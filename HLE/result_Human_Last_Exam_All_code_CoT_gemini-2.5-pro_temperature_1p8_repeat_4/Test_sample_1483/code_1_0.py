# The user wants to know the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
# of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# Let's define the key terms based on the prompt:
# 1. Continuum: A compact, connected metric space.
# 2. Decomposable Continuum: A continuum that is the union of two of its proper subcontinua.
# 3. Regular Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum that equals the closure of its interior.
# 4. Proper Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum that is not the entire space.

# The problem asks for the minimum possible size of the set of these "regular proper subcontinua"
# for any given "nondegenerate decomposable continuum".

# Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
# A theorem in continuum theory states that any decomposable continuum must possess at least two
# regular proper subcontinua. This sets the minimum possible answer to be >= 2.

# Step 2: Show this lower bound can be achieved.
# We need to confirm if a continuum with exactly two regular proper subcontinua exists.
# Such a continuum can be constructed. The construction involves taking two indecomposable
# continua (spaces that cannot be split into two smaller continua) and joining them at
# a single point.
# Let this constructed continuum be X = A U B, where A and B are the two indecomposable
# continua joined at a point.
# - X is decomposable (by its construction).
# - It can be shown that A and B themselves qualify as regular proper subcontinua of X.
# - It can also be shown that due to the properties of indecomposable continua, no other
#   proper subcontinuum of X is regular.
# Therefore, a space with exactly two such subcontinua exists.

# Step 3: Conclude.
# Since the minimum number must be at least 2, and we have an example where the
# number is exactly 2, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.

smallest_possible_cardinality = 2

# The problem asks to print the final number.
print(smallest_possible_cardinality)
