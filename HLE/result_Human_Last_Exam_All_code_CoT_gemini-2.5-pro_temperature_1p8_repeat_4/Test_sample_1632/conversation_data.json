    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in computational combinatorics. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find `a(10)`, which represents the number of self-avoiding walks of 10 steps on a 2D square grid (also known as a Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path on the grid that starts at the origin and never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method**: There is no simple mathematical formula for `a(n)`. The most direct way to solve this for a relatively small number of steps like `n=10` is to computationally enumerate all possible walks. I will use a **recursive backtracking algorithm** for this.\n\n3.  **Develop the Algorithm**:\n    *   A recursive function will explore possible paths step by step.\n    *   The function will keep track of the current position `(x, y)` and the set of all visited points to ensure the walk is self-avoiding.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when the desired number of steps has been taken. When this happens, we have found one valid walk.\n    *   At each step, we explore moves in all four directions (North, South, East, West). If a move leads to a point that hasn't been visited, we take it and continue the recursion. After the recursive call returns, we \"backtrack\" by undoing the move, allowing us to explore other paths.\n\n4.  **Optimization**: The grid has rotational symmetry. The number of walks starting with a move to the East is the same as starting North, West, or South. Therefore, I can calculate the number of walks that begin with one specific move (e.g., East from (0,0) to (1,0)) and multiply that count by 4. This reduces the total computation by a factor of 4.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script that implements this optimized backtracking algorithm to calculate `a(10)` and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number a(n) of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice.\n    \n    The method uses a backtracking algorithm. To optimize, it leverages the\n    symmetry of the lattice: the total number of walks is 4 times the number\n    of walks that start with a specific first step (e.g., to the East).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    # Start at (0,0). The first step is fixed to (1,0) to use symmetry.\n    # The 'visited' set starts with the origin and the first step's destination.\n    visited = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}\n\n    def count_recursive(x, y, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of valid walks from the current position (x, y).\n        'visited' is a closure variable from the parent function's scope.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if no steps are left, we have found one complete valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total = 0\n        \n        # Define the four possible moves from the current position (x,y).\n        moves = [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]\n\n        for next_x, next_y in moves:\n            next_pos = (next_x, next_y)\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # If the next position is valid (not visited), we explore it.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                \n                # Recursively count the walks from this new position.\n                total += count_recursive(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1)\n                \n                # Backtrack: un-mark the position to allow other paths to use it.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return total\n\n    # The recursion starts from (1,0) with n-1 steps remaining.\n    count_from_one_direction = count_recursive(1, 0, n - 1)\n    \n    # The total number of walks is 4 times the count from one direction due to symmetry.\n    return 4 * count_from_one_direction\n\n# Set the number of steps for the walk.\nn_steps = 10\n# Calculate the result using the function.\nresult = solve_saw(n_steps)\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format \"a(n) = result\".\nprint(f\"a({n_steps}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
