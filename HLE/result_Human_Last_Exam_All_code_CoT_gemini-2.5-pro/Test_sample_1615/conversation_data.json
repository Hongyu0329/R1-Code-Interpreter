    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with 12345 vertices, given that the graph is not a complete graph.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Chromatic Number**: The chromatic number of a graph, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n2.  **Relate Chromatic Number to Vertices**: For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n3.  **Consider Complete Graphs**: The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In such a graph, every vertex needs a unique color.\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Constraint**: The problem states that our graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is *not* a complete graph. This means that $\\chi(G)$ must be strictly less than $n$. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is at most $n-1$.\n5.  **Verify the Maximum**: We need to confirm that a chromatic number of $n-1$ is actually achievable for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices. We can construct such a graph. Consider a graph formed by taking a complete subgraph with $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and adding one additional vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph has a total of $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   The $K_{n-1}$ subgraph by itself requires $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the entire graph needs at least $n-1$ colors.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since the chromatic number must be less than or equal to $n-1$, and we have found a case where it is exactly $n-1$, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n7.  **Calculation**: We will calculate this value for $n = 12345$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this simple calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    num_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # For any graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\n    # The equality chi(G) = n holds if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\n    # The problem states that G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be strictly less than n.\n    # The maximum possible value for chi(G) is n - 1.\n    \n    # This maximum is achievable. For example, a graph consisting of a\n    # complete subgraph K_{n-1} and one additional isolated vertex has n vertices,\n    # is not complete, and its chromatic number is n-1.\n    \n    # So, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n    \n    # Print the equation showing the calculation.\n    print(f\"The maximum number of colours is given by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
