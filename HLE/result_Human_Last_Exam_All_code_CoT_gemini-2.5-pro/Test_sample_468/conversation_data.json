    "My plan is to first research the currently accepted common name for the bee genus *Perdita*. Then, I will investigate the origin of this common name to find the year it was first proposed or popularized in a publication. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the name and the year in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.\n    \n    Research indicates the common name \"Fairy bees\" was proposed for the genus Perdita\n    by the entomologist Jerome G.
