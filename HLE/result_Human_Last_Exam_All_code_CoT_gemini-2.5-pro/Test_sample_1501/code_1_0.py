    Solves the user's question about nested Steiner Quadruple Systems.

    The solution is based on the fundamental properties of SQS designs.
    For any SQS of order n, the number of blocks containing any given pair of points
    is exactly (n-2)/2. In this problem, the constructed design is an SQS(2v),
    so n = 2v. The multiplicity of any pair is therefore (2v-2)/2 = v-1.
