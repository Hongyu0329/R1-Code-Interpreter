    # The problem asks for the smallest integer N such that any N-dimensional anisotropic
    # quadratic form over K is surjective. This number is N = u(K) + 1, where u(K)
    # is the u-invariant of the field K. We need to calculate u(K).

    # The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    # with a residue field k which is a local field of characteristic 2.

    # Step 1: Determine the u-invariant of the residue field k.
    # For any local field k (of any characteristic, excluding R and C), the u-invariant is 4.
    u_k = 4

    # K is a complete discretely valued field with residue field k, so K behaves like
    # a Laurent series field k((t)). For fields of characteristic 2, the u-invariant
    # is given by the formula u(K) = 2 * u(k).
    u_K = 2 * u_k

    # The smallest N for which the property holds is u(K) + 1.
    N = u_K + 1
