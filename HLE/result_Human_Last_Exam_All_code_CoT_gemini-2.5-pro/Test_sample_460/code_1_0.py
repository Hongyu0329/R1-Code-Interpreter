def solve():
    """
    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem description.
    
    The logic is based on a worst-case analysis. We determine the maximum possible
    number of agents that can prefer an item outside a candidate set 'O',
    under the conditions that make finding a suitable set difficult. This maximum
    size determines the minimum value for u.
    
    Let m be the number of items and t be the agent threshold.
    The problem can be analyzed by considering an elimination process. If we can always
    find a set O that satisfies condition (1), the maximum number of agents
    preferring an item j not in O over all items in O is bounded by (m-1)*t.
    To guarantee that condition (2) can be met, u must be at least this value.
    
    Parameters:
    m = 4 (number of items)
    t = 20 (agent threshold)
    
    The smallest u is given by the formula: u = (m - 1) * t
