    "To find the state feedback gain `F`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the System**: We are given the state matrix `A` and the input matrix `B`.\n2.  **Determine Desired Characteristics**: The desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system `A + BF` are given as `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. From these eigenvalues, we can determine the desired characteristic polynomial. For a second-order system with eigenvalues `p1` and `p2`, the characteristic polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = s^2 - (p1 + p2)s + p1*p2 = 0`.\n    *   Sum of eigenvalues: `p1 + p2 = (-1 + j) + (-1 - j) = -2`\n    *   Product of eigenvalues: `p1 * p2 = (-1 + j)(-1 - j) = (-1)^2 - (j)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`\n    *   Desired characteristic polynomial: `s^2 - (-2)s + 2 = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n3.  **Formulate Equations**: The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` is also given by `s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl) = 0`. By comparing this with our desired polynomial, we get two conditions:\n    *   `trace(A + BF) = -2`\n    *   `det(A + BF) = 2`\n4.  **Solve for F**: The feedback gain matrix `F` is a 2x2 matrix `[[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`. This gives us four unknowns but only two equations, meaning there are infinite solutions. We can find one solution by simplifying `F`. A common approach is to set the second row of `F` to zero, so `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`. We will then solve the two simultaneous equations for the two unknowns `f1` and `f2`.\n5.  **Implementation**: The plan will be implemented in a Python script using the `numpy` library to perform the matrix operations and solve the system of linear equations. Finally, we will verify the result by calculating the eigenvalues of the resulting `A + BF` matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system so that\n    A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1], [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 0]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define desired eigenvalues and find the characteristic polynomial coefficients\n    # Desired eigenvalues are -1 + j and -1 - j.\n    # Desired characteristic polynomial is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0.\n    # This means the trace of the closed-loop matrix (A+BF) must be -2,\n    # and its determinant must be 2.\n    desired_trace = -2\n    desired_det = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Formulate equations for the elements of F.\n    # Let F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]].\n    # To find a unique solution, we can simplify F by setting some elements to zero.\n    # Let's assume F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]].\n    #\n    # The closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B*F becomes:\n    # A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]\n    #      = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]\n    #      = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]\n    #\n    # Now, we use the trace and determinant conditions:\n    # trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1) + f2 = f1 + f2 - 1\n    # det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1)*f2 - (1 + f2)*(1 + f1)\n    #\n    # This gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    # 1) f1 + f2 - 1 = desired_trace  =>  f1 + f2 = -1\n    # 2) (-1 + f1)*f2 - (1 + f2)*(1 + f1) = desired_det\n    #    -f2 + f1*f2 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2) = 2\n    #    -f2 + f1*f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 = 2\n    #    -f1 - 2*f2 - 1 = 2          => -f1 - 2*f2 = 3\n\n    # We solve the system:\n    #  1*f1 +  1*f2 = -1\n    # -1*f1 + -2*f2 =  3\n    \n    # In matrix form M * x = v, where x = [f1, f2]\n    M = np.array([[1, 1], [-1, -2]])\n    v = np.array([-1, 3])\n\n    # Step 4: Solve for f1 and f2\n    try:\n        f1_f2 = np.linalg.solve(M, v)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"The system of equations could not be solved.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the full F matrix with f3=0, f4=0\n    F = np.zeros((2, 2))\n    F[0, :] = f1_f2\n    \n    # Calculate the resulting closed-loop system for verification\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results and verification\n    print(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\n    print(F)\n    print(\"\\nTo verify the solution, we form the equation A + B*F = A_closed_loop:\")\n    \n    # Format the matrices into strings for clear output\n    A_str = np.array2string(A, precision=2, separator=', ')\n    B_str = np.array2string(B, precision=2, separator=', ')\n    F_str = np.array2string(F, precision=2, separator=', ')\n    A_cl_str = np.array2string(A_cl, precision=2, separator=', ')\n    \n    print(f\"{A_str}\\n+ {B_str} * {F_str}\\n= {A_cl_str}\")\n\n    # Final verification by calculating eigenvalues\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    print(\"\\nThe eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A + BF are:\")\n    print(eigenvalues)\n\nsolve_pole_placement()\n```\n<<<[[ 1. -2.]\n [ 0.  0.]]>>>"
