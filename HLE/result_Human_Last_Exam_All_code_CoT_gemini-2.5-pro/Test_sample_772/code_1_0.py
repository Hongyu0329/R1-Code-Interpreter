    """
    Calculates the exponent alpha for the growth of subsets in SO(3).

    The problem asks for the exponent alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha, where n(N)
    is the smallest integer n such that X^n = G for any compact set X in G = SO(3)
    with Haar measure mu(X) = 1/N.

    The solution relies on a key result from the theory of growth in compact Lie groups,
    which states that the slowest growth (and thus the largest n) occurs for sets X
    that are concentrated around a maximal proper subgroup of G.

    The exponent alpha is given by the formula:
    alpha = 1 / (d - d')
    where:
    d = dimension of the group G
    d' = maximal dimension of a proper subgroup of G
