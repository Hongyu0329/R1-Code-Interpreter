# Step 1: Define the constants based on the problem derivation.
# The expression simplifies to C^2 + N, where C comes from the scalar
# multiplier z_1024 and N is the large constant given in the problem.
C = 1025
N = 10**15

# Step 2: Calculate the components of the final simplified equation.
# From the derivation, the term 2 * ||alpha||^2 / (pi^2/6 - 1) simplifies to C^2.
C_squared = C**2

# Step 3: Calculate the final result by adding the two components.
final_result = C_squared + N

# Step 4: Print the components of the final equation and the result.
# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.
