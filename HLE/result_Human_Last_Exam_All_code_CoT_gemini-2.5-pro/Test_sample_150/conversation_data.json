    "The provided Java program is incorrect.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the original Java code:** The code checks for `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`. This logic fails to account for the post-increment (`X++`) and post-decrement (`X--`) operations, which are also valid statements according to the problem description. Therefore, the program will produce the wrong result if the input contains these post-fix statements.\n2.  **Design a correct and efficient C program:** A more robust and efficient solution would be to read each statement and check the character at the middle position (index 1). If the character is `'+'`, we increment our counter. If it is `'-'`, we decrement it. This approach correctly handles all four possible statement formats (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) with a single character comparison per statement, making it very fast.\n3.  **Calculate efficiency metrics:**\n    *   **x (Character Comparisons):** For 100 instructions, this efficient C code will perform exactly one character comparison (`s[1] == '+'`) inside the loop for each instruction. Thus, the total number of comparisons is 100. This is the minimum possible, as we must inspect at least one character to determine the operation.\n    *   **y (Memory Size):** The C program requires variables to store the number of statements (`n`, an `int`), the result (`x`, an `int`), a loop counter (`i`, an `int`), and a character buffer to read the statement (`s`, an array of 4 chars to hold \"X++\\0\"). On a typical system, this amounts to 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 bytes. This is the minimal memory required for the necessary variables.\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Since the original program is incorrect, the answer will start with 'N'. The final format is `Nx+y`, which translates to `N100+16`.\n\nHere is the corrected and efficient C code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/*\n * This program solves the Bit++ problem efficiently.\n * It reads the number of statements, then iterates through them.\n * For each statement, it checks the middle character to determine\n * whether to increment or decrement the result variable 'x'.\n * This correctly handles all cases: \"++X\", \"X++\", \"--X\", and \"X--\".\n */\nint main() {\n    // Variable to store the number of statements\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Initialize the result variable 'x' to 0\n    int x = 0;\n\n    // Buffer to store the input statement string.\n    // Size 4 is sufficient for \"++X\" and the null terminator.\n    char statement[4];\n\n    // Loop through all the statements\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n        // The operation is determined by the character at index 1.\n        // If it's a '+', we increment.\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            // Otherwise, it must be a '-', so we decrement.\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+16>>>"
