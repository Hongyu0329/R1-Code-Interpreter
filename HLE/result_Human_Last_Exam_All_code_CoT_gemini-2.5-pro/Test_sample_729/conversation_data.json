    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: First, we need to understand the structure of the generalized quaternion group of size 128. This group, denoted as `Q_128`, is defined by a specific presentation. Its order is `128 = 2^7`. It contains a cyclic subgroup `<x>` of order 64.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**: A power subgroup `H` of a group `G` is a subgroup that can be formed by taking the `k`-th power of every element in `G`, for some integer `k`. That is, `H = G^k = {g^k | g âˆˆ G}`.\n3.  **Analyze by Case**: We will analyze the structure of the set `G^k` based on whether the integer `k` is odd or even.\n    *   **Case 1: `k` is odd.** We'll determine what subgroup `G^k` corresponds to when `k` is any odd number. We will find that this always results in the same single subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: `k` is even.** We'll determine the structure of `G^k` when `k` is an even number. These subgroups will be related to the divisors of the order of the cyclic subgroup `<x>`.\n4.  **Count the Subgroups**: We will count the number of unique subgroups found in each case and sum them up to get the total number of power subgroups. The Python code will perform this calculation and print the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quaternion_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \n    A power subgroup H of a group G is a subgroup of the form H = {g^k | g in G} for some integer k.\n    The generalized quaternion group of order 128, Q_128, has the presentation:\n    <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The order of the cyclic subgroup <x> is 64.\n    x_order = 64\n    \n    # We analyze the power subgroups G^k based on whether k is odd or even.\n    \n    # Case 1: k is an odd integer.\n    # For any odd k, the set of k-th powers G^k = {g^k | g in Q_128} is the entire group Q_128.\n    # This is because the k-th power map is a bijection on both the cyclic subgroup <x> and its coset <x>y.\n    # This gives one unique power subgroup: the group Q_128 itself.\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n    \n    # Case 2: k is an even integer.\n    # For any even k, the set of k-th powers G^k results in a cyclic subgroup of <x>.\n    # Specifically, G^k = <x^d>, where d = gcd(k, 64).\n    # Since k is even, d must also be an even divisor of 64.\n    # We need to count the number of even divisors of 64.\n    \n    divisors_of_64 = []\n    for i in range(1, x_order + 1):\n        if x_order % i == 0:\n            divisors_of_64.append(i)\n            \n    even_divisors_of_64 = []\n    for d in divisors_of_64:\n        if d % 2 == 0:\n            even_divisors_of_64.append(d)\n            \n    num_from_even_k = len(even_divisors_of_64)\n    \n    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum from the two cases.\n    # The subgroup from odd k (Q_128) is distinct from the proper subgroups generated by even k.\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n    \n    print(\"Finding the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128):\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
