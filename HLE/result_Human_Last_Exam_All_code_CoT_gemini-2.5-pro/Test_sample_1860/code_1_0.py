    # f(x) must be negative for an intersection. f(x) is negative on (2, 4] and (6, 8].
    # We check the overlapping intervals:
    # - Interval (3, 4]: f(x) = -sqrt(1 - (x-3)^2). Solving f(x) = -1/2 gives x = 3 + sqrt(3)/2. This is one root.
    # - Interval (7, 8]: f(x) = -sqrt(1 - (x-7)^2). Solving f(x) = -1/2 gives x = 7 + sqrt(3)/2. This is one root.

    # We need 6 roots from the sloped parts of g(x).
    # These intersections can only occur where f(x) is positive and g(x) is the sloped line.
    # The relevant intervals in (0, 9] are (0, 1], (4, 5], and (8, 9].
    # There are 3 such intervals. To get 6 roots, we need exactly 2 roots in each.
    
    # Step 3: Find the condition on k for 2 roots in one such interval, e.g., (0, 1].
    # In (0, 1], f(x) = sqrt(1 - (x-1)^2) and g(x) = k*(x+2).
    # f(1) = 1, g(1) = 3*k.
    # For 2 intersections, the line g(x) must start above f(x) at x=0, and also end above f(x) at x=1.
    # The condition g(1) > f(1) gives 3*k > 1, so k > 1/3.
    
    # The line must also not be too high, i.e., it must be below the tangent line.
    # The tangency condition for the line y=k(x+2) and the circle (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1 is found
    # by setting the distance from the center (1,0) to the line equal to the radius 1.
    # distance = |k*1 - 0 + 2*k| / sqrt(k^2 + 1) = 1 => |3k| = sqrt(k^2+1)
    # 9k^2 = k^2 + 1 => 8k^2 = 1 => k = 1/sqrt(8) = sqrt(2)/4.
    # For 2 intersections, k must be less than this value. So, k < sqrt(2)/4.
    
    # The analysis for the other two intervals (4, 5] and (8, 9] is identical and gives the same range for k.
    
    # Step 4: Combine the conditions to find the final range for k.
