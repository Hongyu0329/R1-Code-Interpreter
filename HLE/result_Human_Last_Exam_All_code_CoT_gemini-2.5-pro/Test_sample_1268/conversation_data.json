    "Of course, I can help with that. The question you're asking is about a fundamental result in the geometry of numbers, specifically Minkowski's first theorem, applied to the $L_\\infty$ norm (also known as the maximum norm). Here's a plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question:** We need to find the relationship between the \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$ and the \"covolume\" $(V)$ for a lattice. The mention of \"squarefree natural numbers (N)\" points us to the context of number theory, specifically lattices derived from the ring of integers of quadratic number fields, as their discriminants are related to squarefree integers.\n2.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem:** Minkowski's first theorem for convex bodies provides a bound on the length of the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice. We will apply this theorem to a hypercube, which is the convex body corresponding to the $L_\\infty$ norm.\n3.  **The General Formula:** This application yields a general inequality: $k_{k,\\infty} \\le V^{1/k}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the lattice. Here, $k_{k,\\infty}$ represents the $L_\\infty$ norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice.\n4.  **Develop Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that demonstrates this principle. The script will focus on imaginary quadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$ (where N is a squarefree natural number), which provide a clear and important example. For these fields, the dimension `k` is 2. The code will calculate the covolume `V` for a given `N` and then compute the upper bound $V^{1/2}$, printing the final relation with all the numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and demonstrate the relationship.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_squarefree(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a positive integer is squarefree.\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        return False\n    i = 2\n    # Check for prime factors whose square divides n\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % (i * i) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n    return True\n\ndef calculate_minkowski_bound(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the upper bound for the maximum norm (L-infinity norm) of the \n    shortest vector in the integer lattice of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(-N)).\n    \n    Args:\n        N (int): A squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not is_squarefree(N):\n        print(f\"Error: The number N={N} is not squarefree.
