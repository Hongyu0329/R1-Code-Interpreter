    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify possible torsion group structures:** The torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of cyclic groups, $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\dots$. For elliptic curves, this structure is at most the product of two cyclic groups, i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n$ divides $m$.\n2.  **Condition for non-cyclic:** A group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n > 1$.\n3.  **Use classification theorems:** We rely on the complete classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, established by the work of Kenku, Momose, and Kamienny. We list all possible non-cyclic torsion structures that can occur over any quadratic field.\n4.  **Filter for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** We then narrow down this list to those structures that are known to occur specifically over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special as it contains the 6th roots of unity, which allows for larger and more complex torsion structures compared to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n5.  **List the possibilities for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** The non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n6.  **Calculate orders and find the maximum:** We will write a Python script to calculate the order (which is the product of the orders of the cyclic components) for each of these possible group structures and identify the maximum value.\n\nThe following Python code implements the final step of this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of possible non-cyclic torsion group structures over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # Each tuple (n1, n2) represents the group Z/n1Z x Z/n2Z.\n    # These are derived from the classification theorems for quadratic fields.\n    possible_groups = [\n        # Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N=1,2,3,4\n        (2, 2),  # N=1\n        (2, 4),  # N=2\n        (2, 6),  # N=3\n        (2, 8),  # N=4\n        # Z/3Z x Z/3NZ for N=1,2\n        (3, 3),  # N=1\n        (3, 6),  # N=2\n        # Z/6Z x Z/6Z\n        (6, 6)\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    max_group_str = \"\"\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the orders of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\\n\")\n\n    for n1, n2 in possible_groups:\n        order = n1 * n2\n        group_str = f\"Z/{n1}Z x Z/{n2}Z\"\n        # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n        # as showing the calculation for each possible group.\n        print(f\"Group {group_str} has order {n1} * {n2} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            max_group_str = f\"{n1} * {n2} = {max_order}\"\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest order is given by the final equation: {max_group_str}\")\n    print(f\"So, the largest order is {max_order}.\")\n\nfind_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
