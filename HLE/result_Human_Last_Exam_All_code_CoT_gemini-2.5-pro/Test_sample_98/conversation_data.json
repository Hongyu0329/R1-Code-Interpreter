    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the geometric shape of the cross-section of an icosahedron when it's sliced exactly in half horizontally while standing on one of its faces.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Setup**: The icosahedron tank is standing on one of its triangular faces, making that face the horizontal base. The tank is half-filled, which means due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the water surface will be a horizontal plane passing through its geometric center.\n2.  **Examine the Icosahedron's Structure**: I'll analyze the arrangement of the icosahedron's 12 vertices when it's in this orientation. They form distinct horizontal layers.\n3.  **Identify the Slicing Plane's Intersection**: The central horizontal plane will cut through the icosahedron's edges that cross this midway point. The number of edges it cuts will determine the number of vertices of the resulting shape.\n4.  **Deduce the Shape**: By counting the intersected edges and considering the icosahedron's high degree of symmetry, I can determine the precise shape of the water's surface.\n5.  **Code the Explanation**: I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning, explaining step-by-step how the conclusion is reached and printing the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_water_surface_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the shape of the water surface in a half-filled\n    icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces by analyzing its geometry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
