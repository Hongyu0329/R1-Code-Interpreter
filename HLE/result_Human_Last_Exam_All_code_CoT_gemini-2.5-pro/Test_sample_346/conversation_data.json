    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this complex SKI combinator problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** The given SKI expression is long and nested. The first step is to break it down into its main structural components. I will analyze the expression from the outside in.\n2.  **Analyze the Outer Structure:** The expression is wrapped three times by `S(I)`. I will determine the function of the `S(I)` combinator when applied to a Church numeral. This will tell us how many times the function `f` is applied due to this outer wrapping.\n3.  **Analyze the Inner Structure:** The inner part of the expression is `K(A)(B)`. I will use the reduction rule for the `K` combinator to simplify this part. This will reveal which parts of the expression are relevant and which are not.\n4.  **Evaluate the Core Numeral:** After simplification, the core of the expression is another combinator expression, which I've labeled `A`. I will analyze `A` to determine which integer it represents as a Church numeral. This involves recognizing the \"successor\" combinator pattern.\n5.  **Calculate `n`:** By combining the number of function applications from the outer structure and the value of the inner numeral `A`, I will calculate the final integer `n`.\n6.  **Compute the Final Answer:** Once `n` is known, the final step is a simple calculation of `log_2(n)`.\n\nThe Python code below will follow these steps, explaining each part of the derivation in the comments and printing the numbers used in the final calculation of `n`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by a complex\n    SKI combinator expression.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The SKI expression E is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))(B)))\n    # where A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)\n    # and   B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))\n    #\n    # A Church numeral 'n' is a function that applies another function 'f' to a\n    # value 'x', 'n' times. We can write this as: n(f)(x) = f^n(x).\n    # Our goal is to find the value of 'n' for the expression E.\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the outer structure of E.\n    # The expression is wrapped by S(I) three times.\n    # Let's analyze the S(I) combinator. By definition, S(x)(y)(z) = x(z)(y(z)).\n    # Let's apply S(I) to some expression X, a function f, and a value x.\n    # S(I)(X)(f)(x) is parsed as (((S(I))(X))(f))(x).\n    #\n    #   (S(I))(X) -> reduces to a new function, let's call it F.\n    #   F(f) = S(I)(X)(f) = I(f)(X(f)) = f(X(f)).\n    #\n    # This means wrapping an expression X with S(I) adds one outer application of 'f'.\n    # Since E has three S(I) wrappers, this contributes 3 to the total count of 'f' applications.\n    # E(f)(x) = f(f(f( G(f)(x) ))) where G = K(A)(B).\n\n    num_outer_applications = 3\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the inner expression G = K(A)(B).\n    # By definition, the K combinator K(x)(y) always reduces to x, discarding y.\n    # Therefore, K(A)(B) reduces to A.\n    # The complex expression B is a \"red herring\" and its value does not matter.\n    # Now our main expression simplifies: E(f)(x) = f(f(f( A(f)(x) ))).\n    # The total value 'n' is 3 plus the integer value represented by A.\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the integer value of A.\n    # A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I). This expression has the form of a successor function\n    # being applied to a numeral.\n    #\n    # The successor function SUCC takes a numeral n and returns n+1.\n    # A common form is SUCC = S(B), where B is the composition combinator.\n    # The expression here uses a different but related combinator, B* = S(K(S))(K),\n    # which performs reverse composition: B*(f)(g)(x) = g(f(x)).\n    #\n    # Let's define a successor function SUCC' = S(B*).
