    Solves for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by a complex

    # The SKI expression E is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))(B)))
    # where A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)
    # and   B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))
    #
    # A Church numeral 'n' is a function that applies another function 'f' to a
    # value 'x', 'n' times. We can write this as: n(f)(x) = f^n(x).
    # Our goal is to find the value of 'n' for the expression E.

    # Step 1: Analyze the outer structure of E.
    # The expression is wrapped by S(I) three times.
    # Let's analyze the S(I) combinator. By definition, S(x)(y)(z) = x(z)(y(z)).
    # Let's apply S(I) to some expression X, a function f, and a value x.
    # S(I)(X)(f)(x) is parsed as (((S(I))(X))(f))(x).
    #
    #   (S(I))(X) -> reduces to a new function, let's call it F.
    #   F(f) = S(I)(X)(f) = I(f)(X(f)) = f(X(f)).
    #
    # This means wrapping an expression X with S(I) adds one outer application of 'f'.
    # Since E has three S(I) wrappers, this contributes 3 to the total count of 'f' applications.
    # E(f)(x) = f(f(f( G(f)(x) ))) where G = K(A)(B).

    num_outer_applications = 3

    # Step 2: Analyze the inner expression G = K(A)(B).
    # By definition, the K combinator K(x)(y) always reduces to x, discarding y.
    # Therefore, K(A)(B) reduces to A.
    # The complex expression B is a "red herring" and its value does not matter.
    # Now our main expression simplifies: E(f)(x) = f(f(f( A(f)(x) ))).
    # The total value 'n' is 3 plus the integer value represented by A.

    # Step 3: Determine the integer value of A.
    # A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I). This expression has the form of a successor function
    # being applied to a numeral.
    #
    # The successor function SUCC takes a numeral n and returns n+1.
    # A common form is SUCC = S(B), where B is the composition combinator.
    # The expression here uses a different but related combinator, B* = S(K(S))(K),
    # which performs reverse composition: B*(f)(g)(x) = g(f(x)).
    #
    # Let's define a successor function SUCC' = S(B*). When applied to a numeral n,
    # SUCC'(n)(f)(x) = S(B*)(n)(f)(x) = B*(f)(n(f))(x) = (n(f))(f(x)).
    #
    # Now let's apply this SUCC' to the numeral I.
    # The I combinator is the Church numeral for 1, since I(f)(x) = f(x) = f^1(x).
    #
    # A(f)(x) = SUCC'(I)(f)(x) = (I(f))(f(x)) = f(f(x)) = f^2(x).
    # This shows that A represents the Church numeral for 2.

    value_of_A = 2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final integer n.
    # n is the total number of applications of f.
    # n = (applications from outer wrappers) + (applications from A)
    n = num_outer_applications + value_of_A
    print("The SKI expression represents a Church integer n.")
    print(f"The number of outer S(I) wrappers implies {num_outer_applications} applications of the function 'f'.")
    print(f"The inner expression 'A' resolves to the Church numeral for {value_of_A}.")
    print(f"The final equation for n is: {num_outer_applications} + {value_of_A} = {n}")
    print(f"Therefore, the expression is the Church integer n = {n}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 5: Calculate log_2(n).
    result = math.log2(n)
    print(f"The question asks for log_2(n), which is log_2({n}).")
