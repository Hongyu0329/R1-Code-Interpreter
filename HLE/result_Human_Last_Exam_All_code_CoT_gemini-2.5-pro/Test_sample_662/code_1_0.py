# --- Given Information ---
# Basic reproduction number
R0 = 3.0
# Percentage of vaccinated people who still get the infection
breakthrough_rate = 0.06

# --- Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) ---
# If 6% of vaccinated people can still get infected and become infectious,
# the vaccine is effective in the remaining cases.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - breakthrough_rate

# --- Step 2: Calculate Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) ---
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be immune.
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# --- Step 3: Calculate Critical Vaccination Coverage (Vc) ---
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated,
# accounting for vaccine effectiveness.
critical_vaccination_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_effectiveness

# --- Output the results ---
