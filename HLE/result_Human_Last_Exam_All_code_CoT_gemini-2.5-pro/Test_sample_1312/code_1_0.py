    explanation = """
    The question asks for an intrinsic genome feature that compensates for the genetic deterioration caused by limited recombination.

    1.  Limited recombination leads to the accumulation of harmful mutations, a process known as Muller's Ratchet. Without recombination, these mutations cannot be purged from the population effectively.

    2.  A compensatory mechanism would need to counteract this accumulation.

    3.  Multigene families, which are clusters of similar genes that arose from duplication, provide functional redundancy. If one copy of a gene acquires a deleterious mutation, other functional copies in the family can still perform the necessary role.

    4.  This redundancy acts as a buffer against the permanent loss of function, directly compensating for the inability to remove mutations via recombination. This has been proposed as a key survival strategy for ancient asexual lineages and for maintaining genes on degenerating Y chromosomes.

    5.  Other options are less suitable:
        - Chromosomal inversions suppress recombination.
        - Tandem repeats and transposable elements are often sources of mutation, not stable compensatory mechanisms.
        - Polyploidy provides redundancy but multigene families are a more specific architectural feature addressing this problem.

    Therefore, multigene families are the correct answer.
