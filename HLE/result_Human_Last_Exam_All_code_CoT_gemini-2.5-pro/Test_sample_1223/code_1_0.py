def solve_composant_problem():
    """
    Solves the topological problem about the number of composants.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the
    Stone-Cech remainder of X \ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable
    metric continuum.

    The solution relies on two key results from topology:

    1.  A theorem by D. P. Bellamy (1971): For any indecomposable metric
        continuum M and any point p in M, the Stone-Cech remainder,
        beta(M \ {p}) \ (M \ {p}), is an indecomposable continuum.
        Since X is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, it is also an
        indecomposable continuum. Thus, the remainder in question is an
        indecomposable continuum.

    2.  A standard property of indecomposable continua: Any indecomposable
        continuum has exactly 'c' composants, where 'c' is the cardinality
        of the continuum (c = 2^aleph_0).

    Conclusion:
    Since the remainder is always an indecomposable continuum, it always has 'c'
    composants. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is 'c'.

    # The number 'c' is a transfinite number and cannot be represented as a
