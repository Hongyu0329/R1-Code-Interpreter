    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Interpret the Goal:** The request is to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for an 8-point sequence. This 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n2.  **Define the Operation:** A `K`-point DFT of an `N`-point sequence (`K != N`) is not standard. The most direct mathematical interpretation is to use the `K`-point DFT basis functions `W_K` in the summation over the `N` points of the sequence. So, the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)` is given by:\n    `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_4^{nk}` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`, where `W_N = exp(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n\n3.  **Relate to a Standard DFT:** This operation can be related to the standard 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n    `Y_8(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^{nk}`.\n    Notice that `W_4^{nk} = (exp(-j*2*pi/4))^{nk} = (exp(-j*2*pi/8))^{2nk} = W_8^{2nk}`.\n    Therefore, `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)`. The problem reduces to finding the even-indexed components of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Interleaving Property (Decimation-in-Time):** A standard property of the DFT states that the DFT of a sequence formed by interleaving two sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` can be found from their individual DFTs. The 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` is related to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` by:\n    `Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:** By combining the insights from steps 3 and 4, we can derive a direct formula for the desired `Y_4(k)`:\n    `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_8^{2k} * H(2k mod 4)`.\n    Since `W_8^{2k} = W_4^k`, the formula simplifies to:\n    `Y_4(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to compute `Y_4(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3` using the derived formula and the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` values. The script will print the calculation for each `k` and then the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence formed by interleaving\n    two 4-point sequences, given their respective 4-point DFTs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the 4-point DFT (let's call it Y4) of an 8-point sequence.\")\n    print(\"The 8-point sequence is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences x(n) and h(n).\")\n    print(\"We are given the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe derived formula is: Y4(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4) for k=0,1,2,3\\n\")\n\n    # Array to store the results\n    Y4 = np.zeros(4, dtype=complex)\n\n    # Loop through k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    for k in range(4):\n        # Twiddle factor W_4^k\n        W4_k = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / 4)\n        \n        # Index for X and H is (2*k) mod 4 because they are 4-periodic\n        idx = (2 * k) % 4\n        \n        X_val = X[idx]\n        H_val = H[idx]\n        \n        # Calculate the result for the current k\n        Y4[k] = X_val + W4_k * H_val\n        \n        # Format numbers for clean printing\n        # Using round to avoid floating point artifacts like 1-0j\n        x_str = f\"({np.round(X_val, 4)})\"\n        h_str = f\"({np.round(H_val, 4)})\"\n        w_str = f\"({np.round(W4_k, 4)})\"\n        res_str = f\"({np.round(Y4[k], 4)})\"\n        \n        # Print the detailed calculation for the current step\n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y4({k}) = X({idx}) + W_4^{k} * H({idx})\")\n        print(f\"      = {x_str} + {w_str} * {h_str}\")\n        print(f\"      = {res_str}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final result for the 4-point DFT is:\")\n    print(np.round(Y4, 4))\n\nsolve_dft()\n<<<[ 1.+0.j -1.-1.j  1.+0.j -1.+1.j]>>>\n```"
