To prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the boundary value problem
    u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x in (0, 1)
    u(0) = u(1) = 0
using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, we first define a suitable complete metric space M where a corresponding operator is a contraction.

The problem is converted into an equivalent integral equation u(x) = (Tu)(x), where the operator T is defined using the Green's function for u'' with zero boundary conditions. The space for our solution is the Banach space of continuous functions on [0, 1] that are zero at the boundaries, equipped with the supremum norm ||u||_∞. Let's call this space X:
X = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0}

The set M is defined as a closed ball within X with a specific radius R > 0. This ensures M is a complete metric space:

M = {u ∈ X | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}
  = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0, and max_{x∈[0,1]}|u(x)| ≤ R}

To apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, the radius R must be chosen to satisfy two conditions which ensure the operator T is a contraction that maps M to itself:

1.  The condition that T maps M to itself (T(M) ⊆ M) leads to the inequality:
    exp(R) <= 8 * R

2.  The condition that T is a contraction on M (i.e., its Lipschitz constant is less than 1) leads to the inequality:
    exp(R) < 8

Therefore, the set M is defined as the closed ball of radius R shown above, where R is any constant that satisfies both inequalities. For example, choosing R = 2 satisfies both conditions, since exp(2) ≈ 7.39 < 8 and exp(2) ≈ 7.39 is less than or equal to 8 * 2 = 16.
