# --- Step 1: Define initial assumptions ---

# The number of logical T-gates for a representative large-scale quantum algorithm.
# This is an assumption as the specific algorithm was not provided.
logical_t_gates_per_scenario = 1e8

# The faulty physical gate error rate provided by the user.
physical_error_rate = 0.01

# --- Step 2: Calculate the overhead for a single fault-tolerant T-gate ---

# We use the 15-to-1 magic state distillation protocol.
# The error rate after one round is ~35 * p^3.
error_after_1_round = 35 * (physical_error_rate**3)

# The error rate after a second round is ~35 * (error_after_1_round)^3.
error_after_2_rounds = 35 * (error_after_1_round**3)

# Two rounds of distillation are sufficient to achieve a very high fidelity magic state,
# so we will use R=2 rounds.
distillation_rounds = 2

# The overhead is the number of initial states needed, which is 15^R for the 15-to-1 protocol.
overhead_per_t_gate = 15**distillation_rounds

# --- Step 3: Calculate the total gates for each scenario ---

# For the d=3 simulation scenario
gates_for_d3_scenario = logical_t_gates_per_scenario * overhead_per_t_gate

# For the d=5 implementation scenario
# The T-gate preparation overhead is the same.
gates_for_d5_scenario = logical_t_gates_per_scenario * overhead_per_t_gate

# --- Step 4: Calculate the total and print the result ---
