    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables, $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This means there exists an invertible matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ with entries in $R$ such that $Q_2(x,y) = Q_1(px+qy, rx+sy)$. A matrix is invertible over $R$ if its determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\nThe strategy is to use a computational approach to partition the set of all possible quadratic forms into equivalence classes (orbits) under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations, $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, we identify all possible quadratic forms. A form is uniquely determined by the triple of coefficients $(a, b, c)$, where each can be any of the 8 elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. This gives a total of $8^3 = 512$ forms.\n2.  Next, we generate the group of transformations, $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$, by finding all $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is one of the units $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  The core of the algorithm is to iterate through all 512 forms. We maintain a set of forms that have already been assigned to a class.\n4.  For each form not yet classified, we identify it as a representative of a new equivalence class.\n5.  We then compute the entire orbit of this representative form by applying every transformation matrix in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ to it. The set of all resulting forms is the equivalence class.\n6.  We record the size of this orbit and add all its members to our set of classified forms.\n7.  This process is repeated until all 512 forms have been classified. The number of equivalence classes is simply the count of the representatives we found.\n8.  The final code will print the sum of the sizes of all orbits, which should equal the total number of forms (512), and then provide the total number of classes.\n\nThis method provides a definitive and verifiable count of the equivalence classes.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring R=Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8\n\n    # Generate the group of invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z\n    gl2_z8 = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p in range(R):\n        for q in range(R):\n            for r in range(R):\n                for s in range(R):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % R\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_z8.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Transformation function for a quadratic form (a,b,c) by a matrix T\n    def transform(form, T):\n        a, b, c = form\n        p, q = T[0]\n        r, s = T[1]\n\n        a_prime = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % R\n        b_prime = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % R\n        c_prime = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % R\n        return (a_prime, b_prime, c_prime)\n\n    # Generate all possible forms\n    all_forms = []\n    for a in range(R):\n        for b in range(R):\n            for c in range(R):\n                all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    classified_forms = set()\n    representatives = []\n    orbit_sizes = []\n\n    # Partition the set of all forms into equivalence classes (orbits)\n    for form in all_forms:\n        if form in classified_forms:\n            continue\n\n        representatives.append(form)\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of the current form\n        orbit = set()\n        for T in gl2_z8:\n            new_form = transform(form, T)\n            orbit.add(new_form)\n        \n        orbit_sizes.append(len(orbit))\n        classified_forms.update(orbit)\n\n    # Output the results\n    # The \"equation\" is the sum of the sizes of the orbits\n    orbit_sizes.sort()\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, orbit_sizes))\n    total_forms = sum(orbit_sizes)\n    \n    print(f\"The set of 512 quadratic forms is partitioned into {len(representatives)} equivalence classes.\")\n    print(\"The sizes of these classes (orbits) are:\")\n    print(\", \".join(map(str, orbit_sizes)))\n    print(\"\\nThe sum of the orbit sizes gives the total number of forms:\")\n    print(f\"{equation} = {total_forms}\")\n    print(\"\\nThus, the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms is:\")\n    print(len(representatives))\n\nsolve()\n<<<22>>>\n```"
