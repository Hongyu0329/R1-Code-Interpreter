    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group ($G$), we can count the number of ways the group can act transitively on a set of 4 elements. This is equivalent to counting homomorphisms from $G$ to the symmetric group $S_4$ with a transitive image.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify Transitive Subgroups of S4**: The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are, up to isomorphism, the cyclic group $C_4$, the Klein four-group $V_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the alternating group $A_4$, and the symmetric group $S_4$ itself.\n2.  **Use Properties of the Grigorchuk Group**: The Grigorchuk group $G$ is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. A key property is that any finite quotient of $G$ must also be a 2-group. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $S_4$ (order 24) as possible homomorphic images.\n3.  **Eliminate C4**: We can show that there are no surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $C_4$. The abelianization of $G$ is $G_{ab} = G/[G,G] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $C_4$ must factor through $G_{ab}$. However, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ cannot map surjectively onto $C_4$, as all its quotients have exponent 2. Thus, there are no subgroups of index 4 with quotient $C_4$.\n4.  **Count Subgroups corresponding to V4**: We count the number of subgroups whose corresponding action has an image isomorphic to $V_4$. Since $V_4$ is abelian, this is equivalent to counting surjective homomorphisms from $G_{ab}$ to $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. The number of such subgroups is given by the formula $|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)| / |\\text{Aut}(V_4)|$.\n5.  **Count Subgroups corresponding to D4**: We count the number of subgroups whose corresponding action has an image isomorphic to $D_4$. This involves counting surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $D_4$. We use the known property that for any finite 2-group $P$, $|\\text{Hom}(G, P)| = |\\text{Hom}(C_2 * (C_2 \\times C_2), P)|$. We first calculate the total number of homomorphisms and then subtract the non-surjective ones. The number of such subgroups is given by $|\\text{Epi}(G, D_4)| / |\\text{Aut}(D_4)|$.\n6.  **Sum the results**: The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the counts from the $V_4$ and $D_4$ cases.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    The method is based on counting homomorphisms to transitive subgroups of S4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of subgroups whose quotients are V4 and D4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Part 1: Subgroups with quotient V4 (Klein-4 group)\n    print(\"Part 1: Calculating subgroups whose quotient is the Klein-4 group (V4)\")\n\n    # V4 is abelian, so homomorphisms G -> V4 factor through the abelianization G_ab = (Z/2Z)^3.\n    # We count surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from (Z/2Z)^3 to V4 = (Z/2Z)^2.\n    # The number of homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^m to (Z/2Z)^n is (2^n)^m.\n    # For m=3, n=2, we have (2^2)^3 = 4^3 = 64.\n    total_hom_g_ab_to_v4 = 4**3\n    \n    # Count non-surjective homomorphisms by considering proper subgroups of V4.\n    # V4 has 3 subgroups of order 2 (isomorphic to C2).\n    # 1.
