    This program analyzes the logic puzzle about the dog and provides the correct answer with a step-by-step explanation.
    It identifies the correct logical proposition and demonstrates why it resolves the apparent contradiction.

    # The correct answer is C. The following code will explain why.
    answer = "C"
    
    explanation = """
The correct answer is C. Here is the logical breakdown:

The puzzle presents a contradiction:
- Rule: If the dog detects an intruder (P), it barks (Q). (P → Q)
- Fact 1: The dog did not bark (¬Q).
- Fact 2: The dog detected an intruder (P).
This means the original rule (P → Q) must be incomplete.

Option C introduces a new, more precise rule and condition:
- P: The dog detects an intruder.
- Q: The dog barks.
- R: The dog was asleep.

The logical statement for C is: [(P ∧ ¬R) → Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P), ∴ R

This translates to:
- New Rule: If the dog detects an intruder (P) AND is not asleep (¬R), THEN it barks (Q).
- Known Facts: The dog did not bark (¬Q) AND it detected an intruder (P).
- Conclusion: Therefore, the dog was asleep (R).

This is a logically valid deduction:
1. From the new rule (P ∧ ¬R) → Q, the contrapositive is ¬Q → ¬(P ∧ ¬R).
2. This simplifies to: ¬Q → (¬P ∨ R).
3. We know from the facts that ¬Q is true. So, (¬P ∨ R) must be true.
4. We also know from the facts that P is true, which means ¬P is false.
5. For the expression (¬P ∨ R) to be true while ¬P is false, R must be true.
6. The conclusion that the dog was asleep (R) is logically proven.

This explanation fits all the evidence. The dog (which is blind and deaf) detected the intruder by smell while it was asleep. Because it was asleep, the condition for barking was not met, and thus it did not bark.
