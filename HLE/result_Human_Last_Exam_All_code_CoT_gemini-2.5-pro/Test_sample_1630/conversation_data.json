    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Re-frame the problem**: The number of fixed points for the function $f(g(x))$ is the number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n2.  **Determine the nature of the equation**: I will analyze the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 3, their composition, $h(x)$, will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. Therefore, the fixed-point equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n3.  **Establish the theoretical maximum**: According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n4.  **Investigate achievability**: The main challenge is to determine if this maximum of 9 is achievable under the given constraints that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions (i.e., $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$).\n5.  **Use calculus to argue for achievability**: For the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots. This derivative is $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$. I will analyze the degree of this derivative and argue that it is possible to construct $f$ and $g$ such that $P'(x)=0$ has 8 roots and the corresponding values of $P(x)$ lead to 9 roots for $P(x)=0$.\n6.  **Provide Python code**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to symbolically represent the polynomials and their derivatives. This code will not find a specific numerical solution but will demonstrate the logic by showing the degrees of the relevant polynomials and printing the argument step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_fixed_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses symbolic mathematics to analyze the problem of finding the maximum\n    number of fixed points for f(g(x)), where f and g are cubic polynomials with\n    positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables for the polynomials\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n    a0, a1, a2, a3 = sympy.symbols('a0:4')\n    b0, b1, b2, b3 = sympy.symbols('b0:4')\n\n    # 1.
