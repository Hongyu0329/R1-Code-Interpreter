# The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.
# For example, m=1 for a 2-torus, m=2 for a K3 surface, m=3 for a Calabi-Yau threefold.
# We will use m=3 for this example.
m = 3

# Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the space of symmetric (2,0)-tensors.
# This is given by the formula N = m * (m + 1) / 2.
num_symmetric_pairs = (m * (m + 1)) / 2

# Step 2: The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor is N^2.
# This is because the tensor defines a Hermitian form on the space from Step 1.
independent_entries = num_symmetric_pairs**2

# Print the explanation and the result, showing each number in the equation.
