The question asks to identify which pair of ballet institutions uses a preparation for pirouettes from fourth position with the arms in an 'allongé' (extended) position and bent knees.

1.  **Paris Opera Ballet School (French School):** The French technique emphasizes elegance and clean lines. It characteristically uses an allongé, or extended, arm position in the preparation for pirouettes from fourth position. This fits the description.

2.  **School of American Ballet (Balanchine Method):** The Balanchine style is known for its speed and dynamics. Its preparation for pirouettes is also distinct, often using open, elongated arms from a deep plié in fourth position. This also fits the description.

3.  **Vaganova Academy and La Scala (Vaganova and Cecchetti methods):** Both the Russian (Vaganova) and Italian (Cecchetti) methods typically prescribe strong, rounded arm positions for this preparation to generate power, not an elongated 'allongé' position.

4.  **The Royal Ballet School (English Style):** This style generally uses a more classical, rounded arm preparation as well.

Therefore, the correct pair is the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
