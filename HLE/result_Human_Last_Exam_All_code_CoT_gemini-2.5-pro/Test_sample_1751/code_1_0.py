    print("1. Saturated hydrocarbon chains are straight and flexible. They can pack together very tightly and orderly, maximizing intermolecular forces.")
    print("2. The double bond in the unsaturated chain of C16-ceramide introduces a rigid point that disrupts this tight packing, leading to a less ordered arrangement.")
    print("3. Tighter packing means each molecule occupies a smaller cross-sectional area.")
