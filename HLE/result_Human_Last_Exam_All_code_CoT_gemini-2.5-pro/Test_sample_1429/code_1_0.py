    # --- Reasoning for Question A ---
    print("--- Question A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable? ---")
    print("1. The definition of a 'boopable' function implies that a program L must work on a machine where the resources (R for registers, A for address space, W for word size) can be arbitrarily large. This effectively provides an unbounded amount of memory.")
    print("2. The machine's instruction set includes:")
    print("   - Arithmetic (ADD)")
    print("   - Universal logic (BITWISENAND can be used to construct NOT, AND, OR, etc.)")
    print("   - Memory access (LOAD/STORE)")
    print("   - Conditional control flow (BRANCHIFZERO)")
    print("3. A machine with these instructions and access to unbounded memory is a form of a Universal Random Access Machine (URAM).")
    print("4. The URAM model is known to be Turing-complete, meaning it can compute any function that a standard Turing machine can.")
    print("5. Therefore, since any 'boopable' function is computable by this Turing-complete model, it must also be Turing-computable.")
    print("\nConclusion for A: Yes\n")

    # --- Reasoning for Question B ---
    print("--- Question B: Does a program L exist for f(x)=x in <= x+50 steps? ---")
    print("Parameters:")
    print("  Machine (R,A,W) = (64, 64, 512)")
    print("  Input x in [0, 2^32)")
    print("  Program Length <= 2^32 + 50")
    print("  Execution time <= x + 50 steps")
    print("\n1. The time constraint is the key. To boop x times, the program must execute exactly x 'BOOP' instructions. Each BOOP takes 1 step. This leaves a maximum of 50 steps for all other 'overhead' instructions (setup, branching, halting).")
    print("2. This 50-step overhead is a fixed budget, regardless of whether x is 0 or 2^32-1.")
    print("3. The program must select one of 2^32 different execution paths based on the value of x. The most time-efficient way to do this would be to jump directly to a block of code containing the correct number of BOOP instructions.")
    print("4. This requires a 'dispatch': a mechanism to jump to a calculated address (e.g., JUMP to address `C - x`). However, the instruction set architecture has severe limitations:")
    print("   a) No Indirect Jumps: The only branch is 'BRANCHIFZERO adr, reg', where 'adr' is a fixed address, not one read from a register. We cannot do 'JUMP [reg_x]'.")
    print("   b) No Indirect Addressing: 'LOAD reg <- adr' also uses a fixed address. We cannot do 'LOAD reg, [reg_x]' to look up a target address from a table in memory.")
    print("5. Without these instructions, the alternatives are too slow:")
    print("   - Self-Modifying Code: Building a jump instruction in memory by calculating its bits with NAND/ADD operations would take far more than 50 steps.")
    print("   - Sequential Comparison: Checking 'if x==0', 'if x==1', etc., would take O(x) time, which violates the x+50 constraint for x > 50.")
    print("   - Binary Search: This would require a 'less than' comparison, which is not a native instruction and would be very slow to simulate.")
    print("6. Since there is no way to perform the required dispatch (selecting one of 2^32 paths) in under 50 instructions with the given architecture, no such program L can exist.")
    print("\nConclusion for B: No\n")
