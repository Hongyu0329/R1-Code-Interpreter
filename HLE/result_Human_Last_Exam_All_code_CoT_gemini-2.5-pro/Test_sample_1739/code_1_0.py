# The nonlinear frequency correction (omega_2) is proportional to a polynomial in the square of the linear frequency (omega_0^2).
# Let y = omega_0^2.
# Through the method of multiple scales, the polynomial is derived to be:
# P(y) = 2*y^2 - 3*y - 6

# The terms of the polynomial determine the nonlinear frequency shift.
# The coefficients of the polynomial are:
c1 = 2
c2 = -3
c3 = -6

# The problem asks for the 3rd term of the nonlinear correction, which corresponds to the constant term in this polynomial.

# We will display the polynomial and then state the answer.
