    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band ($M$) for which the forest $F$ does not simplicially collapse onto its root set $R$. This is a problem in algebraic combinatorics.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The question is about \"non-collapsing rooted forests\". This is a concept from the combinatorial algebraic topology literature, particularly related to the works of Kalai, and Catanzaro, Forrester, and Park.\n\n2.  **Find the relevant theorem:** The set of non-collapsing rooted forests on a simplicial complex $K$, along with the trivial empty forest $(\\emptyset, \\emptyset)$, forms a finite abelian group. The order of this group gives the number of such forests plus one. A result by M. J. Catanzaro, M. E. Forrester, and J. Park states that this group is isomorphic to the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of the homology groups of the complex. For a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K$, this group $G$ is:\n    $G \\cong \\text{Tors}(\\tilde{H}_{d-1}(K; \\mathbb{Z})) \\oplus \\text{Tors}(\\tilde{H}_{d-2}(K; \\mathbb{Z}))$\n    The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is therefore $|G| - 1$. Since the Möbius band is connected, we can use the ordinary homology groups $H_1$ and $H_0$ instead of the reduced ones $\\tilde{H}_1$ and $\\tilde{H}_0$.\n\n3.  **Determine the dimension and homology of the Möbius band:**\n    *   The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional surface (with boundary), so any triangulation of it is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex. Thus, $d=2$.\n    *   We need the integer homology groups $H_{d-1}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H_{d-2}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The Möbius band is path-connected, so its 0-th homology group is $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The Möbius band famously deformation retracts onto its central circle ($S^1$). Therefore, its first homology group is $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the order of the torsion subgroups:**\n    *   The torsion subgroup of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, which has order 1.\n    *   The torsion subgroup of $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ is also the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, which has order 1.\n\n5.  **Compute the final number:**\n    *   Calculate the order of the group $G$: $|G| = |\\text{Tors}(H_1)| \\times |\\text{Tors}(H_0)| = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n    *   The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is $|G| - 1$.\n\n6.  **Write Python code:** Implement the final calculation in a Python script and print the result along with the equation.\n\nThis plan leads to the conclusion that there are no such forests. Let's write the code to formalize the calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the standard\n# triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root set.\n\n# Step 1: Define the dimension of the simplicial complex.\n# The Möbius band is a 2D surface, so its triangulation is a 2-dimensional complex.\nd = 2\n\n# Step 2: Determine the orders of the torsion subgroups of the relevant homology groups.\n# The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is given by the formula:\n# N = |Tors(H_{d-1}(M; Z))| * |Tors(H_{d-2}(M; Z))| - 1\n# where M is the Möbius band and Z are the integers.\n\n# For d=2, we need H_1(M; Z) and H_0(M; Z).\n\n# The homology groups of the Möbius band M are well-known:\n# H_1(M; Z) is the group of integers, Z.\n# H_0(M; Z) is the group of integers, Z (since it's path-connected).\n\n# The torsion subgroup of Z is the trivial group {0}, which has order 1.\norder_tors_h1 = 1\norder_tors_h0 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of non-collapsing forests.\n# The order of the group of non-collapsing forests (plus the trivial one) is the product of the orders.\ngroup_order = order_tors_h1 * order_tors_h0\n\n# The number of non-collapsing forests is the order of this group minus 1 (for the trivial empty forest).\nnum_non_collapsing_forests = group_order - 1\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(\"The calculation for the number of non-collapsing rooted forests is based on the formula:\")\nprint(\"N = |Tors(H_1(M))| * |Tors(H_0(M))| - 1\")\nprint(f\"The order of the torsion subgroup of H_1(M) is {order_tors_h1}.\")\nprint(f\"The order of the torsion subgroup of H_0(M) is {order_tors_h0}.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{order_tors_h1} * {order_tors_h0} - 1 = {num_non_collapsing_forests}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of such forests is: {num_non_collapsing_forests}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
