    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is Mount Athos. The Greek god Poseidon is described as watching the Trojan War from the peak of Samothrace, but Mount Athos, mentioned in a simile, is taller.\n\nHere is a Python script that organizes the mountains mentioned in the Iliad by their elevation to determine the tallest after Olympus.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    after Mount Olympus, and prints the comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mt.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
