    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single definitive value but rather an optimal range that depends on the specific synthesis method, nanoparticle morphology, and reaction conditions. However, a general consensus has emerged from numerous scientific studies.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that summarizes the findings from scientific literature. The script will:\n1.  Define the generally accepted optimal range for the Ni/Ce atomic ratio.\n2.  Explain the scientific reasoning behind this optimal range for both the Water-Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n3.  Print this information in a clear and organized manner, explicitly mentioning the key numerical values that define the ratio.\n\n```python\ndef get_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the optimal range and example values based on literature consensus\n    lower_bound_ratio = 0.1\n    upper_bound_ratio = 0.3\n    example_ni_part = 1\n    example_ce_part = 9 # Corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of 1/9 or ~0.11\n\n    print(\"--- Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Ni-Ceria Catalysts ---\")\n    print(\"\\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio is a range designed to maximize the active sites at the Nickel-Ceria interface.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Optimal Range ---\")\n    print(f\"Based on extensive research for both Water-Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions, the optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio generally falls within the range of:\")\n    print(f\"Lower Bound: {lower_bound_ratio}\")\n    print(f\"Upper Bound: {upper_bound_ratio}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis can be expressed in various ways.

Maximizing the Interface: The synergy between Nickel and Ceria is crucial. The reaction primarily occurs at the interface between the Ni nanoparticles and the Ceria (CeO2) support. A ratio within the optimal range ensures a high density of these active sites.\")\n    print(\"2. High Ni Dispersion: Lower Ni content (e.g., Ni/Ce < 0.3) promotes the formation of small, highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles on the Ceria support. This maximizes the surface area of the active metal.\")\n    print(\"3. Preventing Sintering: At higher Ni concentrations (e.g., Ni/Ce > 0.3), the Ni nanoparticles tend to agglomerate or 'sinter' into larger particles during the reaction. This reduces the active surface area and the number of beneficial interface sites, leading to a drop in catalytic performance.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The key is to achieve a balance: enough Ni to provide catalytic sites, but not so much that it agglomerates.
