The demonstrations show that the 'Max Value-diff' decreases at the same geometric rate, regardless of the reward scale. The convergence is guaranteed as long as the reward function is bounded and gamma < 1. There is no requirement for the rewards to be within a specific range like [-1, 1]. Therefore, the values can be any real numbers.
