def solve_complexity_class():
    """
    This function determines and prints the upper bound of the circuit complexity class
    for the described transformer model.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A transformer with a fixed number of layers and heads performs a number of
       arithmetic operations that is polynomial in the length of the input sequence, n.
    2. The "float activations" and weights are, in any real computer, finite-precision
       numbers. Any arithmetic operation on these numbers can be simulated by a
       boolean circuit whose size is polynomial in the number of bits of precision.
    3. A specific, trained transformer network for a given input size 'n' can be "unrolled"
       into a fixed circuit. The trained weights are essentially hard-coded into this circuit's structure.
    4. This maps directly to the definition of a non-uniform complexity class, where a different
       circuit can exist for each input size 'n'. The description of the circuit (including the weights)
       is provided as "advice".
    5. The class of languages that can be decided by a family of circuits of polynomial size
       is known as P/poly. This is the standard upper bound for most practical neural network architectures,
       including transformers. The specific details like "average-hard-attention" and "saturated" activations
       do not elevate the model beyond this class; they can be simulated within a polynomial-size circuit.
