    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation by separating the variables. Then, we will use the initial condition to find the particular solution. Finally, we will use this particular solution to calculate the value of x(1).\n\n**Step 1: Separate the variables**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nWe can separate the variables $x$ and $t$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n$$ \\int x^{-2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nPerforming the integration gives us the general solution:\n$$ -x^{-1} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the initial condition to find C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of C:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution**\nNow we have the value of C, so the particular solution for the initial value problem is:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate x(1)**\nFinally, we need to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nTherefore, by taking the reciprocal of both sides, we find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe following Python code confirms this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions and target time\nx0 = -8\nt0 = 0\nt1 = 1\n\n# Step 2: Use the general solution (-1/x = t^2/2 - t + C) and initial conditions to find C.\n# -1/x0 = t0^2/2 - t0 + C\n# C = -1/x0 - (t0^2/2 - t0)\nC = -Fraction(1, x0) - (Fraction(t0**2, 2) - t0)\n\nprint(f\"The general solution is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C.\")\nprint(f\"Using the initial condition x({t0}) = {x0}, we find C = {C}.\")\nprint(f\"The particular solution is: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + {C}\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 3: Use the particular solution to find x(1).\n# -1/x(1) = t1^2/2 - t1 + C\nprint(f\"To find x({t1}), we solve the equation:\")\nval_t_sq_half = Fraction(t1**2, 2)\nval_t = t1\nprint(f\"-1/x({t1}) = ({t1})^2/2 - {t1} + {C}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x({t1}) = {val_t_sq_half} - {val_t} + {C}\")\n\n# Calculate the right-hand side\nrhs = val_t_sq_half - val_t + C\nprint(f\"-1/x({t1}) = {rhs}\\n\")\n\n# Solve for x(1)\nx1 = -1 / rhs\nprint(f\"Therefore, x({t1}) = -1 / ({rhs}) = {x1}\")\n\n# Final numerical answer\n# The result as a fraction is 8/3.
