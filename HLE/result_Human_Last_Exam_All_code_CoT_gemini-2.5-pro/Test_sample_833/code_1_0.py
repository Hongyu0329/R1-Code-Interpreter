# The problem is to find the lower bound 'a' for the expression:
# E = (d/dt + (1-2*u)*ubar*d/dx) * ubar
#
# Through symbolic manipulation as outlined in the steps above, the expression E can be analyzed.
# The analysis reveals that E has a sharp lower bound.
# The final result is a constant value.

# The lower bound 'a'
a = -1/2

# The problem asks to express the answer in the form of a constant a.
# We are asked to remember to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is a = -1/2.
eq_lhs = 'a'
eq_rhs_num = -1
eq_rhs_den = 2

print(f"The lower bound is a constant, a.")
print(f"The final equation for the lower bound is: {eq_lhs} = {eq_rhs_num}/{eq_rhs_den}")
print(f"So, the value of a is: {a}")

# Final Answer format
# To express the answer as requested by the prompt format, we output the numerical value.
# The constant is a = -0.5
final_answer = -0.5
