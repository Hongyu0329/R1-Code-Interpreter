    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach. A naive brute-force search would be too slow, so we need a more efficient strategy.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The variables $x_i$ are non-negative integers. Their values are bounded, since $x_i^2 \\le 2024$, which means $0 \\le x_i \\le \\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44$.\n2.  The equation is symmetric, meaning the order of the numbers in a solution does not affect the sum. For example, if $(a, b, c, d, e)$ is a solution, then any permutation is also a solution.\n3.  To avoid overcounting and to make the search efficient, we will look for unique sets of numbers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation. We can do this by enforcing an order, such as $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$.\n4.  We will use nested loops to search for these ordered tuples. The bounds of each loop can be optimized. For instance, since $5x_1^2 \\le x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2+x_5^2 = 2024$, we know $x_1 \\le \\sqrt{2024/5} \\approx 20$.\n5.  In the innermost loop, we will calculate the required value for $x_5^2$, check if it's a perfect square, and verify that the resulting $x_5$ maintains the imposed order ($x_5 \\ge x_4$).\n6.  For each unique ordered tuple (a base solution) we find, we will calculate how many distinct permutations it can form. For a set of 5 numbers, this is given by the multinomial coefficient formula $5! / (n_1! n_2! \\dots)$, where $n_i$ are the counts of the unique numbers in the set.\n7.  Finally, we will sum the permutation counts for all unique sets found to get the total number of solutions.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will print each unique set of solutions found, show how they satisfy the equation, state how many permutations they generate, and conclude with the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_permutations(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of distinct permutations of a list of numbers using the formula:\n    n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ...\n    are the counts of each unique item.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(numbers)\n    counts = Counter(numbers)\n    denominator = 1\n    for count in counts.values():\n        denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n    return math.factorial(n) // denominator\n\ndef find_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation\n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024.\n    It iterates through possible values for x1, x2, x3, x4 with an ordering\n    constraint (x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5) to find unique sets of solutions efficiently.\n    For each unique set, it calculates the number of ordered solutions (permutations)\n    and adds it to the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    # Pre-calculating squares and storing them in a set allows for O(1) average time complexity\n    # checks to see if a number is a perfect square.\n    squares_set = {i*i for i in range(limit + 1)}\n    \n    total_solutions = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Finding non-negative integer solutions for x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = {target}\\n\")\n    print(\"Base solution sets and their contributions:\")\n    \n    # We enforce x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5 to find each unique set of numbers only once.\n    # The loop limits are optimized based on this ordering, which significantly reduces the search space.\n    \n    # Bound for x1: 5 * x1^2 <= target  => x1 <= sqrt(target/5)\n    limit1 = int(math.sqrt(target / 5))\n    for x1 in range(limit1 + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        \n        # Bound for x2: s1 + 4 * x2^2 <= target => x2 <= sqrt((target - s1) / 4)\n        limit2 = int(math.sqrt((target - s1) / 4))\n        for x2 in range(x1, limit2 + 1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            \n            # Bound for x3: s1 + s2 + 3 * x3^2 <= target => x3 <= sqrt((target - s1 - s2) / 3)\n            limit3 = int(math.sqrt((target - s1 - s2) / 3))\n            for x3 in range(x2, limit3 + 1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                \n                # Bound for x4: s1 + s2 + s3 + 2 * x4^2 <= target => x4 <= sqrt((target - s1 - s2 - s3) / 2)\n                limit4 = int(math.sqrt((target - s1 - s2 - s3) / 2))\n                for x4 in range(x3, limit4 + 1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    \n                    current_sum = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4\n                    remaining_square = target - current_sum\n                    \n                    if remaining_square in squares_set:\n                        x5 = int(math.sqrt(remaining_square))\n                        \n                        # The last check to ensure the order is maintained.\n                        if x5 >= x4:\n                            solution_tuple = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                            perms = count_permutations(solution_tuple)\n                            total_solutions += perms\n                            \n                            # Output each number in the equation for each unique set found.\n                            num_strs = [f\"{x}^2\" for x in solution_tuple]\n                            val_strs = [f\"{x*x}\" for x in solution_tuple]\n                            print(f\"{' + '.join(num_strs)} = {' + '.join(val_strs)} = {target}.
