    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core techniques of the dances listed in the options. The key distinction lies between \"swing\" dances and \"non-swing\" or \"staccato\" dances.\n\n1.  **Swing Dances**: This category includes the Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep. These dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, momentum, body sway, and rise & fall. While figures have standard amounts of turn, the continuous nature of the movement allows for variations like overturning, which is often used in choreography. It might not be 'by the book' textbook technique, but it doesn't violate the fundamental physics or character of the dance.\n\n2.  **Non-Swing/Staccato Dance**: The European Tango is unique in this list. Its technique is built on the principles of *no swing*, *no sway*, and *no rise & fall*. Movements are sharp, deliberate, and staccato. Turns are not executed with continuous momentum but with precise, clipped actions and specific foot placements.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Reverse Turn**: To \"overturn\" a Reverse Turn, a dancer needs to add extra rotation. In a swing dance, this can be achieved by using the existing momentum. In Tango, however, there is no momentum or swing to use. Adding extra rotation would require introducing a continuous rotational action (a swing or a swivel), which is a fundamental violation of the core Tango technique. Therefore, it is considered technically impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn in Tango without completely disregarding its defining principles.\n\nBased on this logic, the European Tango is the correct answer. I will now generate a Python script that prints this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the core question.\")\n    print(\"The question asks in which dance it is technically impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating the dance's fundamental technique.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the dance categories.\")\n    print(\"The listed dances fall into two main categories based on their movement style:\")\n    print(\"  - Swing Dances: English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep.\")\n    print(\"    - Characterized by: Continuous flowing movement, momentum, body sway, and rise & fall.\")\n    print(\"    - Implication for turns: The use of momentum (swing) allows for turns to be modified (e.g., overturned). This is a common choreographic choice and doesn't break the fundamental nature of the dance.\")\n    print(\"\\n  - Staccato Dance: European Tango.\")\n    print(\"    - Characterized by: Sharp, deliberate actions, NO swing, NO sway, NO rise & fall.\")\n    print(\"    - Implication for turns: Turns are executed with precise, clipped actions. A Reverse Turn is designed to end at a specific alignment without continuous rotation.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Reaching the conclusion.\")\n    print(\"To 'overturn' a turn means to add extra rotation. In Tango, adding this rotation would require introducing 'swing' or continuous momentum.\")\n    print(\"Introducing swing is a direct violation of the most fundamental rule of Tango technique.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn in European Tango without disregarding its technique.\")\n\n    answer_choice = \"C\"\n    answer_text = \"European Tango\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The correct choice is {answer_choice}, {answer_text}.\")\n\n\nsolve_dance_question()\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
