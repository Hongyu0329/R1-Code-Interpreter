        "3. This system includes enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT), which can be quickly activated to neutralize harmful ROS molecules.",
        "4. While non-enzymatic antioxidants (both liposoluble and hydrosoluble) and photosynthetic pigments also play a role, their response is generally part of a secondary or more sustained defense, not the initial, immediate one.",
