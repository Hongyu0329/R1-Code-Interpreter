    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$. A character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Component Characters**: For each prime power factor $m = p^a$ of $N$, we need to determine the possible orders for primitive characters modulo $m$ and how many characters exist for each of those orders. The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$.\n\n3.  **Count Combinations using Inclusion-Exclusion**: We need to count the number of combinations of these primitive component characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. We can do this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by:\n    $N(\\text{ord}=6) = N(\\text{ord}|6) - N(\\text{ord}|3) - N(\\text{ord}|2) + N(\\text{ord}|1)$\n    where $N(\\text{ord}|k)$ is the number of characters whose order divides $k$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Each Term**: For each $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$, we calculate $N(\\text{ord}|k)$. A character's order divides $k$ if and only if the order of each of its primitive components divides $k$. So, for each prime power factor $m$, we count the number of primitive characters whose order divides $k$, let's call this $C_m(k)$. Then, $N(\\text{ord}|k) = \\prod C_m(k)$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the calculated values back into the inclusion-exclusion formula to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_prime_power_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime power factors of n.\"\"\"\n    pf = prime_factorize(n)\n    return sorted([p**a for p, a in pf.items()])\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_primitive_orders(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of {order: count} for primitive characters\n    of conductor m, where m is a prime power.\n    \"\"\"\n    pf = prime_factorize(m)\n    p = list(pf.keys())[0]\n    a = pf[p]\n    \n    orders_count = {}\n    # Case: m = p (odd prime)\n    if a == 1 and p != 2:\n        group_order = p - 1\n        d = 1\n        while d * d <= group_order:\n            if group_order % d == 0:\n                if d > 1: orders_count[d] = phi(d)\n                if d*d != group_order and group_order // d > 1:\n                    orders_count[group_order // d] = phi(group_order // d)\n            d += 1\n    # Case: m = p^a, p odd, a > 1\n    elif p != 2 and a > 1:\n        group_order = phi(m)\n        non_prim_group_order = phi(m // p)\n        \n        # Find divisors of group_order\n        d = 1\n        n = group_order\n        divs = set()\n        while d * d <= n:\n            if n % d == 0:\n                divs.add(d)\n                divs.add(n // d)\n            d += 1\n\n        # Find divisors of non_prim_group_order\n        d = 1\n        n = non_prim_group_order\n        non_prim_divs = set()\n        while d * d <= n:\n            if n % d == 0:\n                non_prim_divs.add(d)\n                non_prim_divs.add(n // d)\n            d += 1\n        \n        for d_ in divs:\n            if d_ not in non_prim_divs:\n                orders_count[d_] = phi(d_)\n    # Case: m = 4\n    elif m == 4:\n        orders_count[2] = 1\n    \n    return orders_count\n\n# Main execution\nN = 36036\nTARGET_ORDER = 6\n\nprint(f\"Let N = {N}.
