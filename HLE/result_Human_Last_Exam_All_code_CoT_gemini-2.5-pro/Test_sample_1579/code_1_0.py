# Define the given surface area of the two-sphere
surface_area = 8.0

# The problem asks for the smallest known upper bound for the length of a
# closed geodesic on a Riemannian two-sphere.
# As of 2024, the best proven result is from Regina Rotman (2006), which provides
# an upper bound for the length (L) of the shortest closed geodesic based on the
# surface area (A). The inequality is: L <= 2 * sqrt(pi * A).
# This provides the upper bound we are looking for.

# Calculate the value of pi
pi_val = math.pi

# Calculate the upper bound for the length of the geodesic
upper_bound = 2 * math.sqrt(pi_val * surface_area)

# Output the explanation and the calculation steps
