# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the value 'a' where the symplectic embedding capacity c(a) of an ellipsoid E(1,a)
#    is determined solely by its volume. This corresponds to the condition c(a) = sqrt(a).
# 2. According to results in symplectic geometry (the McDuff staircase), this condition holds for an initial
#    interval [1, tau^4], where tau is the golden ratio.
# 3. The question asks for the specific value of 'a' where this behavior changes, which is the upper
#    bound of this interval, a = tau^4.
# 4. The code will calculate this value, showing its exact form and its numerical approximation.

print("The value 'a' marks the upper limit of the first continuous interval [1, a] where the volume constraint is the only obstruction for the symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1, x) into a 4-ball.")
print("This value is the fourth power of the golden ratio, tau.")

# The golden ratio, tau = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
# We can express its fourth power, a = tau^4, in a simplified radical form.
# a = tau^4 = ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^4 = (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2

# These are the integer numbers in the final exact equation for 'a'
num1 = 7
num2 = 3
num3 = 5
num4 = 2

# Calculate the final numerical value for 'a'
a_value = (num1 + num2 * math.sqrt(num3)) / num4

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation.
