    Solves the mathematical problem about the topological group.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
    of an open subset of a Hausdorff topological group G of cardinality c
    with a specific property.

    1. The property implies that the connected component of the identity, G_0, is open.
       This reduces the problem to studying open sets within a connected group G_0 that
       also has the property.

    2. This connected group G_0 is not necessarily locally connected. This is key, as
       for locally connected spaces, components of open sets are always open.

    3. We can construct a group with the required properties. A suitable example is the
       direct sum of c copies of the circle group, G =bigoplus_{r in R} S^1_r.
       This group has cardinality c, is connected, satisfies the given property, but is
       not locally connected and not second-countable.

    4. In such a group, it is possible to construct an open set that has c non-open
       connected components. The number of components is bounded by the cardinality
       of the group itself, which is c.

    5. Therefore, the largest possible number of non-open components is c, the
       cardinality of the continuum.

    # The cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by 'c' or '\mathfrak{c}'.
    # In set theory, this is the cardinality of the set of real numbers.
    # We will print the symbol 'c' to represent this transfinite number.
    
    final_answer = 'c'
    
    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # In this context, 'c' is the symbolic representation of the number.
