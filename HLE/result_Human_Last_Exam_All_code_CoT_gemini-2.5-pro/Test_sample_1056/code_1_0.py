# The problem is a mathematical one concerning the structure of a specific group of homeomorphisms.
# The solution involves identifying the group's structure and applying known theorems from algebra and topology.
# The calculation steps are purely mathematical, as explained above.
# The final result is that the rank 'r' of the abelianization of the group G is 2,
# and the order 't' of its torsion subgroup is 1.

# Rank of Ab(G)
r = 2

# Order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G)
t = 1

# The problem asks to compute the pair (r, t).
print(f"The rank r is: {r}")
print(f"The order of the torsion subgroup t is: {t}")
print(f"The pair (r, t) is: ({r}, {t})")
