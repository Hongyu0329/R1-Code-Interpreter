    "This is a historical question rather than a computational one. I will provide a simple Python script that prints the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first identify the historical fact regarding Andre Vernault's true profession.\n2.  I will then create a Python script.\n3.  The script will store the profession in a string variable.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the answer in a full sentence for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the historical answer to the question about Andre Vernault.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Andre Vernault's case is documented in MI5 files. He was evasive not because\n  # he was a spy, but because he was trying to hide his real profession, which\n  # was illegal in the UK at the time and would have brought him shame or prosecution.\n  true_profession = \"a male prostitute\"\n  \n  print(f\"Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators, which was that of {true_profession}.\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<a male prostitute>>>"
