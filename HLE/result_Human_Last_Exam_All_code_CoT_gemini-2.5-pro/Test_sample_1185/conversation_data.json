    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to classify the possible topological structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected projective curve with at most nodal singularities, such that its automorphism group is finite.\n\nThis classification can be approached by considering the structure of the curve's dual graph, where vertices represent irreducible components and edges represent nodes connecting them. The arithmetic genus of the curve `C` is given by the formula: `p_a(C) = h^1(G) + Î£ p_a(C_i)`, where `G` is the dual graph, `h^1(G)` is its first Betti number (`|Edges| - |Vertices| + 1`), and `p_a(C_i)` is the arithmetic genus of component `i`. For a stable curve of genus 2, we must have `p_a(C) = 2`.\n\nThe stability condition for each component `C_i` with geometric genus `g_i` and `n_i` special points (nodes or intersections) requires that `2*g_i - 2 + n_i > 0`, which simplifies to `n_i >= 1` for elliptic components (`g_i = 1`) and `n_i >= 3` for rational components (`g_i = 0`).\n\nThe Python code below systematically enumerates the possibilities based on this framework to find the total number of types.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reduction for genus 2 curves\n    by systematically enumerating the possible structures.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the possible structures of stable curves of genus 2:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    stable_types_count = {}\n\n    # --- Case 1: Irreducible Curves ---\n    # The curve has one component, so the dual graph has 1 vertex and 0 edges.\n    # h^1(G) = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0.\n    # Genus formula: p_a(C) = 0 + p_a(C_1) = 2.\n    # The single component has arithmetic genus p_a(C_1) = g_1 + d_1 = 2,\n    # where g_1 is its geometric genus and d_1 is its number of self-nodes.\n    # Special points n_1 = d_1.\n    print(\"\\nCase A: Irreducible curves (1 component)\")\n    \n    # Subcase A1: g_1=2, d_1=0.
