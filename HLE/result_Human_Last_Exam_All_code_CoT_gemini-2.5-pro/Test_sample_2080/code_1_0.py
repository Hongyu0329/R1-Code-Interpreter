# Goal: Calculate the second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B_steric).

# The steric contribution to the second virial coefficient can be estimated
# from the protein's partial specific volume (v_p) using a hard-sphere model.
# The relationship for the coefficient in units of mL/g is:
# B_steric = 4 * v_p

# A typical partial specific volume for a monoclonal antibody is 0.73 mL/g.
# We will use this standard value for the calculation.

# --- Parameters ---
# The factor from the hard-sphere approximation
factor = 4
# The partial specific volume (v_p) for a typical monoclonal antibody in mL/g
partial_specific_volume = 0.73

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient
b22_steric = factor * partial_specific_volume

# --- Output ---
# Print the final equation with the numbers used in the calculation
