    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will address your primary question regarding the most suitable technique for synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine. I will compare the three main approaches: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), Native Chemical Ligation (NCL), and Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion. I will conclude by recommending the most effective method for this specific case.\n\nSecond, to fulfill the coding aspect of your request and to quantitatively demonstrate why one of the methods (SPPS) is not ideal for a peptide of this length, I will provide a Python script. This script will calculate the dramatic decrease in the theoretical maximum yield of SPPS as a function of its per-step coupling efficiency for a 100-amino-acid peptide.\n\n***\n\nFor synthesizing a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid (UAA) like para-azido phenylalanine (pAzF), there are several techniques to consider.\n\n1.  **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the standard chemical method for building peptides. While it allows for the direct incorporation of a protected pAzF building block, its efficiency decreases with each amino acid added. For a 100 aa peptide, the cumulative yield would be extremely low, making purification of the full-length product from a complex mixture of shorter, failed sequences incredibly difficult.\n\n2.  **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This powerful semi-synthetic method involves chemically joining two or more smaller peptide fragments. You could synthesize a fragment containing the pAzF via SPPS and ligate it to another fragment(s) produced either by SPPS or more efficiently by recombinant expression. This is a very viable and excellent strategy.\n\n3.  **Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** This is arguably the most helpful and powerful technique for your specific goal. It involves genetically engineering a host organism (commonly *E. coli*) to incorporate the UAA during protein synthesis (translation).\n    *   An orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is introduced into the cell. This pair is engineered to uniquely recognize the UAA (pAzF) and a specific codon, typically the amber stop codon (UAG).\n    *   A UAG codon is introduced into the gene encoding your peptide at the position where you want 'X'.\n    *   When the cells are grown in a medium containing pAzF, the ribosome will read the UAG codon and, instead of terminating translation, will insert pAzF, resulting in the full-length 100 aa peptide containing the UAA.\n\n**Conclusion:** For producing a 100 aa peptide with a single pAzF, **Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion** is the most recommended technique due to its high efficiency and yield for proteins of this size.\n\nTo illustrate the challenge of using the alternative SPPS method, the following Python script calculates the theoretical yield. You can see how even a very high coupling efficiency of 99.5% per step results in a poor overall yield for a 100-mer peptide.\n\n```python\n# Define the properties of the peptide synthesis\npeptide_length = 100\n# The number of coupling reactions is one less than the length\nnum_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n\n# A list of possible coupling efficiencies per step\nstep_efficiencies = [0.995, 0.99, 0.98, 0.97]\n\nprint(f\"Calculating theoretical yield for a {peptide_length}aa peptide after {num_couplings} coupling steps:\\n\")\n\nfor efficiency in step_efficiencies:\n    # The formula for total yield is (step_efficiency) ^ (number_of_couplings)\n    total_yield = efficiency ** num_couplings\n\n    # Print the result, showing each number in the equation\n    print(\n        f\"With {efficiency:.1%} efficiency per step: \"\n        f\"({efficiency}) ** {num_couplings} = {total_yield:.2%} final yield\"\n    )\n\n```\n<<<Recombinant protein expression with genetic code expansion>>>"
