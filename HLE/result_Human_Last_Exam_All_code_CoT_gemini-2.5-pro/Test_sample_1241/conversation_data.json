    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, we need to solve the system of equations when the time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:**\n    From the given differential equations, setting the derivatives to zero gives:\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1} \\implies \\lambda_{01}P_{0} = \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} \\implies (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3} \\implies \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}$\n    *   The second differential equation becomes redundant when the others are set to zero, as the sum of all derivatives is zero.\n2.  **Use the normalization condition:**\n    The sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n    *   $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    We will express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n    *   $P_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} P_1$\n    *   $P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} P_1$\n    *   $P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) P_1$\n    \n    Substitute these into the normalization equation to find the value of $P_1$. Then, calculate $P_0$.\n4.  **Calculate the final result:**\n    Compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the lambda values\nlambda01 = 0.019\nlambda10 = 0.65\nlambda12 = 0.4\nlambda21 = 0.392\nlambda23 = 0.008\nlambda31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Solve the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities\n# We express P0, P2, P3 in terms of P1.\n# Let P_i = c_i * P1\n# P1 = c1 * P1 => c1 = 1\nc1 = 1.0\n\n# From l01*P0 = l10*P1\nc0 = lambda10 / lambda01\n\n# From (l21 + l23)*P2 = l12*P1\nc2 = lambda12 / (lambda21 + lambda23)\n\n# From l31*P3 = l23*P2\nc3 = (lambda23 / lambda31) * c2\n\n# The normalization condition is P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n# (c0*P1) + (c1*P1) + (c2*P1) + (c3*P1) = 1\n# P1 * (c0 + c1 + c2 + c3) = 1\n# P1 = 1 / (c0 + c1 + c2 + c3)\nsum_of_coeffs = c0 + c1 + c2 + c3\nP1 = 1 / sum_of_coeffs\n\n# Now calculate P0\nP0 = c0 * P1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required sum P0 + P1\nresult = P0 + P1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\n# Using f-strings to format the output with high precision\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 6):\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {P0:.9f} + {P1:.9f} = {result:.9f}\")\nelse:\n    # Fallback for older Python versions\n    print(\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {:.9f} + {:.9f} = {:.9f}\".format(P0, P1, result))\n\n```\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
