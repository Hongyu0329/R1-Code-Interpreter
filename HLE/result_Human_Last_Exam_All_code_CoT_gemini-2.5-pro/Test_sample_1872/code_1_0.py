    Calculates the theoretically maximal F1 score for knowledge graph alignment

    The key assumptions are:
    1. "No external linguistic resources" means that relations that are semantically
       equivalent but lexically different are impossible to align.
    2. The maximal F1 score is achieved when an ideal algorithm perfectly aligns
       all possible relations (zero false positives) and correctly identifies them
       (maximizing true positives).

    # The proportion of relations that are theoretically alignable.
    # In the F1 score context, this represents the maximum possible recall,
