    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type:** This curve is a Lissajous curve. A self-intersection occurs when the curve passes through the same (x, y) point at two different times, `t1` and `t2`.\n\n2.  **Use the Formula for Lissajous Curves:** For a Lissajous curve of the form `x = cos(at)` and `y = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are integers, there is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n3.  **Check the Condition:** The formula `(a-1)(b-1)/2` applies if the frequencies `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). In our case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, so the condition is met.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We can now apply the formula:\n    *   Number of self-intersections = `(9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    *   = `8 * 4 / 2`\n    *   = `32 / 2`\n    *   = `16`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The parameters for the Lissajous curve x = cos(at), y = sin(bt)\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve where a and b are\n# coprime integers is given by the formula (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\n# We first confirm that a and b are coprime.\nif math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n    # Calculate the individual terms of the formula\n    term1 = a - 1\n    term2 = b - 1\n    numerator = term1 * term2\n    num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation as a final equation\n    print(\"The number of self-intersection points is calculated using the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {term1} * {term2} / 2 = {numerator} / 2 = {num_intersections}\")\nelse:\n    # This part would execute if a and b were not coprime.\n    print(f\"The formula for coprime parameters does not apply because gcd({a}, {b}) is not 1.\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
