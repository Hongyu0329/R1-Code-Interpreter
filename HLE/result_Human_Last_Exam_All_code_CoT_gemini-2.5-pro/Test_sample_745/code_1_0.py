    Solves the topology problem about the number of components of X \ C.

    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c, A a connected
    subset of X, and C a component of X \ A. We want to find the largest
    number of components X \ C can have.

    1. The space in question is X \ C. Since C is a component of X \ A,
       it is a subset of X \ A. This implies that A is a subset of X \ C.

    2. A is given as a connected set. Since A is a connected subset of X \ C,
       it must be entirely contained within a single component of X \ C. Let's call
       this main component K1. So, A is a subset of K1.

    3. Any other component of X \ C, say K2, K3, ..., must be disjoint from A.
       This means these other components must be subsets of (X \ A) \ C.

    4. A key theorem in general topology (due to Kuratowski) states that
       if X is a connected space, A is a connected subset of X, and C is a
       component of X \ A, then the space X \ C has at most two components.

    5. An example that achieves this maximum can be constructed. Consider two
       topologist's sine curves joined at their endpoints to form a circle,
       and let A be one of the curves. Then X \ A has two components (the other
       curve and the interior of the circle). If C is the interior, X \ C
       will have two components (A and the other curve).

    6. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 2.
