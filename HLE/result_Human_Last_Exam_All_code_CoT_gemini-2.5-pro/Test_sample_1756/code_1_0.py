    # Based on a step-by-step analysis of each statement, the following were found to be correct:
    # A) The effective sampling pool from combined top-k and nucleus is the intersection, which is the more restrictive result.
    # C) Temperature > 1 flattens the distribution, potentially expanding the nucleus set.
    # E) Renormalizing probabilities for resampling from a truncated set preserves relative ratios.
    # G) The standard implementation of combined top-k/nucleus uses set intersection, which is commutative.
    # M) Determinism in MoE models is possible with the right software flags and hardware configuration.
    # O) Different GPU architectures can produce different floating-point results, leading to different outputs.
    # P) Non-deterministic expert pruning can lead to different model behavior and outputs across runs.
    # Q) End-to-end determinism requires all components, including attention, to be constant.
    # R) Variable sequence lengths can trigger different, numerically-distinct GPU kernels.
    # W) The entropy of a mixture distribution is >= the average entropy of its components.
    # X) Non-deterministic summation order in attention calculations can alter results.
    # Y) Recomputing activations during checkpointing can introduce numerical differences.
