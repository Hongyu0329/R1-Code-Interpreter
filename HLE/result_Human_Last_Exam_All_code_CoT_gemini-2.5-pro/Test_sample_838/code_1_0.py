### Step 1: Elimination Reaction

*   **Starting Material:** [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene. This is a secondary alkyl halide with the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3.
*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically bulky base.
*   **Reaction:** This is an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Due to the large size of the t-BuOK base, it preferentially removes the most sterically accessible proton. The protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are more accessible than the protons on the internal methylene group (C2).
*   **Product A:** The reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene) over the Zaitsev product (the more substituted alkene). The stereocenter at C3 is destroyed in this step.
    *   **Product A is 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2).**

    # Explanation of Step 2
    step2_explanation = """
### Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation

*   **Starting Material:** Product A, 4-phenylbut-1-ene.
*   **Reagents:** 1. Borane in THF (BH3), 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Reaction:** This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which effectively adds water across the double bond.
*   **Regioselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl group (-OH) adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C1).
*   **Product B:** The resulting product is a primary alcohol.
    *   **Product B is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH).**

    # Explanation of Step 3
    step3_explanation = """
### Step 3: Bromination of Alcohol

*   **Starting Material:** Product B, 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.
*   **Reagent:** Phosphorus tribromide (PBr3).
*   **Reaction:** PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into the corresponding alkyl bromides via an SN2 mechanism.
*   **Product C:** The hydroxyl group at C1 is replaced by a bromine atom.
    *   **Product C is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br).**
"""

    # Final Answer
    final_answer = """
### Final Product Identity: Product C

The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**Chirality Explanation:**
The starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, was chiral. However, the chiral center at carbon 3 was destroyed during the first step (the E2 elimination reaction) to form an achiral alkene. The subsequent reactions did not introduce any new stereocenters. Therefore, the final product, **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is an achiral molecule.**
