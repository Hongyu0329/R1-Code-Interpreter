    "Based on the principles of crystallography and optics, your question contains a fundamental contradiction. Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, can only occur in materials that are **chiral**.\n2.  **Chirality**: A crystal structure (and its corresponding crystal class) is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must not contain any roto-inversion operations, which include a center of inversion (ī) or a mirror plane (m).\n3.  **Achirality**: A crystal class is achiral if it is *not* chiral. This means it *must* contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n4.  **The Contradiction**: You are asking for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity**. By definition, the symmetry required for optical activity is chirality. Therefore, a crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active at the same time. The two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the following Python script will define the sets for achiral, non-polar, and optically active crystal classes and then show that their intersection is an empty set.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies crystal classes based on properties like chirality,\n    polarity, and optical activity, and demonstrates the contradiction in the user's request.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes)\n    all_crystal_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # A crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if and only if it is chiral.\n    # Chiral classes lack a center of inversion (-1) or a mirror plane (m),\n    # which are specific types of roto-inversion axes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # Achiral classes are, by definition, all classes that are NOT chiral (and thus not optically active).\n    achiral_classes = all_crystal_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # Polar classes possess a unique directional axis.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n    non_polar_classes = all_crystal_classes - polar_classes\n\n    # The user asks for the intersection of three sets:\n    # 1. Achiral classes\n    # 2. Non-polar classes\n    # 3. Optically active classes\n    result_set = achiral_classes.intersection(non_polar_classes).intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Crystal Class Properties ---\")\n    print(\"The user's request is to find crystal classes that are simultaneously:\")\n    print(\"1. Achiral (not chiral)\")\n    print(\"2. Non-polar\")\n    print(\"3. Optically Active (must be chiral by definition)\")\n    print(\"\\nThere is a logical contradiction: A crystal class cannot be both Achiral and Optically Active.\")\n    print(\"We will demonstrate this by finding the intersection of the sets.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Set of Achiral Classes ({len(achiral_classes)} total):\")\n    print(sorted(list(achiral_classes)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Set of Non-Polar Classes ({len(non_polar_classes)} total):\")\n    print(sorted(list(non_polar_classes)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Set of Optically Active Classes ({len(optically_active_classes)} total):\")\n    print(sorted(list(optically_active_classes)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation: Intersection of the three sets\")\n    print(\"Result = (Achiral Classes) ∩ (Non-Polar Classes) ∩ (Optically Active Classes)\")\n    \n    # Since the result is an empty set, we represent it as such.\n    # We do not need to print each 'number' as there are none.\n    print(f\"Result = {result_set if result_set else '{}'}\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: As shown, there are no crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\")\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n```\n<<<None>>>"
