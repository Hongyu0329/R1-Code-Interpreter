The pharmacist should advise Allison against taking Excedrin. The aspirin in Excedrin, when taken with Fluoxetine (an SSRI), can increase the risk of bleeding. A safer alternative for her headache would be a product containing only acetaminophen, such as Tylenol.

Additionally, the pharmacist should mention that headaches can be a common side effect of both her birth control (Junel Fe) and her antidepressant (Fluoxetine). She should be advised to monitor her headaches and to contact her doctor if they continue or worsen, as it might be related to her prescription medications.
