    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we need to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of this group.\n\n### My plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of order 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. In the general notation $SD_{2^n}$, we have $n=9$.\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n3.  **Classify Elements and their Subgroups:** The elements of $SD_{2^n}$ can be divided into two main categories, and we will count the distinct cyclic subgroups generated by each.\n    *   **Type 1:** Elements within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_{2^{n-1}}$. The number of subgroups here is the number of divisors of the order $2^{n-1}$, which is $n$.\n    *   **Type 2:** Elements outside $\\langle r \\rangle$, of the form $sr^i$. We need to analyze the orders of these elements and how many distinct cyclic subgroups they generate.\n        *   If $i$ is even, the element $sr^i$ has order 2. There are $2^{n-2}$ such elements, each generating a unique subgroup of order 2.\n        *   If $i$ is odd, the element $sr^i$ has order 4. There are $2^{n-2}$ such elements. Since each cyclic group of order 4 has two generators, these elements form $2^{n-2} / 2 = 2^{n-3}$ distinct subgroups.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these disjoint sets of subgroups. The formula is: Total = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes the group order 512, calculates $n=9$, and applies the formula, printing out each component of the sum before showing the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_semidihedral(group_order):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in a semidihedral group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Find n for the semidihedral group SD_2^n, where order = 2^n.\n    if group_order <= 1 or (group_order & (group_order - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: The group order must be a power of 2 greater than 1.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n    \n    print(f\"For the semidihedral group of order {group_order}, we have n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups is the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\")\n    print(\"We can find this by summing the number of cyclic subgroups of three distinct types.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of cyclic subgroups contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>.\n    # The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order 2^(n-1) is n.\n    subgroups_from_r = n\n    print(f\"1.

They form 2^(n-3) distinct subgroups.\n    subgroups_from_sr_odd = 2**(n - 3)\n    print(f\"3.
