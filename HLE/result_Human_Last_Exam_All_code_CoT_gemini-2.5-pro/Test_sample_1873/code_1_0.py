def calculate_sampling_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the minimum sampling ratio 'r' required to estimate predicate 
    completeness based on the given statistical requirements.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the statistical parameters: confidence level and margin of error (epsilon).
    2. Determine the Z-score for the given confidence level.
    3. Assume a worst-case scenario for the predicate completeness (p=0.5) to ensure 
       the sampling is sufficient for any stratum.
    4. The question asks for a ratio 'r' but does not provide the total population size 'N'.
       We interpret 'r' as the worst-case coefficient of variation (Standard Error / Mean),
       which simplifies to 1/sqrt(n) where 'n' is the required sample size.
    5. This can be calculated directly from the input parameters using the formula:
       r = epsilon / (Z * sqrt(p * (1-p)))
    6. The parameters related to the graph structure (alpha, gamma) are considered
       distractors for this standard sample size calculation model.
