    "Here is my plan to identify the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play:\n\n1.  **Create a Canonical List**: I will first establish a list of the books of the Bible in their standard canonical order (Protestant canon, which would have been the most familiar in Shakespeare's England).\n2.  **Access Shakespeare's Plays**: I need the full text of Shakespeare's plays to perform a search. I will access these texts from the Project Gutenberg archives.\n3.  **Iterative Search**: I will write a Python script to perform the search. The script will:\n    *   Iterate through the list of Bible books, starting with Genesis.\n    *   For each Bible book, it will then iterate through all of Shakespeare's plays.\n    *   It will search the text of each play for the name of the current Bible book. The search will be case-insensitive and look for the name as a whole word to avoid partial matches (e.g., finding \"gene\" in \"generation\" when searching for \"Genesis\").\n4.  **Identify the First Match**: The first time a match is found, the script will stop. The book and the play in which it was found will be the answer, as I am proceeding in canonical order.\n5.  **Extract and Display**: The script will then locate the specific line containing the mention and print the final result, including the book, the play, and the relevant quote.\n\nThis methodical approach ensures that the *very first* book in canonical order is correctly identified.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport ssl\n\n# Bypass SSL verification for environments that might need it.\n# This is sometimes necessary for accessing older resources like Gutenberg.\ntry:\n    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\nexcept AttributeError:\n    pass\nelse:\n    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context\n\ndef find_first_bible_book_in_shakespeare():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name\n    in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of Shakespeare's plays from Project Gutenberg by ID\n    plays = {\n        \"Henry VI, Part 2\": 1113,\n        \"Henry VI, Part 3\": 1114,\n        \"Henry VI, Part 1\": 1112,\n        \"Richard III\": 1503,\n        \"The Comedy of Errors\": 23046,\n        \"Titus Andronicus\": 1789,\n        \"The Taming of the Shrew\": 1508,\n        \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\": 1111,\n        \"Love's Labour's Lost\": 23044,\n        \"Romeo and Juliet\": 1513,\n        \"Richard II\": 1780,\n        \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\": 1514,\n        \"King John\": 1518,\n        \"The Merchant of Venice\": 2243,\n        \"Henry IV, Part 1\": 1782,\n        \"Henry IV, Part 2\": 1783,\n        \"Much Ado About Nothing\": 2240,\n        \"Henry V\": 2252,\n        \"Julius Caesar\": 2263,\n        \"As You Like It\": 1786,\n        \"Twelfth Night\": 1525,\n        \"Hamlet\": 1524,\n        \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\": 1779,\n        \"Troilus and Cressida\": 1790,\n        \"Othello\": 2267,\n        \"All's Well That Ends Well\": 1526,\n        \"Measure for Measure\": 1121,\n        \"King Lear\": 2265,\n        \"Macbeth\": 2264,\n        \"Antony and Cleopatra\": 2266,\n        \"Coriolanus\": 1794,\n        \"Timon of Athens\": 1793,\n        \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\": 2246,\n        \"Cymbeline\": 2248,\n        \"The Winter's Tale\": 1539,\n        \"The Tempest\": 23042,\n        \"Henry VIII\": 1117,\n    }\n\n    # Canonical order of Bible books\n    bible_books = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\", \"Joshua\",\n        \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"Samuel\", \"Kings\", \"Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\",\n        \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\", \"Ecclesiastes\", \"Song of Solomon\",\n        \"Isaiah\", \"Jeremiah\", \"Lamentations\", \"Ezekiel\", \"Daniel\", \"Hosea\",\n        \"Joel\", \"Amos\", \"Obadiah\", \"Jonah\", \"Micah\", \"Nahum\", \"Habakkuk\",\n        \"Zephaniah\", \"Haggai\", \"Zechariah\", \"Malachi\", \"Matthew\", \"Mark\",\n        \"Luke\", \"John\", \"Acts\", \"Romans\", \"Corinthians\", \"Galatians\",\n        \"Ephesians\", \"Philippians\", \"Colossians\", \"Thessalonians\", \"Timothy\",\n        \"Titus\", \"Philemon\", \"Hebrews\", \"James\", \"Peter\", \"Jude\", \"Revelation\"\n    ]\n\n    for book in bible_books:\n        # The pattern looks for the book name as a whole word, case-insensitive\n        pattern = re.compile(r'\\b' + re.escape(book) + r'\\b', re.IGNORECASE)\n\n        for play_title, play_id in plays.items():\n            try:\n                # Fetch play text from Project Gutenberg\n                url = f\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{play_id}/pg{play_id}.txt\"\n                response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n                response.raise_for_status()\n                text = response.text\n            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n                # Silently continue if a single play fails to download\n                continue\n\n            # Split text into lines to find the exact line\n            lines = text.splitlines()\n            for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n                match = pattern.search(line)\n                if match:\n                    # To provide context, find the speaker if possible\n                    speaker = \"\"\n                    # Look backwards for a line in all caps ending with a period, a common speaker format\n                    for j in range(i - 1, max(i - 10, -1), -1):\n                        prev_line = lines[j].strip()\n                        if prev_line.isupper() and prev_line.endswith(('.', ' ')):\n                            speaker = prev_line.strip('.
