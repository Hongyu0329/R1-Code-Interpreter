    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  First, I will convert each Roman numeral in the equation (XXIV, CIII, CMXCIX) into its corresponding modern Arabic number.\n    *   XXIV = 10 + 10 + (5 - 1) = 24\n    *   CIII = 100 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 103\n    *   CMXCIX = (1000 - 100) + (100 - 10) + (10 - 1) = 900 + 90 + 9 = 999\n2.  Next, I will substitute these modern numbers back into the original equation, which becomes `24 / 103 - 999`.\n3.  Finally, I will use a Python script to calculate the result of this expression, following the standard order of operations (division before subtraction), and print the full equation along with its solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the modern numbers corresponding to the Roman numerals\nnum1 = 24  # XXIV\nnum2 = 103  # CIII\nnum3 = 999  # CMXCIX\n\n# Perform the calculation following the order of operations\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation with the modern numbers and the final result\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-998.7669902912622>>>"
