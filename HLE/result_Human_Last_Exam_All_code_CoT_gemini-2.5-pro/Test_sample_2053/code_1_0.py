    Solves the three-part question about dessins d'enfants.

    (a) Is it true that |D_2(N, h)| = sum_{u in D_N} 1/u * sum_{n in D_u^*} 1/n * mu(u/n) * Upsilon_{N, h, n}?
    (b) Is it true that for any r in D_N, |D_{2,r}(N, h)| = r/N * sum_{n in D_{N/r}^*} mu(n/(Nr)) * Upsilon_{N, h, n}?
    (c) Suppose N = 8 and h = 4. What is |D_2(8, 4)|?
