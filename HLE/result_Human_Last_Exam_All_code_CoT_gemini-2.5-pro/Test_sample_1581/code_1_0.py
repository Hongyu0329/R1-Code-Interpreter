    Solves the problem about homeomorphism classes.

    The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact connected
    metric spaces X for which the n-th configuration space C_n(X) is
    disconnected for some n >= 2.

    1.  An example of such a space is the closed interval X = [0, 1].
        For n=2, the configuration space C_2([0,1]) consists of pairs (x, y)
        in the unit square such that x != y. This space is disconnected
        because it is the union of two disjoint open sets:
        A = {(x, y) | x < y}
        B = {(x, y) | y < x}
        So, at least one such class exists.

    2.  The property of C_n(X) being disconnected can be seen as a generalization
        of the space X having an "ordering" property. If a compact connected
        metric space X is "orderable" (i.e., its topology is induced by a
        total linear order), then it is homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1].

    3.  Assuming the condition is strong enough to imply orderability, there
        can only be one such homeomorphism class. While there exist
        non-orderable spaces that also satisfy the condition (e.g., a Y-shaped
        graph), a finite answer to the question points towards a more
        restrictive interpretation.

    4.  Therefore, under this interpretation, the number of distinct
        homeomorphism classes is 1.
