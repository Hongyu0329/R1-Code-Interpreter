# Step 1: Define the parameters for the product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

# R is the number of rings.
R = 1

# A is the number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 carbons + 2 oxygens).
A = 8

# B is the number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.
# (5 in the ring + 1 connecting the group + 2 in the group)
B = 8

# Step 2: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity using the formula BC = R * (A^2 / B).
bottcher_complexity = R * (A**2 / B)

# Step 3: Print the final equation with the calculated values and the result.
print("The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated using the formula: R * (A^2 / B)")
