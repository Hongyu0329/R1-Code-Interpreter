    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of a cyclic α-halo ketone, such as 2-chlorocyclohexanone, results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-chlorocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n\n2.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** The Böttcher Molecular Complexity index (BC) is calculated using the formula:\n    `BC = R * (A² / B)`\n    Where:\n    *   `R` is the number of rings in the molecule.\n    *   `A` is the number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `B` is the number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Calculate R, A, and B for Cyclopentanecarboxylic Acid:**\n    *   **R (Rings):** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid has one cyclopentane ring. So, `R = 1`.\n    *   **A (Non-hydrogen atoms):** The formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. There are 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `A = 6 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   **B (Non-hydrogen bonds):** We count the bonds connecting the 8 non-hydrogen atoms:\n        *   5 C-C bonds forming the cyclopentane ring.\n        *   1 C-C bond connecting the carboxylic acid group to the ring.\n        *   1 C=O double bond and 1 C-O single bond within the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   Total bonds: `B = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will now use a Python script to compute the complexity based on these values.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for the product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n# R is the number of rings.\nR = 1\n\n# A is the number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 carbons + 2 oxygens).\nA = 8\n\n# B is the number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.\n# (5 in the ring + 1 connecting the group + 2 in the group)\nB = 8\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity using the formula BC = R * (A^2 / B).\nbottcher_complexity = R * (A**2 / B)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation with the calculated values and the result.\nprint(\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated using the formula: R * (A^2 / B)\")\nprint(f\"For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid:\")\nprint(f\"Number of rings (R) = {R}\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen atoms (A) = {A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen bonds (B) = {B}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"{R} * ({A}^2 / {B}) = {bottcher_complexity}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is: {bottcher_complexity}\")\n```\n<<<8.0>>>"
