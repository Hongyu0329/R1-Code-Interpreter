    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will execute the following plan:\n\n1.  **Parse the SMILES String**: The first step is to interpret the provided SMILES string, which represents the 2D chemical structure of the molecule. I will use the `rdkit` library, a powerful tool for cheminformatics.\n2.  **Generate a 3D Structure**: Symmetry is a property of a 3D object. I will convert the 2D representation into a 3D model. This involves generating an initial 3D conformation and then using a molecular mechanics force field (MMFF94) to optimize the geometry into a stable, low-energy state. It's critical to add hydrogen atoms to the structure, as their positions are essential for an accurate symmetry assessment.\n3.  **Analyze Symmetry**: Once I have the optimized 3D coordinates of all atoms, I will use the `pymatgen` library. This library is designed for materials analysis and contains a robust `PointGroupAnalyzer` tool. I will feed the atomic species and their 3D coordinates into this analyzer.\n4.  **Identify and Output the Point Group**: The `PointGroupAnalyzer` will computationally find all symmetry elements (like rotation axes and mirror planes) and determine the molecule's point group. The final code will then print this point group symbol.\n\n```python\n# First, please ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n# pip install rdkit pymatgen\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nfrom pymatgen.core import Molecule\nfrom pymatgen.symmetry.analyzer import PointGroupAnalyzer\n\ndef find_molecule_symmetry(smiles_string: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the point group symmetry of a molecule from its SMILES string.\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string: The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Parse the SMILES string using RDKit\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if not mol:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse the SMILES string: {smiles_string}\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Generate a 3D structure\n    # Add hydrogens, which are crucial for correct symmetry determination\n    mol_with_hs = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Embed the molecule in 3D space\n    # Using ETKDGv3 for better handling of complex/symmetric molecules\n    params = AllChem.ETKDGv3()\n    params.randomSeed = 42 # for reproducibility\n    try:\n        AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol_with_hs, params)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Could not generate 3D conformation for the molecule.\")\n        return\n\n    # Optimize the geometry using a force field to get a realistic structure\n    try:\n        AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(mol_with_hs)\n    except Exception:\n        # Fallback to UFF if MMFF fails\n        AllChem.UFFOptimizeMolecule(mol_with_hs)\n\n    # Step 3: Prepare data for Pymatgen\n    # Extract atom symbols and their 3D coordinates\n    conformer = mol_with_hs.GetConformer()\n    atom_symbols = [atom.GetSymbol() for atom in mol_with_hs.GetAtoms()]\n    coordinates = conformer.GetPositions()\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze symmetry using Pymatgen\n    # Create a Pymatgen Molecule object\n    pmg_mol = Molecule(species=atom_symbols, coords=coordinates)\n\n    # Use the PointGroupAnalyzer.
