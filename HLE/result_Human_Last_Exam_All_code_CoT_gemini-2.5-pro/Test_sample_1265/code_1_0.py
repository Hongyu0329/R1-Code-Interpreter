    print("Key Principles for Success:")
    print("1. Maximize the 'Signal': The signal is the presence of the rare allele in the sequencing reads.")
    print("   - Strategy: Increase sequencing depth. Going from 40X to 80X makes it more likely to read the rare allele.")
    print("2. Minimize the 'Noise': The noise is errors introduced during library preparation and sequencing.")
    print("   - Strategy 1: Use a thorough, high-quality library preparation protocol to prevent introducing errors before sequencing.")
    print("   - Strategy 2: Use a high-accuracy sequencing platform. For single nucleotide variants (SNVs), Illumina's low error rate (~0.1%) is superior to MinION's higher error rate (1-5%).\n")

    print("Evaluation of Answer Choices:")
    print("- A: 'Conduct a thorough library preparation and increase the sequencing depth from 40X to 80X...'.")
    print("   - Analysis: This option directly addresses both key principles: minimizing noise (thorough library prep) and maximizing signal (increased depth) using standard high-accuracy methods. This is the strongest approach.")
    print("\n- B, C, E: These options all suggest using MinION.")
    print("   - Analysis: While MinION produces long reads, its higher error rate makes it unsuitable for detecting low-frequency SNVs. The rate of sequencing errors could be higher than the frequency of the allele itself, making results unreliable.")
    print("\n- D: 'Perform a quality check method...'.")
    print("   - Analysis: A quality check is a necessary step in any pipeline, but it is a downstream analysis. A 'thorough library preparation' (Option A) is the proactive, upstream step that ensures high-quality data in the first place.\n")
    
    print("Conclusion: Option A presents the most fundamental and effective strategy for this specific task.")
