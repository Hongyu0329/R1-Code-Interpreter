    "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume division (3375 / 9 = 375) gives an upper bound, but it doesn't account for the geometry of packing.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Decomposition Strategy:** The most effective method for this kind of packing problem is to decompose the larger container (the cube) into smaller boxes (cuboids) based on the dimensions of the block being packed.\n2.  **Decompose the Edge:** The block's longest dimension is 9. The cube's edge is 15. We can express 15 in terms of 9: `15 = 1 * 9 + 6`.\n3.  **Decompose the Cube:** We can use this decomposition to break the 15x15x15 cube into 8 smaller cuboids, as if it were an expanded algebraic expression `(9+6) * (9+6) * (9+6)`. This gives us:\n    *   One 9x9x9 cuboid\n    *   Three 9x9x6 cuboids\n    *   Three 9x6x6 cuboids\n    *   One 6x6x6 cuboid\n4.  **Calculate Blocks per Cuboid:** We will calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into each of these smaller cuboids. A block can only fit if one of the cuboid's dimensions is at least 9.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each of the 8 cuboids.\n\nThe following Python code implements this strategy to find the maximum number of blocks.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_dims, block_dims):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of blocks that can be packed into a cuboid.\n    It checks all 6 possible orientations of the block.\n    \"\"\"\n    from itertools import permutations\n    \n    max_blocks = 0\n    # Check every permutation of the block's dimensions\n    for p in set(permutations(block_dims)):\n        if p[0] <= cuboid_dims[0] and p[1] <= cuboid_dims[1] and p[2] <= cuboid_dims[2]:\n            num_blocks = (math.floor(cuboid_dims[0] / p[0]) *\n                          math.floor(cuboid_dims[1] / p[1]) *\n                          math.floor(cuboid_dims[2] / p[2]))\n            if num_blocks > max_blocks:\n                max_blocks = num_blocks\n    return max_blocks\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of packing 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_dim = 15\n    block_dims = (9, 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"Finding the largest number of {block_dims[0]}x{block_dims[1]}x{block_dims[2]} blocks in a {cube_dim}x{cube_dim}x{cube_dim} cube.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Decompose the cube based on the block's largest dimension.\")\n    large_part = block_dims[0]\n    small_part = cube_dim % large_part\n    print(f\"The cube's edge length {cube_dim} is decomposed into: {cube_dim} = 1 * {large_part} + {small_part}\")\n\n    # These are the sub-cuboids resulting from the (9+6)^3 decomposition, and their counts\n    sub_cuboids = {\n        (9, 9, 9): 1,\n        (9, 9, 6): 3,\n        (9, 6, 6): 3,\n        (6, 6, 6): 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate how many blocks fit into each type of sub-cuboid.\")\n    total_blocks = 0\n    calculation_parts = []\n    \n    for dims, count in sub_cuboids.items():\n        blocks_in_one = calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(dims, block_dims)\n        total_for_type = blocks_in_one * count\n        total_blocks += total_for_type\n        print(f\"- For the {count} cuboid(s) of size {dims[0]}x{dims[1]}x{dims[2]}:\")\n        print(f\"  {blocks_in_one} blocks fit in each.\")\n        calculation_parts.append(f\"{blocks_in_one} * {count}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Sum the blocks from all sub-cuboids.\")\n    \n    final_equation = \" + \".join(calculation_parts)\n    \n    # To show the intermediate products before the final sum\n    intermediate_sums = []\n    for part in calculation_parts:\n        # Evaluate \"num * count\"\n        intermediate_sums.append(str(eval(part)))\n        \n    print(f\"Total blocks = {final_equation}\")\n    print(f\"             = {' + '.join(intermediate_sums)}\")\n    print(f\"             = {total_blocks}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe largest number of blocks is {total_blocks}.\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n<<<351>>>\n```"
