def calculate_sixth_mass_squared():
    """
    This function calculates the squared mass of the 6th degree of freedom
    based on the given squared mass of the other 5.

    In the theory of linearized gravity with a mass term -m^2 h_uv h^uv / 2,
    there are 6 propagating degrees of freedom. Let the parameter in the
    Lagrangian be mu^2, and the given mass of the 5 modes be M_5^2.

    The derivation shows that:
    - The squared mass of the 5 spin-2 modes is M_5^2 = 2 * mu^2.
    - The squared mass of the 1 scalar mode is M_1^2 = -mu^2.

    This gives the relation M_1^2 = -M_5^2 / 2.
    The problem states M_5^2 is m^2. We will calculate M_1^2.
