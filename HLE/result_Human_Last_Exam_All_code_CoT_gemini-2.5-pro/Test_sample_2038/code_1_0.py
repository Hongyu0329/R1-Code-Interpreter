    This script finds the number of 2-bridge knots with crossing number at most 13
    that admit two disjoint non-parallel embedded minimal genus Seifert surfaces.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Identify the family of knots: These are 2-bridge knots of the form K(4k+1, 2k) for k >= 1.
    2. Determine their crossing number: For this family, the crossing number is c(k) = 2 + 2k.
    3. Apply the constraint: We need to find the number of positive integers k where c(k) <= 13.
    4. Count the solutions: The script will loop through k, check the condition, and count the valid knots.
