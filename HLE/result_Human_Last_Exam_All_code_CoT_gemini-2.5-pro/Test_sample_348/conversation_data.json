    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. After finding the equilibrium price (P_e) and quantity (Q_e), we can calculate the Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). The total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** Set the supply and demand equations equal to each other (`Supply(Q) = Demand(Q)`) and solve for the equilibrium quantity, `Q_e`. Since this equation is complex, we will use a numerical solver. Once `Q_e` is found, we can find the equilibrium price, `P_e`, by plugging `Q_e` into either function.\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** CS is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. It is calculated with the formula:\n    `CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)`\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** PS is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`. The formula for PS is:\n    `PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[from 2^(1/3) to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare (TW):** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus:\n    `TW = CS + PS`\n\nWe will use Python with the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the demand function\n    def demand(Q_D):\n        \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))\"\"\"\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q_D))\n\n    # Define the supply function\n    def supply(Q_S):\n        \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n        # The function is defined for Q_S^3 - 2 > 0.\n        # We add a condition to handle values outside the domain for the solver.\n        if np.any(Q_S**3 <= 2):\n            return np.inf\n        return np.log(Q_S**3 - 2)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the Market Equilibrium ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the market equilibrium point (Q_e, P_e).\")\n    \n    # Define the equation to find the equilibrium quantity where Demand(Q) = Supply(Q)\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        return demand(Q) - supply(Q)\n\n    # Use a numerical solver (fsolve) to find the root, which is Q_e.\n    # An initial guess of 4.5 is used based on preliminary analysis.\n    initial_guess_Q = 4.5\n    Q_e_solution = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, x0=initial_guess_Q)\n    Q_e = Q_e_solution[0]\n\n    # Calculate the equilibrium price (P_e) using the demand function\n    P_e = demand(Q_e)\n    \n    print(f\"   Equilibrium Quantity (Q_e): {Q_e:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"   Equilibrium Price (P_e): {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS) ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating Consumer Surplus (CS).\")\n    # CS = Integral of Demand(Q) from 0 to Q_e - (P_e * Q_e)\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_e)\n    consumer_surplus = integral_demand - (P_e * Q_e)\n    print(f\"   Consumer Surplus = (Integral of Demand from 0 to {Q_e:.2f}) - ({P_e:.2f} * {Q_e:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"   Consumer Surplus = {integral_demand:.4f} - {P_e * Q_e:.4f} = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Producer Surplus (PS) ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating Producer Surplus (PS).\")\n    # The supply curve starts where Q^3 - 2 > 0, so Q_min = 2^(1/3)\n    Q_min = np.cbrt(2)\n    # PS = (P_e * Q_e) - Integral of Supply(Q) from Q_min to Q_e\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply, Q_min, Q_e)\n    producer_surplus = (P_e * Q_e) - integral_supply\n    print(f\"   Producer Surplus = ({P_e:.2f} * {Q_e:.2f}) - (Integral of Supply from {Q_min:.2f} to {Q_e:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"   Producer Surplus = {P_e * Q_e:.4f} - {integral_supply:.4f} = {producer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate Total Welfare (TW) ---\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculating Total Welfare (TW).\")\n    total_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n    \n    # Final output showing the equation\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f} = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<44.4098>>>"
