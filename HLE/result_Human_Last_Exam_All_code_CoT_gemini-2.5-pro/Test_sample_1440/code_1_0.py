def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem about the number of equivalence classes in a continuum.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of equivalence classes defined by the relation:
    x ~ y if x and y are contained in some nowhere dense subcontinuum of X.

    The continuum X has two properties:
    1.  Hereditarily Unicoherent: The intersection of any two subcontinua is connected or empty.
    2.  Irreducible: There exist points a, b such that X is the only subcontinuum containing them.

    Reasoning:
    1.  Lower Bound is 2: The points a and b cannot be in the same class. If they were, the subcontinuum containing them would have to be X itself (by property 2). But X is not nowhere dense in X. So, [a] != [b].
    2.  Lower Bound is 3: For any point x, X can be decomposed into I(a,x) U I(b,x), where I(p,q) is the unique irreducible subcontinuum between p and q. The class [a] consists of points x where I(a,x) is nowhere dense. The class [b] consists of points x where I(b,x) is nowhere dense. It is a known result in continuum theory that for any such space X, there must exist at least one point x where BOTH I(a,x) and I(b,x) have non-empty interiors. Such a point x cannot belong to [a] or [b], so it must belong to a third class.
    3.  Upper Bound is 3: An example exists with exactly 3 classes (the "double sine curve" continuum, formed by joining two sine curves at their limit bar). The classes are the left curve, the right curve, and the central limit bar.

    Conclusion: The smallest possible number is 3.
