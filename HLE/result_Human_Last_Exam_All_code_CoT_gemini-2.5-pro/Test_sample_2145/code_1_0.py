# Step 1: Solve each trivia question to find the four key answers.
# The answer to question (1) is "Ray". The musical chord sequence points to the biopic of the musician Ray Charles.
# The answer to question (2) is "Enemies". This fits the context of Stalinist films and religious diagrams of Hell.
# The answer to question (3) is "ALF". The cat-based dishes are a direct reference to the show's main running gag.
# The answer to question (4) is "Lion King". The villain Scar's plot to kill the king is a classic coup d'Ã©tat.

answer1 = "Ray"
answer2 = "Enemies"
answer3 = "ALF"
answer4 = "Lion King"

# Step 2: Extract the first letter from each answer.
letter1 = answer1[0]
letter2 = answer2[0]
letter3 = answer3[0]
letter4 = answer4[0]

# Step 3: Combine the letters to reveal the hidden word.
hidden_word = letter1 + letter2 + letter3 + letter4

# Step 4: Print the final result in an equation format, showing each component letter.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as "output each letter".
print("The hidden word is revealed by combining the first letter of each answer:")
print(f"{letter1} + {letter2} + {letter3} + {letter4} = {hidden_word}")
