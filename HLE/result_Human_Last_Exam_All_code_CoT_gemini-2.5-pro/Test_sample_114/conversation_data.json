    "Of course. I will help you solve this by analyzing key passages from Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\".\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the list of potential words: `Wente`, `Here`, `Fool`, `Hool`, and `Countour`.\n2.  For each word, I will check the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" to see if it forms a rhyming pair with another word. The poem is largely written in rhyming couplets.\n3.  I will present the rhyming pairs I find as evidence. To satisfy the prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will show the approximate line numbers and the words involved in a simple formula format.\n4.  For the word that does not have a rhyme, I will show its context at the end of a line, demonstrating the lack of a rhyming partner.\n5.  Based on this evidence, I will identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_unrhymed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes rhyming patterns in Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n    to find which word from a given list is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing rhymes in Chaucer's 'The Book of the Duchess'...\\n\")\n\n    # A.
