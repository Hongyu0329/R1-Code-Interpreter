    "This is a problem in point-set topology. The answer can be determined through a series of logical deductions about the properties of the spaces involved. I will provide a Python script that explains the steps of this deduction to find the upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the subset $U$**: I'll use the properties of $U$ (open, dense, and locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$) to determine its own cardinality and topological properties. This will establish that $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold and is separable.\n2.  **Relate properties of $U$ to $X$**: I'll show that because $U$ is a dense and separable subset of $X$, the space $X$ must also be separable.\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of $X$**: Using the fact that $X$ is a separable metric space, I'll establish an upper bound on its cardinality. I will show that any such space must have a cardinality less than or equal to that of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n4.  **Conclude the result**: By combining the lower bound on the cardinality of $X$ (from $|U| \\le |X|$) and the upper bound found in the previous step, I will determine the precise cardinality of $X$ and state the upper bound.\n\nThe script below will execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step mathematical proof to determine the\n    upper bound on the cardinality of the space X.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the dense open subset U.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The problem states that U is an open subset of X where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line R.\")\n    print(\"This means U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold without boundary.\")\n    print(\"The classification of connected 1-manifolds tells us U must be homeomorphic to either R (the real line) or S^1 (the circle).\")\n    print(\"The cardinality of both R and S^1 is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as c or |R|.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, |U| = c.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Showing that the space X is separable.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A space is 'separable' if it contains a countable dense subset.\")\n    print(\"First, U is a 1-manifold.
