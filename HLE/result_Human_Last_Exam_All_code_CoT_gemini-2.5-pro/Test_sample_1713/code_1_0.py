# Define the economic variables with example values that satisfy P < AVC < ATC.
# Let's assume the firm is producing at an output level q_1.
q_1 = 50  # units of output

# The problem states P = MC < AVC < ATC. Let's assign values accordingly.
P = 10  # Market Price ($ per unit)
MC = 10 # Marginal Cost ($ per unit)
AVC = 12 # Average Variable Cost ($ per unit)
ATC = 15 # Average Total Cost ($ per unit)

# 1. Calculate the area S, which represents Total Revenue (TR).
# S is the area of the rectangle with height P and width q_1.
S = P * q_1

# 2. Calculate the area H, which represents Total Cost (TC).
# H is the area of the rectangle with height ATC and width q_1.
H = ATC * q_1

# 3. The firm's profit (or loss) is Total Revenue minus Total Cost (TR - TC).
# In terms of the defined areas, this is S - H.
profit_or_loss = S - H

# 4. The area representing the profit or loss is the difference between the areas
# representing total revenue and total cost.
# A negative result indicates a loss. The area of the loss is H - S.
