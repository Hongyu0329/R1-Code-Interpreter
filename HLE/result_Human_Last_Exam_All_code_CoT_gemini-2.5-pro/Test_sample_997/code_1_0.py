    Solves the sequential game for Agent C's optimal strategy.

    The logic proceeds by backward induction:
    1. Agent A (last) will always pick the best available option to win.
    2. Agent B (middle) knows this and will pick the best option (w=0, p=1) if available, to prevent A from winning.
    3. Agent C (first) knows this and must pick the best option (w=0, p=1) to prevent B and A from winning.
