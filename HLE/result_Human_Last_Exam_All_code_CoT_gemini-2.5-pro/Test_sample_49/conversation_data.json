    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the f-vector, denoted as (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), for a specific type of 4-dimensional polytope. The f-vector components represent the number of vertices (f₀), edges (f₁,), 2-faces (f₂), and 3-faces (facets, f₃).\n\nThe properties of the polytope are:\n1.  It is a 4-polytope (dimension d=4).\n2.  It has 6 vertices (f₀ = 6).\n3.  It is non-simplicial, meaning at least one of its facets is not a simplex (a tetrahedron, in this case).\n4.  It has the maximal number of 2-faces (f₂) possible for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find the f-vector:\n\n1.  **Identify the Polytope:** The Upper Bound Theorem tells us that the absolute maximum number of faces of any dimension for a polytope with a given number of vertices is achieved by a simplicial polytope (specifically, the cyclic polytope). Therefore, the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" for a *non-simplicial* polytope refers to the maximum within that specific class. By consulting the complete classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, the non-simplicial one with the highest f₂ is known to be the **pyramid over a square pyramid**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Base Polytope:** The construction starts with a 3D **square pyramid**. We first need its f-vector.\n    *   Vertices (f₀_base): A square base (4) + one apex (1) = 5.\n    *   Edges (f₁_base): Edges of the square base (4) + edges from the apex to each base vertex (4) = 8.\n    *   2-Faces (f₂_base): The square base (1) + four triangular sides (4) = 5.\n\n3.  **Apply the Pyramid Construction:** To get the 4-polytope, we construct a pyramid over the 3D square pyramid. This involves adding a new apex in the 4th dimension. The f-vector of the resulting 4-polytope is calculated from the f-vector of its 3D base using the following formulas:\n    *   `f₀ = f₀_base + 1`\n    *   `f₁ = f₁_base + f₀_base`\n    *   `f₂ = f₂_base + f₁_base`\n    *   `f₃ = f₂_base + 1` (The facets are the base itself plus new pyramids over each face of the base).\n\n4.  **Verify the Result:** We will check if the calculated f-vector satisfies the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes: `f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the f-vector.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the f-vector for the base of the polytope, which is a 3D square pyramid.\n# 2. Use the pyramid construction formulas to calculate the f-vector of the final 4-polytope.\n# 3. Print the resulting f-vector and verify it with the Euler-Poincaré formula.\n\n# Step 1: Define the f-vector of the base (a square pyramid).\n# A square pyramid has 5 vertices, 8 edges, and 5 faces.\nf0_base = 5\nf1_base = 8\nf2_base = 5\n\nprint(f\"The base is a square pyramid with f-vector (vertices, edges, faces): ({f0_base}, {f1_base}, {f2_base})\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the f-vector of the 4-polytope (pyramid over the square pyramid).\nf0 = f0_base + 1          # Vertices\nf1 = f1_base + f0_base      # Edges\nf2 = f2_base + f1_base      # 2-Faces\nf3 = f2_base + 1          # 3-Faces (Facets)\n\nprint(\"The f-vector of the resulting 4-polytope is (f0, f1, f2, f3).\")\nprint(f\"f0 (vertices) = {f0}\")\nprint(f\"f1 (edges)    = {f1}\")\nprint(f\"f2 (2-faces)  = {f2}\")\nprint(f\"f3 (facets)   = {f3}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Verify with the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes (f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0).\neuler_char = f0 - f1 + f2 - f3\nprint(\"Checking the Euler-Poincaré formula for a 4-polytope:\")\nprint(f\"f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = {f0} - {f1} + {f2} - {f3} = {euler_char}\")\n\nif euler_char == 0:\n    print(\"The formula is satisfied.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The formula is NOT satisfied.\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The final f-vector is ({f0}, {f1}, {f2}, {f3}).\")\n\n```\n<<<(6, 13, 13, 6)>>>"
