    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the connectome data from Witvliet et al., 2021. This dataset provides a comprehensive map of synaptic connections in the adult hermaphrodite.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use a Python script to access this data via the `celegans-connectome` library.\n2.  The script will first filter the full connectome to find all outgoing connections from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Since the question asks for the main target \"cell,\" it's most informative to consider neuron classes (e.g., the AIY class, which includes AIYL and AIYR). I will group the target neurons by their class.\n4.  Next, I will sum the synapse counts for each target neuron class to find the total strength of the projection.\n5.  Finally, the script will identify the neuron class with the highest total synapse count and print this result. To satisfy the request to show all numbers, it will also display the individual synapse counts that contribute to this total in the form of an equation.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n# pip install celegans-connectome pandas\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport celegans_connectome as ce\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the C. elegans connectome to find the main synaptic\n    target of the ASJ neuron class.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Load the neuron-to-neuron synapse data from the Witvliet et al. 2021 dataset.\n        # This dataset is a comprehensive connectome of an adult C. elegans hermaphrodite.\n        print(\"Loading C. elegans connectome data (Witvliet et al., 2021)...\")\n        connectome_df = ce.get_connectome_data('witvliet_2021', 'neuron_to_neuron_synapses')\n        print(\"Data loaded successfully.\")\n\n        # Filter the data to get all connections originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n        asj_outputs = connectome_df[connectome_df['pre_cell'].isin(['ASJL', 'ASJR'])].copy()\n\n        # Define a function to determine the neuron class from a specific neuron name\n        # (e.g., 'AIYL' -> 'AIY', 'AVAL' -> 'AVA').\n        def get_cell_class(cell_name):\n            if cell_name.endswith('L') or cell_name.endswith('R'):\n                # For paired neurons, the class is the name without the L/R suffix.\n                return cell_name[:-1]\n            # For unpaired neurons, the class is the name itself.\n            return cell_name\n\n        # Create a new column for the postsynaptic cell class to group the targets.\n        asj_outputs['post_cell_class'] = asj_outputs['post_cell'].apply(get_cell_class)\n\n        # Group by the target cell class and sum the synapse counts ('N').\n        target_class_synapses = asj_outputs.groupby('post_cell_class')['N'].sum()\n\n        # Find the target class that receives the maximum number of synapses.\n        main_target_class = target_class_synapses.idxmax()\n        max_synapses = target_class_synapses.max()\n\n        print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the '{main_target_class}' neuron class.\")\n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n        # To show the final equation, we find the individual connections to this target class.\n        print(f\"This is based on the following synaptic connections from ASJ to the {main_target_class} class:\")\n        \n        # Filter for connections to the main target class\n        main_target_connections = asj_outputs[asj_outputs['post_cell_class'] == main_target_class]\n        \n        # Get the individual connection counts\n        connection_counts = main_target_connections.groupby(['pre_cell', 'post_cell'])['N'].sum()\n        \n        equation_parts = []\n        for (pre_cell, post_cell), count in connection_counts.items():\n            print(f\"- Synapses from {pre_cell} to {post_cell}: {count}\")\n            equation_parts.append(str(count))\n\n        # Format and print the final equation.\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"\\nThe final equation for the total synapse count is:\")\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = {max_synapses}\")\n\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nAn error occurred.
