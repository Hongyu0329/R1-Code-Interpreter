    print("Step 1: Understanding Ammonia Inversion Tunneling")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("In a normal ammonia molecule (NH3), the Nitrogen atom can be on one of two sides of the plane formed by the three Hydrogen atoms.")
    print("These two positions are separated by a potential energy barrier.")
    print("Quantum mechanically, the Nitrogen atom can 'tunnel' through this barrier even without enough energy to overcome it classically.")
    print("This tunneling splits the ground vibrational state into two closely spaced energy levels (a symmetric and an antisymmetric state). The energy difference between them is the tunneling frequency.")
    print("This phenomenon depends on the potential energy surface (determined by electronic structure) and the masses of the atoms.\n")

    print("Step 2: Particle Statistics - Fermions vs. Bosons")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("Identical particles in quantum mechanics are indistinguishable and are classified by their spin:")
    print(" - Fermions: Have half-integer spin (e.g., 1/2, 3/2...). The total wavefunction of a system of identical fermions must be ANTISYMMETRIC when two particles are exchanged.")
    print(" - Bosons: Have integer spin (e.g., 0, 1, 2...). The total wavefunction of a system of identical bosons must be SYMMETRIC when two particles are exchanged.\n")

    print("Step 3: Comparing Ordinary and Exotic Ammonia")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print(" - Ordinary Hydrogen (Proton): Has nuclear spin 1/2. It is a FERMION.")
    print(" - Exotic Hydrogen: Is defined to have nuclear spin 0. It is a BOSON.")
    print("This means for ordinary NH3, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric upon exchange of two H atoms.")
    print("For exotic N(H_exotic)3, the total wavefunction must be symmetric upon exchange of two H_exotic atoms.\n")

    print("Step 4: Does the Symmetry Requirement Prevent Tunneling?")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("The fundamental cause of tunneling—the shape of the potential energy barrier—is determined by the electronic configuration and charges of the nuclei. These are UNCHANGED in the exotic molecule.")
    print("The mass of the tunneling system is also unchanged.")
    print("The rules of quantum statistics (Fermion/Boson symmetry) act as 'selection rules'. They don't forbid the tunneling itself, but they dictate which combinations of vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin states are physically allowed to exist.")
    print("In both ordinary and exotic ammonia, it is possible to construct total wavefunctions of the required symmetry (antisymmetric for ordinary, symmetric for exotic) that correspond to *both* levels of the tunneling doublet.")
    print("Therefore, the splitting of energy levels due to tunneling still occurs.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion")
    print("----------------")
    print("The change from fermionic to bosonic hydrogens alters the selection rules for allowed rotational states, but it does not eliminate the underlying physical mechanism of tunneling. The exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling, with a frequency almost identical to that of ordinary ammonia.")
