# Plan:
# 1. The goal is to find the simplest model (most parsimonious) that optimally predicts y from x.
# 2. A visual inspection of the data suggests an increasing but concave relationship (it rises, but the rate of rising slows down).
# 3. This pattern suggests a function like y = a*sqrt(x) + b.
# 4. Analysis of several models (linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and square root) shows that the square root model
#    provides the best fit (highest R-squared value) while remaining parsimonious with only two parameters.
# 5. This script calculates the parameters 'a' and 'b' for this model and prints the final equation
#    with values rounded to 3 significant digits.
