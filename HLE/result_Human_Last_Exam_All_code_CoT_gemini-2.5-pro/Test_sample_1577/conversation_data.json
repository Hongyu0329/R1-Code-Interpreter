    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to understand how boundaries affect the number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the System's Topology:** The problem describes a system with `n` smooth and `m` rough \"holes\". This is typically interpreted as holes punched into an infinite 2D plane. Topologically, an infinite plane is equivalent to a disk. A disk has an outer boundary. Therefore, the total number of boundaries is `n + m + 1`.\n\n2.  **Determine the GSD Formula:** The ground space degeneracy of the toric code on a surface is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits depends on the genus (`g`) of the surface and the number and type of its boundaries. For a surface with genus `g`, `N_s` smooth boundaries, and `N_r` rough boundaries, a known formula for the number of logical qubits `k` is `k = 2g + N_s + N_r - 1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Our Case:**\n    *   A plane or disk has a genus `g = 0`.\n    *   We have `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. Let's assume the outer boundary of the plane/disk is also one of these types.\n    *   **Case 1 (Outer boundary is smooth):** The total number of smooth boundaries is `N_s = n + 1`. The total number of rough boundaries is `N_r = m`.\n        Plugging this into the formula:\n        `k = 2*0 + (n + 1) + m - 1 = n + m`.\n    *   **Case 2 (Outer boundary is rough):** The total number of smooth boundaries is `N_s = n`. The total number of rough boundaries is `N_r = m + 1`.\n        Plugging this into the formula:\n        `k = 2*0 + n + (m + 1) - 1 = n + m`.\n    *   In both cases, the number of logical qubits is `k = n + m`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Degeneracy:** The ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** This result, `2^(n+m)`, corresponds to answer choice A.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that uses this formula to calculate the degeneracy for example values of `n` and `m` and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_toric_code_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Example values for the number of holes\n    n = 3  # number of smooth holes\n    m = 2  # number of rough holes\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the topology.\")\n    print(\"The system is a 2D plane (genus g=0) with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\")\n    print(\"This implies a total of n+m+1 boundaries, including the outer boundary of the plane.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: State the formula for the number of logical qubits (k).\")\n    print(\"The formula is k = 2*g + N_s + N_r - 1, where N_s and N_r are the total counts of smooth and rough boundaries.\")\n    print(\"Assuming the outer boundary is smooth, N_s = n+1 and N_r = m.\")\n    print(f\"k = 2*0 + ({n}+1) + {m} - 1 = {n+m}\")\n    print(\"The result is the same if the outer boundary is rough.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: State the formula for Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD).\")\n    print(\"GSD = 2^k = 2^(n + m)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the GSD for the given example.\")\n    print(f\"Given n = {n} and m = {m}:\")\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent\n    exponent = n + m\n    \n    # Calculate the final degeneracy\n    degeneracy = 2**exponent\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number explicitly shown\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m})\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^{exponent}\")\n    print(f\"GSD = {degeneracy}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"This result corresponds to the formula in Answer Choice A.\")\n\n# Run the function\nsolve_toric_code_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
