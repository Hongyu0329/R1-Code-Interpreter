No, the approach is not valid. The primary reason is that human vision is not an appropriate substitute for the vision of natural predators (like birds), which can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light. Since bumblebee color patterns often include UV components, human-based similarity rankings will fail to capture the true, ecologically relevant mimicry signals.
