    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step solution to find the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** First, I will identify the structures of the two reactants: the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the phosphorus ylide (Wittig reagent).\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The Wittig reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the oxygen atom of a carbonyl group with the carbon group from the ylide.\n3.  **Construct the Product:** I will combine the relevant parts of the two reactants to form the new alkene product. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n4.  **Name the Product:** I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the alkene product by identifying the longest carbon chain and numbering it correctly.\n5.  **Present the Final Equation:** The final python code will print the full reaction equation and then, as requested, explicitly list the numbers that appear in the product's IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a Wittig reaction and prints the resulting chemical equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define the reactants by name and structure\n    reactant_aldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n    reactant_aldehyde_structure = \"(CH3)3C-CHO\"\n    reactant_ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    reactant_ylide_structure = \"(2-Cl-C6H4)-CH2-CH=P(Ph)3\"\n\n    # 2. Explain the reaction mechanism\n    # In a Wittig reaction, the oxygen of the aldehyde is swapped with the\n    # carbon group of the ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n    # Aldehyde part: (CH3)3C-CH=\n    # Ylide part: =CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)\n\n    # 3. Form the products\n    product_alkene_structure = \"(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)\"\n    product_oxide_name = \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n    product_oxide_structure = \"O=P(Ph)3\"\n\n    # 4. Determine the IUPAC name of the alkene product\n    # The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (pentene).\n    # Numbering the chain to give the double bond and substituents the lowest locants:\n    # 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\n    product_alkene_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n\n    # 5. Print the full reaction equation\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{reactant_aldehyde_name} + {reactant_ylide_name} -> {product_alkene_name} + {product_oxide_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn terms of structure:\")\n    print(f\"{reactant_aldehyde_structure} + {reactant_ylide_structure} -> {product_alkene_structure} + {product_oxide_structure}\")\n\n    # 6. Output the numbers from the final product's name as requested\n    print(\"\\nThe final product in the equation is the alkene:\")\n    print(product_alkene_name)\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the IUPAC name of this product are:\")\n    print(\"1 (from the '1-(2-chlorophenyl)' part)\")\n    print(\"2 (from the '2-chlorophenyl' and 'pent-2-ene' parts)\")\n    print(\"4 (from the '4,4-dimethyl' part, appears twice)\")\n    print(\"4 (from the '4,4-dimethyl' part, appears twice)\")\n\n\nsolve_wittig_reaction()\n```\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
