    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. As it's an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, results from the coupling of orbital and spin angular momenta. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate $J^2$ Eigenvalues:** For each value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n4.  **Calculate $J_z$ Eigenvalues:** For each `j`, the z-component of the total angular momentum, `m_j`, can take `2j + 1` values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The corresponding eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are `m_j ħ`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations. It will iterate through each possible `j` value, calculate the eigenvalues for $J^2$, and then determine the set of corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalues for each `j`. The script will use the `fractions` module for clear and accurate representation of the quantum numbers and eigenvalues.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron with spin-orbit coupling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for p-shell\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j).\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum l = {l} and spin s = {Fraction(s)}.\")\n    j_values_str = ', '.join([str(Fraction(j)) for j in j_values])\n    print(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j) are: {j_values_str}.\\n\")\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z are found for each |j, m_j> state.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through each j to find eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z.\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j)\n        \n        # Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2: j*(j+1)ħ^2\n        j_plus_1_frac = Fraction(j + 1)\n        j2_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(j * (j + 1))\n        \n        print(f\"For the multiplet with j = {j_frac}:\")\n        \n        # Output the J^2 eigenvalue calculation step-by-step\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2\")\n        print(f\"  = {j_frac} * ({j_frac} + 1)ħ^2\")\n        print(f\"  = {j_frac} * {j_plus_1_frac}ħ^2\")\n        print(f\"  = {j2_eigenvalue_frac}ħ^2\\n\")\n        \n        # Calculate the possible m_j values and J_z eigenvalues\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        mj_values_str = ', '.join([str(Fraction(m)) for m in mj_values])\n        jz_eigenvalues_str = ', '.join([f'{Fraction(m)}ħ' for m in mj_values])\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible magnetic quantum numbers (m_j) are: {mj_values_str}.\")\n        print(f\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z are m_j*ħ: {jz_eigenvalues_str}.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 65)\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<For j=3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ^2 and J_z eigenvalues are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ.
