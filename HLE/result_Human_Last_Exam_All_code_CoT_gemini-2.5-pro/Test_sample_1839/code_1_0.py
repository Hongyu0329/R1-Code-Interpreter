        "The definition of `(μ, λ)`-semidistributivity for a forcing `P` is that for any set `X` of size `λ` in the generic extension `V[G]`, there exists a subset `Y` of `X` such that `Y` is in the ground model `V` and `|Y| = μ`.",
        "We are looking for the largest `μ` that works for *every* forcing `P` with density `d(P) = κ`. If we can find a single counterexample `P` where the property fails for `μ > 0`, then the universally true value of `μ` must be 0.",
        
        "\nStep 1: Choose a specific forcing notion `P`.",
        "Let's consider the Cohen forcing `P = Fn(κ, 2)`, which consists of finite partial functions from `κ` to `{0, 1}`. It is a standard result in set theory that the density of this forcing is `κ`. This forcing adds a new, 'generic' subset of `κ` to the universe, which we'll call `g`.",
        
        "\nStep 2: Construct a set `X` of size `κ+` in the generic extension `V[G]`.",
        "Let `g` be the generic subset of `κ` added by `P`. So `g` is in `V[G]` but not in `V`. We can construct a set `X` in `V[G]` using `g`. Let `κ+` be the first cardinal greater than `κ` in the ground model `V`. Define the set `X` as follows:",
        "X = { (α, g) : α < κ+ }",
        "Here, `(α, g)` is the standard ordered pair `{{α}, {α, g}}`. Since the map `α -> (α, g)` is injective, the cardinality of `X` is `κ+`.",
        
        "\nStep 3: Show that `X` contains no elements from the ground model `V`.",
        "Suppose an element `y` from `X` is in the ground model `V`. Then `y = (α, g)` for some ordinal `α < κ+`. For the ordered pair `(α, g)` to be in `V`, its constituent elements must also be in `V`. The ordered pair is the set `{{α}, {α, g}}`. This requires the set `{α, g}` to be in `V`. This in turn requires that both `α` and `g` must be in `V`.",
        "However, `g` is the generic subset of `κ` and is not in the ground model `V`. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and no element of `X` can be in `V`. This means the intersection of `X` with the ground model is empty: `X ∩ V = ∅`.",
        
        "\nStep 4: Analyze the properties of a ground-model subset of `X`.",
        "We are looking for a set `Y` such that `Y ⊆ X` and `Y ∈ V`. If `Y ⊆ X`, then every element of `Y` is also an element of `X`. If `Y ∈ V`, then every element of `Y` must also be in `V`. Combining these, any element of `Y` must be in both `X` and `V`. In other words, `Y ⊆ (X ∩ V)`.",
        "From the previous step, we know `X ∩ V = ∅`. Therefore, `Y` must be a subset of the empty set, which means `Y` itself must be the empty set: `Y = ∅`.",
        
        "\nStep 5: Conclude the value of `μ`.",
        "For our chosen forcing `P` and set `X`, the only subset `Y` of `X` that exists in the ground model `V` is the empty set. The cardinality of the empty set is 0. So, for this `P`, the semidistributivity property only holds for `μ = 0`.",
        "Since the question asks for the largest `μ` that is *necessarily* true for *all* forcings with density `κ`, and we have found a case where it only holds for `μ = 0`, the largest such `μ` must be 0.",
