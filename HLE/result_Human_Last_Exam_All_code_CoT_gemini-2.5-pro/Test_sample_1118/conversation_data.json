    "To answer your question, I will first identify the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933 after his escape from the Gestapo. Then, I will determine the object he is holding in that painting and its symbolic meaning in the context of resistance. Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the question about\n  Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n  \"\"\"\n  # In 1933, after being arrested and escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner painted\n  # \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohn\" (Self-Portrait with a Red Poppy).\n  symbol = \"a red poppy\"\n\n  # The red poppy is interpreted as a symbol of life, defiance, and resistance\n  # against the encroaching Nazi regime.\n  print(f\"In his 1933 self-portrait painted after escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a red poppy>>>"
