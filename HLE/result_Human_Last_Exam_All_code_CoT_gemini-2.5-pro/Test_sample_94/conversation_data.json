    "This is a historical trivia question. I will identify the key elements from your query to find the correct physicist.\n\n1.  **Physicist's field:** \"better known for work in the microscopy field\"\n2.  **Discovery:** An \"optical effect in real imagery\"\n3.  **Origin story:** \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\"\n\nThese clues point to the story of the invention of the Schlieren photography method. The physicist who developed this method after reportedly hearing of the effect being noticed by someone cleaning a mirror is August Toepler. While primarily known for his work in acoustics and the development of the Toepler pump, his invention of the Schlieren method is a significant contribution to optics, used for visualizing phenomena that are otherwise invisible, which is conceptually related to microscopy.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print his name.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on the provided clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1. Associated with microscopy.\n    2. Discovered an optical effect.\n    3. The effect was noticed by a worker cleaning concave mirrors.\n    \n    The story points to August Toepler, the inventor of the Schlieren method\n    for visualizing fluid flow, which makes transparent phenomena visible.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist_name = \"August Toepler\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<August Toepler>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
