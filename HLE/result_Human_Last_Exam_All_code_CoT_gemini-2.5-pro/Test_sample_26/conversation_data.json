    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use a result from algebraic topology concerning the homotopy groups of complex hypersurfaces.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  State the relevant theorem that relates the rank of the homotopy group $\\pi_m(V_d)$ of a smooth hypersurface $V_d$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^m$ to its Betti numbers.\n2.  For our specific case, $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so we have $d=5$ and $m=3$. The theorem gives a formula for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n3.  The formula requires the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$, of the hypersurface $X$.\n4.  We will calculate $b_2(X)$ using standard formulas from algebraic geometry, specifically by first computing the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$.\n    a. The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ can be found using Noether's formula, which relates it to other invariants: the geometric genus $p_g = h^{2,0}(X)$ and the self-intersection number of the canonical class $K_X^2$.\n    b. We'll compute these invariants using formulas for a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n5.  Once $\\chi(X)$ is known, we can find $b_2(X)$ using the relation $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$. For a smooth complex surface like $X$, we know $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n6.  The formula also requires $b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^{m-1}) = b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$, which is a known value.\n7.  Finally, substitute the calculated values into the formula to get the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Execution:\nThe theorem from Libgober and Wood states that for a smooth hypersurface $V_d \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^m$, the rank of the $m$-th homotopy group is given by:\n`Rank(π_m(V_d)) = b_{m-1}(V_d) - b_{m-1}(\\mathbb{CP}^{m-1})`\n\nFor our problem, we have $d=5$ and $m=3$. Thus, the formula becomes:\n`Rank(π_3(X)) = b_2(X) - b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^2)`\n\nThe Betti numbers for $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ are well-known: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=1, b_3=0, b_4=1$. So, $b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 1$.\n\nNow, we calculate $b_2(X)$ for the quintic surface $X$:\n1.  **Geometric genus, $p_g = h^{2,0}(X)$**: For a smooth surface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $h^{2,0}(X) = \\binom{d-1}{3}$.\n2.  **Canonical class self-intersection, $K_X^2$**: By the adjunction formula, $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(d-4)$. So, $K_X^2 = (d-4)^2 \\cdot d$.\n3.  **Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X)$**: This is related to the arithmetic genus by $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 1 - h^{0,1}(X) + h^{0,2}(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface, $h^{0,1}=0$, and by Serre duality $h^{0,2}=h^{2,0}$. So, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 1 + h^{2,0}(X)$.\n4.  **Topological Euler characteristic, $\\chi(X)$**: Noether's formula states $12\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = K_X^2 + c_2(X)$. The second Chern number $c_2(X)$ is the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. So, $\\chi(X) = 12\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) - K_X^2$.\n5.  **Second Betti number, $b_2(X)$**: For a simply-connected smooth complex surface, $\\chi(X) = b_0 + b_2 + b_4 = 1 + b_2 + 1 = b_2 + 2$. Thus, $b_2(X) = \\chi(X) - 2$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 5 # Degree of the hypersurface\n    m = 3 # Dimension of the ambient complex projective space\n\n    print(f\"The task is to find the rank of pi_3(X) for a smooth quintic (d={d}) hypersurface X in CP^{m}.\")\n    print(\"According to a theorem by Libgober and Wood, the rank is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"Rank(pi_{m}(X)) = b_{m-1}(X) - b_{m-1}(CP^{m-1})\")\n    print(f\"For m={m}, this is: Rank(pi_3(X)) = b_2(X) - b_2(CP^2)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate b_2(X)\n    print(\"First, we calculate the second Betti number, b_2(X).\")\n    \n    # Calculate geometric genus h^{2,0}(X)\n    h20 = comb(d - 1, m)\n    print(f\"The geometric genus h^2,0(X) = C(d-1, m) = C({d-1}, {m}) = {h20}\")\n\n    # Calculate chi(O_X)\n    chi_OX = 1 + h20\n    print(f\"The Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf chi(O_X) = 1 + h^2,0(X) = 1 + {h20} = {chi_OX}\")\n\n    # Calculate K_X^2\n    K_X_sq = (d - m - 1)**2 * d\n    print(f\"The self-intersection of the canonical class K_X^2 = (d - m - 1)^2 * d = ({d} - {m} - 1)^2 * {d} = {K_X_sq}\")\n    \n    # Calculate topological Euler characteristic chi(X) using Noether's formula\n    chi_X = 12 * chi_OX - K_X_sq\n    print(f\"Using Noether's formula, the topological Euler characteristic chi(X) = 12 * chi(O_X) - K_X^2 = 12 * {chi_OX} - {K_X_sq} = {chi_X}\")\n    \n    # Calculate b_2(X)\n    # For a simply connected surface, chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = b_2 + 2\n    b2_X = chi_X - 2\n    print(f\"For a smooth hypersurface, b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1.
