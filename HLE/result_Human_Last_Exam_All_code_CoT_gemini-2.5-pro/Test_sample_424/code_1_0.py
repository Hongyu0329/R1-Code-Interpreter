def solve_planar_set_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem by analyzing the connectivity of the planar set.

    The problem asks for the number of points 'p' in a given planar set 'S'
    such that removing 'p' from 'S' results in a new set 'S \\ {p}' that has
    three or more connected components.

    The set S is a connected graph-like structure. Removing a point 'p' can
    disconnect it. Such a point is called a 'cut point'. We are looking for
    cut points that split the set into 3 or more pieces.

    This typically happens at junction vertices where multiple paths meet.
    Let's analyze the critical junction points:
    """

    # List of junction points to analyze
    # A point is represented as a tuple (x, y)
    # A list of tuples: [(point, number_of_branches_attached)]
    # A "branch" here is a path that terminates and whose only connection to the rest
    # of the graph is at the junction point.
    
    # At point (0, 1), the vertical segment {0}x[1/2, 3/2] splits into two branches:
    # {0}x[1/2, 1) and {0}x(1, 3/2].
    # The horizontal segment [-1/2, 1/2]x{1} splits into two branches:
    # [-1/2, 0)x{1} and (0, 1/2]x{1}.
    # Total branches = 2 + 2 = 4.
    p1 = {'point': (0, 1), 'branches': 4}

    # At point (-1, 0), the segment [-3/2, -1/2]x{0} splits into two branches:
    # [-3/2, -1)x{0} and (-1, -1/2]x{0}.
    # Total branches = 2.
    p2 = {'point': (-1, 0), 'branches': 2}

    # At point (1, 0), the segment [1/2, 3/2]x{0} splits into [1/2, 1) and (1, 3/2]x{0}.
    # The piece [1/2, 1) is a branch.
    # The piece (1, 3/2]x{0} remains connected to the main graph at (3/2, 0).
    # So, only 1 branch is created.
    p3 = {'point': (1, 0), 'branches': 1}

    # At point (0, -1), the segment {0}x[-3/2, -1/2] splits into {0}x[-3/2, -1) and {0}x(-1,-1/2].
    # The piece {0}x[-3/2, -1) remains connected at (0,-3/2).
    # The piece {0}x(-1,-1/2] is a branch.
    # So, only 1 branch is created.
    p4 = {'point': (0, -1), 'branches': 1}

        num_components = 1 + branches
        
        print(f"Point {point}:")
        print(f"  Removing this point disconnects {branches} branch(es).")
        print(f"  The total number of components becomes 1 + {branches} = {num_components}.")
