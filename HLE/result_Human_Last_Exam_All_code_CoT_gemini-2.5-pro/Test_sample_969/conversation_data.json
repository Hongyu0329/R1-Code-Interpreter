    "This sequence problem requires identifying an underlying structure. It's not a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. A careful analysis reveals that the sequence is constructed from 'runs' of numbers (e.g., `3, 3, 3` is a run of `3`s of length 3). By breaking down the sequence into the numbers being repeated and the length of their runs, two simpler patterns emerge.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Hypothesize the pattern:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` is composed of runs of numbers. Let's decompose it.\n    *   Runs: `(3)` `(2)` `(1)` `(2)` `(3,3,3)` `(2,2)`\n    *   The numbers being repeated are: `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2`\n    *   The lengths of these runs are: `1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2`\n2.  **Identify the full pattern:** The sequence of run lengths `1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2` seems incomplete. A more regular pattern would be `1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3` (four 1s, followed by three 3s). This implies the last run of `2`s was cut short in the given sequence.\n3.  **Confirm the pattern:** If we assume the run lengths are `(1,1,1,1), (3,3,3)`, the sequence of numbers `(3,2,1,2), (3,2,1)` also becomes very regular. This strong combined pattern suggests our hypothesis is correct.\n4.  **Generate the next elements:**\n    *   The given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` has 9 elements.\n    *   Based on our pattern, the run of `2`s should have a length of 3, not 2. So, the 10th element must be `2` to complete this run.\n    *   The next run in the pattern uses the number `1` and repeats it `3` times. So, elements 11, 12, and 13 are `1, 1, 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the next 4 elements are `2, 1, 1, 1`.\n5.  **Code the solution:** The python code will construct the full sequence based on this discovered pattern and print the original 9 elements followed by the 4 new elements.\n\n```python\n# The pattern of the sequence is based on runs of numbers.\n# By analyzing the structure, we can deduce the underlying rules for generating the sequence.\n\n# The sequence of numbers being repeated is [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1].\n# The sequence of the lengths of these runs is [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3].\n\n# We can generate the full sequence from these two patterns.\n# The given sequence is the first 9 elements of this fully generated sequence.\n# We will generate the sequence and then print out the first 13 elements.\n\nnumbers_pattern = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nlengths_pattern = [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n\nfull_sequence = []\nfor i in range(len(numbers_pattern)):\n    number = numbers_pattern[i]\n    length = lengths_pattern[i]\n    for _ in range(length):\n        full_sequence.append(number)\n\n# The problem asks to complete the sequence.\n# The initial sequence given has 9 elements.\n# The next 4 elements will be elements at index 9, 10, 11, and 12 of our generated sequence.\nfinal_sequence_to_print = full_sequence[:13]\n\n# Print each number in the completed sequence, as requested.\nprint(*final_sequence_to_print)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
