    "Of course. Here is the plan to calculate the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** First, I will identify all possible vacuum bubble diagrams of the second order in the coupling constant $\\lambda$. A second-order diagram has two vertices. In $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines. We need to find all ways to connect the 8 lines (4 from each of the two vertices) to form diagrams with no external lines. This process yields three distinct diagrams.\n2.  **Describe the Diagrams:**\n    *   **Diagram A (the \"glasses\" diagram):** Two vertices are connected by two propagators, and each vertex also has a self-loop (a propagator starting and ending on the same vertex).\n    *   **Diagram B (the \"melon\" diagram):** Two vertices are connected to each other by four distinct propagators.\n    *   **Diagram C (the disconnected diagram):** Two separate copies of the first-order \"figure-eight\" diagram. This diagram is disconnected.\n3.  **Calculate Symmetry Factors:** For each diagram, I will calculate its symmetry factor, which is the number of permutations of its lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n    *   For Diagram A, the symmetries come from swapping the two vertices, swapping the two propagators connecting them, and symmetries within each self-loop.\n    *   For Diagram B, the symmetries come from swapping the two vertices and permuting the four identical propagators connecting them.\n    *   For Diagram C, the symmetry factor is calculated by first finding the symmetry of a single first-order figure-eight diagram and then considering that the full diagram consists of two identical, swappable components.\n4.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, I will sum the individual symmetry factors to get the total. The Python code will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and sums the symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\\n\")\n\n    # There are three distinct diagrams at this order.\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Melon\" Diagram ---\n    # This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Its symmetries are:\n    # 1.
