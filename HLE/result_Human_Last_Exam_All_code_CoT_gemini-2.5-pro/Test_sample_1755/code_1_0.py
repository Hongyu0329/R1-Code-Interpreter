    This script analyzes the provided C code and identifies the location of the critical error
    and the number of edits to fix it.

    The error is a stack buffer overflow caused by a type mismatch in a scanf call.
    The code effectively calls scanf("%d", &c), but `c` is declared as a `char` (1 byte)
    while `%d` writes an integer (typically 4 bytes).

    The fix is to change the declaration of `c` to a type that can hold an integer,
    such as `short int`.
