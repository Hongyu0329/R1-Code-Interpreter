    """
    This function solves for the whitening filter W(D) based on a plausible interpretation of the problem.
    The problem as stated leads to a non-physical channel model. We assume a likely intended structure
    that is solvable.

    The key steps are:
    1. Define a plausible causal and minimum-phase spectral factor H(D) based on problem hints.
       A common form for such problems involves simple rational functions. Let's assume the intended
       H(D) = (1+D) / (1 - (2/3)D).
    2. The whitening filter W(D) that makes the channel Q(D)W(D) causal is W(D) = 1 / H(D^{-1}).
    3. We will find the expression for W(D) and print its transfer function.
