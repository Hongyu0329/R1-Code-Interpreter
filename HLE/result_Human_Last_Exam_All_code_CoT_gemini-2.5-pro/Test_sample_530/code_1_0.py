def analyze_endomorphisms():
    """
    Analyzes the relationship between the number of endomorphisms of a
    semi-abelian variety G and its underlying abelian variety A.

    A semi-abelian variety G is an extension of an abelian variety A by a torus T,
    represented by the short exact sequence:
    0 -> T -> G -> A -> 0

    There exists a canonical ring homomorphism:
    rho: End(G) -> End(A)

    The relationship between the rings is given by the isomorphism:
    End(G) / ker(rho) is isomorphic to Im(rho)

    where:
    - ker(rho) = Hom(G, T) (homomorphisms from G to T)
    - Im(rho) is a subring of End(A)

    We analyze three possible scenarios.
