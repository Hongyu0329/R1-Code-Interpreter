    "My plan is to determine the Hopf charge by using its topological definition as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere S^2.\n\n1.  **Understand the Field**: The given vector field `(nx, ny, nz)` defines a map from 3D space `(x, y, z)` to the surface of a unit sphere `S^2`. The coordinates on the sphere are effectively given by `G` (polar angle) and `f` (azimuthal angle).\n2.  **Choose Regular Points**: I will choose two convenient regular points on the sphere `S^2`. The poles are critical points, so I will select two points on the equator, for instance, `p1 = (1,0,0)` and `p2 = (0,1,0)`.\n3.  **Find Preimages**: I will find the sets of points in the `(x,y,z)` space that map to `p1` and `p2`. These preimages will be curves in 3D space.\n4.  **Analyze Preimage Topology**: A key step is to analyze the shape of these preimage curves. I will show that the specific formula `(x*x+y*y-0.5)^2` results in each preimage being composed of two disjoint loops.\n5.  **Calculate Linking Number**: The Hopf charge is the total linking number between the sets of loops corresponding to the two preimages. I will analyze the geometric arrangement of these loops to determine their linking number. Loops that lie in orthogonal planes and do not intersect their common axis are unlinked.\n6.  **Conclusion**: By summing the linking numbers of all pairs of loops, I will find the total Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The Hopf charge is an integer that characterizes the topology of a map from 3D space to the 2-sphere.\n# It can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of any two regular points on the sphere.\n# A regular point on the sphere is one whose preimage is a collection of smooth, non-intersecting curves.\n\n# Let's define the vector field n = (nx, ny, nz) which maps a point (x,y,z) in R^3\n# to a point on the unit sphere S^2. The mapping is given in terms of intermediate variables:\n# f = atan2(y, x)\n# r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)*(x*x + y*y - 0.5) + z*z)\n# G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)\n# nx = sin(G) * cos(f)\n# ny = sin(G) * sin(f)\n# nz = cos(G)\n# Here, (G, f) are essentially spherical coordinates on the S^2 sphere, with G being the polar angle (theta)\n# and f being the azimuthal angle (phi).\n\n# The Hopf charge H is given by the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular values, say p1 and p2, on S^2.\n# H = Lk(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))\n\n# Let's choose two convenient regular points on the sphere. The poles (G=0 or G=pi) are critical points\n# because the derivatives of the field components are singular or vanish there, so we avoid them.\n# A good choice is two points on the equator of the sphere, for example:\n# p1 corresponding to G = PI/2, f = 0. This is the point (1, 0, 0) on S^2.\n# p2 corresponding to G = PI/2, f = PI/2. This is the point (0, 1, 0) on S^2.\n\n# Let's find the preimages of these points in R^3.\n\n# Preimage of p1 (n^{-1}(p1)):\n# We need G = PI/2 and f = 0.\n# f = atan2(y, x) = 0 implies y=0 and x > 0. The preimage lies in the x-z half-plane with x > 0.\n# G = PI/2 implies PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI/2 => exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5\n# => -10 * r2 = ln(0.5) = -ln(2)\n# => r2 = ln(2) / 10\n# Let K = ln(2) / 10. So, r2^2 = K^2.\n# r2^2 = (x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = K^2\n# Let rho^2 = x^2 + y^2. The equation is (rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = K^2.\n# This equation for rho and z defines the shape of the preimage curve(s).\n# Let u = rho^2 - 0.5. The equation is u^2 + z^2 = K^2, which is a circle in the (u, z) plane.\n# So, u = +/- sqrt(K^2 - z^2).\n# This means rho^2 = 0.5 +/- sqrt(K^2 - z^2).\n# For a given z in [-K, K], we get two values for rho^2, and thus two values for rho.\n# This means the preimage of G=PI/2 consists of two separate, concentric loops in the (rho, z) plane.\n# When we set f=0, we get two loops in the x-z half-plane. Let's call them C1_inner and C1_outer.\n\n# Preimage of p2 (n^{-1}(p2)):\n# We need G = PI/2 and f = PI/2.\n# f = atan2(y, x) = PI/2 implies x=0 and y > 0. The preimage lies in the y-z half-plane with y > 0.\n# The condition on G is the same: (rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = K^2.\n# This preimage also consists of two loops, C2_inner and C2_outer, but in the y-z half-plane.\n\n# Now we need to compute the total linking number.\n# H = Lk(C1_inner U C1_outer, C2_inner U C2_outer)\n# H = Lk(C1_inner, C2_inner) + Lk(C1_inner, C2_outer) + Lk(C1_outer, C2_inner) + Lk(C1_outer, C2_outer)\n\n# C1_inner and C1_outer lie entirely in the x-z plane (y=0).\n# C2_inner and C2_outer lie entirely in the y-z plane (x=0).\n# Two curves can only be linked if one passes through a surface bounded by the other.\n# The C1 loops are in the x-z plane. The C2 loops are in the y-z plane.\n# They can only intersect on the z-axis. A check shows that rho is never zero on these loops,\n# so they do not touch the z-axis and do not intersect.\n# Loops in orthogonal planes that do not intersect are not linked.\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Understand the definition of Hopf Charge.\")\nprint(\"The Hopf charge is a topological invariant that can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere S^2.\")\nprint(\"\\nH = Lk(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))\\n\")\nprint(\"Step 2: Choose two regular points on the sphere S^2.\")\nprint(\"We choose p1 = (1,0,0) and p2 = (0,1,0).
