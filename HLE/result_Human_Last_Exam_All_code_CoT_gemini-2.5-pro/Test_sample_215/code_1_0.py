# Based on the analysis of the R script, we can determine the expected number of chemotypes.

# For the control group, the R script calls:
# generate_chemistry(360, 340, 'control')
# In this call, all 360 specimens are assigned the single 'control' treatment.
# A single baseline is generated and subtracted from ALL 360 specimens.
# This means they all originate from a single statistical population.
control_chemotypes = 1

# For the water stress group, the R script calls:
# generate_chemistry(510, 340, 'water_stress')
# Similarly, all 510 specimens are assigned the 'water_stress' treatment.
# A new, single baseline is generated and subtracted from ALL 510 specimens.
# This also means they originate from a single statistical population.
water_stress_chemotypes = 1
