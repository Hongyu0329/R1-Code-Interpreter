Step 1: Identify the client's core problem.
Charles is "struggling to keep up" with his new health plan. This suggests the plan is too demanding or not sustainable in its current form.

Step 2: Analyze the components of the plan.
-   Psychology: This is a strength. Behavioral psychotherapy has already helped him with self-control.
-   Exercise: This is a goal. He plans to start exercising, which is positive but will increase his body's energy demands.
-   Diet: This is the most significant change and a likely source of the problem. The diet is described as limiting three major macronutrient sources: animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Step 3: Evaluate the diet's impact.
-   A diet that severely restricts carbohydrates, fats, and protein all at once is unsustainable for most people.
-   Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. Limiting them can cause fatigue and weakness.
-   Fats are essential for hormone production and satiety.
-   Protein is vital for muscle repair and feeling full.
-   Starting a new exercise program requires adequate energy and nutrients for performance and recovery. A triple-restricted diet will leave Charles feeling drained and unable to meet the demands of his job, let alone his workouts.

Step 4: Formulate the recommendation.
The most critical issue is the overly restrictive nature of the diet. It is setting him up for failure by depleting his energy. The very first adjustment Charles needs to make is to his diet, making it more balanced and less restrictive to ensure he has enough energy to sustain his lifestyle and new exercise goals.
