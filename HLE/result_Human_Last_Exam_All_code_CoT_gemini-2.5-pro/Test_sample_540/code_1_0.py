    Analyzes the equation Delta Q + alpha |Q|^(p-1)Q = beta Q to determine the range of alpha and beta.
    
    The analysis proceeds in several steps:
    1. The equation is identified as a stationary nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation. We are looking for localized L^2 solutions (solitary waves).
    2. We apply the existence theory for such equations, notably the results by Berestycki and Lions for equations of the form -Delta u = g(u).
    3. Our equation can be written as -Delta Q = g(Q) where g(Q) = beta*Q - alpha*|Q|^(p-1)Q.
    4. The existence conditions from Berestycki and Lions are:
       a) lim_{s->0} g(s)/s < 0. For our g(Q), this limit is beta. Thus, we need beta < 0.
       b) The potential G(s) = integral_0^s g(t)dt must be positive for some s > 0.
          G(Q) = (beta/2)*Q^2 - (alpha/(p+1))*Q^(p+1).
          Since beta < 0, the first term is negative. For G(Q) to be positive, the second term, -(alpha/(p+1))*Q^(p+1), must be positive and dominant for some Q. This requires alpha < 0.
    5. The combination of these conditions is alpha < 0 and beta < 0. This corresponds to option G.
    6. This result is also checked for consistency with the Pohozaev identity, a necessary condition for solutions, and it is found to be consistent for all dimensions d >= 2.
