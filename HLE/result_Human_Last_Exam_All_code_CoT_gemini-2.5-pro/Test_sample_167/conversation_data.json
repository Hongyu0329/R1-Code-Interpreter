    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use a known result from graph theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the graph type:** The graph is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ with $m=1000$ and $n=1000$.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem:** For any complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, its Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $AT(K_{m,n}) = \\min(m, n) + 1$. This result is established from a combination of a lower bound for regular graphs and a constructive upper bound.\n3.  **Apply the formula:** We will substitute the values of $m=1000$ and $n=1000$ into the formula.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A simple Python script will be provided to perform this calculation and print the result, showing each number in the final equation.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\min(1000, 1000) + 1 = 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_kmn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_m,n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the complete bipartite graph K_m,n\n    m = 1000\n    n = 1000\n\n    # The Alon-Tarsi number of K_m,n is given by the formula: min(m, n) + 1.\n    min_val = min(m, n)\n    result = min_val + 1\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph K_{m},{n} is found using the formula min(m, n) + 1.\")\n    print(\"For this case, m = 1000 and n = 1000.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"min({m}, {n}) + 1 = {min_val} + 1 = {result}\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_kmn()\n```\n<<<1001>>>"
