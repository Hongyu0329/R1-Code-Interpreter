    "The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), typically measured as R² (the proportion of variance explained) in a new sample, is a practical measure of how well we can predict a person's phenotype from their genotype using a specific model. This model's parameters (the SNP weights) are estimated from a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP), on the other hand, is a theoretical quantity. It represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by *all* the genetic variants (SNPs) included in the analysis, assuming their true effects were known. It is the theoretical upper limit or ceiling for the predictive ability of any PGS based on those same SNPs.\n\nIn practice, the predictive ability of a PGS is always lower than the SNP heritability due to several factors:\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** GWAS are performed on finite samples, so the estimated SNP effects have standard errors and are not the true effects. This noise reduces predictive accuracy.\n2.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The methods used to build PGS (like clumping and thresholding or more advanced methods like LDpred) do not perfectly account for the complex correlation structure between SNPs.\n3.  **Mismatched Populations:** Differences in genetic ancestry and LD structure between the GWAS (base) population and the prediction (target) population lower the PGS accuracy.\n4.  **Different Genetic Architectures:** The PGS model might not perfectly match the true underlying genetic architecture of the trait (e.g., the distribution of effect sizes).\n\nTherefore, the SNP heritability represents the \"best-case scenario\" for prediction, while the PGS R² represents the \"real-world performance,\" which is inevitably degraded by statistical and methodological limitations.\n\n<<<True>>>"
