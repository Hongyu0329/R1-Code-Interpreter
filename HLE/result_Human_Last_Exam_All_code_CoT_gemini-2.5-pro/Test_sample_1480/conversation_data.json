    "To calculate the rule activation level of a fuzzy rule, we need to combine the membership degrees of its antecedent parts using a t-norm operation. A t-norm acts as a fuzzy logical AND. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which takes the minimum of the given membership values. Another common one is the product t-norm, which multiplies the values.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two given membership values, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values to find the rule activation level.\n3.  Print the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Given membership values for the antecedent parts of the fuzzy rule\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to combine the membership values.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
