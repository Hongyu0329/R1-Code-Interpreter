    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your request.\n\nFirst, I must clarify the premise of your question. Gödel's ontological proof is a work of *modal logic*, a branch of formal logic that deals with concepts like possibility and necessity. The mathematics \"customary for quantum mechanics\" involves fields like linear algebra, functional analysis, and group theory, which operate on entirely different principles and are used to model physical systems. There is no established method to prove a theorem of modal logic using the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, instead of attempting an impossible cross-domain proof, I will provide a Python script that programmatically lays out the axioms, definitions, and theorems of Gödel's proof in a step-by-step manner. This will demonstrate the logical structure of the argument itself. The code will print each numbered step of the formal proof, fulfilling your request to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n\nThe final answer will reflect the status of the proof: it is considered logically valid within its specific system (S5 modal logic), meaning the conclusion follows from the premises. However, its *soundness* (whether the axioms are actually true) is a subject of intense philosophical debate.\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\ndef a_demonstration_of_goedels_ontological_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script programmatically lays out the steps of Kurt Gödel's\n    ontological proof for the existence of God.\n\n    The proof is a formal argument in modal logic, not a mathematical\n    calculation or a finding from physics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- A Step-by-Step Representation of Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\")\n    print(\"\\nThis code does not 'run' or 'solve' the proof, but displays its logical structure.\")\n    print(\"The argument's validity depends on accepting its initial axioms and definitions.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Key to Logical Symbols ---\")\n    print(\"P(φ)      : The property 'φ' is a positive property.\")\n    print(\"~         : NOT (negation)\")\n    print(\"->        : IMPLIES (if... then...)\")\n    print(\"□         : NECESSARILY (it is necessarily true that...)\")\n    print(\"◇         : POSSIBLY (it is possibly true that...)\")\n    print(\"G(x)      : x is God-like.\")\n    print(\"E(φ, x)   : φ is the essence of x.\")\n    print(\"NE(x)     : x has Necessary Existence.\\n\")\n\n    # The steps are numbered to satisfy the prompt's formatting requirement.\n    print(\"--- The Argument ---\")\n    \n    print(\"1.
