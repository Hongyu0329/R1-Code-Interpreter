1.  **Effect on Beam Shape (Dispersion):**
    A laser beam with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) has a unique ring-shaped or "donut" intensity profile, with zero intensity at the center. When this laser hits the target, it pushes electrons forward in a ring pattern. This creates a corresponding ring-shaped electrostatic field at the rear of the target that accelerates the protons. An accelerating force applied from a ring structure pushes protons not just forward, but also radially outward. This causes the resulting proton beam to spread out, a phenomenon known as **Dispersion**.

2.  **Effect on Proton Energy (Decrease):**
    The maximum energy protons can gain is highly dependent on the laser's peak intensity. By distributing its energy into a ring, an OAM beam has a lower peak intensity compared to a standard laser beam of the same total power focused to a single tight spot. This lower intensity leads to less efficient energy transfer to the electrons, creating a weaker accelerating field. Consequently, the maximum energy of the resulting proton beam **Decreases**.

Therefore, the combined effect is Dispersion of the proton beam and a Decrease in proton energy.
