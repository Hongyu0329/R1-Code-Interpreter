    print("1. The goal is to identify the specific source of Dilp2 that drives neural stem cell reactivation based on the provided experimental evidence.")

    print("\n2. Evaluating Choice B: Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph.")
    print("   - Evidence of Necessity: An experiment is described where Imp-L2, a Dilp2-binding protein, is overexpressed in the fat body.")
    print("   - Effect: This action targets and removes Dilp2 from the hemolymph.")
    print("   - Result: 'neural stem cells stay in quiescence and fail to reactivate.'")
    print("   - Conclusion: This strongly supports that hemolymph Dilp2 is NECESSARY for reactivation.")
    print("\n   - Evidence of Sufficiency: Another experiment involves incubating a brain from an unfed animal in bovine insulin (a Dilp2 analog).")
    print("   - Result: This 'drives neural stem cell reactivation.'")
    print("   - Conclusion: This supports that a systemic signal like hemolymph Dilp2 is SUFFICIENT for reactivation.")

    print("\n3. Evaluating Choice A: Dilp2 transported to the DRNs.")
    print("   - Evidence of Involvement: Inhibiting DRN activity 'causes neural stem cells' delay in reactivation.'")
    print("   - Conclusion: This shows that DRNs are involved in the process.")
    print("   - Critical Caveat: The text explicitly states, 'DRNs may have function independent of Dilp2 absorption.' This means we cannot conclude that the *transported Dilp2* is the signal. The delay could be caused by disrupting another, parallel function of the DRNs.")

    print("\n4. Synthesis:")
    print("   - The evidence for the hemolymph pathway (B) is direct and compelling, as experiments demonstrate both its necessity and sufficiency.")
    print("   - The evidence for the DRN pathway (A) being the primary source is inconclusive and indirect.")
    print("   - Therefore, the most logical answer is that Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph is the source that drives reactivation.")
