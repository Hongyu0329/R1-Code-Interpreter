# The validity of a Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) relies on a chain of interconnected assumptions.
# The failure of any key assumption can invalidate the results. Therefore, no single assumption is sufficient.

# Assumption A: Transitivity. This is a fundamental logical assumption that underpins the entire analysis.
# It assumes you can logically bridge from A->B and B->C to make a conclusion about A->C.
# Why it's not sufficient: Even if transitivity is plausible, the data could still show significant
# statistical inconsistency or heterogeneity, making the results unreliable.

# Assumption B: Consistency. This is a statistical check to see if direct and indirect evidence agree.
# Why it's not sufficient: A non-significant test for inconsistency doesn't prove its absence,
# especially with few studies. More importantly, it doesn't guarantee the underlying transitivity assumption holds.

# Assumption C: Homogeneity. This assumes low variability among studies making the same direct comparison.
# Why it's not sufficient: First, this assumption is often relaxed by using a random-effects NMA.
# Second, you can have perfect homogeneity within each pairwise comparison, but still have a major
# transitivity violation across the network (e.g., all A-B studies are on men, all B-C studies on women).

# Assumption D: Similarity of Effect Modifiers. This is the practical basis for assuming transitivity.
# Why it's not sufficient: Like transitivity itself, this is a necessary prerequisite but doesn't protect
# against statistical inconsistency that might arise from chance or other unmeasured factors.

# Assumption F: Exchangeability. This is a statistical assumption in random-effects models.
# Why it's not sufficient: It is a modeling assumption. If the underlying data violates the logical
# prerequisite of transitivity, the model's output will be biased, regardless of its internal assumptions.

# Final Conclusion: A valid NMA requires a combination of plausible transitivity, which is supported by
# similar effect modifiers across comparisons, and is not contradicted by statistical tests for inconsistency
# or overwhelming heterogeneity. No single condition can ensure this.
