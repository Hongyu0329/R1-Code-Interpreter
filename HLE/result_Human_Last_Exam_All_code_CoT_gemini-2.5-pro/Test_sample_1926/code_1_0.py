    # The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of two sets of points on a curve C as a height parameter grows.
    # Let N_fiber(H) be the number of irreducible degree d points on C from a specific linear system up to height H.
    # Let N_all(H) be the number of all irreducible degree d points on C up to height H.
    # We are asked to find the limit of N_fiber(H) / N_all(H) as H -> infinity.

    # A direct counting argument based on a standard interpretation of the height function suggests the ratio should be 0.
    # This is because the points in the numerator are constrained to a subvariety, which is typically a "thin set" of density zero.
    # However, this analysis discards the provided parameters G (the Galois group) and R (the Mordell-Weil rank).

    # The form of the answer choices, particularly 1/|G|, strongly suggests that the problem refers to a deeper result in
    # arithmetic statistics, likely an analogue of the Chebotarev Density Theorem for points on curves.
    # This type of result states that rational points are equidistributed according to certain Galois-theoretic properties.
    # In this context, the Galois group G of the cover C -> P^1 defined by the g^r_d governs the structure of the "special"
    # points in the numerator. The result 1/|G| implies that these special points make up a fraction of the whole set
    # that is inversely proportional to the size of this Galois group.

    # The final equation for the ratio is:
    final_ratio_numerator = 1
    final_ratio_denominator_symbol = "|G|"
