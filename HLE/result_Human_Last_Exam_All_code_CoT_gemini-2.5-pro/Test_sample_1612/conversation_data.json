    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners:\n\n1.  **Define the Triple Crown:** The Triple Crown in baseball can be won by either a batter or a pitcher.\n    *   **Batting:** Leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n    *   **Pitching:** Leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n2.  **Count the Instances:** I will count the number of times the batting Triple Crown has been won and the number of times the pitching Triple Crown has been won throughout MLB history.\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** The total number of Triple Crown winners will be the sum of the batting and pitching winners.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will perform this calculation and print the breakdown and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crowns():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The Triple Crown can be won by either a batter or a pitcher.\n    This function counts the number of times each has been achieved and sums them up.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data represents each time the Triple Crown was won in MLB history.\n    # Source: MLB official records and Baseball-Reference.com\n    batting_winners_count = 18\n    pitching_winners_count = 35\n\n    # Calculate the total\n    total_winners = batting_winners_count + pitching_winners_count\n\n    # Print the breakdown and the final equation\n    print(f\"Number of batting Triple Crown winners: {batting_winners_count}\")\n    print(f\"Number of pitching Triple Crown winners: {pitching_winners_count}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTotal MLB Triple Crown Winners = {batting_winners_count} + {pitching_winners_count} = {total_winners}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_mlb_triple_crowns()\n```\n<<<53>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
