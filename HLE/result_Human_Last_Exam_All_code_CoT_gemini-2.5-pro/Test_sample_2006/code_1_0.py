# 1. Decode the numbers from the haiku based on the plan.

# From "Twice fifteen brings winds of change"
# "Twice fifteen" = 2 * 15
num_from_line2 = 2 * 15

# From "An August tempest"
# "An" = 1, "August" = 8, "tempest" (Beaufort scale) = 10
num_from_line1 = 1 + 8 + 10

# From "A divine one yields"
# "A divine one" is an anagram of "eleven"
result_from_line3 = 11

# 2. Assemble and verify the equation.
# The riddle implies the equation: 30 - 19 = 11.
# Let's confirm our derived numbers match this.
calculated_result = num_from_line2 - num_from_line1

# 3. Print the equation with each number.
print(f"The equation derived from the haiku is: {num_from_line2} - {num_from_line1} = {calculated_result}")

# 4. Find the final answer based on the riddle's question.
# The question "in alphabetical order what is the answer?" implies converting
# the numeric result to its corresponding letter in the alphabet.
if calculated_result == result_from_line3:
    # The English alphabet
    alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    # Find the letter at the 11th position (index 10)
    final_answer = alphabet[calculated_result - 1]
    print(f"The result is {calculated_result}.")
    print(f"The {calculated_result}th letter of the alphabet is '{final_answer}'.")
else:
    print("The numbers derived did not solve the equation correctly.")
