# Based on the analysis, the problem simplifies significantly if we assume
# the complex sampling procedure results in a random variable `z` that
# follows a standard uniform distribution on [0, 1].

# For z ~ U(0, 1):
# The probability density function p(z) = 1 for z in [0, 1].
# So, the value of the pdf at z=1 is 1.
p_k_at_1 = 1

# The differential entropy d = -integral(p(z) * log(p(z)) dz).
# For p(z) = 1, log(p(z)) = log(1) = 0.
# So, the entropy is 0.
d_k = 0

# The function to evaluate is l(k) = p_k(1) + 2*d_k - 1.
result = p_k_at_1 + 2 * d_k - 1

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: 1 + 2 * 0 - 1 = 0
