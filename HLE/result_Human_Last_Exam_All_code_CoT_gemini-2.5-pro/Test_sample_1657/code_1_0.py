# The task is to calculate the travel time to Pandora in both Earth's and the
# spacecraft's reference frames. However, the problem is unsolvable as stated.
#
# Here is the reasoning:
#
# 1.  The problem provides enough information to calculate the necessary velocities.
#     - Pandora's recessional velocity can be found from the redshift.
#     - Pioneer's velocity profile during and after its 400-day acceleration
#       can be simulated.
#
# 2.  The fundamental equation for the travel time depends on the initial distance
#     to Pandora, let's call it 'D'. The time it takes for Pioneer to catch up
#     to Pandora is a function of this initial separation D.
#
# 3.  The problem statement, while detailed in other aspects, completely omits
#     the value of 'D'. There is no information given that would allow 'D' to
#     be calculated (for example, by providing the Hubble constant).
#
# 4.  Without this crucial piece of input data, it is impossible to write a
#     program that can calculate a numerical answer for the travel time.
#
# 5.  The prompt's instructions state: "If you can write such a program, answer
#     in the form a:b ... Otherwise, answer 0:0."
#
# 6.  Since a program cannot be written to solve for 'a' and 'b' due to the
#     missing information, the correct response is "0:0".
