    "I will determine the answer by following these steps:\n1.  First, I will identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I will compile a list of the Academy Award for Best Picture winners in chronological order.\n3.  Then, I will examine the setting and notable scenes of each winning film to check if it depicts either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris's Place de la Concorde.\n4.  The first film on the list that meets this criterion will be the answer.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to present the name of the film, the year it won, and the location of the obelisk shown.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the first Best Picture Oscar winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n# There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n# After reviewing the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, I determined the following:\n# - Early winners like \"Wings\" (1927/28) or \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), while set in France, do not prominently feature the Place de la Concorde.\n# - No early winners are set in Luxor, Egypt.\n# - The film \"An American in Paris\" won Best Picture for the year 1951.\n# - This film is famous for its musical numbers set against the backdrop of iconic Parisian locations.\n# - One of the locations prominently featured in the film is the Place de la Concorde, which is where the Parisian Luxor Obelisk stands.\n\n# Therefore, \"An American in Paris\" is the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nmovie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\naward_year = 1951\nobelisk_location = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris\"\n\nprint(f\"The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk was '{movie_title}'.\")\nprint(f\"It won for the year {award_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The film shows the obelisk located at the {obelisk_location}.\")\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
