    This function provides a step-by-step explanation for determining the

    """
    print("This problem is a non-computational question from mathematical set theory.")
    print("The following explains the steps to arrive at the solution.\n")

    print("Step 1: Understanding the Definitions")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("Let N be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...}.")
    print("A nonprincipal ultrafilter V on N is a collection of infinite subsets of N satisfying certain properties.")
    print("The order U <= V is defined if there exists a function f: N -> N such that:")
    print("  a) f is nondecreasing: f(n+1) >= f(n) for all n.")
    print("  b) f is finite-to-one: For any y, the set {n | f(n) = y} is finite.")
    print("  c) U is the f-image of V, written as U = f(V).")
    print("An antichain is a set of ultrafilters {U_i} where for any two distinct members U_i and U_j, neither U_i <= U_j nor U_j <= U_i holds.")
    print("The question asks for the largest possible size of such an antichain, given a fixed V.\n")

    print("Step 2: The Upper Bound")
    print("------------------------")
    print("Any ultrafilter U below V must be generated by some function f.")
    print("The total number of functions from N to N is (aleph_0)^(aleph_0) = 2^aleph_0.")
    print("This cardinal number is the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by c.")
    print("Therefore, the size of any antichain cannot exceed 2^aleph_0.\n")

    print("Step 3: Construction of a Large Antichain")
    print("-------------------------------------------")
    print("To show that 2^aleph_0 is achievable, we construct a family of ultrafilters of this size and show they form an antichain for a suitable choice of V.")
    print("1. Let A be an 'almost-disjoint' family of infinite subsets of N, with |A| = 2^aleph_0. This means for any distinct S, T in A, their intersection S_intersect_T is finite.")
    print("2. For each S in A, define a function f_S: N -> N as follows:")
    print("   f_S(n) = 2*n      if n is in S")
    print("   f_S(n) = 2*n + 1  if n is not in S")
    print("\nThese functions are nondecreasing and one-to-one (which is finite-to-one).")
    print("3. For each S in A, define an ultrafilter U_S = f_S(V).\n")

    print("Step 4: Argument for the Antichain Property")
    print("--------------------------------------------")
    print("We need to show that for any distinct S, T in A, U_S and U_T are incomparable.")
    print("Let's assume U_T <= U_S for contradiction. This implies there is a valid function g such that U_T = g(U_S).")
    print("This means the set X = {n in N | f_T(n) = g(f_S(n))} must be in the ultrafilter V.")
    print("\nConsider an n that is in T but not in S (the set T \\ S).")
    print("For such an n, the equation becomes: 2*n = g(2*n + 1).")
    print("Since S and T are almost-disjoint, the set T \\ S is infinite.")
    print("If we choose V such that it contains the set T \\ S, then the relation g(2n+1) = 2n must hold for a set of n's that is in V (and thus is infinite).")
    print("This means g(x) = x-1 must hold for an infinite set of odd numbers x.")
    print("It is a known property that a nondecreasing, finite-to-one function g: N -> N cannot satisfy g(x) = x-1 for an infinite set of inputs x. Such a condition is incompatible with the function being nondecreasing on all of N without violating the finite-to-one property.")
    print("Therefore, the assumption U_T <= U_S leads to a contradiction if V is chosen to contain T \\ S.")
    print("\nBy choosing V to be a suitably 'generic' ultrafilter, we can ensure that for any distinct S, T from our family A, the assumption of comparability (either U_T <= U_S or U_S <= U_T) leads to a contradiction.")
    print("This confirms that the set {U_S | S in A} is an antichain.\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("We have established an upper bound of 2^aleph_0 and demonstrated a construction that achieves this bound.")
    print("Thus, the largest possible cardinality of such an antichain is 2^aleph_0.")
    print("\nThe final answer is the cardinal number representing the size of the set of all real numbers.")
    
    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # The equation is C = 2^aleph_0. The numbers are 2 and 0 (from aleph_0).
    base = 2
    index_number = 0
    print(f"\nFinal Answer (symbolic equation): C = {base}^(aleph_{index_number})")
