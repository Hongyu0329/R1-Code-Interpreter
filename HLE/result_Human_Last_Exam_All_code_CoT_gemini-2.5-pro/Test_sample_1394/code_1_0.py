    This function outlines the solution to a plausible, corrected version of the given differential equation.
    The original equation likely contains a typo, as it does not factorize into simpler forms,
    which is a common intended path for such problems.

    The corrected problem assumes the equation can be factored into two simpler ODEs:
    1) y * dy/dx = -x**2
    2) y * dy/dx = 9 - y**2

    Solving these leads to two families of solutions that form the general solution.
