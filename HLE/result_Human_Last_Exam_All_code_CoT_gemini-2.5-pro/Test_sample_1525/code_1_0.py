    # --- Analysis of each statement ---

    # Statement A: Correct.
    # The definition of the segregation process P_{k+1} depends on C_P, a multiset of
    # constants indexed by their "order of appearance". This ordering is not formally
    # defined for a Datalog program (which is a set of facts and rules),
    # making the process ambiguous. The statement correctly points out this lack of rigor.
    is_a_correct = True

    # Statement B: Incorrect.
    # This statement misinterprets the claim. The claim is about the final output of
    # the program on a set of facts, i.e., `... (S_0) = P(S_0)`, not about program
    # identity, i.e., `gamma[gamma^{-1}[P]] = P`. In fact, a careful analysis shows
    # that `gamma[gamma^{-1}[P]]` results in a singleton set `{P}`, and `{P}(S_0)`
    # is equivalent to `P(S_0)`, so the first part of the claim holds. The statement
    # is incorrect because it critiques a claim that wasn't made.
    is_b_correct = False

    # Statement C: Correct.
    # This statement makes a correct general observation about the operators.
    # Aggregation `gamma` can be lossy. If multiple distinct constants `c'` and `c''`
    # are mapped to the same constant `c`, this information is lost. The segregation
    # operation `gamma^{-1}` cannot uniquely recover the original program; instead,
    # it generates a set of possible original programs. Therefore, `gamma^{-1}[gamma[P]]`
    # is not generally identical to `P`. This is a correct and important piece of context.
    is_c_correct = True

    # Statement D: Correct.
    # Similar to statement A, this statement correctly identifies an ambiguity in the
    # definition of segregation as applied to a set of facts, `gamma^{-1}[S_0]`.
    # The notation and recursive definition are not explicit about how multiple
    # constant occurrences are handled, leading to uncertainty about whether it generates
    # all combinations or follows some other procedure. The definition is unclear.
    is_d_correct = True

    # Statement E: Correct.
    # This statement provides an excellent high-level interpretation of the claim.
    # The conditions `gamma[P]=P` and `gamma[S_0]=S_0` indeed establish a "stable level of
    # granularity". The equation `gamma[gamma^{-1}[P](gamma^{-1}[S_0])] = P(S_0)` shows
    # that refining the granularity (segregation), performing the computation, and then
    # coarsening the result (aggregation) is equivalent to computing at the stable,
    # coarse-grained level. It correctly paraphrases the claim's meaning.
    is_e_correct = True

    # --- Count the correct statements ---
    correct_statements = [is_a_correct, is_b_correct, is_c_correct, is_d_correct, is_e_correct]
    count = sum(correct_statements)

    # The final equation is simply the count of correct statements.
