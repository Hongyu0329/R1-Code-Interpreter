# The problem asks for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of the
# Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f from R to R, in the Stone-Cech remainder.

# As derived in the reasoning above, the number of fixed points can be 0 (e.g., for f(x) = -x).
# The number of fixed points can be 2 (e.g., for f(x) = x + 1).
# We demonstrated that for the function f(x) = x^2 + 1, the number of fixed points is exactly 1.

# Since the number of fixed points is an integer, the smallest possible *nonzero* number is 1.
