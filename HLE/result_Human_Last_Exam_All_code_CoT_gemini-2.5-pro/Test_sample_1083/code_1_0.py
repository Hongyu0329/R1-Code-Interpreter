    This function determines the classification for the asymptotic bounds on arboricity.
    f_1 corresponds to the case c=1.
    f_2 corresponds to the case c=2.
    
    The analysis shows that for any subgraph H of G, the expected number of edges in the
    sampled subgraph H' is at most half the expected number of vertices, for both c=1 and c=2.
    This implies that the resulting graph G' is globally and locally sparse.
    A graph where |E(S)| <= C * |V(S)| for all subgraphs S has arboricity at most C.
    Our analysis of expectations E[|E(S')|] <= 0.5 * E[|V(S')|] suggests C=O(1).
    This holds for both c=1 and c=2.
    
    Therefore, both f_1(n) and f_2(n) are O(1).
    According to the problem description, O(1) corresponds to category 1.
