# Step 1: Analyze the constraints for a number to be in [0, 1].
# The formula for the floating-point number is v = (-1)^s * 2^(E - B) * (1 + M).

# Constraint v >= 0:
# For the number to be non-negative, the sign bit 's' must be 0.
# This means the term (-1)^s is always 1. So, the number of bits needed for 's' is 0.

# Constraint v <= 1:
# The formula becomes v = 2^(E - B) * (1 + M).
# The mantissa 'M' represents a fraction, so the term (1 + M) is in the range [1, 2).
# For v to be at most 1, we must have 2^(E - B) <= 1, which implies E - B <= 0, or E <= B.

# Step 2: Count the number of unique, representable values in [0, 1].
# This is equivalent to counting the valid combinations of the exponent 'E' and mantissa 'M'.

# The mantissa 'M' is represented by 'm' bits, giving 2^m possible values.
# The exponent 'E' is constrained by E <= B.

# We can split the counting into two cases based on the value of E:
# Case 1: E is in the range [0, 1, ..., B-1].
# There are 'B' possible integer values for E in this range. For each of these,
# M can be any of its 2^m values.
# Number of combinations for this case = B * (2**m).

# Case 2: E = B.
# If E = B, the value is v = 2^(B - B) * (1 + M) = 1 + M.
# For v <= 1, M must be 0.
# This gives only one combination: (E=B, M=0), which represents the number 1.0.

# The total number of representable values, N, is the sum of the counts from both cases.
# N = (B * 2**m) + 1

# Step 3: Calculate the number of bits required to choose one value uniformly from N possibilities.
# The information content, or the minimum number of bits required, is log2(N).
# Required bits = log2(B * 2**m + 1)

# Step 4: Simplify the expression.
# For typical floating-point systems, B and m are large, so B * 2**m is a very large number.
# The '+ 1' has a negligible effect on the logarithm.
# So, we can approximate log2(B * 2**m + 1) by log2(B * 2**m).
# Using the properties of logarithms:
# log2(B * 2**m) = log2(B) + log2(2**m)
# log2(B * 2**m) = log2(B) + m

# The result is m + log2(B). This matches answer choice A.
