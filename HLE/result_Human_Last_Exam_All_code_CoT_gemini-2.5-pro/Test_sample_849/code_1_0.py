    This function determines and prints the safe goal for the model M.

    The problem states that the model cannot a priori prove the success of its predictors
    because the set of truly successful predictors is uncomputable. Therefore, the model
    must abandon the goal of optimizing for this unknowable success metric.

    The only computable and reliable source of information available to the model is the
    step-by-step feedback it receives when its prediction is compared against the actual
    digit. A safe and computable goal is to learn directly from this feedback stream.

    This process can be framed as:
    - learning_type: The model takes actions (choosing a predictor) and receives rewards
      (1 if correct, 0 if not). This is the definition of "Reinforcement learning".
    - data_source: The feedback comes from the user-provided sequence, which is a form of
      "human feedback".

    Completing the template {_______ learning} from {_______} yields the final answer.
