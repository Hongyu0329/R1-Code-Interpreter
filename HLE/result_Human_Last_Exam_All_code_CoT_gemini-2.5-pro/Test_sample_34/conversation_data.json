    "To determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, we need to consult a standard pre-flop opening range chart for a 100BB cash game. The button is the most profitable position, allowing for the widest opening range.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List all suited Jack hands, ranked from best to worst based on their kickers.\n2.  Define a standard Button opening range based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles. In a 100BB, rake-free game, this range is very wide (often around 48-50% of hands).\n3.  Find the weakest hand from our list of suited Jacks that is still included in this standard opening range.\n4.  The script will then print this hand as the answer.\n\nBased on GTO solver outputs, a player on the button should open-raise all suited Jack combinations. Therefore, the one with the lowest kicker is the \"worst\" among them that is still a profitable open.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_openable_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open-raise from the button\n    in a standard 100BB NLHE cash game scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. List all suited Jack hands, ordered from best (JTs) to worst (J2s).\n    suited_jacks_ranked = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    # 2. Define a standard GTO button opening range. In a 100BB game, especially\n    #    rake-free, this range is very wide and includes all suited Jacks.\n    #    We represent the suited Jack portion of the range here.\n    button_opening_range = {\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"}\n    \n    # 3. Find the worst hand that should be opened.\n    #    We iterate through our ranked list. The last hand we encounter that is also\n    #    in the opening range is by definition the worst one to open.\n    worst_jack_to_open = None\n    for hand in suited_jacks_ranked:\n        if hand in button_opening_range:\n            # This hand is a standard open. Since we are iterating from best to worst,\n            # we continuously update our answer. The last one will be the correct one.\n            worst_jack_to_open = hand\n            \n    # 4. Print the result.\n    if worst_jack_to_open:\n        print(f\"Based on standard GTO ranges, all suited Jacks are opened from the button.\")\n        print(f\"The hand with the lowest kicker in this category is the 'worst' profitable open.\")\n        print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_jack_to_open}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine the hand based on the provided ranges.\")\n\nfind_worst_openable_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
