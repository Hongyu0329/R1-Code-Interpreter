    This function determines and prints the maximum integer k for which counting
    k-matchings in a graph can be done in subcubic time in the number of vertices.

    The analysis is based on current research in fine-grained complexity:
    - For k=1 and k=2, the problem is solvable in O(n^2) time, which is subcubic.
    - For k=3, the problem is solvable in O(n^w) time (w is the matrix multiplication
      exponent, w < 2.373), which is subcubic.
    - For k=4, the problem requires n^(3-o(1)) time under the standard APSP
      hypothesis, which is not subcubic.

    Therefore, the maximum value of k is 3.
