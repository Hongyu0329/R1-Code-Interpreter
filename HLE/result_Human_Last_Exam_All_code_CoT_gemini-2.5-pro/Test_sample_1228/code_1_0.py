# Step 1: Calculate the total semileptonic branching ratio for K_L.
# This is the probability that a K_L will decay via one of these neutrino-producing channels.
total_semileptonic_BR = BR_KL_e + BR_KL_mu

# Step 2: Explain the setup.
# An initial decay X -> K^0 + K^0_bar produces, on average, one K_L particle.
# The net neutrino asymmetry is generated when this K_L decays.
# The net number of neutrinos produced per K_L is the product of the total semileptonic
# branching ratio and the charge asymmetry parameter delta_L.

# Net Neutrino Number = (Number of K_L) * (Prob. of semileptonic decay) * (Asymmetry per decay)
# We assume 1 K_L is produced per initial event.
num_KL = 1.0

# Step 3: Calculate the net number of neutrinos (neutrinos - antineutrinos)
# produced per initial symmetric decay event.
net_neutrino_number = num_KL * total_semileptonic_BR * delta_L

# Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.
