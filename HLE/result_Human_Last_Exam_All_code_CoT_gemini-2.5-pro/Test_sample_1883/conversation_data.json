    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this stereochemistry problem using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction is the thermal ring-closure of a conjugated polyene, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an electrocyclic reaction.\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** The outcome of an electrocyclic reaction is governed by the number of π-electrons and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n    *   The reactant is a tetraene, so it has 4 double bonds, which means there are 8 π-electrons involved in the reaction.\n    *   Systems with 4n π-electrons (where n is an integer; here n=2) follow a specific rule under thermal conditions.\n3.  **Determine the Mode of Ring Closure:** According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, thermal electrocyclic reactions involving 4n π-electrons proceed via a **conrotatory** motion of the terminal orbitals.\n4.  **Analyze the Reactant's Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the conjugated system determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   The reactant is (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. We are interested in the stereochemistry at the ends of the conjugated system: the C2=C3 double bond and the C8=C9 double bond.\n    *   The **(2Z)** configuration means the methyl group (on C2) points \"inward\" relative to the C-shape of the polyene chain.\n    -   The **(8E)** configuration means the other methyl group (on C9) points \"outward\".\n    *   This arrangement is known as **\"in/out\"**.\n5.  **Predict the Product:** We combine the mode of closure with the reactant's stereochemistry. The rule is that for a **conrotatory** closure, an **\"in/out\"** reactant gives a **trans** product.\n6.  **Determine the Ratio:**\n    *   The *trans*-isomer is labeled as product B.\n    *   The FMO theory predicts that the conrotatory pathway to form the *trans* product (B) is energetically \"allowed\".\n    *   The formation of the *cis*-isomer (A) would require a disrotatory closure, which is \"forbidden\" under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the theory predicts that only the allowed product (B) is formed. The ratio of the forbidden product (A) to the allowed product (B) is 0:1.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this logic to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef predict_electrocyclic_product_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the product ratio of a thermal electrocyclic reaction\n    using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
