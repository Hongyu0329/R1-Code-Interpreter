The edges of the image become smoother and rounder. This process, which approximates mean curvature flow, causes convex parts of an edge to shrink and concave parts to expand. Over many iterations ($t \rightarrow \infty$), any isolated shape will tend towards a circle, shrink, and ultimately disappear, leaving a solid-colored image.
