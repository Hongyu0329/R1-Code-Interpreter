# The problem decouples into an infinite number of scalar equations.
# We analyze the solvability conditions for each equation type.

# Case 1: The first 2024 equations have the form x'(t) = tanh(t)x(t) + f(t).
# The homogeneous part x' = tanh(t)x has only the trivial (zero) bounded solution.
# This leads to two solvability conditions for each of these equations.
num_equations_with_conditions = 2024
conditions_per_equation = 2

# Case 2: The remaining infinite equations have the form x'(t) = -tanh(t)x(t) + f(t).
# The homogeneous part x' = -tanh(t)x has a family of bounded solutions C/cosh(t).
# The free constant C can always be chosen to satisfy the boundary condition.
# This means there are no solvability conditions for these equations.
num_equations_without_conditions = "infinite"
conditions_for_these = 0

# The total number of conditions is the sum from all equations.
total_conditions = num_equations_with_conditions * conditions_per_equation
