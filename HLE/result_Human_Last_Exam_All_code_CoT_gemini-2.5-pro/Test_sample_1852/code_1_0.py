    print("   - The sequence is 'almost decreasing': for alpha < beta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable (written as x_beta subset_of_* x_alpha).")
    print("   - The tower is 'maximal': No uncountable set y exists that is an 'almost subset' of all x_alpha in the tower.")
    print(f"   - This structure corresponds to a maximal, well-ordered, strictly decreasing chain in the Boolean algebra P({omega_1})/I, where I is the ideal of countable subsets.")

    print(f"   - {delta_2} = inf(X) is the 'tower number' of this algebra.")

    print(f"2. Determining {delta_2} (the infimum of X):")
    print(f"   - First, we show that no tower can have length {omega_1}. This implies {delta_2} > {omega_1}.")
    print(f"   - Proof sketch: Let <x_alpha : alpha < {omega_1}> be an 'almost decreasing' sequence of uncountable subsets of {omega_1}.")
    print("     By a standard diagonalization argument, one can construct an uncountable set Y which is an 'almost subset' of every x_alpha.")
    print("     This construction involves, for each alpha, picking an element for Y from x_alpha that has not been picked yet. This is possible because x_alpha is uncountable.")
    print("     The existence of such a Y violates the maximality condition for a tower. Thus, no tower of length omega_1 exists.")
    print(f"   - Since {delta_2} is a regular cardinal and {delta_2} > {omega_1}, the smallest possible value for {delta_2} is {omega_2}.\n")
    
    print(f"   - Second, we establish an upper bound for {delta_2}.")
    print("   - A tower of length lambda corresponds to a strictly decreasing chain of length lambda in the Boolean algebra.")
    print(f"   - The length of any such chain is at most the size of the algebra, which is |P({omega_1})/I| = 2^{omega_1}.")
    print(f"   - We are given 2^{omega_1} = {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - Therefore, any tower must have a length {lambda_char} <= {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - This implies {delta_2} = inf(X) <= {omega_2}.\n")
    
    print(f"   - Combining the lower and upper bounds: {omega_2} <= {delta_2} <= {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - Thus, {delta_2} = {omega_2}.\n")

    print(f"3. Determining {delta_1} (the supremum of X):")
    print(f"   - From the previous step, any {lambda_char} in X must satisfy {lambda_char} <= {omega_2}. This means {delta_1} = sup(X) <= {omega_2}.")
    print("   - A known theorem in set theory (due to Hechler, generalized) states that if lambda is a regular cardinal and 2^kappa >= lambda, then a tower of length lambda exists in P(kappa)/I_{<kappa}).")
    print(f"   - In our case, kappa = {omega_1}. We are given 2^{omega_1} = {omega_2}. Let's test {lambda_char} = {omega_2}, which is a regular cardinal.")
    print(f"   - The condition 2^{omega_1} >= {omega_2} holds true.")
    print(f"   - Therefore, a tower of length {omega_2} exists. This means {omega_2} is in X.")
    print(f"   - Since {omega_2} is in X, the supremum of X must be at least {omega_2}. So, {delta_1} >= {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - Combining the bounds: {omega_2} <= {delta_1} <= {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - Thus, {delta_1} = {omega_2}.\n")

    print(f"   - We found {delta_1} = {omega_2} and {delta_2} = {omega_2}.")
    print(f"   - By cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.")
    print(f"   - So, {omega_2} + {omega_2} = {omega_2}.\n")
