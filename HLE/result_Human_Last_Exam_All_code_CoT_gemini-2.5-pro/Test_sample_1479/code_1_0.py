    # Step 1: Explain Type-1 Fuzzy Sets
    print("1. Type-1 Fuzzy Set Structure:")
    print("   - A Type-1 membership function (MF) maps each element from the universe of discourse (x-axis) to a crisp membership grade between 0 and 1 (y-axis).")
    print("   - This creates a 2-dimensional structure.\n")

    # Step 2: Explain Type-2 Fuzzy Sets
    print("2. Type-2 Fuzzy Set Structure:")
    print("   - A Type-2 MF handles uncertainty about the membership grade itself. For each element, the membership grade is not a single value but a Type-1 fuzzy set.")
    print("   - This adds a third dimension (secondary membership grade).")
    print("   - The uncertainty is captured by a 2D region called the 'Footprint of Uncertainty' (FOU).")
    print("   - The overall model relating an input variable to its uncertain membership is 3-dimensional.\n")

    # Step 3: Explain Type-3 Fuzzy Sets
    print("3. Type-3 Fuzzy Set Structure:")
    print("   - A Type-3 MF adds another layer of uncertainty. The membership of an element is described by a Type-2 fuzzy set.")
    print("   - This means the secondary membership grades from the Type-2 definition are now also fuzzy.")
    print("   - The structure used to model this new, deeper uncertainty is a 3-dimensional shape called the 'Volume of Uncertainty' (VOU).\n")

    # Step 4: Identify the Fundamental Difference
    print("4. Fundamental Difference (Type-2 vs. Type-3):")
    print("   - The core structural change when moving from Type-2 to Type-3 is in how uncertainty is modeled.")
    print("   - Type-2 uses a 2-dimensional structure (the FOU) to model uncertainty.")
    print("   - Type-3 introduces a 3-dimensional structure (the VOU) to model uncertainty.")
    print("   - Therefore, the fundamental difference is the addition of three-dimensional uncertainty modeling.\n")

    # Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choice
    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("Based on the analysis, the choice that best describes this transition is 'Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling added'.")
    print("The model of uncertainty itself graduates from a 2D plane (FOU) to a 3D volume (VOU).\n")
