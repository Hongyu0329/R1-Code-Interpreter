    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Operation:** The problem describes a graph \\( G \\) that is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, also known as the graph join (denoted \\( G_1 + G_2 \\)), is formed by taking the disjoint union of the graphs and adding edges connecting every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) to every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Sum:** A fundamental property of the chromatic number with respect to the graph join operation is that it is additive. For any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their sum is \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This extends to the sum of multiple graphs.\n\n3.  **Apply the Property to \\( G \\):** Our graph is \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). Using the additive property, its chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n4.  **Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( C_n \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on whether its length \\( n \\) (for \\( n \\ge 3 \\)) is even or odd:\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is a bipartite graph and can be colored with just two colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, it is impossible to color the cycle with only two colors. A third color is required for the last vertex. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n5.  **Find the Maximal Chromatic Number:** To find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must use the maximal possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). Comparing the two cases, the maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3. This occurs when \\( n \\) is any odd integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:** We substitute the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our formula for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n    Maximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot (\\text{maximal } \\chi(C_n)) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number_sum_of_cycles():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of cycles being summed.\n    num_cycles = 3\n\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on its length n.\n    # Case 1: n is even (n >= 4).
