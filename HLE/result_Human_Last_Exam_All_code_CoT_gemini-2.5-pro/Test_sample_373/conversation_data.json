    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed from two complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, called the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\" edge. To have 10 nodes in total, the most standard configuration is to use two cliques of 5 nodes each (K5). Let's call the two cliques C1 and C2.\n2.  **Identify the Bridge Nodes:** One node from C1 (let's call it `u`) is connected to one node from C2 (let's call it `v`). The edge `(u, v)` is the bottleneck edge.\n3.  **Understand the Gossiping Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    a. A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from all `n` nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/n`.\n    b. Node `i` then selects one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of picking a specific neighbor `j` is `1/deg(i)`, where `deg(i)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `i`.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** We need to find the degrees of the bridge nodes `u` and `v`.\n    *   In a clique of size `m=5`, each node is connected to the other `m-1=4` nodes.\n    *   The bridge node `u` is connected to the 4 other nodes in its own clique (C1) AND to node `v`. So, its degree is `deg(u) = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of the other bridge node `v` is `deg(v) = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if the gossiping process selects it in either direction: from `u` to `v` or from `v` to `u`. We calculate the probability for each direction and add them together.\n    *   Probability of selecting `u` then `v`: `P(u -> v) = P(select u) * P(select v | u) = (1/n) * (1/deg(u))`.\n    *   Probability of selecting `v` then `u`: `P(v -> u) = P(select v) * P(select u | v) = (1/n) * (1/deg(v))`.\n    *   Total probability: `P(edge_uv) = P(u -> v) + P(v -> u)`.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** The Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
