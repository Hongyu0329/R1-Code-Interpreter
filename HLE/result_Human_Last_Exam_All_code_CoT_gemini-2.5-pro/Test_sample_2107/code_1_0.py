# Step 1: Define the values for X1 through X9 based on the riddles.
X1 = 26  # Iron's atomic number
X2 = 2   # A pair of shoes for a shoemaker
X3 = 3   # Mohs hardness of calcite/limestone
X4 = 10  # From the denominator in Tolstoy's 3/10 exponent
X5 = 2   # Phonetic riddle 'mews' -> 'twos'
X6 = 12  # Months in a calendar
X7 = 1   # A single dagger
X8 = 4   # Officer (e.g., 4 stripes on a captain's uniform)
X9 = 17  # Commerce (17 provinces of the Netherlands)

# Step 2: Verify the first equation to ensure the values are correct.
# The equation is: X1*X2 + (X3*X4 - X5*X6) + X7*X4 = X8*X9
left_side = X1 * X2 + (X3 * X4 - X5 * X6) + X7 * X4
right_side = X8 * X9

print("Verifying the first equation:")
print(f"{X1} * {X2} + ({X3} * {X4} - {X5} * {X6}) + {X7} * {X4} = {X8} * {X9}")
print(f"{left_side} = {right_side}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Determine the value of X12.
# The clue for X12 is the sequence: X9, X10, X11, X12.
# X10 is "namesake" (Russian: "однофамилец", 12 letters).
# X11 is "co-author" (Russian: "соавтор", 7 letters).
# We get their numerical values by counting the letters in the Russian words.

X10_num = 12
X11_num = 7

# The sequence of numbers is X9, X10_num, X11_num, ...
sequence = [X9, X10_num, X11_num]

# Identify the pattern in the sequence.
# It is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of -5.
# 17 - 5 = 12
# 12 - 5 = 7
common_difference = sequence[1] - sequence[0]

# Calculate X12 by continuing the sequence.
X12 = sequence[2] + common_difference

print("Finding X12 from the sequence X9, X10, X11...")
print(f"The sequence is: {sequence[0]}, {sequence[1]}, {sequence[2]}, ...")
print(f"The common difference is {common_difference}.")
print(f"X12 = {sequence[2]} + ({common_difference})")
print(f"The value of X12 is: {X12}")
