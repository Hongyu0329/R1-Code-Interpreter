    "This is a classic poker scenario involving stack size, position, and tournament pressure (ICM). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the situation to determine the correct hand to shove all-in.\n\n**1. Understand the Situation:**\n*   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under the Gun + 1). This is an early position, meaning you have to act before most of your opponents. Shoving from early position requires a stronger hand range because there are many players left to act who could wake up with a premium hand.\n*   **Stack Size:** 16 Big Blinds (bb). This is a \"shove/fold\" stack size. You don't have enough chips to raise and then fold to a 3-bet, so your only viable moves with hands you want to play are to go all-in or fold.\n*   **Game Stage:** \"Near the money bubble\". This is the most critical factor. The Independent Chip Model (ICM) pressure is extremely high. Players with medium or big stacks will call your all-in with a much tighter range than usual because they don't want to risk busting you and letting other short stacks get into the money. This means when you *do* get called, you are likely facing a very strong hand. Therefore, you should also tighten your shoving range to account for this.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hand Options:**\n*   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This is a good playable hand, but shoving it from early position with 16bb on the bubble is too loose. You will be dominated by many hands that call you (e.g., AQ, KQ, JJ, QQ, KK, AA).\n*   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** Stronger than QJs, but it suffers from similar domination issues. If you get called, it's often by AQ, AK, or a big pair, all of which have you in bad shape. This is generally considered too wide for a bubble shove from UTG+1.\n*   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** This is a strong hand and a profitable shove in many 16bb scenarios. However, on the bubble from early position, it's borderline. When called by a tight range (e.g., TT+, AQ+), you are often a significant underdog or flipping at best. While it's a potential shove, it's not as clear-cut as other premium hands.\n*   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand. It has excellent equity against the entire range of hands. It dominates all other Ax and Kx hands. Against pocket pairs like QQ or JJ, it's roughly a coin flip. Even against the very tight calling range you expect on the bubble (e.g., TT+, AQs+, AK), AKo performs well. It is a standard and mandatory all-in in this spot, despite the ICM pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the options, AKo is the clearest and most profitable hand to shove all-in. While 99 is borderline, AKo is a premium holding that is strong enough to shove from any position with this stack size, even on the money bubble.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poker_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the optimal hand to shove all-in with 16bb UTG+1 on the bubble.\n    \"\"\"\n    position = \"UTG+1 (Early Position)\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble (High ICM pressure)\"\n\n    hands = {\n        \"A\": \"QJs (Queen-Jack suited)\",\n        \"B\": \"None of these\",\n        \"C\": \"99 (Pocket Nines)\",\n        \"D\": \"AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit)\",\n        \"E\": \"AKo (Ace-King offsuit)\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Scenario Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"  - Position: {position}\")\n    print(f\"  - Stack: {stack_bb} Big Blinds\")\n    print(f\"  - Game State: {situation}\\n\")\n    print(\"This is a 'shove-or-fold' situation.
