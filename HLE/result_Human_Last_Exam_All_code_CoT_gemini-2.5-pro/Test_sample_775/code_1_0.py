def solve_intersection_components():
    """
    This function determines the largest number of components of the intersection
    of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.

    Let the two sets be A and B, and S be the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].
    We are given:
    1. A and B are closed subsets of the plane.
    2. A and B are connected.
    3. A U B = S.

    We want to find the maximum number of connected components of the intersection C = A \cap B.

    Simple examples, like dividing the square into two rectangles, yield an intersection
    with one component. Topological tools like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence also suggest
    a single component, but they rely on an assumption (that the interiors of A and B cover S)
    which is not guaranteed.

    In fact, this is a classic problem in topology. It has been proven that for any finite integer n,
    one can construct sets A and B that satisfy the conditions and whose intersection has exactly n
    components. It is also possible to construct an example with a countably infinite number of components.

    A common way to construct an example for n components is to let one set, say A, be the union
    of n disjoint closed disks D_1, ..., D_n, made connected by adding a set of "thin" tubes or
    lines between them. The second set, B, can then be constructed based on the complement of A in the
    square. With careful construction (for example, using "interlocking combs"), one can create situations
    where the intersection A \cap B has multiple, disjoint components.

    Since we can construct an intersection with n components for any arbitrarily large integer n,
    there is no finite "largest number". The number of components is unbounded.
    Therefore, the answer is infinity.

    The problem asks for code to solve the task and to output a number. We will output the
    floating-point representation of infinity. The prompt also asks for an equation, but this
    problem is conceptual and not based on solving an algebraic equation.
