    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ that are proper subfields of the splitting field $K$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Determine the Galois Group**: First, we need to find the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The structure of this group is key to finding all subfields. Calculating the Galois group of a degree 7 polynomial is a complex task that typically requires specialized computer algebra systems like PARI/GP or Magma. For this specific polynomial, the Galois group is known to be the Projective Special Linear Group $PSL(2, 7)$.\n\n2.  **Use the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory**: This theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields $L$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and the subgroups $H$ of the Galois group $G$.\n\n3.  **Identify Normal Extensions**: A sub-extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n4.  **Consider the Field Conditions**: The problem asks for fields $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. This means we are looking for proper subfields that are not $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $K$. In terms of subgroups, this corresponds to finding normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are proper and non-trivial, i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$, where $\\{e\\}$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Galois Group**: The group $G = PSL(2, 7)$ is a simple group. A simple group, by definition, has no proper non-trivial normal subgroups. Its only normal subgroups are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ and the group $G$ itself.\n    *   The subgroup $H = \\{e\\}$ corresponds to the entire splitting field $L = K$.\n    *   The subgroup $H = G$ corresponds to the base field $L = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n6.  **Find the Degrees**: The degree of an extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the corresponding subgroup $H$ in $G$, which is $|G|/|H|$. Since there are no normal subgroups between $\\{e\\}$ and $G$, there are no normal extensions $L$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The set of possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is empty. The following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the resulting list of degrees, which is empty.\n\n```python\ndef find_degrees_of_normal_subfields():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the possible degrees of proper normal subfields\n    of the splitting field K of the polynomial x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 over Q.\n    The logic is based on Galois theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Galois group G of the polynomial x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6\n    # over Q is known to be the simple group PSL(2, 7).
