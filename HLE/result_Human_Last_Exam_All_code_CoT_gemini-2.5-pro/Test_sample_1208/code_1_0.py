# The user wants to identify the best statements regarding a patient's opioid tapering plan.
# I will analyze each statement's clinical validity and then find the best combination from the answer choices.

# Statement I: Maintain current regimen and taper slowly.
# Analysis: Plausible but may be insufficient as the patient is already struggling.
is_statement_I_best = False

# Statement II: Transition to methadone.
# Analysis: A strong, valid clinical option for both pain and OUD.
is_statement_II_best = True

# Statement III: Rapid opioid taper.
# Analysis: Clinically inappropriate and potentially dangerous for high-dose opioid dependence.
is_statement_III_best = False

# Statement IV: Multidisciplinary consultation.
# Analysis: Gold standard for complex cases. Ensures a holistic, safe, and individualized approach. Essential.
is_statement_IV_best = True

# Statement V: Prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone).
# Analysis: Directly addresses the patient's question. A first-line, safe, and effective option for managing withdrawal and facilitating a taper.
is_statement_V_best = True

# Conclusion:
# The best approach involves a comprehensive assessment by a team of experts (IV) who can then implement the best pharmacological strategy.
# Both methadone (II) and buprenorphine (V) are excellent pharmacological options.
# However, the combination that represents the highest standard of care and directly addresses the patient's question is the multidisciplinary consultation (IV) to guide the use of buprenorphine-naloxone (V).
# Therefore, the best combination of statements is IV and V.

# Let's find the answer choice corresponding to (IV, V).
