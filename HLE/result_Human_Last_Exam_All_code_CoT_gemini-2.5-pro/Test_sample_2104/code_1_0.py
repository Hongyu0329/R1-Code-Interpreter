# Step 1: Find n1 and n2.
# Based on the analysis, any positive even integer n satisfies the conditions.
# The 1st and 2nd smallest positive integers n are therefore 2 and 4.
n1 = 2
n2 = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the period T.
# The Hamiltonian is given by H = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - C * q^k)
# where k = n1/2 and C = (2/n1) * sqrt((n2-n1)/(n1/2))
# For n1=2, k=1. The potential is quadratic, describing a simple harmonic oscillator.
# The equation of motion is d^2(q)/dt^2 + omega^2 * (q - q0) = 0.
# From the potential V(q) = 1/2 * q^2 - C/2 * q, the force is F = -V'(q) = -q + C/2.
# For unit mass, the equation of motion is d^2(q)/dt^2 = -q + C/2, so d^2(q)/dt^2 + q = C/2.
# The angular frequency omega^2 is the coefficient of q, so omega^2 = 1.
omega = 1.0

# The period of the oscillator is T = 2 * pi / omega.
# The function T(alpha) is defined as this period.
period = 2 * math.pi / omega
