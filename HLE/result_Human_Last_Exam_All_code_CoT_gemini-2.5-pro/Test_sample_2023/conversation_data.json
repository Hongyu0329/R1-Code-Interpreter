    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a, b, c)`**: The recurrence relation `f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)` with the base case `f(0,0,0)=1` implies that `f(a,b,c)` is the number of ways to form the triplet `(a,b,c)` using steps `(1,0,0)`, `(0,2,0)`, and `(0,3,0)`. This is a classic combinatorial problem, and the solution is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    `f(a, b, c) = (k_1 + k_2 + k_3)! / (k_1! * k_2! * k_3!)`\n    where `k_1 = a`, `k_2 = b/2`, and `k_3 = c/3`. This formula is valid only if `b` is an even number and `c` is a multiple of 3; otherwise, `f(a, b, c) = 0`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the arguments `α_p, β_p, γ_p`**: We need to compute `f(α_p, β_p, γ_p) mod p`. The arguments are very large numbers, so we cannot compute them directly. The problem involves modular arithmetic with a large prime `p`.\n    First, we check the conditions for the `f` function. `β_p` is a sum of even terms, so it's even. `γ_p` is term-by-term 3 times `α_p`, so `γ_p = 3α_p`, which means `γ_p` is a multiple of 3. The conditions are met.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem**: To compute a multinomial coefficient modulo a prime `p`, we can use the multinomial extension of Lucas's Theorem. This theorem states that `C(n; k_1, ..., k_m) ≡ ∏ C(n_i; k_{1,i}, ..., k_{m,i}) (mod p)`, where `n_i` and `k_{j,i}` are the digits of `n` and `k_j` in base `p`.\n\n4.  **Find base-`p` digits**: We need the base-`p` expansions of `A = α_p`, `B = β_p/2`, and `C = γ_p/3`. The definitions of `α_p`, `β_p`, `γ_p` are sums of powers of `p`, which conveniently gives us their base-`p` representation.\n    *   `α_p = ∑ (1*p^{3i} + 3*p^{3i+1} + 4*p^{3i+2})` -> Digits of `A=α_p` are `(..., 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1)_p`.\n    *   `β_p = ∑ (8*p^{3i} + 4*p^{3i+1} + 4*p^{3i+2})` -> Digits of `B=β_p/2` are `(..., 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4)_p`.\n    *   `γ_p = 3α_p` -> Digits of `C=γ_p/3` are the same as `A`: `(..., 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1)_p`.\n\n5.  **Construct the product**: The result is the product of multinomial coefficients of the digits. The sequence of digits repeats every 3 positions. Let's denote the repeating block of coefficients as `M`.\n    *   For digits at positions `3i`: `C(1+4+1; 1, 4, 1) = C(6; 1, 4, 1) = 30`.\n    *   For digits at positions `3i+1`: `C(3+2+3; 3, 2, 3) = C(8; 3, 2, 3) = 560`.\n    *   For digits at positions `3i+2`: `C(4+2+4; 4, 2, 4) = C(10; 4, 2, 4) = 3150`.\n    The product of these is `M = 30 * 560 * 3150 = 52,920,000`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value**: The product repeats for `i` from `0` to `(3p-1)/2`. The number of repetitions is `(3p-1)/2 + 1 = (3p+1)/2`.\n    So, `f(α_p, β_p, γ_p) ≡ M^((3p+1)/2) (mod p)`.\n    Using Fermat's Little Theorem (`a^p ≡ a mod p`), we can simplify the exponent:\n    `M^((3p+1)/2) = M^(p + (p+1)/2) ≡ M * M^((p+1)/2) = M * M * M^((p-1)/2) = M^2 * M^((p-1)/2) (mod p)`.\n    The term `M^((p-1)/2) (mod p)` is the Legendre symbol `(M/p)`.\n\n7.  **Compute the Legendre Symbol**: We need to determine if `M` is a quadratic residue modulo `p`.\n    `M = 52,920,000 = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^4 * 7^2`.\n    `(M/p) = (2^6/p)(3^3/p)(5^4/p)(7^2/p) = (1) * (3/p) * (1) * (1) = (3/p)`.\n    Using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, `(3/p) = (p/3) * (-1)^((p-1)/2 * (3-1)/2) = (p/3) * (-1)^((p-1)/2)`.\n    *   `p = 2^{127} - 1`. `p-1 = 2^{127}-2`, so `(p-1)/2 = 2^{126}-1`, which is odd. Thus, `(-1)^((p-1)/2) = -1`.\n    *   `2 ≡ -1 (mod 3)`, so `p = 2^{127}-1 ≡ (-1)^{127}-1 = -1-1 = -2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`. So, `(p/3) = (1/3) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `(M/p) = (3/p) = 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n\n8.  **Final Result**: The result is `M^2 * (-1) = -M^2 (mod p)`. Since `M^2` is positive and smaller than `p`, this is calculated as `p - M^2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define a function for the multinomial coefficient C(n; k1, k2, ...)\ndef multinomial(n, ks):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the multinomial coefficient.\"\"\"\n    res = math.factorial(n)\n    for k in ks:\n        res //= math.factorial(k)\n    return res\n\n# The prime p is the Mersenne prime 2^127 - 1\np = 2**127 - 1\n\n# Calculate the repeating block of coefficients M\n# Digits for A are (1, 3, 4)\n# Digits for B are (4, 2, 2)\n# Digits for C are (1, 3, 4)\n# Sum of digits (N) are (6, 8, 10)\n\n# For positions 3i\nm0_n = 1 + 4 + 1\nm0_ks = [1, 4, 1]\nM0 = multinomial(m0_n, m0_ks)\n\n# For positions 3i+1\nm1_n = 3 + 2 + 3\nm1_ks = [3, 2, 3]\nM1 = multinomial(m1_n, m1_ks)\n\n# For positions 3i+2\nm2_n = 4 + 2 + 4\nm2_ks = [4, 2, 4]\nM2 = multinomial(m2_n, m2_ks)\n\n# M is the product of these coefficients\nM = M0 * M1 * M2\n\n# The final result is -M^2 mod p, which is p - M^2\nM_sq = M**2\nresult = p - M_sq\n\n# As per the instruction, print the numbers in the final equation\nprint(f\"p = {p}\")\nprint(f\"M = {M}\")\nprint(f\"M^2 = {M_sq}\")\nprint(f\"f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p = p - M^2\")\nprint(f\"Result = {p} - {M_sq} = {result}\")\n\n# Final Answer\n# print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n<<<170141183460469231731687303715881305801>>>"
