    "To solve this problem, we need to find all the ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. A computational approach using a backtracking algorithm is best suited for this combinatorial problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Board and Queens**: We are working with a board of size `n=5` and need to place `k=4` queens.\n2.  **Toroidal Attack Rules**: On a toroidal board, the rows, columns, and diagonals wrap around. A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if any of the following are true:\n    *   `r1 = r2` (same row)\n    *   `c1 = c2` (same column)\n    *   `(r1 - c1) % 5 = (r2 - c2) % 5` (same wrapped main diagonal)\n    *   `(r1 + c1) % 5 = (r2 + c2) % 5` (same wrapped anti-diagonal)\n3.  **Backtracking Algorithm**: We will write a recursive function to explore all possible placements.\n    *   The function will try to place one queen at a time on a safe square.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of squares in a different order, we will iterate through the board's 25 squares in a fixed order (from index 0 to 24). When placing the next queen, we only consider squares with an index greater than the previously placed queen's square.\n    *   If a placement of 4 queens is successful, we increment a counter.\n    *   The function will backtrack by removing the last placed queen to explore other possibilities.\n4.  **Final Output**: The code will execute this search and print the total count of valid arrangements. The numbers defining the problem (4 queens, 5x5 board) will be shown in the final output message.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens on an n x n\n    toroidal chessboard using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5  # The size of the chessboard (n x n)\n    k = 4  # The number of queens to place\n\n    # A global or non-local counter to store the number of solutions\n    solution_count = 0\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe from existing queens.\"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in placed_queens:\n            # Check for attacks on row, column, and wrapped diagonals\n            if (r == qr or\n                c == qc or\n                (r - c) % n == (qr - qc) % n or\n                (r + c) % n == (qr + qc) % n):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def backtrack(queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursive function to find valid queen placements.\n        \n        :param queens_to_place: Number of queens remaining to be placed.\n        :param start_index: The board square index to start searching from.\n        :param placed_queens: A list of (r, c) coordinates of already placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        nonlocal solution_count\n        \n        # Base case: If all queens are placed, we found a solution\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            solution_count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through the board squares to find a spot for the next queen\n        for i in range(start_index, n * n):\n            r = i // n\n            c = i % n\n\n            if is_safe(r, c, placed_queens):\n                # Place the queen\n                placed_queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recur to place the rest of the queens\n                backtrack(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, placed_queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                placed_queens.pop()\n\n    # Start the backtracking process\n    backtrack(k, 0, [])\n\n    # The \"final equation\" is conceptual: Result = Count(queens=4, board_size=5)\n    # The code outputs all the numbers involved.\n    print(f\"Board size (n x n): {n}x{n}\")\n    print(f\"Number of queens (k): {k}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of ways: {solution_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<250>>>\n```"
