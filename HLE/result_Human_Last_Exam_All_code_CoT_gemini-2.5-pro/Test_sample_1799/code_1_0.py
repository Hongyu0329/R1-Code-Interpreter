    # Step 1: Define the postulates and the question.
    print("This program analyzes whether the second postulate of special relativity can be derived from the first.")
    print("-" * 80)
    print("The Postulates are:")
    print("1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.")
    print("2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum, c, has the same value in all inertial frames of reference.")
    print("-" * 80)

    # Step 2: Present the argument that Postulate 2 SEEMS derivable.
    print("Argument: Why one might think Postulate 2 is a consequence of Postulate 1.")
    print("\n1. The 'laws of physics' mentioned in Postulate 1 must include Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.")
    print("2. Maxwell's equations predict that electromagnetic waves (like light) travel in a vacuum at a speed 'c'.")
    print("3. This speed is derived from two fundamental constants of nature, the vacuum permittivity (ε₀) and the vacuum permeability (μ₀).")
    
    # Printing the equation as requested
    print("\nThe equation is:")
    print("c = 1 / sqrt(ε₀ * μ₀)")

    print("\n4. If Postulate 1 is true, then Maxwell's equations must hold true for any observer in an inertial frame. This means the values of the fundamental constants ε₀ and μ₀ must also be the same for all such observers.")
    print("5. Therefore, the value of 'c' calculated from these constants must also be the same for all inertial observers.")
    print("6. This conclusion is identical to Postulate 2. So, it appears that Postulate 2 is simply a logical consequence of applying Postulate 1 to the laws of electromagnetism.")
    print("-" * 80)

    # Step 3: Present the counterargument explaining why Postulate 2 is NOT superfluous.
    print("Counter-Argument: Why Postulate 2 is considered independent and necessary.")
    print("\n1. Foundational Strength: By stating the constancy of the speed of light as a separate postulate, Einstein made it a fundamental principle about the nature of spacetime itself, rather than just a consequence of electromagnetism.")
    print("2. Generality: This makes the theory of relativity more robust. It would still hold true even if Maxwell's equations were later found to be an incomplete or approximate theory. The theory rests on principles of relativity and a universal speed limit, not on the specifics of light.")
    print("3. Historical and Logical Clarity: The conflict before Einstein was between Galilean relativity (our intuitive way of adding velocities) and Maxwell's prediction of a constant 'c'. Stating Postulate 2 explicitly highlights the core, counter-intuitive idea that had to be accepted to resolve this conflict: our notions of absolute space and time are incorrect.")
    print("-" * 80)

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("It is generally held that Postulate 2 is NOT superfluous. While strongly supported by applying Postulate 1 to electromagnetism, its status as an independent postulate is crucial. It establishes the constant speed 'c' as a fundamental feature of the universe's geometry, which is a more profound and general claim.")
