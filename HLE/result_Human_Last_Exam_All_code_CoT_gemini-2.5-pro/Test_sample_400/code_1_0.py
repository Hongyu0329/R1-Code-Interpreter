    Solves the connected components problem by carefully analyzing the space definition.

    # Step 1: Analyze the definition of the space X.
    # The space X is defined as the union of a line segment L and a series of segments L_n.
    # L is the line segment from p = (1, 0) to the origin (0, 0).
    # The problem defines p_n = (1, 1/n) and then states:
    # "Let each L_n be the line segment from p_1 to the origin."
    # The point p_1 corresponds to n=1, so p_1 = (1, 1/1) = (1, 1).
    #
    # This wording is critical: it means that L_1, L_2, L_3, ... are all the *same* line segment,
    # the one from (1, 1) to the origin. The definitions for p_2, p_3, ... are a distraction.
    #
    # Therefore, the union of all L_n segments is just L_1 itself.
    # The space X is the union of just two distinct segments: X = L U L_1.

    # Step 2: Describe the space X and the modified space Y.
    # X consists of the segment from (1, 0) to (0, 0) and the segment from (1, 1) to (0, 0).
    # These two segments meet only at the origin (0, 0).
    #
    # The problem asks to remove the origin, creating the space Y = X - {(0, 0)}.
    # Removing the origin eliminates the only connection point between L and L_1.

    # Step 3: Identify the connected components of Y.
    # After removing the origin, the space Y consists of two separate pieces:
    # 1. The line segment L, with the origin removed. This piece is connected.
    # 2. The line segment L_1, with the origin removed. This piece is also connected.
    # These two pieces do not touch, so they are disconnected from each other.
    # They represent the two connected components of the space Y.

    # Step 4: Formulate and print the final count.
