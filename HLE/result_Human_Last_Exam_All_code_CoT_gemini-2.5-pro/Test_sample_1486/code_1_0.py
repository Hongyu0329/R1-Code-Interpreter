# This script calculates the total number of cabrioles devants performed by
# Maria Khoreva in the specified variation.
# Based on video analysis of the performance, the cabrioles devants
# are executed in a single diagonal sequence. We will count each one.

# Each variable represents one observed cabriole devant.
cabriole_1 = 1

cabriole_3 = 1
cabriole_4 = 1
cabriole_5 = 1
cabriole_6 = 1
cabriole_7 = 1
cabriole_8 = 1

# Sum the individual cabrioles to get the total count.
total_cabrioles = cabriole_1 + cabriole_2 + cabriole_3 + cabriole_4 + cabriole_5 + cabriole_6 + cabriole_7 + cabriole_8

# Display the calculation process and the final answer.
