    "The user is asking for the specific term used to describe the time value between individual heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the correct terminology. The time between consecutive heartbeats is most commonly referred to as the \"Inter-beat interval\" (IBI) or, more specifically when using an ECG, the \"R-R interval\". Since the user mentions PPG, \"Inter-beat interval\" is a very appropriate term.\n2.  Create a simple Python script.\n3.  The script will store this term in a string variable.\n4.  The script will then print the answer to the user.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name for the value computed between heartbeats to measure HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value computed between heartbeats is the time interval.\n    # When measured using PPG, this is commonly called the Inter-beat interval (IBI).\n    # When measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), it is called the R-R interval.\n    term_name = \"Inter-beat interval (IBI)\"\n    alternative_term = \"R-R interval\"\n    \n    print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to calculate HRV is called the '{term_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It is the time duration between consecutive heartbeats. Another common name, especially in the context of ECGs, is the '{alternative_term}'.\")\n\nget_hrv_term()\n```\n<<<Inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
