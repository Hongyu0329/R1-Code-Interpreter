    This function identifies the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the
    increasing number of university entrants in Japan.
    
    Analysis of options:
    A. Incorrect. The 18-year-old population has declined sharply, as predicted.
       The error in prediction was about the consequences, not the demographic trend itself.
    B. Correct. The university enrollment rate has significantly increased,
       counteracting the population decline.
    C. Correct. While not the largest factor, the increase in adult learners is a
       real trend contributing to university enrollment.
    D. Incorrect. Other higher education institutions like specialized training colleges are
       primarily alternatives to, not feeder/prep schools for, four-year universities.
       They compete with universities rather than directly boosting their entrant numbers in this way.
    E. Correct. Government deregulation in the 1990s eased the establishment of new
       universities, increasing the supply of available spots.
    
    The incorrect/inappropriate options are A and D.
