    This function generates and prints the formula for P(n).
    The derivation is based on matching the asymptotic series of ln(Q(n))
    with the series of the given approximation ln(S(n)).
    The goal is to cancel out error terms to achieve a relative error of O((L/n)^4).
    
    The coefficients in the formula are derived from the Euler-Maclaurin formula
    and Taylor series expansions.
