    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule using the 6-31G basis set, we need to sum the number of functions contributed by each atom.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify atoms:** The molecule is toluene, C7H8. It has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine functions per Carbon:** In the 6-31G basis set, a first-row atom like Carbon has:\n    *   1 contracted function for the core 1s orbital.\n    *   4 contracted functions for the inner valence shell (one 2s and three 2p orbitals).\n    *   4 contracted functions for the outer valence shell (one 2s and three 2p orbitals).\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 functions.\n3.  **Determine functions per Hydrogen:** For a Hydrogen atom, the 6-31G basis set has:\n    *   1 contracted function for the inner part of the 1s orbital.\n    *   1 contracted function for the outer part of the 1s orbital.\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 functions.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThis script will perform the calculation and print the breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_basis_functions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8)\n    with the 6-31G basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\n    num_carbon = 7\n    num_hydrogen = 8\n\n    # Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n    # For Carbon: 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9\n    funcs_per_carbon = 9\n    # For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2\n    funcs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\n    total_funcs_carbon = num_carbon * funcs_per_carbon\n\n    # Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\n    total_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n    # Calculate the total number of functions for the molecule\n    total_funcs = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen})\")\n    print(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon}\")\n    print(f\"Number of functions per Carbon atom: {funcs_per_carbon}\")\n    print(f\"Contribution from Carbon = {num_carbon} * {funcs_per_carbon} = {total_funcs_carbon}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen}\")\n    print(f\"Number of functions per Hydrogen atom: {funcs_per_hydrogen}\")\n    print(f\"Contribution from Hydrogen = {num_hydrogen} * {funcs_per_hydrogen} = {total_funcs_hydrogen}\\n\")\n    print(\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\")\n    print(f\"{total_funcs_carbon} (from C) + {total_funcs_hydrogen} (from H) = {total_funcs}\")\n\ncalculate_basis_functions()\n```\n<<<79>>>"
