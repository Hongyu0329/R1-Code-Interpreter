    print("1. There is a constant, but weak, selective pressure to lower the mutation rate because most mutations are deleterious.")
    print("2. The power of natural selection to act on this weak pressure is limited by the power of genetic drift.")
    print("3. In small populations, drift is strong and can overwhelm weak selection. This creates a 'drift barrier' that prevents selection from reducing the mutation rate further.")
    print("4. Therefore, the mutation rate evolves to an equilibrium point determined by the balance between selection and drift.\n")

    # Illustrate the core concept of the Drift-Barrier Hypothesis with a conceptual equation
    print("The hypothesis can be conceptually modeled by the relationship between the selective advantage (s) of a lower mutation rate and the effective population size (Ne).")
    print("Drift dominates when s < 1/Ne. The mutation rate stabilizes where selection is just strong enough to overcome drift, so s ≈ 1/Ne.\n")

    s = 0.0001 # Example selective advantage for a better mutator allele
    Ne = 10000   # Example effective population size
