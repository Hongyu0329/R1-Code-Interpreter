    # The integrals evaluate to I1 = -pi and I2 = pi, which means the space L
    # consists of all symmetric matrices. The image of f is the set of all
    # symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices.

    # The expression for l(b) simplifies to:
    # l(b) = 101 + inf_{A in SPD} { min_k (k*mu_k + sum_{i=k+1 to n} mu_i) }
    # where mu_i are eigenvalues of A * P_inv * A.

    # We argue that the infimum is 0. We can demonstrate this by considering
    # A = epsilon * I. The expression inside the infimum becomes epsilon^2 times
    # a constant. As epsilon -> 0, the value approaches 0.

    # Therefore, l(b) = 101 for any b in (-1, 1).
