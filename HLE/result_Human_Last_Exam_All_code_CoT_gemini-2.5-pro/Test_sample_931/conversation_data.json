    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, we need to consult entomological knowledge.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Research the diet of adult Raphidiopterans. They are known to be predatory insects, but some also supplement their diet.\n2.  Evaluate each choice against the known facts:\n    *   **A. Nectar:** Many adult insects consume nectar for energy. This is a plausible food source.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Māhoe is a plant native to New Zealand. Raphidioptera are not native to New Zealand, making this specific option highly unlikely. However, pollen in general is a known supplemental food source for them.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** This is not a commonly cited food for snakeflies.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Karamū is also a New Zealand native plant. More importantly, adult snakeflies are not herbivorous (leaf-eaters).\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** While Totara is a New Zealand native tree, the key part of this option is \"Aphids\". Adult Raphidiopterans are well-documented predators of soft-bodied insects, especially aphids.\n3.  Synthesize the findings. Both nectar (A) and aphids (E) are known food sources.\n4.  Therefore, the combined option F, which includes both A and E, is the most accurate and complete answer.\n5.  I will create a Python script to represent this logical deduction process. The script will define the known diet facts and check them against the provided options to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define a knowledge base about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # This is based on established entomological facts.\n    known_diet = {\n        \"predatory\": True,\n        \"prey\": [\"aphids\", \"mites\", \"other small, soft-bodied insects\"],\n        \"supplemental\": [\"pollen\", \"nectar\"],\n        \"herbivorous\": False,\n        \"mycophagous\": False # does not eat fungus\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices for analysis.\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Nectar\",\n        \"B\": \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        \"C\": \"Fungus\",\n        \"D\": \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        \"E\": \"Totara Aphids\",\n        \"F\": \"A and E\",\n        \"G\": \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate each primary choice against the knowledge base.\n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    is_a_correct = \"nectar\" in known_diet[\"supplemental\"]\n    print(f\"Analysis for A (Nectar): Correct.
