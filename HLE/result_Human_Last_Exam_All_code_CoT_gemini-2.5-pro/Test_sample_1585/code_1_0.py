# Problem Analysis:
# n_2 is the smallest number of vertices for a specific 2-planar graph.
# The geometric constraints of 2-planarity (vertices on z=0 or x=0, edges in x>0, z>0)
# force the graph to be bipartite.
# Bipartite graphs cannot have odd cycles, so they cannot have C5 cycles.
# The problem requires n C5 cycles. This is only possible if n=0.
# A graph with n=0 vertices vacuously satisfies all the problem's conditions.
# As n must be non-negative, the smallest possible value for n_2 is 0.
n_2 = 0

# n_3 is the smallest number of vertices for a similar 3-planar graph.
# The 3-planar constraints make the graph tripartite.
# While tripartite graphs can have C5 cycles, the n=0 graph remains a valid solution
# for all conditions. As we seek the minimum n, n_3 is also 0.
n_3 = 0

# The problem asks to calculate (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# Print the final equation with the determined values.
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
print(f"Based on the analysis, n_2 must be 0.")
print(f"Similarly, the minimum possible value for n_3 is 0.")
print(f"The calculation is ({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {result}")

# The final answer is the numerical result of the calculation.
# print(f"<<<{result}>>>")
