    Evaluates 10 statements on Cordilleran geology and provides the result as a string.

    The evaluation for each statement is as follows:
    (1) Consensus (C): The Morrison formation is a classic foreland basin deposit.
    (2) Debated (D): The cause of metamorphic core complexes is highly debated (slab window is one of several hypotheses).
    (3) Debated (D): The existence and extent of the "Nevadaplano" plateau is a debated hypothesis.
    (4) Debated (D): The "Arizonaplano" and its formation mechanism are a debated hypothesis.
    (5) Consensus (C): The inboard position of Laramide structures relative to Sevier structures is a fundamental observation.
    (6) Consensus (C): The Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths are the roots of the ancestral Cordilleran arc.
    (7) Consensus (C): The southwestward propagation of Eocene-present volcanism (Yellowstone hotspot track) is well-established.
    (8) Debated (D): The uplift timing and mechanism for the Colorado Plateau are famously debated.
    (9) Debated (D): The detailed uplift history of the Cascades arc is complex and debated.
    (10) Debated (D): The Shatsky conjugate is a leading but unproven and debated hypothesis for the cause of Laramide flat-slab subduction.
