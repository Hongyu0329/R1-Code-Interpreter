# Step 1: Define the given values.
# Let S = SNYWR. Since the value is not specified, we will use a representative
# integer value. Let's assume S = 2024.
S = 2024
angle_B_deg = 30

# Step 2: State the condition for two possible triangles (Ambiguous SSA case).
# For two triangles to exist with a given acute angle B, side BC, and side AC,
# the length of AC must be greater than the altitude from C but less than BC.
# Condition: altitude < AC < BC
# altitude = BC * sin(B) = S * sin(30) = S / 2

# Step 3: Calculate the bounds for the length of AC.
# The inequality is S/2 < AC < S.
lower_bound = S / 2
upper_bound = S

print(f"Let S = {S}.")
print(f"The condition for two possible values of side AB is based on the length of AC.")
print(f"The inequality for AC is: S/2 < AC < S")
print(f"Substituting S = {S}, we get: {lower_bound} < AC < {upper_bound}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 4: Find the number of integer values for AC in this range.
# The smallest integer AC must be greater than the lower bound.
min_AC_int = math.floor(lower_bound) + 1

# The largest integer AC must be less than the upper bound.
max_AC_int = upper_bound - 1

# Step 5: Calculate the total count of these integer values.
# The number of integers from min_AC_int to max_AC_int (inclusive) is:
# max_AC_int - min_AC_int + 1
count = max_AC_int - min_AC_int + 1

# As requested, output the final equation with each number.
print("The range of possible integer values for AC is [{}, {}].".format(min_AC_int, max_AC_int))
print("The number of these integer values is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Count = {max_AC_int} - {min_AC_int} + 1 = {count}")
print("-" * 30)
print(f"The final number of integer values for AC is: {count}")
