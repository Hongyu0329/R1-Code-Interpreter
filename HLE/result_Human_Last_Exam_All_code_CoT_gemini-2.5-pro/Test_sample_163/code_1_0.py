    # Step-by-step reasoning

    print("1. The primary goal after stenting the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is to monitor for in-stent restenosis (re-narrowing).")
    print("2. Arterial duplex ultrasound is the gold standard for this surveillance because it directly visualizes the stent and blood flow. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) alone is not sensitive enough to detect focal restenosis. This makes options A and C less ideal.")
    print("3. The risk of restenosis is highest within the first year. Therefore, surveillance should be more frequent initially. An annual-only schedule (Option E) is inadequate for the first year.")
    print("4. Comparing the remaining duplex ultrasound schedules (B and D), the schedule in Option D (3, 6, and 12 months) is a standard, widely accepted protocol. It provides regular checks during the highest-risk period. Option B's schedule is less common.")
