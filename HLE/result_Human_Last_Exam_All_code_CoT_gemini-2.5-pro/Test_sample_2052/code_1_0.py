    This function provides the answers to the conceptual questions about the two-matrix model.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) Superintegrability in this context is defined by the existence of a character expansion
        for the partition function. The given formula for Z_{-n}(t) is such an expansion.
        This holds for any n >= 2, including n=3. Thus, the answer is Yes.

    (b) The model for n=4 is associated with a Tr(Phi_2^4) term in the potential. In the
        operator formalism, this corresponds to a spin-4 generator. Such a generator is an
        essential part of the W_4 algebra and cannot be created from lower-spin generators
        (like those in W_3). Therefore, an algebra containing a spin-4 operator (W_4) is
        necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t). Thus, the answer is Yes.
