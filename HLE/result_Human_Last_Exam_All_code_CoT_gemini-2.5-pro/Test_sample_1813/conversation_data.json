    "To compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is defined as the positive root of the quadratic equation $q^2x^2 + (2p-3q)qx - p^2 = 0$.\n2.  **Substitute the given values:** For $m_{4/7}$, we have $p=4$ and $q=7$. Substituting these into the equation gives $49x^2 - 91x - 16 = 0$.\n3.  **Solve for the number:** The positive root of this equation is $m_{4/7} = \\frac{91 + \\sqrt{11417}}{98}$.\n4.  **Apply the continued fraction algorithm:** I will use the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number of the form $\\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q}$. The algorithm iteratively calculates the coefficients $a_k$ and the subsequent terms of the fraction until the sequence of terms repeats.\n5.  **Code the solution:** A Python script will perform these calculations precisely using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors. The script will first determine the number and then compute its continued fraction coefficients until the periodic pattern is found.\n6.  **Format the output:** The final code will print the quadratic equation, the value of $m_{4/7}$ in radical form, and the final continued fraction equation, clearly indicating the periodic sequence of coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Computing the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p}/{q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the quadratic equation for the generalized Markov number.\n    # The number m_p/q is the positive root of q^2*x^2 + (2p-3q)q*x - p^2 = 0.\n    a = q**2\n    b = (2 * p - 3 * q) * q\n    c = -p**2\n\n    print(\"The number is the positive root of the quadratic equation:\")\n    print(f\"{a}x^2 + ({b})x + ({c}) = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Solve for the number using the quadratic formula.\n    # The root is (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n    # Let D be the discriminant.\n    D = b**2 - 4 * a * c\n    \n    # We write the number in the form (P0 + sqrt(D)) / Q0 for the CF algorithm.\n    P0 = -b\n    Q0 = 2 * a\n    \n    print(\"The value of the number is:\")\n    print(f\"m_{p}/{q} = ({P0} + sqrt({D})) / {Q0}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the continued fraction using the standard algorithm.\n    Pk = P0\n    Qk = Q0\n    # Use integer square root for precision\n    sqrt_D_int = math.isqrt(D)\n\n    coefficients = []\n    seen_states = {}\n    k = 0\n\n    # The algorithm will terminate because the continued fraction of a quadratic\n    # irrational is always periodic.\n    while (Pk, Qk) not in seen_states:\n        seen_states[(Pk, Qk)] = k\n\n        # Calculate the coefficient a_k = floor((Pk + sqrt(D)) / Qk)\n        ak = (Pk + sqrt_D_int) // Qk\n        coefficients.append(ak)\n\n        # Update P and Q for the next iteration\n        # P_{k+1} = a_k * Q_k - P_k\n        # Q_{k+1} = (D - P_{k+1}^2) / Q_k\n        Pk_next = ak * Qk - Pk\n        Qk_next = (D - Pk_next**2) // Qk\n\n        Pk = Pk_next\n        Qk = Qk_next\n        k += 1\n\n    # Step 4: Format and print the final continued fraction equation.\n    # The number m_{4/7} is a reduced quadratic irrational, so its\n    # continued fraction is purely periodic.\n    start_of_period = seen_states.get((Pk, Qk), 0)\n    \n    pre_period = coefficients[:start_of_period]\n    periodic_part = coefficients[start_of_period:]\n\n    coeffs_str = \", \".join(map(str, periodic_part))\n\n    print(\"The associated continued fraction is:\")\n    if not pre_period:\n        # Purely periodic\n        final_equation = f\"m_{p}/{q} = [{coeffs_str}] (The sequence is purely periodic)\"\n    else:\n        pre_period_str = \", \".join(map(str, pre_period))\n        final_equation = f\"m_{p}/{q} = [{pre_period_str}; {coeffs_str}] (The sequence starting from {periodic_part[0]} is periodic)\"\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(final_equation)\n\n# Run the computation for p=4, q=7\ncompute_markov_cf(4, 7)\n```\n<<<m_{4/7} = [2, 52, 1, 25, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 7, 2, 5, 6] (The sequence is purely periodic)>>>"
