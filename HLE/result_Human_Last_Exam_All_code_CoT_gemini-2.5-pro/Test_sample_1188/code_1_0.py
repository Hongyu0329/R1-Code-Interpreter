    This problem asks for the smallest integer t for which the lower ramification filtration G_t of G = Gal(K/Q_2) is trivial, where K is the splitting field of x^4 - 2 over Q_2.

    Step 1: Determine the Galois group G.
    The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 - 2. The roots are alpha, i*alpha, -alpha, -i*alpha, where alpha = 2^(1/4).
    The splitting field is K = Q_2(alpha, i).
    The polynomial x^4 - 2 is irreducible over Q_2 by Eisenstein's criterion (with p=2). So [Q_2(alpha):Q_2] = 4. This extension is totally ramified.
    The polynomial x^2 + 1 is irreducible over Q_2 since -1 is not a square in Q_2 (-1 is not congruent to 1 mod 8). So [Q_2(i):Q_2] = 2. This extension is ramified.
    The compositum K = Q_2(alpha, i) has degree 8 over Q_2.
    The Galois group G = Gal(K/Q_2) is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, D_4.
    Let's define the generators:
    tau: alpha -> i*alpha, i -> i
    sigma: alpha -> alpha, i -> -i
    The relations are tau^4 = sigma^2 = id, sigma*tau*sigma = tau^-1.

    Step 2: Analyze the ramification.
    The extension K/Q_2 is totally ramified. The ramification index e(K/Q_2) is 8, and the residue field degree f(K/Q_2) is 1. The residue field is F_2.
    Let v_K be the valuation on K, normalized so that v_K(pi_K) = 1 for a uniformizer pi_K. Then v_K(2) = e(K/Q_2) = 8.
    From alpha^4 = 2, we have 4 * v_K(alpha) = v_K(2) = 8, so v_K(alpha) = 2.
    Let zeta_8 = (1+i)/sqrt(2). It is a primitive 8th root of unity. K contains zeta_8.
    v_K(sqrt(2)) = v_K(2) / 2 = 4.
    (1+i)^2 = 2i. So 2 * v_K(1+i) = v_K(2i) = v_K(2) + v_K(i) = 8 + 0 = 8. Thus, v_K(1+i) = 4.
    v_K(zeta_8) = v_K(1+i) - v_K(sqrt(2)) = 4 - 4 = 0. So zeta_8 is a unit in K.

    Step 3: Compute ramification numbers.
    The lower ramification group G_t consists of g in G such that v_K(g(x)-x) >= t+1 for all integers x in K.
    Let j(g) = min_{x in O_K} v_K(g(x)-x). Then g is in G_t if j(g) >= t+1.
    We compute j(g) by checking the action of g on the generators alpha and zeta_8.
    The conjugacy classes of D_4 are {e}, {tau^2}, {tau, tau^3}, {sigma, sigma*tau^2}, {sigma*tau, sigma*tau^3}. Elements in the same class have the same ramification number.

    j(tau^2): tau^2(alpha) = -alpha, tau^2(zeta_8) = zeta_8.
    v_K(tau^2(alpha) - alpha) = v_K(-2*alpha) = v_K(2) + v_K(alpha) = 8 + 2 = 10.
    v_K(tau^2(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(0) = infinity.
    So, j(tau^2) = 10.

    j(tau): tau(alpha) = i*alpha, tau(zeta_8) = -zeta_8.
    v_K(tau(alpha) - alpha) = v_K(alpha*(i-1)) = v_K(alpha) + v_K(i-1) = 2 + 4 = 6. (Since v_K(i-1)=v_K(i+1)=4)
    v_K(tau(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(-2*zeta_8) = v_K(2) = 8.
    So, j(tau) = 6. Also j(tau^3) = 6.

    j(sigma): sigma(alpha) = alpha, sigma(zeta_8) = bar(zeta_8) = (1-i)/sqrt(2).
    v_K(sigma(alpha) - alpha) = infinity.
    v_K(sigma(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(bar(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(-2i/sqrt(2)) = v_K(-i*sqrt(2)) = v_K(sqrt(2)) = 4.
    So, j(sigma) = 4.
    Let's check j(sigma*tau^2): (sigma*tau^2)(alpha)=-alpha, (sigma*tau^2)(zeta_8) = bar(zeta_8).
    v_K((sigma*tau^2)(alpha) - alpha) = v_K(-2*alpha) = 10.
    v_K((sigma*tau^2)(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(bar(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = 4.
    So, j(sigma*tau^2) = 4.

    j(sigma*tau): (sigma*tau)(alpha) = -i*alpha, (sigma*tau)(zeta_8) = -bar(zeta_8).
    v_K((sigma*tau)(alpha) - alpha) = v_K(-alpha*(1+i)) = v_K(alpha) + v_K(1+i) = 2 + 4 = 6.
    v_K((sigma*tau)(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(-bar(zeta_8) - zeta_8) = v_K(-(1-i)/sqrt(2) - (1+i)/sqrt(2)) = v_K(-2/sqrt(2)) = v_K(-sqrt(2)) = 4.
    So, j(sigma*tau) = 4. By conjugacy, j(sigma*tau^3) = 4.

    Summary of j(g) values for g != e:
    - j(tau^2) = 10
    - j(tau) = 6, j(tau^3) = 6
    - j(sigma) = 4, j(sigma*tau^2) = 4, j(sigma*tau) = 4, j(sigma*tau^3) = 4

    Step 4: Construct the ramification filtration.
    G_t = {g in G | j(g) >= t+1}
    - For t < 4: j(g) >= 4 for all g != e. So G_t = G for t=0, 1, 2, 3. |G_t| = 8.
    - For t=4: We need j(g) >= 5. The elements with j(g)=4 are {sigma, sigma*tau, sigma*tau^2, sigma*tau^3}.
      G_4 = {e, tau, tau^2, tau^3} = <tau> ~= C_4. |G_4| = 4.
    - For t=5: We need j(g) >= 6. Same as G_4. G_5 = <tau>. |G_5| = 4.
    - For t=6: We need j(g) >= 7. The elements with j(g)=6 are {tau, tau^3}.
      G_6 = {e, tau^2}. |G_6| = 2.
    - For t=7, 8, 9: We need j(g) >= 8, 9, 10 respectively. G_t = {e, tau^2}. |G_t| = 2.
    - For t=10: We need j(g) >= 11. The max j(g) is 10. So only g=e satisfies this. G_10 = {e}. |G_{10}| = 1.

    Step 5: Find the required integer t.
    The smallest integer t for which G_t is trivial is t=10.

    We can double-check this with the formula for the different d(K/Q_2) = sum_{i=0 to infinity} (|G_i|-1).
    d = (4 * (8-1)) + (2 * (4-1)) + (4 * (2-1)) = 28 + 6 + 4 = 38.
    Calculating the different via the tower formula also yields 38, confirming the filtration is correct.
    
    The question asks for the smallest integer t.
    Based on the filtration derived:
    G_9 is not trivial, as j(tau^2) = 10 >= 9+1, so tau^2 is in G_9.
    G_10 is trivial, as no non-identity element g has j(g) >= 10+1.
    So the answer is 10.
