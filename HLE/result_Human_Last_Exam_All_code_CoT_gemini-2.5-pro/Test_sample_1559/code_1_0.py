# Gate A: Creates superposition.
# Gate B: Measures the superposition. Per Rule R1, the result is 1.
classical_bit = 1
# Gate C: Processes the bit 1.
# For input 1, state is |1>, amplitudes are 0 for |0> and 1 for |1>.
# Output = (0**2 * 0) + (1**2 * 1) = 1

# Second ABC block:
# Input to this block is the output of the first, which is 1.
# The process repeats, and the output will be 1 again.

# Third ABC block:
# Input is 1. The output will again be 1.

# For the final step, we calculate the output from the last Gate C.
# The input to the final Gate C is 1.
# This corresponds to the state |1>, where amplitude of |0> is 0 and amplitude of |1> is 1.
