    "An elementary cellular automaton consists of a one-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states (0 or 1). The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. This is governed by a specific \"rule\". There are 256 such rules in total.\n\nThe problem provides the first and third generations of an 8-cell automaton and asks for the unknown intermediate generation. The key is that the same rule must govern the transition from the first to the second generation AND from the second to the third.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Iterate through all 256 possible rules (numbered 0 to 255).\n2.  For each rule, apply it to the known first generation (`01101001`) to calculate a candidate for the intermediate generation.\n3.  Apply the *same rule* to this candidate intermediate generation to calculate a third generation.\n4.  Compare the calculated third generation with the known third generation (`10000111`).\n5.  If they match, we have found the correct rule and the corresponding unique intermediate generation.\n6.  The script will then print the digits of this valid intermediate generation, separated by spaces. I'll assume the automaton wraps around at the edges (periodic boundary conditions), which is a standard convention.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    gen_t0_str = \"01101001\"\n    gen_t2_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    gen_t0 = [int(c) for c in gen_t0_str]\n    length = len(gen_t0)\n\n    solutions = []\n\n    def apply_rule(rule_num, generation):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given rule to a generation to produce the next generation.\n        Assumes periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Convert rule number to 8-bit binary string (e.g., 30 -> \"00011110\")\n        rule_bits = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        \n        # Map the 8 neighborhood patterns (from '111' down to '000') to the rule's output\n        rule_map = {\n            (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[0]), (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[1]),\n            (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[2]), (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[3]),\n            (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[4]), (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[5]),\n            (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[6]), (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[7])\n        }\n\n        next_gen = [0] * length\n        for i in range(length):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic (wrap-around) boundaries\n            left = generation[i - 1]\n            center = generation[i]\n            right = generation[(i + 1) % length]\n            \n            neighborhood = (left, center, right)\n            next_gen[i] = rule_map[neighborhood]\n            \n        return next_gen\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # Calculate the potential intermediate generation from the first generation\n        gen_t1_candidate = apply_rule(rule, gen_t0)\n\n        # Calculate the third generation from the candidate intermediate generation\n        gen_t2_calculated = apply_rule(rule, gen_t1_candidate)\n\n        # Convert the result back to a string for comparison\n        gen_t2_calculated_str = \"\".join(map(str, gen_t2_calculated))\n\n        # Check if the calculated third generation matches the given one\n        if gen_t2_calculated_str == gen_t2_str:\n            solution_str = \"\".join(map(str, gen_t1_candidate))\n            if solution_str not in solutions:\n                solutions.append(solution_str)\n\n    # As per the problem, there is only one valid solution.
