The mathematical formulation characterizing the upper bound of a vertical cross-section of a Gaussian IT3 MF is given by:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
μ̄_vc(u) = exp( -0.5 * ( (x_p - c̄(u)) / σ̄(u) )^2 )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:
  - μ̄_vc(u): Represents the upper membership grade for the vertical cross-section. It is a function of the secondary variable 'u'.
  - x_p: A specific, fixed value of the primary input variable 'x'.
  - u: The secondary variable, representing the vertical axis of the secondary membership function, typically in the range [0, 1].
  - exp(): The standard exponential function.
  - The number -0.5 and the exponent 2 define the Gaussian form.
  - c̄(u): The center (mean) of the Gaussian function. In an IT3 MF, this center is a function of 'u'.
  - σ̄(u): The spread (standard deviation) of the Gaussian function, which is also a function of 'u'.

This equation defines the Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) for the Interval Type-2 set that results from the vertical slice.
A similar equation with different parameter functions would define the Lower Membership Function (LMF).
