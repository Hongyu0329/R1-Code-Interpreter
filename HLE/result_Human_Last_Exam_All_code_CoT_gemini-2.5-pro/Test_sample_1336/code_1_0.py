    """
    Calculates the total number of smooth coverings for the given group-theoretic setting.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings D(G, b, w) of
    D(PSL(2, p), b, w), where G = SL(2, p) for a prime p > 5.

    1. G = SL(2, p) is a central extension of S = PSL(2, p) by the center Z(G).
    2. For p > 2, the center Z(G) consists of {I, -I} and has order 2.
    3. The theory of coverings (in the sense of blocks or representations) is governed
       by the character group of the center, Irr(Z(G)). Its order is |Z(G)|.
    4. The number of coverings of an object on S is the size of the orbit of the
       lifted object on G under the action of Irr(Z(G)).
    5. The orbit size is |Irr(Z(G))| / |Stabilizer|.
    6. The term "smooth" implies an ideal situation, which we interpret as the
       action being free, meaning the stabilizer is trivial (order 1).
