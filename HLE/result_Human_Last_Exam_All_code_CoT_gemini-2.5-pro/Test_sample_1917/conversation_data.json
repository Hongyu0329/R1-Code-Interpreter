    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ as $a$ ranges over the natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the expression**: We are interested in the values of $f(a) = a^a \\pmod{22}$. The behavior of this expression depends on the base $a$ and the exponent $a$.\n2.  **Use Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**: Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, we can analyze the expression modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\n    *   $a^a \\pmod 2$: This depends on whether $a$ is even or odd. If $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, so $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. If $a$ is even ($a \\ge 2$), $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, so $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   $a^a \\pmod{11}$: By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the value of the exponent matters modulo 10. So, the behavior of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n3.  **Determine the Periodicity**: The overall behavior of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is determined by $a$ modulo 2, 10, and 11. The sequence of values $f(a)$ is therefore periodic. The period will be a multiple of the least common multiple of these moduli, $\\text{lcm}(2, 10, 11) = \\text{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$.\n4.  **Computational Approach**: To find all possible unique values, we only need to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ in one full period, i.e., for $a = 1, 2, \\dots, 110$. Any value of $a > 110$ will produce a residue that has already been generated by some $a$ in the range $[1, 110]$.\n5.  **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to iterate $a$ from 1 to 110. For each $a$, we calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ using efficient modular exponentiation. We store the unique results in a set and then count the number of elements in the set.\n\nThis plan allows us to find the exact set of residues and its cardinality by checking a finite number of cases.\n\n```python\ndef find_cardinality_a_power_a():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\n    Based on number theory, the sequence of residues a^a mod 22 is periodic.\n    The period is lcm(22, lambda(22)) = lcm(22, 10) = 110, where lambda is the Carmichael function.\n    Thus, we only need to check the values for a from 1 to 110 to find all possible residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    residues = set()\n    \n    # We iterate through 'a' from 1 up to 110.\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # pow(a, a, 22) is an efficient way to compute (a^a) % 22\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n\n    # Sort the residues for a clean presentation\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    cardinality = len(sorted_residues)\n    \n    print(f\"The set of unique residues for a^a mod 22 is:\")\n    print(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"The cardinality of this set is {cardinality}.\")\n\nfind_cardinality_a_power_a()\n```\n<<<19>>>"
