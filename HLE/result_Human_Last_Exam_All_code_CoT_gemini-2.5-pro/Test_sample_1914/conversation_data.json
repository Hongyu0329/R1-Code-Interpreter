    "This problem requires a case-by-case analysis based on the structure of the category. A category is defined by its objects, its morphisms, and the rules of composition.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the fixed components:** We have 2 objects (let's call them `O1` and `O2`) and 4 morphisms. Every category must have an identity morphism for each object. So, two of our morphisms are fixed as `id_O1: O1 -> O1` and `id_O2: O2 -> O2`.\n2.  **Identify the variable components:** This leaves us with `4 - 2 = 2` \"non-identity\" morphisms to place. Let's call them `f` and `g`. The structure of the category is determined by the source and target objects of `f` and `g`, and by the composition rules.\n3.  **Enumerate the cases:** We can classify the possible categories by how `f` and `g` are arranged.\n    *   **Case 1:** `f` and `g` are parallel morphisms, e.g., both go from `O1` to `O2`.\n    *   **Case 2:** `f` and `g` are parallel loops on a single object, e.g., both go from `O1` to `O1`.\n    *   **Case 3:** `f` and `g` form a sequence, e.g., `f: O1 -> O1` and `g: O1 -> O2`.\n    *   **Case 4:** `f` and `g` form a cycle, e.g., `f: O1 -> O2` and `g: O2 -> O1`.\n    *   **Case 5:** `f` and `g` are on separate components, e.g., `f: O1 -> O1` and `g: O2 -> O2`.\n4.  **Count the possibilities within each case:** For each arrangement, we determine how many non-isomorphic composition tables are possible while satisfying the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each distinct case.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, explaining each step and calculating the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    The logic is based on a case-by-case analysis of the structure of the two non-identity morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: Find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be O1 and O2.\")\n    print(\"Any such category must have two identity morphisms, id_O1 and id_O2.\")\n    print(\"This leaves 4 - 2 = 2 non-identity morphisms, which we'll call f and g.\\n\")\n    print(\"We analyze the possible structures based on the arrangement of f and g:\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: f and g are parallel, connecting O1 and O2.\n    # f: O1 -> O2, g: O1 -> O2\n    # No non-trivial compositions exist (e.g., h o k where h, k are non-identities),\n    # so the axioms are trivially satisfied.
