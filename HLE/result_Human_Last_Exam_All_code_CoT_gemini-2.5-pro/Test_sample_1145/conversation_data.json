    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval within a 1D infinite potential well (a \"box\").\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Recall the Physics:** The probability of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval.\n2.  **State the Wavefunction:** For a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wavefunction for the n-th quantum state is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)`\n3.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability density is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)`\n4.  **Set up the Integral:** We are given `n = 2` and the interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]`. The probability `P` is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2 * π * x / a) dx`\n5.  **Simplify and Calculate:** We can simplify this integral by substituting `u = x/a`. This makes the box length `a` cancel out, simplifying the calculation. The integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(2 * π * u) du`\n6.  **Code the Solution:** We will use Python with the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically compute this definite integral for an accurate result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval for a specific quantum number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    # n is the principal quantum number.\n    n = 2\n    \n    # The integration limits are given as 0.495a and 0.505a.\n    # By using a change of variables u = x/a, the box length 'a' cancels out,\n    # so we can integrate from u=0.495 to u=0.505.\n    x1 = 0.495\n    x2 = 0.505\n\n    # The probability density function is |ψ(u)|² = 2 * sin²(n*π*u), where u=x/a.\n    def probability_density(u, n_level):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n_level * np.pi * u))**2\n\n    # Calculate the definite integral of the probability density function\n    # over the interval [x1, x2].\n    # The quad function returns the integration result and an error estimate.\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n,))\n\n    # Print the equation and the values used for the calculation,\n    # followed by the final result.\n    print(\"The probability P is found by integrating the probability density |ψ_n(x)|² from x1 to x2.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is: P = integral from x1 to x2 of (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the given values:\")\n    print(f\"Quantum number n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Lower bound x1 = {x1}a\")\n    print(f\"Upper bound x2 = {x2}a\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated probability is:\")\n    print(f\"P = {probability}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n<<<6.579708171452109e-06>>>\n```"
