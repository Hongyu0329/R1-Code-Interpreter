    "This is a historical question, not a computational one. My plan is to determine the answer based on historical facts and then present that answer in the requested Python code block format.\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and dates:** The question is about Geoffrey Chaucer and Blanche of Lancaster at the time of her death.\n2.  **Find the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** Historical records show she died on 12 September 1368, most likely from the plague, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n3.  **Determine Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368:** At this time, Chaucer was in the service of the English court of King Edward III as an esquire. His duties would have kept him in England, within the court's circle.\n4.  **Find corroborating evidence:** Chaucer's first major work, *The Book of the Duchess*, is widely accepted as an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster. The creation of such a personal and timely poem strongly suggests he was in England and part of the court that was mourning her death.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on his service to the English court and the writing of *The Book of the Duchess*, Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucers_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about\n    Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical facts\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    location_of_death = \"England\"\n    chaucers_location = \"England\"\n    evidence = \"Chaucer was in service to the English court and his poem 'The Book of the Duchess' is an elegy for Blanche.\"\n\n    # The answer based on historical evidence\n    answer_choice = \"C\"\n    answer_location = \"England\"\n\n    print(f\"When Blanche of Lancaster died in {location_of_death} in {year_of_death}, Geoffrey Chaucer was also in {chaucers_location}.\")\n    print(f\"Evidence: {evidence}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct option is {answer_choice}: {answer_location}.\")\n\nfind_chaucers_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
