    # The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes
    # that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph on n vertices.

    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of induced cliques.
    # An induced clique is a subset of vertices where the induced subgraph is a complete graph.
    # Let's say a graph G has a maximum clique of size k (this size is called the clique number, omega(G)).
    # This means there is a set of k vertices, let's call it C, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in C.
    # Now, if we take any subset of C with j vertices (where 1 <= j <= k), this subset will also be a clique.
    # The subgraph induced by this subset of j vertices is a complete graph of size j, or K_j.
    # This proves a crucial point: If a graph has an induced clique of size k, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to k.

    # Step 2: Simplify the problem.
    # From the reasoning above, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph G is
    # exactly {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}, where omega(G) is the clique number of G.
    # The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to omega(G).
    # The problem is now simplified to: What is the maximum possible value of omega(G) for a graph G on n vertices?

    # Step 3: Maximize the clique number.
    # The size of a clique in a graph cannot be greater than the total number of vertices.
    # Therefore, for any graph G with n vertices, omega(G) <= n.

    # Step 4: Construct a graph that achieves this maximum.
    # We can construct the complete graph on n vertices, denoted K_n.
    # In K_n, all n vertices form a single large clique.
    # Thus, the clique number of K_n is n.
    # This shows that the maximum possible clique number is indeed n.

    # Step 5: State the conclusion and the final equation.
    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible clique number, which is n.
    # For n = 128, the answer is 128.
