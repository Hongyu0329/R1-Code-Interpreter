    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to find the maximum possible number of unique clique sizes that can be found as induced subgraphs within a single graph of `n=128` vertices.\n2.  **Analyze Induced Cliques:** I will start by analyzing the properties of induced cliques. A key insight is that if a graph contains a large induced clique (e.g., of size `k`), it must also contain induced cliques of all smaller sizes (from 1 to `k-1`). This is because any subset of vertices from a clique also forms a clique.\n3.  **Relate to Clique Number:** This analysis reveals that the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph `G` is precisely `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the clique number (the size of the largest clique) of `G`. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is simply `ω(G)`.\n4.  **Maximize the Clique Number:** The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n5.  **Construct an Optimal Graph:** The maximum clique number for a graph on `n` vertices is `n`. This maximum value is achieved by the complete graph, `K_n`, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** For `n=128`, the maximum clique number is 128. This means the complete graph `K_{128}` has induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes. This is the maximum possible number.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will formalize this logic, setting `n=128`, and print the reasoning and the final answer, including the simple equation `max_sizes = n`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    # The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    # that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph on n vertices.\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of induced cliques.\n    # An induced clique is a subset of vertices where the induced subgraph is a complete graph.\n    # Let's say a graph G has a maximum clique of size k (this size is called the clique number, omega(G)).\n    # This means there is a set of k vertices, let's call it C, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in C.\n    # Now, if we take any subset of C with j vertices (where 1 <= j <= k), this subset will also be a clique.\n    # The subgraph induced by this subset of j vertices is a complete graph of size j, or K_j.\n    # This proves a crucial point: If a graph has an induced clique of size k, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to k.\n\n    # Step 2: Simplify the problem.\n    # From the reasoning above, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph G is\n    # exactly {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}, where omega(G) is the clique number of G.\n    # The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to omega(G).\n    # The problem is now simplified to: What is the maximum possible value of omega(G) for a graph G on n vertices?\n\n    # Step 3: Maximize the clique number.\n    # The size of a clique in a graph cannot be greater than the total number of vertices.\n    # Therefore, for any graph G with n vertices, omega(G) <= n.\n\n    # Step 4: Construct a graph that achieves this maximum.\n    # We can construct the complete graph on n vertices, denoted K_n.\n    # In K_n, all n vertices form a single large clique.\n    # Thus, the clique number of K_n is n.\n    # This shows that the maximum possible clique number is indeed n.\n\n    # Step 5: State the conclusion and the final equation.\n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible clique number, which is n.\n    # For n = 128, the answer is 128.\n    \n    max_sizes = n\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is determined by the maximum possible clique number in a graph of size n.\")\n    print(\"The set of induced clique sizes in any graph G is {1, 2, ..., k}, where k is the size of the largest clique in G.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible value for k in a graph with {n} vertices is {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This is achieved by the complete graph K_{n}, which has induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to {n}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"max_possible_sizes = n\")\n    print(f\"max_possible_sizes = {max_sizes}\")\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
