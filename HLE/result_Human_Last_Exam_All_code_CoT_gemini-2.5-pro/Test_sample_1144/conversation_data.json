    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum of an electron in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We'll use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. We will consider the case of minimum uncertainty:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):** In the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron is quantized: L = n * ħ, where n is the principal quantum number. For the first orbit, n=1, so L = ħ. The angular momentum is also defined as L = p * r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the orbit's radius. The radius of the first Bohr orbit is the Bohr radius (a₀). Therefore, the momentum is:\n    p = ħ / a₀\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio (Δp / p):** We can now find the ratio by dividing the uncertainty in momentum by the momentum. Notice that the reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n    Ratio = Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀) = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in J·s\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34\n# Bohr radius in meters\na0 = 5.291772109e-11\n\n# Given uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp)\ndelta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p)\np = h_bar / a0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio\nratio = delta_p / p\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"This script calculates the ratio of the momentum uncertainty to the momentum for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\nprint(f\"Given position uncertainty (Δx): {delta_x} m\")\nprint(f\"Bohr radius (a₀): {a0} m\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Calculated momentum uncertainty (Δp): {delta_p:.4g} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Calculated momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p): {p:.4g} kg·m/s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"The final ratio is Δp / p:\")\nprint(f\"{delta_p:.4g} / {p:.4g} = {ratio}\")\n```\n<<<2.6458860545>>>"
