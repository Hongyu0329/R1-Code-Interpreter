    "To find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze how the number of elementary operations grows as the input `n` increases.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Part of the Algorithm:** The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop. The initialization part before the loop runs only once and takes constant time. The complexity of the algorithm is therefore determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop and the work done within each iteration.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop's condition is `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's track the value on which `q` depends. Inside the loop, `x` is set to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that the variable controlling the loop is effectively divided by the base `c` in each iteration.\n    *   The process starts with a value related to `n` and stops when it becomes 0. The number of times you can divide an integer `n` by another integer `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) before the result is 0 is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   Therefore, the `while` loop executes `O(log_c n)` times. The number of iterations is directly proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Work Done Inside the Loop:**\n    *   The operations inside the loop are `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_i := x - qc`.\n    *   These are basic arithmetic and assignment operations. In standard computational models (assuming `n` fits within a machine's word size), each of these operations is considered to take constant time, or `O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the product of the number of loop iterations and the work done per iteration.\n    *   Time Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration)\n    *   Time Complexity = `O(log_c n) × O(1)`\n    *   Time Complexity = `O(log_c n)`\n\nThis means the algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with the input `n`. To fulfill the request of providing a Python script and demonstrating the final equation, the following code implements the algorithm, explains the complexity analysis, and constructs the final mathematical equation that the algorithm solves for.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_imag_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements the IMAG algorithm to analyze and explain\n    its computational time complexity.
