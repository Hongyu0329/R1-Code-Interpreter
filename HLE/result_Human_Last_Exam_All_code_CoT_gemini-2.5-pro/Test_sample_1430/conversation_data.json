    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group, `rho(X)`, where `X = C^(15)` is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve `C` of genus `g`, denoted `C^(d)`, is given by the formula:\n`rho(C^(d)) = 1 + rank(End(J(C)))`\nwhere `J(C)` is the Jacobian of the curve `C` and `End(J(C))` is its ring of endomorphisms. This formula holds for `d >= g`. In our case, the genus is `g = 3` and the degree of the symmetric power is `d = 15`, so the condition `15 >= 3` is satisfied.\n\nThe problem, therefore, reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible rank of `End(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank for `End(J(C))` occurs when the curve `C` is \"generic\". For a generic curve, the only endomorphisms of its Jacobian `J(C)` are the trivial ones (multiplication by integers). Thus, `End(J(C)) = Z`, which has a rank of 1.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank for `End(J(C))` occurs when the curve `C` is \"special\" and has complex multiplication (CM). The maximum is achieved when the Jacobian `J(C)` is isogenous to a product of `g` copies of a single CM elliptic curve `E`. For a genus `g=3` curve, this means:\n`J(C) ~ E^3`\nIn this case, the endomorphism ring `End(J(C))` is a maximal order in the matrix algebra `M_g(End(E) \\otimes Q)`.\nAn elliptic curve `E` with complex multiplication has `rank(End(E)) = 2`.\nThe rank of `End(J(C))` is then `g^2 * rank(End(E))`.\nSuch curves exist. For example, the Fermat quartic curve `x^4 + y^4 = z^4` is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of a CM elliptic curve, achieving this maximum rank.\n\nThe following Python code calculates these minimum and maximum values based on this theory.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3\n\n    # --- Smallest Rank Calculation ---\n    # For a generic curve, End(J(C)) = Z, which has rank 1.\n    # The formula for the rank of the Neron-Severi group is rho = 1 + rank(End(J(C))).\n    rank_end_min = 1\n    rho_min = 1 + rank_end_min\n\n    print(\"Calculation for the smallest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve C is g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"For a generic curve, the rank of the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian, rank(End(J(C))), is 1.\")\n    print(f\"Smallest rank = 1 + rank(End(J(C))) = 1 + {rank_end_min} = {rho_min}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Largest Rank Calculation ---\n    # For a special curve with maximal complex multiplication, J(C) is isogenous to E^g,\n    # where E is a CM elliptic curve.\n    # rank(End(E)) for a CM elliptic curve is 2.\n    # rank(End(J(C))) is g^2 * rank(End(E)).\n    rank_end_E = 2\n    rank_end_max = g**2 * rank_end_E\n    rho_max = 1 + rank_end_max\n\n    print(\"Calculation for the largest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve C is g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"For a curve with maximal CM, J(C) is isogenous to E^g, where E is a CM elliptic curve.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of End(E) for a CM elliptic curve is {rank_end_E}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum rank of End(J(C)) is g^2 * rank(End(E)) = {g}^2 * {rank_end_E} = {rank_end_max}.\")\n    print(f\"Largest rank = 1 + rank(End(J(C))) = 1 + {rank_end_max} = {rho_max}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(f\"The smallest possible rank is {rho_min}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank is {rho_max}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_neron_severi_rank()\n\n```\n<<<2, 19>>>"
