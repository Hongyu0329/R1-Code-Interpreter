    This function constructs an example to find the smallest possible size of the limit.
    
    We model a simple case to demonstrate the principle:
    1. J: A finite directed poset, e.g., {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} with the usual <= relation.
    2. F: A functor from J^op to Set.
       - F(j) is a non-empty set. We choose a singleton set for each j: F(j) = {c_j}.
       - For every i <= j, F maps the corresponding morphism in J^op to a surjective map
         f_ij: F(j) -> F(i). With singleton sets, this map is uniquely f_ij(c_j) = c_i.
    
    The limit is the set of "coherent" families (x_j) where x_j is in F(j) and for all i<=j, f_ij(x_j) = x_i.
