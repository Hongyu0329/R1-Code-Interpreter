    print("Step 1: Basic properties of the function f")
    print("Let g(x) = exp(x). The equation is f(f(x)) = g(x).")
    print("Since g(x) is injective (one-to-one), f must also be injective.")
    print("Proof: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2). This implies x1 = x2.")
    print("A continuous and injective function mapping the real numbers to themselves must be strictly monotonic.\n")

    print("Step 2: Rule out strictly decreasing solutions")
    print("Let's assume f is a strictly decreasing continuous function from R to R.")
    print("Such a function must have exactly one fixed point, p, where f(p) = p.")
    print("(This is because h(x) = f(x) - x is a continuous, strictly decreasing function that goes from +inf to -inf, so it must cross zero exactly once).")

    print("Since f(p) = p, the left side becomes f(p), which is p.")

    print("However, the equation x = exp(x) has no real solutions (as exp(x) > x for all real x).")
    print("This is a contradiction. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists.\n")

    print("Step 3: Count the strictly increasing solutions")
    print("Since decreasing solutions are ruled out, any solution must be strictly increasing.")
    print("The range of f(f(x)) = exp(x) is (0, +inf). This means the range of f must be (0, +inf), so f(x) > 0 for all x.")

    print("1. Choose a value for f(0). Let f(0) = c. From f(f(0)) = exp(0)=1, we get f(c) = 1.")

    print("3. For each choice of c in (0, 1), we can define f on the interval [0, c]. f must be a continuous increasing function that maps [0, c] to [f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1].")
    print("4. We can choose any continuous increasing bijection phi: [0, c] -> [c, 1] for this part of the function.")
    print("5. The definition of f can be extended to all of R using the original equation and the commutation property f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).")
    print("The number of choices for c in (0, 1) is the cardinality of the continuum, c.")
    print("For each c, the number of possible functions phi is also c.")
    print("Thus, the total number of increasing solutions we can construct is c * c = c.\n")

    print("Step 4: Final Conclusion")
    print("The number of solutions is at least c (from the construction in Step 3).")
    print("The set of all continuous functions from R to R has cardinality c. So, the number of solutions can be at most c.")
