    "My approach to solving this problem involves a few key steps. First, I will analyze the properties of any function $f$ that satisfies the given equation. This will lead to the conclusion that $f$ must be strictly monotonic.\n\nNext, I will consider the two cases for monotonicity: strictly decreasing and strictly increasing.\nFor the strictly decreasing case, I will demonstrate that no such solutions exist by showing that the existence of such a function leads to a logical contradiction. The argument hinges on the fact that a decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point, which is incompatible with the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFor the strictly increasing case, I will show that not only do solutions exist, but there is a continuum of them. I'll outline a method for constructing these solutions. This method involves making a series of choices, where each set of choices generates a unique valid function. By analyzing the number of possible choices, I will determine the cardinality of the set of these increasing solutions.\n\nFinally, by combining the results from both cases, I will determine the total cardinality of the set of all such functions. Since the total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$), the number of solutions cannot exceed this. The construction will show that the number of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$, leading to the final conclusion.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this entire logical argument.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_of_functional_root():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step derivation of the cardinality of the set\n    of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Problem: Find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Basic properties of the function f\")\n    print(\"Let g(x) = exp(x).
