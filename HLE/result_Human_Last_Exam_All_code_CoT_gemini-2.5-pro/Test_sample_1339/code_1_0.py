def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    Solves the group theory problem based on a literal interpretation of the notation.

    The problem asks two questions:
    (a) Does there exist a unique minimal group hat(G) for which any p-nonsingular system over G is solvable in hat(G)?
    (b) What is the maximum possible derived length of hat(G)?

    Our reasoning is as follows:
    For part (a), the theory of p-localization of groups confirms that such a unique minimal group exists.

    For part (b), we analyze the subnormal series notation provided:
    G = G_1 normal_in G_2 normal_in ... normal_in G_n normal_in G_{n+1} = {1}

    1. The statement `G_n is a normal subgroup of G_{n+1} = {1}` implies that G_n must be the trivial group {1}.
    2. By induction, the statement `G_{i-1} is a normal subgroup of G_i` implies that if G_i = {1}, then G_{i-1} must also be {1}.
    3. Working backwards from G_n = {1}, we conclude that G_1 = G = {1}.
    4. So, the only group G satisfying the condition is the trivial group.
    5. The p-localization hat(G) of the trivial group is the trivial group itself.
    6. The derived length of the trivial group {1} is 0, as its derived series starts with H^(0) = {1}.
    7. Therefore, the maximum possible derived length is 0.
