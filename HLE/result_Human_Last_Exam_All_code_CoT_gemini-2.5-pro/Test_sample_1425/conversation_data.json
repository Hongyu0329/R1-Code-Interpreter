    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function, followed by a Python script to present the final result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Grand Canonical Partition Function:** The partition function `Z` in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as the trace (`Tr`) over all states in the Fock space of the operator `exp[-β(H - μN)]`.\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β(H - μN))]`\n    Here, `β` is the inverse temperature (`1/(k_B*T)`), `H` is the Hamiltonian operator, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `N` is the particle number operator.\n\n2.  **Substitute the Given Hamiltonian:** The problem provides a specific, simple Hamiltonian: `H = -μN`. We substitute this into the general formula:\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β((-μN) - μN))]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Exponent:** We can simplify the expression inside the exponent:\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN))]`\n    `Z = Tr[e^(2βμN)]`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Trace:** The path integral formulation is a powerful tool, but for a Hamiltonian that is diagonal in the particle number basis, we can directly evaluate the trace. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements over a complete basis. We use the particle number basis `|n>`, where `n` is the number of particles (`n = 0, 1, 2, ...`). The number operator `N` acting on these states gives `N|n> = n|n>`.\n    Therefore, the trace becomes a sum over all possible particle numbers `n`:\n    `Z = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} <n| e^(2βμN) |n>`\n    `Z = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} e^(2βμn)`\n\n5.  **Sum the Geometric Series:** The resulting sum is a geometric series with the first term `a = 1` (for n=0) and a common ratio `r = e^(2βμ)`.\n    `Z = 1 + e^(2βμ) + (e^(2βμ))^2 + (e^(2βμ))^3 + ...`\n    This series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1, i.e., `|e^(2βμ)| < 1`. Since `β` is positive, this requires `μ` to be negative (`μ < 0`). Assuming this condition holds, the sum of the series is:\n    `Z = 1 / (1 - r)`\n    `Z = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))`\n\nThis result is precisely what one would obtain from a more complex path integral calculation for a single-state bosonic system. The Python code below will format and print this final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the symbolic solution for the partition function Z\n    for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN in the grand canonical ensemble.\n\n    The derivation leads to the equation: Z = 1 / (1 - e^(2*β*μ))\n    This code will print the final equation, highlighting the numerical constants involved.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The final equation is Z = numerator / (denominator_const - e^(exponent_const * β * μ))\n    # Let's define the numerical constants in the equation.\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator_const = 1\n    exponent_const = 2\n\n    # We use a print statement to output the final equation in a readable format.\n    # The variables β (beta) and μ (mu) are treated as symbols.\n    print(\"The grand canonical partition function Z is derived as a geometric series.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for Z is:\")\n    print(f\"Z = {numerator} / ({denominator_const} - e^({exponent_const}*β*μ))\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is valid for μ < 0, where μ is the chemical potential.\")\n\nsolve_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = 1 / (1 - e^(2*β*μ))>>>"
