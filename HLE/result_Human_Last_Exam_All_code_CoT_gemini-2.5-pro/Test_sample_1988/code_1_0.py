    This function calculates the number of subgraphs of the Gosset graph
    that are isomorphic to the graph with HoG ID 50698.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Construct the target graph, which is described as the graph of edges of K8
        where adjacency means the edges are disjoint. This is the Johnson graph J(8, 2).
    2.  Construct the Gosset graph, a 27-regular graph on 56 vertices.
    3.  Use the GraphMatcher from networkx to find all subgraph isomorphisms from the
        target graph to the Gosset graph.
    4.  Count the number of unique sets of vertices that form these subgraphs to get the
        final answer.
