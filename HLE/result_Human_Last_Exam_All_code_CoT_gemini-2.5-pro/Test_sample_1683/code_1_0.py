# This script analyzes the multi-step synthesis to identify the final product.

# Define the names of the compounds as determined by the step-by-step analysis.
compound_1_name = "bis(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)methanone"
compound_2_name = "A cyclic silyl ether derivative of Compound 1"
compound_3_name = "bis(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)methanol"
compound_4_name = "2,2'-benzophenonedicarboxylic acid"

# The final step is the Jones oxidation of Compound 3.
# Compound 3 has two primary alcohols (-CH2OH) and one secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).
# Jones reagent oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids (-COOH) and
# secondary alcohols to ketones (C=O).

# The final product, Compound 4, is 2,2'-benzophenonedicarboxylic acid.
# Let's determine its molecular formula and atom counts.
# The structure consists of a central ketone (CO) linking two disubstituted
# benzene rings (C6H4). Each ring is substituted with a carboxylic acid group (COOH).

# Atom counts for the final product:
# Carbons: 1 (ketone) + 2 * 6 (benzene rings) + 2 * 1 (from COOH)
total_C = 1 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 1

# Hydrogens: 2 * 4 (benzene rings) + 2 * 1 (from COOH)
total_H = 2 * 4 + 2 * 1

# Oxygens: 1 (ketone) + 2 * 2 (from COOH)
total_O = 1 + 2 * 2
