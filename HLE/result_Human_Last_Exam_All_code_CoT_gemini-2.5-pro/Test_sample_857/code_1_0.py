# This problem is a theoretical question from point-set topology.
# The final answer is a cardinal number, not a value that can be computed
# through a simple numerical calculation. The code below displays this
# answer in its standard mathematical representation.

# The largest possible cardinality is 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.
# This is mathematically defined as 2 raised to the power of aleph-nought,
# where aleph-nought is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.

# The mathematical expression for the answer is: 2^aleph_0
# The prompt requests that we output each number in the final equation.
# The numbers in this expression are the base (2) and the index of the aleph number (0).

base = 2
aleph_index = 0

print(f"The largest possible cardinality is 2^aleph_{aleph_index}.")
print("The numbers in this expression are:")
print(f"Base: {base}")
print(f"Index of the Aleph number in the exponent: {aleph_index}")
