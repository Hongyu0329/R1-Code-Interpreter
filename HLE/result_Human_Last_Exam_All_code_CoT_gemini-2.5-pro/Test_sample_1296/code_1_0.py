    Solves the three-part question about dessin d'enfants.

    (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    Analysis: The problem states that G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F. A key property of a quasiprimitive group action is that every non-trivial normal subgroup is transitive. Since N (the socle) is a non-trivial normal subgroup, N must act transitively on the face set F. The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F. Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit. Therefore, D_N has only one face, meaning it is unicellular. This holds true regardless of whether G/N is cyclic. Thus, the implication is true.
    Answer: Yes

    (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    Analysis: A smooth covering implies that the face-length of D and D_N are the same, which leads to the condition <g_2> ∩ N = {e}, where g_2 is the face-rotation generator. A unicellular D_N implies that the quotient group G/N must be generated by the image of g_2, meaning G/N is a cyclic group. The question then becomes: for which of the types HA, TW, AS can G/N be cyclic?
    - HA (Holomorph of Abelian): G/N is a subgroup of GL(d, p), which can be cyclic. Possible.
    - TW (Twisted Wreath): For G = T ≀ Z_l, G/N ≅ Z_l, which is cyclic. Possible.
    - AS (Almost Simple): G/N is a subgroup of Out(S). Out(S) is often cyclic or contains cyclic subgroups (e.g., for S=PSL(2, 2^l), Out(S) is cyclic). Possible.
    All three types can satisfy the condition.
    Answer: HA, TW, AS

    (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    Analysis: This is possible if and only if there exists a non-abelian simple group T that can be generated by two elements x, y such that gcd(order(xy), l) = 1. The statement claims this is impossible for l <= 5. We can find a counterexample. Let T = A_5 (the alternating group on 5 elements) and l=2. A_5 can be generated by x=(1,2,3) and y=(1,4,5). Their product is xy=(1,4,5,2,3), which has order 5. gcd(5, 2) = 1. Since the condition is met for T=A_5 and l=2, it is possible for a group of type TW with l=2 (which is <= 5) to be the automorphism group. Similar examples can be found for l=3, 4, 5. Therefore, the statement is false.
    Answer: False
