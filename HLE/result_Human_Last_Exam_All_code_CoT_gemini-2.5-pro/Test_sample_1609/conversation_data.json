    "To find a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, we need to refer to a known sequence in combinatorics and computer science. This sequence is registered as A000375 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThere is no simple, closed-form formula to calculate a(n) for any given n. The values have been determined through complex combinatorial arguments and constructions developed in research papers over many years.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define a Python function that stores the first few known values of this sequence in a dictionary.\n2.  Call this function with `n=4` to retrieve the corresponding value.\n3.  Print the result in the format `a(4) = result`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_maximal_prime_implicants(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables.\n\n    This function uses a pre-computed list of values from the On-Line Encyclopedia\n    of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A000375, as there is no simple\n    closed-form formula for this sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known values for a(n) from OEIS A000375\n    known_values = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 12,\n        4: 32,\n        5: 80,\n        6: 224,\n        7: 672\n    }\n    \n    if n in known_values:\n        return known_values[n]\n    else:\n        # For values not in the list, we can't compute them easily.\n        # This is a placeholder for a more complex calculation if needed.\n        return f\"The value for n={n} is not in the pre-computed list.\"\n\ndef solve_for_a4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for a(4) and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    result = get_maximal_prime_implicants(n)\n    \n    print(f\"If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables:\")\n    # The final equation is a(4) = 32. We output each number in it.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_for_a4()\n```\n<<<32>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.
