    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   A **binary operation** on a set S is a function that takes two elements from S and returns an element of S. For a set with 3 elements, say {0, 1, 2}, this can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (Cayley table).\n    *   An operation is **commutative** if `x * y = y * x` for all elements x, y. This means the multiplication table is symmetric about its main diagonal.\n    *   An operation is **associative** if `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all elements x, y, z.\n\n2.  **Count Commutative Operations:**\n    *   To define a commutative operation on 3 elements, we only need to specify the values for the upper triangle of the 3x3 table (including the diagonal).\n    *   The number of these entries is `3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements, there are `3^6 = 729` possible commutative operations.\n\n3.  **Check for Associativity:**\n    *   We need to filter these 729 commutative operations to find out which ones are also associative.\n    *   For each of the 729 operations, we must check if the associative law holds for all possible combinations of x, y, and z. There are `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` such combinations (triples) to check.\n\n4.  **Automate with Code:**\n    *   A program can be written to perform this exhaustive check.\n    *   The code will iterate through all 729 possible commutative operations.\n    *   For each operation, it will check all 27 associativity conditions.\n    *   A counter will keep track of how many operations satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of associative and commutative binary \n    operations that can be defined on a set of 3 elements.\n\n    It works by systematically generating every possible commutative operation,\n    and then for each one, testing if it also satisfies the associative property.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    associative_commutative_count = 0\n\n    # A commutative operation on a set of size n is determined by the values on \n    # the diagonal and upper triangle of its Cayley table.\n    # The number of such entries is n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    num_defining_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # Total number of commutative operations is n^(n*(n+1)/2)\n    total_commutative_ops = n**num_defining_entries\n\n    # Iterate through all possible ways to define a commutative operation.\n    # Each 'values' tuple represents one unique commutative operation.\n    # The tuple contains the 6 values for op(0,0), op(1,1), op(2,2), op(0,1), op(0,2), op(1,2).\n    defining_values_iterator = itertools.product(elements, repeat=num_defining_entries)\n\n    for values in defining_values_iterator:\n        # Construct the full 3x3 Cayley table for the current operation\n        op = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Fill the table using the 6 defining values and commutativity\n        op[0][0] = values[0]\n        op[1][1] = values[1]\n        op[2][2] = values[2]\n        op[0][1] = op[1][0] = values[3]\n        op[0][2] = op[2][0] = values[4]\n        op[1][2] = op[2][1] = values[5]\n        \n        # Check if this operation is associative\n        is_associative = True\n        # The associative property (x*y)*z = x*(y*z) must hold for all n^3 triples.\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    left_hand_side = op[op[x][y]][z]\n                    right_hand_side = op[x][op[y][z]]\n                    \n                    if left_hand_side != right_hand_side:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n\n        # If the operation was found to be associative, increment our counter\n        if is_associative:\n            associative_commutative_count += 1\n            \n    # Print the explanation of the calculation\n    print(f\"Let S be a set with n = {n} elements.\")\n    print(\"To define a commutative operation, we need to specify the values for pairs (i, j) where i <= j.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the number of such pairs is n * (n + 1) / 2 = {n} * ({n} + 1) / 2 = {num_defining_entries}.\")\n    print(f\"Since each of these {num_defining_entries} values can be any of the {n} elements, the total number of commutative operations is {n}^{num_defining_entries} = {total_commutative_ops}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAn operation is associative if (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) for all x, y, z in S.\")\n    print(f\"We must check this condition for all {n}^3 = {n**3} possible triples (x, y, z).\")\n    print(\"\\nBy programmatically checking each of the 729 commutative operations for associativity, we find the final count.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is {associative_commutative_count}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_associative_commutative_operations()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
