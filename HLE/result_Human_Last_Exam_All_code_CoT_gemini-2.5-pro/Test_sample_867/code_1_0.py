# First, we define the number of sissone fermés Svetlana Zakharova performs
# in the first part of the sequence, traveling to one side of the stage.
sissones_first_set = 4

# Next, we define the number of sissone fermés she performs in the second part,
# traveling back to the other side.
sissones_second_set = 4

# We calculate the total by adding the two sets together.
total_sissones = sissones_first_set + sissones_second_set

# Finally, we print the equation showing how the total is calculated.
