    "An analysis of the provided examples reveals a specific rule for the transformation. The grid contains a single agent, represented by the number '2', which moves to an adjacent empty cell, represented by '0'. The original cell of the '2' becomes a '0', and the destination '0' cell becomes a '2'.\n\nThe core of the puzzle lies in determining the direction of the agent's move. This is governed by a fixed priority list of the eight possible directions. If multiple empty cells are available for the agent to move to, it will always choose the one corresponding to the direction with the highest priority.\n\nThe priority order, deduced from examples A and B, is as follows (from highest to lowest):\n1.  Top-Right\n2.  Right\n3.  Bottom-Right\n4.  Bottom\n5.  Bottom-Left\n6.  Left\n7.  Top-Left\n8.  Top\n\nThe output is 'MISSING' under specific conditions of ambiguity or impossibility. By analyzing all three examples, the condition for 'MISSING' in `Input_C` is identified: the situation is considered ambiguous if the two highest-priority moves (Top-Right and Right) are both available as valid moves. Another plausible condition for 'MISSING' would be if the agent is trapped with no '0' cells to move to.\n\nFor `Input_C`, the agent '2' has valid '0' cells in both its Top-Right and Right adjacent positions. Since these are the top two directions in the priority list, the condition for ambiguity is met, and the resulting output is 'MISSING'.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to determine the correct output for the provided `Input_C`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by applying a transformation rule to a grid.\n\n    The rule involves an agent '2' moving to an adjacent '0' cell based on a\n    priority list of directions.
