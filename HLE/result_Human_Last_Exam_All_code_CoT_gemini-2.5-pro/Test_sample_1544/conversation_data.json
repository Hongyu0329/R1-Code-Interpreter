    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:** I will carefully examine the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1` to understand the placement of the pieces, the material balance, and the key strategic features for both White and Black. White's main asset is the advanced passed pawn on d6, while Black's queen on c5 is very active.\n2.  **Identify Candidate Moves:** I will list and evaluate the most promising moves for White. Since White's only pieces that can move are the King and Queen, I will focus on forcing moves like checks and captures, as well as significant tactical threats.\n3.  **In-Depth Analysis of the Best Move:** The most forcing move is `Qf7+`. I will analyze the consequences of this move in detail, considering all of Black's plausible responses.\n4.  **Trace the Winning Line:** I will show how `Qf7+` leads to a sequence of moves that forces a transition into a simple and overwhelmingly winning endgame for White. This involves trading queens under favorable circumstances.\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** After confirming the winning move, I will write a Python script that prints the move in standard chess notation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport chess\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and determines the best move for White.\n\n    The position is given by the FEN: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n\n    Analysis:\n    1.  White's passed d-pawn on d6 is a massive threat, just two squares from promotion.\n    2.  Black's king is somewhat exposed, and the Black queen is active but has no immediate knockout blows.\n    3.  White needs to find a forcing sequence to capitalize on the d-pawn's strength before Black can create counterplay.\n\n    Candidate Moves Evaluation:\n    -   Moves like Qxc5 or other queen moves that allow a queen trade (e.g., ...Qe3+) lead to a lost or difficult pawn endgame for White, as Black's d-pawn becomes a passed c-pawn.\n    -   The move Qf7+ is the most forcing move on the board.\n\n    Line Analysis:\n    1.  White plays Qf7+. This check forces Black's king to move.\n        - If 1... Kb7, White plays 2. Qxc7+. This is a critical move that captures the d7 pawn with check. Black must recapture with 2... Kxa7. The resulting endgame is a White king and pawns on a4 and d6 versus a Black king on a7 and a pawn on a5. White's d-pawn is unstoppable and will promote, leading to an easy win.\n        - If 1... Ka6, White can play 2. Qe7!, pinning the Black queen to the king. Black cannot save the queen and the game is lost. For example, 2... Ka7 3. Qxc5+ dxc5, and White's king can easily stop Black's newly created passed c-pawn while the d-pawn marches to victory.\n\n    Conclusion:\n    The move Qf7+ initiates a forced sequence that leads to a winning position for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move = \"Qf7+\"\n    print(f\"The best move for White is: {best_move}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Qf7+>>>"
