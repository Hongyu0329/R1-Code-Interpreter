    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned. The total number of submatrices accessed during a standard operation (like matrix-vector multiplication) is the sum of all the blocks that define the HSS structure.\n\nThese blocks consist of:\n1.  **Off-diagonal blocks:** At each level of the hierarchy (except the last, or leaf, level), the off-diagonal blocks are represented in a compressed low-rank format. For a binary tree partitioning, there are `2 * 2^l = 2^(l+1)` such blocks at level `l`.\n2.  **Diagonal blocks:** The partitioning recursion stops at the leaf level. The diagonal blocks at this final level are stored as regular (often dense) matrices.\n\nFor a tree of depth 4, the levels are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The leaf nodes are at level 4. We need to sum the off-diagonal blocks from level 0 to 3 and add the diagonal blocks at level 4.\n\n*   **Level 0:** `2^(0+1)` = 2 off-diagonal blocks.\n*   **Level 1:** `2^(1+1)` = 4 off-diagonal blocks.\n*   **Level 2:** `2^(2+1)` = 8 off-diagonal blocks.\n*   **Level 3:** `2^(3+1)` = 16 off-diagonal blocks.\n*   **Level 4 (leaf):** `2^4` = 16 diagonal blocks.\n\nThe total is the sum of these values. The following Python code calculates this sum and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hss_submatrices(depth):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices in an HSS representation of a given depth.\n\n    In an HSS tree of depth 'd', the submatrices consist of:\n    1.
