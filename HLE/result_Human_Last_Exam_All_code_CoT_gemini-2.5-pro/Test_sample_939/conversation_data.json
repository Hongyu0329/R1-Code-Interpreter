    "Answering this question requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the sRGB color space and checking if the resulting values fall within the valid sRGB gamut.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: A color \"cannot be represented\" if, after conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of its R, G, or B components are outside the standard range of [0, 1]. This happens because ROMM RGB has a much wider gamut (range of colors) than sRGB.\n2.  **Use a reliable library**: The conversion process involves complex matrix transformations and non-linear gamma corrections. I will use Python with the `scikit-image` library, which provides an accurate `convert_colorspace` function for this task.\n3.  **Process each color**:\n    *   For each of the five given ROMM RGB colors, I will perform the conversion to sRGB.\n    *   I will print the original ROMM RGB values and the resulting sRGB values for clarity.\n4.  **Check the Gamut**:\n    *   For each converted sRGB color, I will check if all three components (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n    *   If a component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut.\"\n5.  **Compile the final answer**:\n    *   I will collect the numbers of all the colors that are out of the sRGB gamut.\n    *   Finally, I will present these numbers in ascending order, as requested.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan. You will need the `scikit-image` and `numpy` libraries installed (`pip install scikit-image numpy`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    from skimage.color import convert_colorspace\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the required libraries: pip install scikit-image numpy\")\n    exit()\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a list of ROMM RGB colors to sRGB and checks if they are within the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the ROMM RGB colors from the problem description\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),    # Pure ROMM Blue\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),    # Pure ROMM Green\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),    # White\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_colors = []\n\n    print(\"--- Checking ROMM RGB to sRGB Conversion ---\")\n    \n    for number, romm_rgb in colors.items():\n        # The conversion function expects an image-like array, so we reshape the color\n        # from a simple array [R, G, B] to a (1, 1, 3) array.\n        romm_rgb_reshaped = romm_rgb.reshape((1, 1, 3))\n\n        # Perform the color space conversion from ProPhoto (ROMM) to sRGB\n        srgb_reshaped = convert_colorspace(romm_rgb_reshaped, 'ProPhoto RGB', 'sRGB')\n\n        # Squeeze the result back to a simple [R, G, B] array\n        srgb = srgb_reshaped.squeeze()\n        r, g, b = srgb[0], srgb[1], srgb[2]\n\n        print(f\"\\nColor {number}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converted to sRGB({r:.4f}, {g:.4f}, {b:.4f})\")\n\n        # Check if any sRGB component is outside the valid [0, 1] range.\n        is_in_gamut = (0 <= r <= 1) and (0 <= g <= 1) and (0 <= b <= 1)\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            status = \"Out of sRGB gamut.
