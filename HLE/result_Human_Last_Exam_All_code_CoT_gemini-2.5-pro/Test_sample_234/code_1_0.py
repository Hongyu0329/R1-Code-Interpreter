# The problem is a mathematical deduction, not a computation.
# The step-by-step reasoning is as follows:
# 1. Analyze the property of the function f and the set S.
# 2. Test the property "Open".
#    - Let x be in S. By definition, there is a ball B(x, ε) on which f is an isometry.
#    - For any y in B(x, ε), we can find a smaller ball B(y, δ) that is inside B(x, ε).
#    - f is also an isometry on B(y, δ), so y is in S.
#    - This means B(x, ε) is a subset of S.
#    - Therefore, S is an open set. This property must always be true.
# 3. Test the other six properties by trying to find counterexamples.
#    - Closed: f(x) = |x| in R gives S = R \ {0}, which is not closed.
#    - Connected: f(x) = |x| in R gives S = R \ {0}, which is not connected.
#    - Compact: f(x) = |x| in R gives S = R \ {0}, which is not compact.
#    - Connected complement: A piecewise function f(x) on R can be built by changing the derivative from +1 to -1 and back, such that S^c = {-1, 1}, which is not connected.
#    - Dense: It is possible to construct a function f such that its S^c contains an open ball, meaning S is not dense. For example, f could be the identity outside a ball and behave differently inside.
#    - Trivial first singular homology group: It is possible to construct f in R^2 such that S is a region with a hole, like R^2 minus an annulus. Such a set has a non-trivial first homology group.
# 4. Conclude that only the "Open" property must always be true.
# The number of properties that must always be true is 1.
