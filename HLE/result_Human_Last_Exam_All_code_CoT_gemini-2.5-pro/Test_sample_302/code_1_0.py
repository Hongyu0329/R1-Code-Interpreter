# This python block demonstrates the key relationships from the data generation.
# We will not regenerate the full dataset, but we will print the conclusion.

# The data generation process for the mean of y is:
# E[y] = (country_effect^2 + 0.01) * x + continent_effect + 1

# This can be written as:
# E[y] = slope * x + intercept
# where:
# slope depends on 'country'
# intercept depends on 'continent'
# 'country' effects are nested within 'continent' effects.

# Analysis of the models:
# - Models 1, 2, 6 use the wrong distribution for y.
# - Models 4, 5 have the wrong structure for the slope (depends on continent, not country).
# - Models 6, 7 have syntactically invalid prior specifications.
# - Model 8 uses the wrong functional form for x (x^2 instead of x).

# - Model 3 uses the correct Gamma distribution.
# - Model 3 correctly models the hierarchical nesting of country-within-continent for both slope and intercept.
# - While the intercept in Model 3 is more complex than in the data generation (country-level instead of just continent-level),
#   it is the only syntactically correct model that captures the essential features: the Gamma distribution,
#   the hierarchical structure, and a slope that varies at the country level.
