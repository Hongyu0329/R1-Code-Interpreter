    # The problem asks to find a solution that meets four key requirements:
    # 1. Prevents spoofing and replay attacks.
    # 2. Ensures an unwilling (coerced) user will NOT authenticate.
    # 3. Remains secure even if biometric data is stolen.
    # 4. Applies to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    # Option H, Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication, is the most robust choice.
    # 1. It mitigates spoofing/replay by checking context (e.g., location, device).
    #    An attacker would need to spoof the biometric AND the context.
    # 2. It directly addresses coercion by detecting anomalies in user behavior and context
    #    (e.g., unusual time or place), which are hallmarks of a duress situation.
    # 3. It protects against data exposure because the stolen biometric data is insufficient
    #    without the correct, dynamic context.
    # 4. It is modality-agnostic, as contextual data is evaluated independently of the
    #    specific biometric type being used.

    # Other options fail on one or more critical requirements, especially coercion.
    # For example, Liveness Detection (D) fails against coercion, and solutions like
    # Hashing (J) or ZKP (C) do not stop a coerced user from authenticating.
