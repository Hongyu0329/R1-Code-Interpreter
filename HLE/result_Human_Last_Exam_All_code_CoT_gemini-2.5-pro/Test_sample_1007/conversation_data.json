    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as the starting position, let's analyze the mechanics of each option. The \"position\" refers not just to the type (e.g., fifth position) but also to which foot is in front.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the starting and ending characteristic for each ballet step provided in the answer choices.\n2.  I will represent the leg positions as a state, for example, \"Right foot front\" or \"Left foot front\".\n3.  I will model the action of each step and determine if the state changes.\n4.  The step for which the starting state equals the ending state is the correct answer.\n5.  I will write a Python script to automate this logic and print the result.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** An entrechat with an even number (deux, quatre, six, huit) lands in the same position it started from. It's a jump in place where the legs beat, but the starting and ending configuration of the feet remains unchanged.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"changé\" literally means \"changed.\" The dancer starts in fifth position, jumps to second, and lands back in fifth with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step \"assembles\" the legs in the air. A common assemblé, such as *assemblé dessus* (over), involves the back leg moving to the side and then landing in front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière*, one foot glides to the side and the other closes behind it. This action typically results in the feet switching their front/back relationship.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a pas de chat but with ronds de jambe. It almost always involves changing which foot is in front.\n\nBased on this analysis, **Entrechat six** is the step that is defined by starting and ending in the exact same foot position. The Python code below will formalize this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position it started from.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let's define the properties of each step.\n    # 'changes_position' being False means start and end positions are identical.\n    steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'A jump in place.
