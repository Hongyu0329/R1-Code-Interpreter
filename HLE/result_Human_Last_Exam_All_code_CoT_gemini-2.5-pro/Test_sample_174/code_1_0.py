# Step 1: Define the formula for the Euler characteristic of the moduli stack M_3.
# chi(M_g) = -B_{2g} / (2g), where B_{2g} is the 2g-th Bernoulli number.
# For genus g = 3, we need B_6.
g = 3
B6 = bernoulli(2 * g)

# Calculate chi(M_3)
chi_M3 = -Rational(B6, 2 * g)

# Step 2: Use the known value for the Euler characteristic of the hyperelliptic locus H_3.
# From the literature (e.g., Bergstr√∂m, Tommasi), chi(H_3) = -1/120.
chi_H3 = Rational(-1, 120)

# Step 3: The stack of smooth plane quartics [U/G] corresponds to the stack of
# non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, M_3^nh.
# The Euler characteristic is chi(M_3^nh) = chi(M_3) - chi(H_3).
result = chi_M3 - chi_H3

# Step 4: Print the final calculation step by step.
