# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar molecule.
# The chemical formula for a well-known fullerene-wheeled nanocar is C298H32.
# The hydrogens are on the chassis/axle part of the molecule.
num_hydrogens_in_nanocar = 32

# Step 2: Apply the "perfluoro-" rule.
# The prefix "perfluoro-" means that every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.
# So, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version is equal to
# the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogens_in_nanocar

# Step 3: Print the reasoning and the result.
print(f"A standard nanocar molecule (C298H32) has {num_hydrogens_in_nanocar} hydrogen atoms.")
print("In a perfluoronanocar, all of these hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")
print(f"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.")
print(f"Number of Fluorine Atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}")
