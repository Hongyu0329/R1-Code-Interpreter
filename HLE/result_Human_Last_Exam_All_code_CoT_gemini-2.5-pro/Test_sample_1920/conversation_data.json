    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $g$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$ from the prime factorization $d = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Primitivity and Order Conditions**: For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. In our case, since the conductor $d=53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., square-free), this simplifies to each $\\chi_i$ being a non-principal character modulo its respective prime $p_i$. This means the order of each $\\chi_i$ must be greater than 1.\n\n3.  The order of the overall character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given this must be $g=6$. This implies that the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: Combining these conditions, the order of each component $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6 and greater than 1, so $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of characters modulo a prime $p$ having order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$. We will verify this condition for all prime factors of $d$.\n\n5.  **Use Inclusion-Exclusion**: We will count the total number of combinations of component characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ that result in an overall order of 6. This can be calculated using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The total number of primitive characters with order 6, $N(6)$, is given by:\n    $N(6) = (\\text{Num. with order dividing 6}) - (\\text{Num. with order dividing 3}) - (\\text{Num. with order dividing 2}) + (\\text{Num. with order dividing 1})$\n    Each term is calculated by counting the valid choices for each component character and raising it to the power of the number of prime factors.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a natural number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d={d} and order g={g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of d\n    primes = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d={d} is {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    print(\"The conductor is square-free.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define conditions for component characters\n    print(\"Step 2: A primitive character chi modulo d is a product of non-principal characters chi_i modulo each prime factor p_i.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi, lcm(ord(chi_1), ord(chi_2), ord(chi_3), ord(chi_4)), must be {g}.\")\n    print(f\"This means ord(chi_i) must be a divisor of {g} and greater than 1.\")\n    \n    divisors_g = [k for k in range(1, g + 1) if g % k == 0]\n    possible_orders = [k for k in divisors_g if k > 1]\n    print(f\"The possible orders for each component chi_i are {possible_orders}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count characters for each possible order\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of characters for each possible order modulo the prime factors.\")\n    phi_values = {k: phi(k) for k in possible_orders}\n    print(\"The number of characters of order k modulo a prime p is phi(k), provided k divides (p-1).\")\n    \n    all_valid = True\n    for p in primes:\n        if (p -
