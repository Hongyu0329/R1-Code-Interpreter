    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions with identical large groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry means that the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals from the central core and one of the arms.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene moiety. Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups are equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linker:** Each substituent is connected to the central ring by a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker. The three linker groups are equivalent. However, each linker is attached to a chiral center (the complex substituent). This makes the two protons on a single `-CH2-` group diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and will produce two separate signals.\n4.  **Count Signals from the Substituent:** We will analyze one of the identical substituents, which is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a rigid and chiral structure derived from camphor. We must count every unique proton environment within it:\n    *   **Pyrazole ring proton (H3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring. It is in a unique environment. (1 signal)\n    *   **Bridgehead proton (H4):** There is one proton at a bridgehead of the bicyclic system. (1 signal)\n    *   **Methylene protons (H5 and H6):** There are two `-CH2-` groups in the bicyclic skeleton. In each group, the two protons are diastereotopic. Furthermore, the two `-CH2-` groups themselves are not in equivalent positions. This results in four unique proton signals. (2 + 2 = 4 signals)\n    *   **Methyl groups:** There are three methyl groups specified: `7,8,8-trimethyl`.\n        *   The methyl group at position 7 is on a bridgehead carbon and is unique. (1 signal)\n        *   The two methyl groups at position 8 form a gem-dimethyl pair on the methano bridge. Due to the overall chirality of the molecule, these two methyl groups are diastereotopic and will produce two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n5.  **Sum the Totals:** Finally, we will add up the number of signals from the core, the linker, and the substituent to get the total number of expected peaks.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints the breakdown based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
