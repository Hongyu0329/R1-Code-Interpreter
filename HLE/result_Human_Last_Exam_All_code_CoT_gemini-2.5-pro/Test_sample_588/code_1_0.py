def solve_manifold_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the manifold puzzle by verifying the derived solution.

    The problem asks for the lexicographically least tuple (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l),
    with l minimal, such that each manifold M(a_i, b_i) is not "full", but their
    connect-sum is "full".

    This translates to the following conditions:
    1. For each i, a_i != 1 and b_i != 1 (since M(a_i, b_i) is not full).
       a_i and b_i are non-negative integers (genera).
    2. The connect-sum being full imposes the condition on the Euler characteristics:
       2 * sum_{i=1 to l} (1 - a_i) * (1 - b_i) = l - 1

    Through analysis, the minimal number of manifolds is l=3. The equation becomes:
    sum_{i=1 to 3} (1 - a_i) * (1 - b_i) = 1

    To find the lexicographically smallest tuple, we search for the smallest valid
    pairs (a_i, b_i) that satisfy this equation. The solution found is composed
    of the pairs (0,0), (0,0), and (0,2).
