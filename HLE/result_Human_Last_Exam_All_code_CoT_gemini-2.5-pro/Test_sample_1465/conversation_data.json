    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequences.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Coiled-Coil Structure:** The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of its heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The identity of the amino acids in these core positions dictates how the alpha-helices pack together.\n2.  **Identify Heptad Register:** I will analyze each sequence to find the repeating seven-amino-acid pattern. By identifying the hydrophobic residues that typically occupy the 'a' and 'd' positions, I can establish the register. For these sequences, a `gabcdef` register seems most plausible, placing the first Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and the fourth residue of the first heptad at the 'd' position.\n3.  **Determine Core Residue Pairs:** For each sequence, I will identify the characteristic pair of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  **Apply Prediction Rules:** Based on well-established principles from structural biology and bioinformatics prediction tools, different `(a, d)` pairings strongly favor specific oligomeric states. I will implement these rules in a Python script:\n    *   `(I, A)` pairing at `(a, d)` tends to form trimers.\n    *   `(I, L)` is the canonical pairing for dimers.\n    *   `(I, I)` favors trimers due to efficient core packing.\n    *   `(I, Q)` can be accommodated in trimers.\n    *   `(I, T)` has beta-branched side chains at both 'a' and 'd' positions, which can favor tetrameric structures.\n5.  **Generate Output:** The script will process each sequence, apply the rules to predict its oligomeric state, and print the results in a clear format, concluding with the final sequence of numbers corresponding to the answer choices.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on the\n    residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    predictions = []\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing coiled-coil sequences...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    for seq in sequences:\n        # Assuming a 'gabcdef' register where the first Isoleucine is at 'a'.\n        # 'a' positions are 1, 8, 15, 22...\n        # 'd' positions are 4, 11, 18, 25...\n        a_residues = [seq[i] for i in range(1, len(seq), 7)]\n        d_residues = [seq[i] for i in range(4, len(seq), 7)]\n        \n        # Determine the most common 'a' and 'd' residues to define the core pair\n        a_res = collections.Counter(a_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n        d_res = collections.Counter(d_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n        \n        state = 'Unknown'\n        \n        # Prediction rules based on common (a, d) pairings\n        if a_res == 'I' and d_res == 'A':\n            # IaAd packing is characteristic of trimers.\n            state = 3\n        elif a_res == 'I' and d_res == 'L':\n            # IaLd is the canonical pairing for dimers.
