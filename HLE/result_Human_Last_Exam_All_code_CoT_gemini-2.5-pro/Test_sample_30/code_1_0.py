        'B': "To understand how randomization and interaction can help for proof checking, the example of an interactive proof for the language graph non-isomorphism isn't very helpful.",
        'C': "Quantum entanglement cannot be used as a tool for verifying answers to very complicated problems.",
        'D': "If a prover and verifier are required, there are exponential requirements on the computational power of the prover, whereas the verifier is required to run in polynomial time",
        'E': "...Standard amplification techniques reveal that the exact values significantly affect the class of languages that admit such proofs, provided that they are chosen within reasonable bounds.",
        'F': "By interrogating two provers separately about their answers, you can never quickly verify solutions to an even larger class of problems than you can when you only have one prover to interrogate.",
        'G': "A polynomial-time verifier, when augmented with the ability to interrogate an all-powerful prover and use randomization, can never solve computational problems that are vastly more difficult than... NP problems.",
        'H': "Complexity theory formalizes the notion of proof... a language L is a subset of {0, 1, 2}, the set of all trinary strings...",
        'I': "...for any z ∈/ L there is at least one string π such that V(z, π) accepts.",

    explanations = {
        'A': "Incorrect. This is the opposite of the definition. The core idea of an interactive proof is the communication (interaction) between a verifier and a prover. The statement describes static proofs (the class NP).",
        'B': "Incorrect. The interactive proof for Graph Non-Isomorphism (GNI) is the classic, canonical example used to demonstrate the power of interaction and randomization in proof systems.",
        'C': "Incorrect. A landmark result in complexity theory, MIP* = RE, shows that interactive proofs with multiple, entangled provers can verify solutions to uncomputable problems. Thus, entanglement is an immensely powerful tool.",
        'D': "Correct. This statement accurately captures the fundamental computational asymmetry in interactive proof systems. The verifier must be efficient (polynomial-time), while the prover is assumed to be computationally unbounded (all-powerful), which is often conceptualized as having the power to solve problems requiring exponential time.",
        'E': "Incorrect. While the description of completeness and soundness is mostly correct, the conclusion is false. Standard amplification techniques show that the power of the proof system is robust to the specific choices of completeness/soundness probabilities (as long as a gap exists). The class of languages does not significantly change.",
        'F': "Incorrect. Using two provers (MIP - Multi-prover Interactive Proofs) allows the verification of a strictly larger class of problems (NEXP) than with one prover (IP = PSPACE). The result MIP = NEXP proves this.",
        'G': "Incorrect. Interactive proofs (the class IP) can solve all problems in PSPACE (IP = PSPACE). PSPACE is known to contain NP and is widely believed to be a significantly larger class, containing problems vastly more difficult than NP problems.",
        'H': "Incorrect. The standard alphabet for defining languages in complexity theory is the binary alphabet {0, 1}, not a trinary one.",
        'I': "Incorrect. This describes the soundness condition for NP incorrectly. For an instance z not in the language, the verifier must *reject* for *all* possible proofs π. The statement describes the opposite.",
        'J': "Incorrect. This describes highly technical details of a specific construction (likely related to Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, a type of proof system) rather than a general, defining characteristic of the overall concept of interactive proofs."
