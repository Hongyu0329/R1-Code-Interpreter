# The correction factor P(n) is derived from the Euler-Maclaurin expansion
# of the sum of k*ln(k). The goal is to cancel out the error terms of the
# initial approximation T(n).

# The logarithmic error ln(Q(n)/T(n)) has an asymptotic series starting
# with terms in n^{-2} and n^{-4}. We define ln(P(n)) to be equal to
# these terms.

# The coefficients are derived from Bernoulli numbers:
# Term 1: B4 / 4! * (d^3/dx^3)(x*ln(x))  -> 1/720
# Term 2: B6 / 6! * (d^5/dx^5)(x*ln(x))  -> -1/5040

# Define the coefficients of the formula for P(n).
# P(n) = exp(c1/n**2 - c2/n**4)
