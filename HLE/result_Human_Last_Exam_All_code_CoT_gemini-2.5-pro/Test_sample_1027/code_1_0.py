    Computes the dimension of the homology of G with trivial real coefficients in degree 31.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. The group G, generated by g and h, is analyzed. It fits into a short exact sequence
       1 -> K -> G -> Z^2 -> 1, where K is the subgroup of elements with compact support
       and Z^2 is the group of translations at +/- infinity.
    2. The homology of G can be related to the homology of K and Z^2 via the
       Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.
    3. The group K is a subgroup of the commutator subgroup of a Thompson-Stein group. Such
       groups are known to be acyclic over the reals, meaning H_q(K, R) = 0 for q >= 1.
       This is a deep result from geometric group theory which we assume.
    4. This acyclicity causes the spectral sequence to collapse, leading to an isomorphism
       H_n(G, R) ~= H_n(Z^2, R).
    5. The dimension of the k-th homology group of Z^n (with trivial real coefficients)
       is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k).
    6. We need to compute this dimension for n=2 (from Z^2) and k=31.
