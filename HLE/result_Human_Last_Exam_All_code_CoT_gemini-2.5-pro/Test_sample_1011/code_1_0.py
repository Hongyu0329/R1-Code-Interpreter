    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points
    for a specific set of ultrafilters in the Stone-Cech remainder of the integers.

    Let K be the set of accumulation points.
    1. K is the continuous image of the space N*, which is connected.
    2. Therefore, K must be a connected set.
    3. In a Hausdorff space like N*, a finite connected set can only have one point.
    4. Thus, if K is finite, its size must be 1.
    5. We seek the smallest possible size for K. If it's possible to construct
       the sequence of ultrafilters such that K has only one point, then 1 is the minimum.
       Any other scenario would lead to an infinite number of accumulation points.

    Therefore, the smallest possible number of accumulation points is 1.
