# This script will print the solution to the Go puzzle.
# The problem asks for the move(s) White can make to kill the Black group.
# After analyzing the position, the only move that initiates a kill sequence is B1.
# Any other move allows Black to make an eye or connect out.
# The move B1 leads to a kill regardless of Black's response,
# either by direct capture or by winning a ko fight.
