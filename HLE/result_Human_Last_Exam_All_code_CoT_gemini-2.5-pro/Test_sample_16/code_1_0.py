    Analyzes the theoretical problem to find the minimum number of prototypes.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of prototypes (M) required to guarantee
    that a distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier can correctly classify C
    class centroids.

    Let's denote the number of classes as C.

    Step 1: Proving M >= C (Lower Bound)

    We need to show that M = C-1 prototypes are not sufficient. Let's assume we have C-1
    prototypes, p_1, p_2, ..., p_{C-1}.
    Let's also consider a "worst-case" but valid configuration for the class centroids,
    c_1, c_2, ..., c_C. A challenging configuration is one where the centroids are
    equidistant from each other (e.g., the vertices of a regular simplex).

    The soft label for each prototype p_i is based on its proximity to the class
    centroids. To have the best chance of success, we can place each of our C-1
    prototypes p_i very close to one of the first C-1 centroids c_i.
    - If p_i is very close to c_i, its soft label L(p_i) will be a vector where the
      i-th component is close to 1 and all other components are close to 0. Let's denote
      this approximate label as e_i (the standard basis vector).

    Now, consider the task of classifying the centroid c_C. All C-1 prototypes
    p_1, ..., p_{C-1} are far from c_C. In our equidistant-centroid scenario,
    dist(c_C, p_i) is approximately dist(c_C, c_i), which is the same for all i from 1 to C-1.
    Therefore, c_C is roughly equidistant from all C-1 prototypes.

    When we use the kNN classifier (for any k <= C-1), the predicted soft label for c_C,
    L_pred(c_C), will be a weighted average of the labels of its k nearest neighbors,
    which are some subset of {p_1, ..., p_{C-1}}. Since the weights are based on
    inverse distance and the distances are all similar, the predicted label will be
    a roughly even combination of {L(p_1), ..., L(p_{C-1})}.
    - L_pred(c_C) ≈ α_1*e_1 + α_2*e_2 + ... + α_{C-1}*e_{C-1}, where α_i are non-negative weights.
    Crucially, the C-th component of each e_i is approximately 0. Therefore, the C-th
    component of L_pred(c_C) will also be approximately 0.

    The classifier will pick the class corresponding to the largest component in L_pred(c_C).
    Since the C-th component is near zero, c_C will be misclassified as one of the classes
    1, 2, ..., C-1. This construction shows that C-1 prototypes cannot *guarantee* success.
    Therefore, the minimum number of prototypes M must be at least C.

    Step 2: Proving M <= C (Upper Bound)

    We now show that C prototypes are sufficient. This is a constructive proof.
    The strategy is to place one prototype, p_i, extremely close to each class centroid, c_i,
    for all i from 1 to C.
    - As before, placing p_i very close to c_i makes its soft label L(p_i) approximately e_i.

    Now, let's classify an arbitrary centroid c_j using the kNN classifier.
    1.  Find k-nearest prototypes to c_j: The prototype p_j is extremely close to c_j (e.g., distance ε),
        while all other prototypes p_i (where i ≠ j) are much farther away (at distances
        approximately dist(c_j, c_i)). Therefore, p_j is unambiguously the closest prototype.
    2.  Calculate weighted average: The weight for each prototype p_i in the kNN average is
        w_i = 1 / dist(c_j, p_i).
        - The weight for p_j is w_j = 1/ε, which is a very large number.
        - The weights for other prototypes p_i (i ≠ j) are significantly smaller.
    3.  Compute prediction: The predicted soft label L_pred(c_j) is the weighted sum of the
        prototype labels. Because the weight w_j is orders of magnitude larger than all other
        weights, the sum is dominated by the term w_j * L(p_j).
        - L_pred(c_j) ≈ L(p_j) ≈ e_j.

    The resulting predicted label for c_j is a vector with a value close to 1 at the j-th
    position and close to 0 everywhere else. The classifier correctly identifies class j as
    the most probable class. Since this holds for any centroid c_j (for j=1..C), this
    strategy is successful.

    Therefore, C prototypes are sufficient.

    Step 3: Conclusion

    Since at least C prototypes are necessary and C prototypes are sufficient, the minimum
    number required is C.
