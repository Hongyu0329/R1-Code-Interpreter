    Analyzes the Barcan and Converse Barcan formulas in systems with decreasing domains.

    - Barcan Formula (BF): □∃x φ(x) → ∃x □φ(x)
    - Converse Barcan Formula (CBF): ∃x □φ(x) → □∃x φ(x)
    - System Constraint: Decreasing domains across possible worlds (if w' is accessible from w, Domain(w') is a subset of Domain(w)).

    Analysis:
    1.  Barcan Formula (BF): This formula fails.
        - Intuition: "If every possible future contains a winner, it doesn't mean there is someone today who will be the winner in every possible future."
        - Counterexample: A person 'a' could win in future 1, and a different person 'b' could win in future 2. Person 'a' might not exist in future 2, and 'b' might not exist in future 1. This is allowed by decreasing domains. So, while in every future *someone* wins (□∃x φ(x) is true), there is no single person who wins in *all* futures (∃x □φ(x) is false).

    2.  Converse Barcan Formula (CBF): This formula holds.
        - Intuition: "If there is a specific person today, 'c', who will be the winner in every possible future, then it is true that every possible future contains a winner (namely, 'c')."
        - Proof Sketch: The premise ∃x □φ(x) asserts the existence of an individual 'c' in the current world's domain who has property φ in all accessible worlds. For any given accessible world, this same individual 'c' serves as the witness that makes ∃x φ(x) true. Therefore, □∃x φ(x) must be true.

    Conclusion: The Converse Barcan formula holds, but the Barcan formula does not. This matches option C.
