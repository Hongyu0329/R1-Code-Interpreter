    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a sterile product depends on the type of container and the environment in which it is handled, as specified by guidelines like the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>.\n\nAn ampule is a single-dose container made of glass that is sealed by fusion. Once it is broken open, it cannot be resealed. This makes it an open system, highly susceptible to contamination. Therefore, the contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no storage time allowed after opening.\n\nFor comparison, a single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) can be punctured in a sterile ISO Class 5 environment and used for up to 12 hours, as it can maintain a degree of closure. This distinction highlights why ampules require immediate use.\n\nThe following Python code clarifies this rule.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    action = \"punctured/opened in a sterile environment\"\n    bud_ampule = \"Immediate Use\"\n\n    # For comparison\n    comparison_container = \"single-dose vial\"\n    bud_vial_hours = 12\n\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Action: {action}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The official Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is: {bud_ampule}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(\"An ampule is a glass container that cannot be resealed once broken open.\")\n    print(\"Because it becomes an open system, the contents must be withdrawn and used immediately to prevent microbial contamination.\")\n    print(\"Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any length of time.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor Comparison:\")\n    print(f\"A {comparison_container}, when punctured in the same sterile environment, has a BUD of up to {bud_vial_hours} hours.\")\n    print(f\"This is because a vial's rubber stopper allows it to remain a closed system, unlike an open ampule.\")\n\nget_bud_information()\n```\n<<<Immediate use>>>"
