    "To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting material is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, which has a structure of Perylene-S-S-Perylene. The major reduction product is formed by breaking the disulfide (-S-S-) bond and adding hydrogen, resulting in two identical molecules of perylene-3-thiol (Perylene-SH). The calculation will be performed on a single molecule of this product.\n\n2.  **Represent the Molecule as a Graph:** I will use the SMILES string for perylene-3-thiol to represent the molecule. The problem specifies including hydrogen atoms, so I will generate the full molecular graph where each atom (C, S, H) is a vertex and each bond is an edge.\n\n3.  **Define and Calculate Indices:**\n    *   **Wiener Index (W):** This is the sum of the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices in the graph. I will first compute the all-pairs shortest path (distance) matrix for the molecular graph and then sum the unique pair distances.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz):** This index is calculated by summing contributions from each edge. For an edge connecting atoms `u` and `v`, its contribution is `n_u * n_v`, where `n_u` is the number of atoms closer to `u` than to `v`, and `n_v` is the number of atoms closer to `v` than to `u`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Ratio:** Finally, I will calculate the ratio by dividing the Szeged index by the Wiener index (Sz / W).\n\n5.  **Implementation:** I will use Python with the `rdkit`, `numpy`, and `scipy` libraries. `rdkit` will be used for molecular modeling, and the other two for numerical calculations, specifically for finding the shortest paths and performing the summations.\n\nThe final code will print out the calculated values for the Szeged index, the Wiener index, and their ratio as a final equation.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the required libraries.
