    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points in a compact connected metric space.
    Let X be such a space, and D be its set of dispersion points.

    A point x in X is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.

    The solution is derived in two main steps:

    Step 1: Prove that the cardinality of D is at most 1.

    The proof is by contradiction. Assume that |D| >= 2. Let p and q be two distinct dispersion points in X.

    - Since X is a compact metric space, it is a compact connected Hausdorff space. A key property of such spaces is that they are regular.
    - Regularity allows us to find an open neighborhood U of q such that p is not in the closure of U, denoted cl(U).
    - Since p is a dispersion point, the space Y = X \\ {p} is totally disconnected. Y is also a locally compact Hausdorff space.
    - In a locally compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space, for any point (like q) and any of its neighborhoods (like U intersect Y), there exists a non-empty set A which is both open and closed (clopen) in Y, such that q is in A and A is a subset of the neighborhood.
    - Because A is open in Y and Y is open in X, A is open in X.
    - Because A is closed in Y, its complement in Y, B = Y \\ A, is open in Y and thus open in X.
    - A and B are disjoint, non-empty (A contains q, B must be non-empty otherwise X would be disconnected), open sets in X whose union is X \\ {p}.
    - So, X = A U B U {p}.
    - Since X is connected, the point p must be a limit point of both A and B. In particular, p must be in the closure of A, i.e., p is in cl(A).
    - But we chose A such that A is a subset of U. This implies that cl(A) is a subset of cl(U).
    - This leads to the conclusion that p is in cl(U).
    - This contradicts our initial choice of U, where p was explicitly not in cl(U).
    - The contradiction proves our assumption that |D| >= 2 was false.
    - Therefore, the cardinality of the set of dispersion points is at most 1.

    Step 2: Show that a cardinality of 1 is possible.

    To show that the maximum is exactly 1, we need an example of a compact connected metric space that has one dispersion point.
    - Such a space exists and is known in topology as the Brouwer-Janiszewski-Knaster (BJK) continuum or the Knaster-Kuratowski fan.
    - This space is a subset of the Euclidean plane that is compact and connected, and it is constructed in such a way that it has a single, special 'apex' point.
    - The removal of this apex point leaves a space that is totally disconnected. Thus, the apex is a dispersion point.
    - The existence of this space proves that a cardinality of 1 is achievable.

    Conclusion:

    From Step 1, the maximum number of dispersion points is at most 1. From Step 2, the number can be 1.
    Therefore, the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points is 1.
