    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the molecule and provide the code:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clue:** The question points to a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago. This timeframe is famously associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and their contemporaries, such as pterosaurs.\n2.  **Identify the Molecule:** I will look for a polycyclic hydrocarbon named after one of these extinct creatures. The molecule in question is \"Pterodactyladiene,\" a whimsical name given to a complex hydrocarbon because its 2D chemical structure resembles a pterodactyl, a flying reptile from that era.\n3.  **Generate the Code:** I will create a simple Python script that prints the name of this molecule as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon\n# named after an extinct flying reptile.\n\n# The molecule's name is a portmanteau of \"pterodactyl\" and \"diene\"\n# (a hydrocarbon with two double bonds).\nmolecule_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n\nprint(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years is: {molecule_name}\")\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
