    "To solve this problem, we need to find the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Strategy**: The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case. The most memory-intensive part of a naive solution would be storing both strings in memory. The strings can be up to 100 characters long.\n2.  **Memory Optimization**: To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing both strings. The input is sequential (first string, then a newline, then the second string). We cannot read the second string's characters without first reading through the entire first string. Therefore, the most efficient approach is:\n    *   Read and store the first string in a buffer.\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time from the input stream.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it (case-insensitively) to the corresponding character in the stored first string.\n    *   This way, we only need memory for one full string buffer, plus a few small variables for processing.\n3.  **Variable Selection and Sizing**: We will choose the smallest possible C data types for our variables to minimize memory usage.\n    *   **String Buffer**: To store the first string of up to 100 characters, we need a `char` array of size 101 (100 for characters + 1 for the null terminator `\\0`).\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Input Character Variable**: The `getchar()` function, used for reading one character at a time, returns an `int`. This is necessary so it can return any possible `char` value as well as the special `EOF` (End-of-File) marker.\n        *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (this is the standard size on most 32-bit and 64-bit systems).\n    *   **Index Variable**: We need an index to keep track of our position in the first string's buffer. The index will go from 0 to 99. A `char` type is sufficient to hold this range and uses less memory than an `int`.\n        *   `char i;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation**: The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\nThe following Python script will detail this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_c_memory_usage():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logic for a memory-efficient C program\n    to solve the described problem and calculates the total memory\n    used for its variables.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To write the most memory-efficient C program, the strategy is to store only the first string and then compare it against the second string as it's being read character by character.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe variables needed for this approach and their memory consumption (in bytes) are:\")\n\n    # Memory for a buffer to hold the first string (max 100 chars + 1 null terminator)\n    string_buffer_mem = 101  # sizeof(char) is 1 byte\n\n    # Memory for the variable to hold a character from the second string, read via getchar()\n    # getchar() returns an int to accommodate the EOF value.\n    getchar_variable_mem = 4  # sizeof(int) is typically 4 bytes\n\n    # Memory for the loop index. The length is at most 100, so a char is sufficient.\n    index_variable_mem = 1  # sizeof(char) is 1 byte\n\n    print(f\"- A character buffer `char s1[101]` for the first string: {string_buffer_mem} bytes.\")\n    print(f\"- An integer `int c` for getchar()'s return value: {getchar_variable_mem} bytes.\")\n    print(f\"- A character `char i` for the loop index: {index_variable_mem} byte.\")\n\n    # Calculate the total memory\n    total_memory = string_buffer_mem + getchar_variable_mem + index_variable_mem\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total memory 'm' required for variables is the sum of these values.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: m = {string_buffer_mem} + {getchar_variable_mem} + {index_variable_mem}\")\n    print(f\"Total Memory (m) = {total_memory} bytes\")\n\ncalculate_c_memory_usage()\n\n```\n<<<106>>>"
