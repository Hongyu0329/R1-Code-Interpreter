    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System's Equilibria**: First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$. The equilibrium points are $(u, d)$ where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Classify the Equilibria**: I will then analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point determine its type (e.g., stable node, unstable node, saddle point). A saddle point is particularly important as its stable and unstable manifolds are separatrices.\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix**: The equilibrium points for the system are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$. By classifying them, I found that $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point. The separatrices are the trajectories that lead to or from this saddle point. By inspecting the structure of the differential equations, I've identified a candidate curve, $d = -u^2$, which is a simple polynomial relationship that passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n4.  **Symbolic Verification with Python**: To confirm that $d = -u^2$ is indeed a trajectory (and thus a separatrix), I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library. The script will perform a symbolic verification by substituting $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ into the first differential equation and show that it holds true.\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the script will print the final equation of the separatrix and its constituent numbers as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the verification and present the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the separatrix for the given system of differential equations\n    and prints the final equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbolic variables and functions\n    # t is the independent variable (time)\n    # u(t) and d(t) are the dependent functions\n    t = sp.Symbol('t')\n    u = sp.Function('u')(t)\n    d = sp.Function('d')(t)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the system of differential equations from the problem\n    # u'(t) = (u(t)-1)*u(t)^2\n    # d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t)+5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)*(1-u(t))*u(t)^2\n    u_prime_expr = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    d_prime_expr = 2*d**2 + (5*u**2 - 3*u)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n\n    # Step 3: Propose the equation for the separatrix\n    # Through analysis (as described in the plan), the candidate for the separatrix is d = -u^2.\n    separatrix_eq = -u**2\n\n    # Step 4: Verify that the proposed separatrix is a valid trajectory.\n    # This is done by showing that if d(t) = -u(t)^2, it satisfies the first ODE.\n\n    # Left-Hand Side (LHS) of the equation for d': d'(t)\n    # We compute this by taking the derivative of the separatrix equation w.r.t. t\n    # d/dt (separatrix_eq) = d/dt (-u^2) = -2*u * u'(t)\n    lhs = sp.diff(separatrix_eq, t)\n    # Now, substitute the expression for u'(t) from the system\n    lhs = lhs.subs(sp.diff(u, t), u_prime_expr)\n    \n    # Right-Hand Side (RHS) of the equation for d':\n    # We substitute d = -u^2 into the original expression for d'(t).\n    rhs = d_prime_expr.subs(d, separatrix_eq)\n\n    # Step 5: Simplify both sides to check for equality.\n    lhs_simplified = sp.simplify(lhs)\n    rhs_simplified = sp.simplify(rhs)\n\n    print(\"Verification of the separatrix d = -u^2:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"LHS after substitution (d'/dt): {lhs_simplified}\")\n    print(f\"RHS after substitution: {rhs_simplified}\")\n    \n    if sp.simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0:\n        print(\"\\nVerification successful: LHS equals RHS.\")\n        print(\"The curve d = -u^2 is a trajectory of the system and a separatrix.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nVerification failed: LHS does not equal RHS.\")\n\n    # Step 6: Output the final answer.\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\n    # The equation is d = -u^2, which can be written as d + u^2 = 0.\n    final_eq_str = \"d = -1 * u**2\"\n    print(final_eq_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nNumbers in the final equation (d = a*u^b):\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient 'a': {-1}\")\n    print(f\"Power 'b': {2}\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
