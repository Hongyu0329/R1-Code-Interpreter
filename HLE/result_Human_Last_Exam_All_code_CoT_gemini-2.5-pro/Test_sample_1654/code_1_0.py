    Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him.
    ...
    "I'll teach you to let dogs run all over the place! It's time people of that sort were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson! Yeldyrin," cries the Superintendent, addressing the policeman, "find out who the dog belongs to and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad.... Whose dog is it, I ask?"
    "I fancy it's General Zhigalov's," says someone in the crowd.
    "General Zhigalov's? H'm. Take my coat off, Yeldyrin," he says to the policeman. "It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain."
    ...
    The policeman, struggling with his collar, asks: "No one knows, it's a stray."
    "A stray? It's a stray," repeats Otchumyelov. "Then there's no need to waste time. Since he says it's a stray, a stray it is.... It must be destroyed, that's all about it."
    "It is not our dog," Prohor went on. "It's the General's brother's, who came the other day. Our master does not care for hounds. His honour's brother is fond of them."
    "You don't say his Excellency's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanitch?" cries Otchumyelov, and his whole face beams with an ecstatic smile. "Well, I never! And I didn't know! Has he come on a visit?"
    "Yes."
    "Well, I never.... He couldn't stay away from his brother.... And there I didn't know! So this is his honour's dog? Delighted to hear it.... Take it. It's not a bad pup.... A lively pup.... Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha.... Come, why are you shivering? R-r-r-r.... The rascal's angry.... A nice little pup."
    ...
    "He's a delicate dog," says Prohor, "and if you poke a cigar in his mouth, of course he will be cross.... He is a stupid fellow, your honour!"
    "You are a fool, you are!" says the Superintendent angrily, turning on him. "You shut up! If it's a stupid finger, you'd better not put it out. It's your own fault!..."
    "Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin," says Otchumyelov. "I fancy a wind is getting up.... I am chilled."
    ...
    "That's a lie.... I saw him."
    "If you saw him, you know.... then it is so. He is a hunter."
    "And there's no need to say any more about it.... A hunter's dog is a hunter's dog.... Open the kennel and let it out.... Is it your dog?" he asks the man in the yellow waistcoat.
    "It's mine," he answers.
    "What an idea! You'd better let it out, then. Has it been bitten?"
    "I don't know."
    "Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...."
    ...
    "H'm.... Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad.... There's a wind getting up.... I am cold.... You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And say they are not to let it out into the street.... It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigar in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal.... And you, blockhead, put your hand down! It's no use your displaying your fool of a finger. It's your own fault!..."
    "Here comes the General's cook, we'll ask him.... Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog.... Is it one of yours?"
    "What an idea! We have never had one like that."
    "There's no need to waste time in asking," says Otchumyelov. "It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking about it.... If I say it's a stray dog, it is a stray dog.... It must be destroyed, and that's all about it."
    "It is not our dog," Prohor says again. "It belongs to the General's brother, who arrived lately."
    "Is his honour's brother here? Has he come?" asks Otchumyelov, and his face melts into a smile of ecstatic tenderness. "Vladimir Ivanitch, you say? Well, I never! On a visit? And I did not know it!..."
    "Yes."
    "Well, I declare.... And he is fond of a dog.... This is his little dog.... Delighted to hear it.... Take him. It is not a bad little dog.... A smart little dog...."
    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with it. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.
    "I'll make you smart one of these days!" Otchumyelov threatens him, and, wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the market-place.
