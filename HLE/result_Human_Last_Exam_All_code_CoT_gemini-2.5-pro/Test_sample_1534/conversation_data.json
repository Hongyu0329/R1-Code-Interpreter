    "This is a biological question concerning the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish. The answer is based on established knowledge of cephalopod brains. I will provide a Python script that prints the answer as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the location and function of the palliovisceral lobe within the cephalopod brain, which is part of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n2.  Research the anatomical structures that are situated adjacent to and posteriorly to this lobe. In cephalopods, the most posterior part of the brain is the posterior subesophageal mass, which contains several lobes.\n3.  The main lobes in this complex, adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe, are the branchial lobes (which control the gills) and the posterior pedal lobe (which controls the funnel).\n4.  I will create a Python script that stores these names in a list and then prints them in a clear, formatted output to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in cuttlefish, based on cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    # The structures listed are also part of this posterior complex and are\n    # located adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe.\n    \n    adjacent_regions = {\n        \"1\": \"Branchial lobes\",\n        \"2\": \"Posterior pedal lobe\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    \n    # The prompt asks to output each number in a final equation.\n    # Since this is an anatomy question, not a math problem, we will represent this\n    # by listing the numbered components that form the adjacent posterior complex.\n    \n    region_names = list(adjacent_regions.values())\n    \n    # Printing the \"equation\" as a formatted list\n    print(f\"Region {list(adjacent_regions.keys())[0]} ({region_names[0]}) + Region {list(adjacent_regions.keys())[1]} ({region_names[1]})\")\n\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The primary brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the branchial lobes and the posterior pedal lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
