def solve_poem_meaning():
    """
    This function analyzes a poem snippet to find the meaning of a specific phrase.
    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  The poem describes preserved moths in a frame, now reduced to "eyes and dust".
    2.  The phrase "that strange tarnished logic of their discipline" explains their condition.
    3.  "Discipline" refers to a systematic practice, most likely the scientific discipline of collecting and preserving specimens (like entomology).
    4.  The "logic" of this discipline is to preserve a creature for study.
    5.  This logic is "tarnished" (flawed, decayed) because the act of preservation kills the living thing and, as the poem notes, the specimen itself eventually degrades into "dust". The process is imperfect.
    6.  This paradox—destroying life and creating a decaying artifact in order to study it—is "strange".
    7.  Based on this, the phrase means that the scientific method of preserving specimens is inherently flawed because it leads to the degradation of the very thing it seeks to preserve.

    analysis = """
The phrase 'strange tarnished logic of their discipline' refers to the paradox of scientific specimen collection.

- 'Discipline' points to the scientific practice of collecting and preserving insects (entomology).
- The 'logic' of this discipline is to preserve a creature perfectly for study.
- This logic is 'tarnished' because the process is flawed: it requires killing the moth, and over time, the preserved specimen itself degrades into 'dust', as the poem mentions.
- The result is 'strange': an imperfect, decaying artifact is created in the pursuit of preserving a life form.

Therefore, the phrase means that scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation.
