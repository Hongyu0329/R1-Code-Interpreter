    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark when viewed as a matrix. The prompt specifies that we should assume the values in the matrix are chosen to make the rank maximal.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret \"Maximal Rank\" of a Flag**: A flag is a composition of colored regions. We can represent it as a matrix by assigning a numerical value or vector to each color. To achieve the *maximal* rank, we can assign a unique, linearly independent basis vector to each distinct color in the flag. Under this assignment, the rank of the flag's matrix becomes equal to the number of distinct colors it contains.\n2.  **Calculate the Rank of Denmark's Flag**: The flag of Denmark consists of two colors: red and white. Therefore, its maximal rank is 2.\n3.  **Identify African Flags with the Same Rank**: The task is now reduced to finding all African nations whose flags are composed of exactly two colors.\n4.  **Create a Script**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores a dataset of African countries and the colors of their flags.\n    *   Sets the target rank to 2 (the rank of Denmark's flag).\n    *   Iterates through the dataset to find countries whose flags have exactly two colors.\n    *   Prints the names of the matching countries, showing that their rank is equal to Denmark's.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_flag_rank_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies African nations whose flags have the same\n    maximal linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The maximal rank of a flag is equivalent to the number of distinct\n    colors it contains. The flag of Denmark has 2 colors (red and white),\n    so its rank is 2.\n\n    The script finds all African flags that also have exactly 2 colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary mapping African countries to a list of their flag colors.\n    # Note: Variations in shades (e.g., light blue vs. blue) are treated as distinct.\n    african_flags_colors = {\n        \"Algeria\": [\"Green\", \"White\", \"Red\"],\n        \"Angola\": [\"Red\", \"Black\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Benin\": [\"Green\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\"],\n        \"Botswana\": [\"Light Blue\", \"Black\", \"White\"],\n        \"Burkina Faso\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Burundi\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"White\"],\n        \"Cabo Verde\": [\"Blue\", \"White\", \"Red\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Cameroon\": [\"Green\", \"Red\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Central African Republic\": [\"Blue\", \"White\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\"],\n        \"Chad\": [\"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\"],\n        \"Comoros\": [\"Yellow\", \"White\", \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"],\n        \"Congo, Dem.
