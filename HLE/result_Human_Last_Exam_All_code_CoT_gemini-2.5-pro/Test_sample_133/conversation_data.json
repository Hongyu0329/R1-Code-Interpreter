    "An optimal move is one that guarantees a win as quickly as possible. In Connect 4, the fastest way to win is to create a situation where you have two different ways to get four-in-a-row on your next turn, and your opponent can only block one. This is often called a \"fork\" or a \"double threat\".\n\nHere is my plan to find the optimal move(s):\n1.  **Analyze the Board:** First, I will represent the current game state in a 2D grid that my code can understand.\n2.  **Identify All Possible Moves:** I will determine all the columns where 'O' can legally play a piece.\n3.  **Simulate Each Move:** For each possible move, I will create a temporary board state assuming 'O' makes that move.\n4.  **Look for Winning Threats:** On this new temporary board, I will check if 'O' has created multiple winning threats. A \"threat\" is a line of three of your pieces with an open space to complete the line of four. If a single move creates two or more of these threats that are immediately playable, the opponent can only block one, guaranteeing a win for 'O' on the next turn.\n5.  **Filter for Optimal Moves:** Any move that creates such an unblockable, game-winning setup is an optimal move. I will collect all such moves.\n6.  **Format the Output:** Finally, I will format the identified move(s) using the requested coordinate system (e.g., f4).\n\nBased on this plan, I will now generate the Python code to perform the analysis and find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nclass Connect4Solver:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class to solve a given Connect 4 board state.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, board_state, player='O'):\n        self.rows = 6\n        self.cols = 7\n        self.board = board_state\n        self.player = player\n        self.opponent = 'X' if player == 'O' else 'O'\n\n    def get_next_open_row(self, board, col):\n        \"\"\"Finds the next empty row in a given column.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(self.rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            if board[r][col] == '.':\n                return r\n        return None\n\n    def get_valid_moves(self, board):\n        \"\"\"Gets a list of columns that are not full.\"\"\"\n        return [c for c in range(self.cols) if self.get_next_open_row(board, c) is not None]\n\n    def check_win(self, board, player):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the specified player has won the game.\"\"\"\n        # Check horizontal locations for win\n        for c in range(self.cols - 3):\n            for r in range(self.rows):\n                if all(board[r][c + i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n\n        # Check vertical locations for win\n        for c in range(self.cols):\n            for r in range(self.rows - 3):\n                if all(board[r + i][c] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n\n        # Check positively sloped diagonals\n        for c in range(self.cols - 3):\n            for r in range(self.rows - 3):\n                if all(board[r + i][c + i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n\n        # Check negatively sloped diagonals\n        for c in range(self.cols - 3):\n            for r in range(3, self.rows):\n                if all(board[r - i][c + i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def find_fastest_win(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Finds moves that guarantee a win on the next turn.\n        A move is optimal if it creates two or more immediate winning threats\n        that the opponent cannot block in a single move.\n        \"\"\"\n        optimal_moves = []\n        \n        # 1.
