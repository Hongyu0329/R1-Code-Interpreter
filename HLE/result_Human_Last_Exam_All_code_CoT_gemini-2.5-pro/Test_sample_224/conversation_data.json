    "My plan is to find the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17.\n\n1.  **Represent the Number**: A nine-digit palindrome in base 17 has the form `(d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8)_17`. The digits `d_i` are integers from 0 to 16. Since it's a nine-digit number, `d8` must be non-zero (1-16). The value in base 10 is `N = d8*17^8 + d7*17^7 + ... + d8*17^0`.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy**: To find the largest such prime, I will start my search from the largest possible palindrome and work downwards. This means starting with the largest possible values for the digits `d8, d7, d6, d5, d4` and decrementing them in nested loops. The first prime number found will be the largest.\n    - `d8` will loop from 16 down to 1.\n    - `d7, d6, d5, d4` will loop from 16 down to 0.\n\n3.  **Primality Testing**: The numbers involved are large (up to ~10¹³), so a standard trial division is too slow. I will use the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a fast and reliable probabilistic test. For numbers of this size, it can be made deterministic by using a specific set of bases.\n\n4.  **Optimizations**: I can significantly speed up the search by eliminating non-prime candidates early.\n    - **Parity Check**: For `N` to be a prime other than 2, it must be odd. In an odd base like 17, the parity of `N` is the same as the parity of the sum of its digits. The sum is `2*(d8+d7+d6+d5) + d4`. For this sum to be odd, the center digit `d4` must be odd. This cuts the search space for `d4` in half.\n    - **Divisibility Checks**: I will add quick checks for divisibility by 3 and 5 using modular arithmetic on the digits, avoiding the expensive calculation of `N` for many composite numbers.\n        - For divisibility by 3: `N mod 3 = (2*d8 - 2*d7 + 2*d6 - 2*d5 + d4) mod 3`\n        - For divisibility by 5: `N mod 5 = (2*d8 + 3*d6 + d4) mod 5`\n\n5.  **Final Output**: Once the prime number is found, the script will print the base-10 conversion equation as requested, showing how the digits in base 17 form the final number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Miller-Rabin primality test.
