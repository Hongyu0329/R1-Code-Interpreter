    "This is a classic and challenging problem in mathematics known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The goal is to find the smallest possible radius `R` of a large circle that can contain a given number `n` of smaller circles with radius `r`.\n\nFor `n=14` circles, the optimal arrangement is not a simple, intuitive pattern like concentric rings. The solution was mathematically proven to be optimal by F. Fodor in 2003. The arrangement is complex, but the resulting radius is a surprisingly elegant number.\n\nThe proven relationship between the radius of the large circle (`R`) and the radius of the small circles (`r`) for `n=14` is:\n\n`R/r = sqrt(13)`\n\nSince the problem states that the radius of the small circles is one (`r=1`), the radius of the large circle is simply:\n\n`R = sqrt(13)`\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that calculates the value of `sqrt(13)` and formats the result to 4 significant digits as requested. The code will also explicitly state the formula used, showing the number involved in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the radius of a large circle that tightly packs 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n# This is a well-known problem in geometry. The proven optimal radius, R, for 14 circles\n# of radius 1 is given by the exact formula R = sqrt(13).\n\n# Define the number inside the square root from the formula.\nnumber = 13\n\n# Calculate the radius using the formula.\nradius = math.sqrt(number)\n\n# The final equation is R = sqrt(13). We print the number in this equation.\nprint(f\"The final equation for the radius R is: R = sqrt({number})\")\n\n# Print the final answer, formatted to 4 significant digits.\n# The format specifier \"{value:.4g}\" formats the number to 4 significant figures.\nprint(f\"The radius of the circle is {radius:.4g}\")\n\n```\n<<<3.606>>>"
