    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which the expression $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the polynomial:** Let $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We are looking for integers $x$ such that $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y$.\n\n2.  **Determine the search range for x:** A number can only be a perfect square if it is non-negative. Therefore, we must have $P(x) \\ge 0$.\n    $P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, so for very large positive $x$, $P(x)$ is positive, and for very large negative $x$, $P(x)$ is negative.\n    To find where $P(x) \\ge 0$, we need to find its roots. By testing some integer values, we can estimate the location of the roots:\n    *   $P(17) = 121$ and $P(16) = -96$, so there is a root between 16 and 17.\n    *   $P(7) = 111$ and $P(8) = -32$, so there is a root between 7 and 8.\n    *   $P(-8) = 96$ and $P(-9) = -321$, so there is a root between -9 and -8.\n\n    This means $P(x) \\ge 0$ for integers in the approximate ranges $[-8, 7]$ and $[17, \\infty)$.\n\n3.  **Perform the search:** I will write a Python script to search for integer solutions within these ranges.\n    *   The first range is small and can be checked completely: from -8 to 7.\n    *   The second range $[17, \\infty)$ is infinite. However, integer solutions to such equations are often \"small\". I will search up to a large but practical limit (e.g., $x=100000$) to find any potential solutions. If no solutions are found for a large portion of this range, it is highly likely that there are no more solutions.\n\n4.  **Code implementation:** The script will iterate through the determined ranges of $x$, calculate $P(x)$, and check if the result is a perfect square. An efficient way to check if a number `n` is a perfect square is to see if `math.isqrt(n) ** 2 == n`.\n\n5.  **Output the results:** For each integer solution found, the script will print the value of $x$ and the equation showing that $P(x)$ is a perfect square. Finally, it will print the total count of such integers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the search:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False, -1\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n, sqrt_n\n\ndef solve_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    \n    # First search range: from -8 to 7\n    for x in range(-8, 8):\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        is_sq, y = is_perfect_square(val)\n        if is_sq:\n            solutions.append((x, val, y))\n            \n    # Second search range: from 17 up to a reasonable limit, e.g., 100000\n    # Based on number theory, it's expected that solutions are small.\n    # A larger range can be used for a more thorough search.\n    for x in range(17, 100001):\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        is_sq, y = is_perfect_square(val)\n        if is_sq:\n            solutions.append((x, val, y))\n\n    print(\"Found the following integer solutions:\")\n    for x, val, y in solutions:\n        print(f\"For x = {x}:\")\n        print(f\"{x}^3 - 16*({x})^2 - 72*({x}) + 1056 = {val} = {y}^2\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of integers x for which the quantity is a perfect square is {len(solutions)}.\")\n\nsolve_equation()\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
