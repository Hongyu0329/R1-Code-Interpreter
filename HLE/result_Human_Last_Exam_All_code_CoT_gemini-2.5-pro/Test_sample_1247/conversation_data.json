    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which represents the number of permutations of length 333 that are 1324-avoiding and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the constraints**: The permutation length `n=333` is very large, making it impossible to generate and check all permutations. However, the number of inversions `k=3` is very small.\n2.  **Structural Property of Permutations with Few Inversions**: A permutation with a small number of inversions is very close to the identity permutation `(1, 2, 3, ..., n)`. The inversions are caused by a few elements being out of their \"natural\" sorted order. These are called non-fixed points.\n3.  **1324-avoiding condition**: A permutation \\(\\pi\\) is 1324-avoiding if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\). For a permutation that is mostly sorted, this pattern is often formed when the out-of-order elements are \"in the middle\" of the permutation. For example, the permutation \\((1, 3, 2, 4)\\) has one inversion and contains a 1324-pattern (with values 1,3,2,4 and indices 1,2,3,4).\n4.  **Hypothesis**: For a permutation with a very small number of inversions to be 1324-avoiding, its non-fixed points must be located at the very beginning or very end of the permutation. Any non-fixed points located \"in the middle\" will have sorted elements both before and after them, which provides the necessary elements to form a 1324-pattern.\n5.  **Stability of the Count**: This structural requirement implies that for a fixed small `k`, the number of such permutations, \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), does not change with `n` once `n` is large enough (i.e., it becomes stable). For `k=3`, the number of non-fixed points is small (at most 4). The value of \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) stabilizes for \\(n \\ge 5\\).\n6.  **Computational Strategy**: We can therefore calculate the value for a small `n` (like `n=6`, which is safely in the stable region) and this result will be the answer for `n=333`.\n7.  **Implementation**: We will write a Python script that:\n    *   Generates all permutations for a small `n` (e.g., `n=6`).\n    *   Counts the inversions for each permutation.\n    *   Checks the 1324-avoiding property for those with exactly `k=3` inversions.\n    *   Counts how many such permutations exist.\n    *   Prints the final result in the requested format.\n\nThis approach uses a key insight into the structure of these specific permutations to make an otherwise intractable problem solvable.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv_count = 0\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef is_1324_avoiding(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation is 1324-avoiding.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    if n < 4:\n        return True\n    # Find quadruplets (i, j, k, l) with i < j < k < l\n    for i in range(n - 3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n - 2):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n - 1):\n                # Early exit if the first part of the pattern isn't met\n                if not (p[i] < p[k]):\n                    continue\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    # Check for the 1324 pattern\n                    if p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l]:\n                        return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_av_nk_bruteforce(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(1324) by brute-force checking all permutations.\n    This is only feasible for small n.\n    \"\"\"\n    avoiding_perms_count = 0\n    # Generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to n\n    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):\n        if count_inversions(p) == k:\n            if is_1324_avoiding(p):\n                avoiding_perms_count += 1\n    return avoiding_perms_count\n\n# The problem asks for av_n^k(1324) where n=333 and k=3.\nn_target = 333\nk_target = 3\n\n# For a small k, the value of av_n^k(1324) is constant for all n greater than\n# some small integer.
