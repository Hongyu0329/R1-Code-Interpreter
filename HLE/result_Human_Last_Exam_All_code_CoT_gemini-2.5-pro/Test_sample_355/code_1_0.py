# Step 1: Define physical and observational constants.
# The problem specifies a star of magnitude 20. We assume this is the apparent magnitude.
m_star = 20.0
# The desired accuracy (error) in the magnitude measurement.
delta_m = 0.01
# The diameter of the telescope in meters.
D_tel = 1.0
# A standard reference value for the photon flux of a magnitude 0 star in the B-band.
# This value is approximately 1.33e10 photons/s/m^2.
F0_B = 1.33e10  # units: photons/s/m^2

# Step 2: Calculate the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) from the magnitude error.
# The relationship is delta_m â‰ˆ 1.0857 / S/N.
snr = 1.0857 / delta_m

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of photons (N) needed for this S/N.
# For photon-counting statistics, S/N = sqrt(N). Thus, N = (S/N)^2.
N_photons_total = snr**2

# Step 4: Calculate the photon flux from the target star.
# The flux F_star is related to the reference flux F0_B by: F_star = F0_B * 10^(-0.4 * m_star).
F_star = F0_B * 10**(-0.4 * m_star)

# Step 5: Calculate the telescope's photon collection rate (R).
# First, find the telescope's collecting area: A = pi * (D/2)^2.
A_tel = math.pi * (D_tel / 2)**2
# The rate is the star's flux multiplied by the telescope's area.
# We assume 100% efficiency as none is specified.
R_photons_per_sec = F_star * A_tel

# Step 6: Calculate the required exposure time (t).
# The time is the total number of photons needed divided by the collection rate.
exposure_time_s = N_photons_total / R_photons_per_sec

# Step 7: Print the results, including the final equation with numbers.
