    # Step 1 & 2: Define Rawlsian reciprocity and its connection to the duty of fair play.
    # Rawls' reciprocity is a moral concept where citizens cooperate on fair terms.
    # This creates a "duty of fair play," but this duty is conditional on the justice of the social system.
    # If the system's institutions are just, citizens are obligated to uphold them.
    conditional_obligation = True

    # Step 3: Analyze the context of poverty.
    # The existence of significant poverty suggests the system may be unjust, failing to meet
    # Rawls' "difference principle" (inequalities must benefit the least advantaged).
    system_is_unjust_for_poor = True

    # Step 4: Evaluate the options based on the conclusion that obligation is conditional and the system may be unjust.
    # A. "irrelevant" - Incorrect. The concept is highly relevant for judging the system's fairness.
    # B. "None of the above" - Unlikely if a better option exists.
    # C. "Civic obligations bind those in fair systems, which is not true of poorer citizens..." - This aligns perfectly.
    #    It captures the conditional nature of the obligation. If the system is unfair to the poor, the obligation does not bind them.
    # D. "...not a product of their own agency" - This shifts focus to a determinism debate, which is not the core of Rawls' argument about justification.
    # E. "...difference in resources and class do not change moral duty..." - This is directly contrary to Rawls' theory.

    # Step 5: Select the best fit.
