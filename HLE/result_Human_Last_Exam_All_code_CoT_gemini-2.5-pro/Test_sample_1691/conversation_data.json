    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to derive the analytical formula for the integral.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. For the small $\\epsilon$ regime, the term $\\epsilon$ in the denominator is small. The denominator becomes close to zero only if the polynomial part, let's call it $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$, is also close to zero. This happens for $x$ near 0. This means the dominant contribution to the integral comes from a small interval (a \"boundary layer\") around $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integral:** Inside this boundary layer, where $x$ is small, the polynomial $f(x)$ can be approximated by its leading term, which is $9x^5$. The higher-order terms are negligible in this region. So, the integral can be approximated by:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the integration limits:** Since the primary contribution comes from very small $x$, where $\\epsilon$ and $9x^5$ are comparable, the value of the integral is not sensitive to the upper limit of 15. We can extend the upper limit to infinity without affecting the leading-order result, which simplifies the calculation:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n4.  **Rescale the integral:** To evaluate this integral, we can perform a change of variables to factor out the $\\epsilon$ dependency. Let's set $9x^5 = \\epsilon y^5$. This gives $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} y$, and the differential becomes $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} dy$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon y^5} = \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon^{4/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the constant part:** The expression now consists of a part dependent on $\\epsilon$ and a constant definite integral. This integral is a known result from the theory of special functions (related to the Beta function) and can be evaluated as:\n    $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^p} dy = \\frac{\\pi/p}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n    For our case, $p=5$, so the integral is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Construct the final formula:** By combining all the parts, we obtain the final analytical formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime. The following Python code will calculate the numerical values for the coefficient and the exponent in this formula and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the analytical approximation for the integral\n    I(eps) = integral_0^15 dx / (eps + 9*x^5 + 5*x^6 + 9*x^8)\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # From the problem, the dominant term in the polynomial for small x is 9*x^5.\n    # So, we have f(x) ~= c * x^p\n    p = 5.0\n    c = 9.0\n\n    # The approximation for the integral is of the form I(eps) ~= C * eps^k.\n\n    # 1.
