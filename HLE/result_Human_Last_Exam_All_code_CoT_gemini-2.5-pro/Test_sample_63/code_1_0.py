# The person Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine is the philosopher Bertrand Russell.
# The puzzle requires a two-word name for this person where both words start with the same letter.
# A fitting epithet for the philosopher and activist is "Radical Russell".

# The two words of the final name are:
word1 = "Radical"
word2 = "Russell"

# Print the final name
print(f"{word1} {word2}")
