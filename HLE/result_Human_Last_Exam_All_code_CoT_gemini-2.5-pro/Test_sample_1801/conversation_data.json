    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the core question, which is to name the two Nobel laureates in a specific Enron commercial from the year 2000.\n2.  Since this is a trivia question requiring factual knowledge, I cannot compute the answer. Instead, I will retrieve the information from my knowledge base.\n3.  I will then create a Python script that stores the names of the two individuals in variables.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a formatted string that clearly states the names of the two Nobel laureates as the answer to your question.\n\n```python\n# The two individuals in question were prominent economists.\n# One had already won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and the other would win it later.\nlaureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"  # Nobel laureate in 2008\nlaureate2 = \"Merton Miller\" # Nobel laureate in 1990\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline 'Ask Why' were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
