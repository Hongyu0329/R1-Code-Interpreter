    # Step 1: Determine the effect of (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal on ALDH
    # This compound is an electrophile that activates the Nrf2 pathway.
    # Nrf2 activation upregulates antioxidant genes, including Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH).
    aldh_change = "increase"

    # Step 2: Identify the key protein in this pathway
    # The Nrf2 pathway is regulated by the sensor protein Keap1, which binds Nrf2.
    # Electrophiles react with Keap1, causing it to release Nrf2.
    protein_involved = "Keap1"

    # Step 3: Compare the effect of 4-OI
    # 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) is known as a very potent Nrf2 activator.
    # At the same concentration, it is expected to have a stronger effect than the HNE analog.
