    This function analyzes the properties of the given function f(x)
    to determine the Lebesgue measure of the set S.

    The set S consists of points x0 for which the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n)
    has exactly 7 distinct values. This requires the orbit of x0 to be finite.

    For a smooth function like f(x), the set of points with finite orbits
    can only have a positive measure if the function exhibits specific degeneracies,
    for example, if f^p(x) = x for all x in some interval, for some integer p.

    If f^p(x) = x on an interval, its derivative (f^p)'(x) must be 1 on that interval.
    Since f is an analytic function, this would imply (f^p)'(x) is the constant function 1.
    We can check this is not the case for f.

    # This confirms that f^p(x)=x does not hold on any interval.

    # Based on the theory of dynamical systems, since there are no stable fixed points
    # but there is a stable 2-cycle, almost every point in [0,1] will have an
    # orbit that converges to this 2-cycle, resulting in an infinite number of
    # distinct values.
    # The set of points with finite orbits (periodic points and their preimages)
    # is a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
