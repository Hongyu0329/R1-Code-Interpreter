def solve_maze_path():
    """
    This function determines the least dangerous path from the adventurer '@' to the gold 'g'.

    Path Reasoning:
    1. The adventurer (@) starts in the right-hand room. The gold (g) is in the top-left room.
    2. The primary danger is the Dragon (D) in the lower-right.
    3. To find the least dangerous path, we must avoid the Dragon. The starting room has two exits (+):
       - A safe exit on row 4, far from the Dragon.
       - A dangerous exit on row 10, near the Dragon.
    4. The optimal path uses the safe exit.
    5. Move Down (D) from the starting position to the safe exit.
    6. Move Left (L) through the exit into the main hallway.
    7. Move Up (U) to align with the row containing the gold.
    8. Move Left (L) again to cross the hallway and reach the gold.

    The resulting path is DLUL.
