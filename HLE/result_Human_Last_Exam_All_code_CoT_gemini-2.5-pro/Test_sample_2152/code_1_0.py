# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem.
# We don't need the exact values of e, h_bar, c, etc., as they will cancel out.
# Let's use ratios.
# Monopole charge in terms of electron charge e.
# We assume e_m = e*c/16 to make the final ratio dimensionless.
em_over_e_sq = (1.0 / 16.0)**2 # (e_m/e)^2

# Magnetic dipole moment in terms of Bohr magneton mu_B.
mu_over_muB = 25.0
# mu_B = e * h_bar / (2 * m_e)
# mu = 25 * e * h_bar / (2 * m_e)
# mu^2 = 625 * e^2 * h_bar^2 / (4 * m_e^2)

# Particle speed in terms of speed of light c.
v_over_c = 1.0 / 100.0

# Scattering angle in radians.
theta = np.pi / 30.0

# Step 2: Write down the ratio of the cross-sections.
# From the derivation in the plan, the ratio is:
# Ratio = (3 * h_bar**2 * em**2) / (mu**2 * q**2)
# where q = 2 * p * sin(theta/2) = 2 * m * v * sin(theta/2)
# We assume the scattered particle is an electron, so m = m_e.
#
# Let's substitute the expressions for e_m, mu, and q:
# Ratio = (3 * h_bar**2 * (e*c/16)**2) / ( (25*e*h_bar/(2*m_e))**2 * (2*m_e*v*sin(theta/2))**2 )
# Ratio = (3 * h_bar**2 * e**2 * c**2 / 256) / ( (625 * e**2 * h_bar**2 / (4*m_e**2)) * 4 * m_e**2 * v**2 * sin(theta/2)**2 )
# After cancelling e, h_bar, m_e:
# Ratio = (3 * c**2 / 256) / (625 * v**2 * sin(theta/2)**2)
# Substitute v = c/100 => v**2 = c**2/10000
# Ratio = (3 * c**2 / 256) / (625 * (c**2/10000) * sin(theta/2)**2)
# Ratio = (3 / 256) / (625 / 10000 * sin(theta/2)**2)
# Ratio = (3 / 256) * (10000 / (625 * sin(theta/2)**2))
# Ratio = 30000 / (256 * 625 * sin(theta/2)**2)
# 256 * 625 = 160000
# Ratio = 30000 / (160000 * sin(theta/2)**2)
# Ratio = 3 / (16 * sin(theta/2)**2)

# Step 3: Calculate the final value.
sin_val_sq = np.sin(theta / 2.0)**2
ratio = 3.0 / (16.0 * sin_val_sq)
