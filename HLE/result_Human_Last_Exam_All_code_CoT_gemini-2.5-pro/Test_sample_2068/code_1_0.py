Bj = 10**20

# The solvability condition for the nonlinear boundary value problem imposes a constraint
# on the initial values (x_j^0, y_j^0) of the unperturbed system.
# Based on our analysis, this constraint for each j from 1 to n is:
# (x_j^0/A_j)^2 + (y_j^0/B_j)^2 = K
# where K = 1 / (n - 1)
# This equation describes an ellipse for each pair (x_j^0, y_j^0).

# The area of the region bounded by one such ellipse is Area_j = pi * A_j * B_j * K
# The total area S is the sum of these areas for j from 1 to n.
# S = n * pi * A_j * B_j * K = n * pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1)

# We need to find the value of S / (2025 * pi).
# Since n = 2025, this is S / (n * pi).
# Value = (n * pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1)) / (n * pi)
# Value = A_j * B_j / (n - 1)

# Calculate the final value
final_value = (Aj * Bj) / (n - 1)

# Output the numbers used in the final equation and the result
