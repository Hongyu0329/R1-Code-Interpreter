# The derived analytical expression for T is T = 0.5 * (10^a - 10^b).
# This script calculates the exponents a and b based on the given parameters.

# Given parameters in exponential form:
# alpha = 10^10000
alpha_exp = 10000
# x0 = 10^-5000000
x0_exp = -5000000

# According to the derivation, the exponents in the final expression for T are:
# a = alpha_exp - x0_exp
# b = alpha_exp
a = alpha_exp - x0_exp
b = alpha_exp

# The instruction is to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is T = 0.5 * (10^a - 10^b)
# The numbers composing this equation are 0.5, 10, a, 10, and b.
