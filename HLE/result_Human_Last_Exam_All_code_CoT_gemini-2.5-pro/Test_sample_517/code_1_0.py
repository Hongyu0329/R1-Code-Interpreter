    Calculates the limit of the probability p_n for the given random walk problem.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. Model the asymptotic behavior of the conditioned random walk. The walk has a radial drift,
       and its angular position becomes uniformly distributed on [0, 2*pi] at large distances.
    2. Define the target region: a disk of radius n^(1/3) around the point (n,0).
    3. Calculate the angular width of this target as seen from the origin.
    4. The probability p_n is the ratio of the target's angular width to the total angle 2*pi.
    5. Compute the limit of p_n as n approaches infinity.
