    "This is a classic riddle based on a linguistic pun that works in Russian. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the key location:** The riddle mentions the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse (Ring-Road or Ring-Boulevard).\n2.  **Consider the Russian context:** The riddle specifies a \"Russian translation.\" The key part of \"Ringstrasse\" is \"Ring.\"\n3.  **Find the pun:** The word \"Ring\" sounds very similar to the surname of a famous English poet when transliterated or spoken among Russians.\n4.  **Identify the poet:** The surname is \"Browning\" (Robert Browning or Elizabeth Barrett Browning), which is transliterated into Russian as \"Браунинг\". The pun connects \"the Ring\" (boulevard) to \"Browning\" (the poet).\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that outlines this logic and prints the final surname.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by explaining the linguistic pun.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the key location in Vienna mentioned in the riddle.\n    location = \"The Ringstrasse (Ring-Boulevard)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the keyword that forms the basis of the pun in a Russian context.\n    pun_keyword = \"The Ring\"\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the English poet's surname that sounds similar to the keyword.\n    poet_surname = \"Browning\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the logical \"equation\" to explain the solution.\n    # The riddle is solved by connecting the place to the name via a pun.\n    print(f\"Vienna's Boulevard -> {location}\")\n    print(f\"Keyword from the location's name -> '{pun_keyword}'\")\n    print(f\"'{pun_keyword}' sounds like the English poet's surname -> '{poet_surname}'\")\n\n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"\\nThe surname of the English poet is:\")\n    print(poet_surname)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Browning>>>"
