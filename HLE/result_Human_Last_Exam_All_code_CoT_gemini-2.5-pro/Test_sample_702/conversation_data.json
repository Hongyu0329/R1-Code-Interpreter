    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we need to analyze the induced maps on homotopy groups, $\\pi_k(f): \\pi_k(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$.\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is said to be $n$-connected if the induced map $\\pi_k(f): \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and a surjection (an epimorphism) for $k=n$. The connectivity of the map is the largest such integer $n$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the source and target spaces.**\n    *   Source: $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    *   Target: $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$\n\n2.  **Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces.**\n    *   A space $X$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(X)=0$ for all $i \\le k$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected. $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected. $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product of a $k_1$-connected space and a $k_2$-connected space is $(k_1+k_2+1)$-connected. So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The suspension $\\Sigma X$ of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected. Thus, the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n    *   The target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n    *   Since both spaces are 8-connected, the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\n3.  **Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups ($k=9$).**\n    *   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this is isomorphic to $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $\\pi_9(f): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is known to be an isomorphism for the standard map of this type. So the connectivity is at least 9.\n\n4.  **Analyze the map for $k=10$.**\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This is a non-trivial result of homotopy theory, which states that this group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The map $\\pi_{10}(f): \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is an isomorphism. So the connectivity is at least 10.\n\n5.  **Analyze the map for $k=11$.**\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(A) = \\pi_{11}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this group is isomorphic to $H_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(B) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{12}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The map $\\pi_{11}(f): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a surjection (the standard projection). It is not an isomorphism.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism for $k < 11$ and a surjection for $k=11$. Therefore, the connectivity of the map is 11.\n\n```python\n# Sphere dimensions\np = 4\nq = 6\n\n# The connectivity of the source space A = Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q)\n# Connectivity of Omega S^p is p-2\n# Connectivity of Omega S^q is q-2\nconn_omega_p = p - 2\nconn_omega_q = q - 2\n\n# Connectivity of the smash product is conn1 + conn2 + 1\nconn_smash = conn_omega_p + conn_omega_q + 1\n\n# Connectivity of the suspension is conn + 1\nconn_source = conn_smash + 1\n\nprint(f\"The dimension of the first sphere is p = {p}\")\nprint(f\"The dimension of the second sphere is q = {q}\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity of the source space A = Sigma(Omega S^{p} wedge Omega S^{q}) is {conn_source}\")\n\n# The connectivity of the target space B = Omega(S^p wedge S^q) = Omega(S^{p+q})\n# Connectivity of Omega S^n is n-2\nconn_target = p + q - 2\nprint(f\"Connectivity of the target space B = Omega(S^{p+q}) is {conn_target}\")\n\n# The map is an isomorphism on pi_9 and pi_10\n# pi_9(A) = Z, pi_9(B) = Z\n# pi_10(A) = Z_2, pi_10(B) = Z_2\n# The map is a surjection on pi_11\n# pi_11(A) = Z, pi_11(B) = Z_2\n\n# The connectivity is defined as the largest n for which pi_k is an isomorphism for k < n\n# and pi_n is a surjection.\nconnectivity = 11\n\nprint(f\"The map is an isomorphism on homotopy groups for k < {connectivity}.\")\nprint(f\"The map is a surjection on the homotopy group for k = {connectivity}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"
