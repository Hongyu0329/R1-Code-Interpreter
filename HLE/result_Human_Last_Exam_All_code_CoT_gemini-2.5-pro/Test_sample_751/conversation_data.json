    "To find the observer canonical form of the given system using duality, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Duality Principle**: The transformation to the observer canonical form for a system `(A, C)` is directly related to the transformation to the controllable canonical form for its dual system, `(A^T, C^T)`. The new output matrix, `C_o`, is the transpose of the new input matrix, `B_c`, of the dual system's controllable canonical form.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Transformation**: The new matrix `C_o` can be found using the formula `C_o = C * T^{-1}`, where `T` is the transformation matrix that converts the original system to the observer canonical form. This formula is derived from the duality principle.\n\n3.  **Construct the Transformation Matrix (T)**: The matrix `T` is constructed from `n` linearly independent rows taken from the system's observability matrix `Q_o`. The observability matrix is formed by stacking `C`, `CA`, `CA^2`, and so on. For our 3-dimensional system, we need to find 3 linearly independent rows. We will select them in the standard order (`c1`, `c2`, `c1*A`, `c2*A`, ...) where `c1` and `c2` are the rows of `C`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the New C Matrix**: Once `T` is constructed, we will calculate its inverse, `T^{-1}`, and then compute the new output matrix `C_o = C * T^{-1}`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n              [2, 1, 1],\n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\nn = A.shape[0]\nprint(f\"Original A matrix:\\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Original C matrix:\\n{C}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Construct the transformation matrix T\n# We need to find n=3 linearly independent rows from C, CA, ...\n# Let c1 and c2 be the rows of C\nc1 = C[0, :]\nc2 = C[1, :]\n\n# Calculate rows of CA\nc1A = c1 @ A\nc2A = c2 @ A\n\n# Select n=3 linearly independent rows to form the transformation matrix T.\n# The standard procedure checks for linear independence in the order c1, c2, c1A, c2A...\n# 1. c1 = [0, 1, 0] is independent.\n# 2. c2 = [1, 1, 0] is linearly independent from c1.\n# 3. c1A = [2, 1, 1] is linearly independent from c1 and c2.\n# We have found 3 linearly independent rows.\n# The convention is to group rows related to the same output together in T.\n# Since we used c1 and c1A (related to the first output) and c2 (related to the second),\n# the observability indices are mu_1 = 2, mu_2 = 1.\n# We form T by stacking these rows:\nT = np.vstack([c1, c1A, c2])\n\nprint(f\"Transformation matrix T:\\n{T}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the inverse of T\ntry:\n    T_inv = np.linalg.inv(T)\n    print(f\"Inverse of T (T_inv):\\n{T_inv}\\n\")\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"Matrix T is singular, cannot compute inverse.\")\n    exit()\n\n# Step 4: Compute the new output matrix C_o for the observer canonical form\n# C_o = C * T_inv\nC_o = C @ T_inv\n\n# Clean up the result to show integer values, as they are exact in this case\nC_o_clean = np.round(C_o).astype(int)\n\nprint(\"The new matrix C in observer canonical form (C_o) is:\")\n# Print the final matrix element by element as requested\nprint(\"[\", end=\"\")\nfor i, row in enumerate(C_o_clean):\n    if i > 0:\n        print(\" \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"[\", end=\"\")\n    for j, val in enumerate(row):\n        print(f\"{val}\", end=\"\")\n        if j < len(row) - 1:\n            print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"]\", end=\"\")\n    if i < len(C_o_clean) - 1:\n        print(\",\\n\", end=\"\")\nprint(\"]\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = C_o_clean.tolist()\n# <<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>\n```\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
