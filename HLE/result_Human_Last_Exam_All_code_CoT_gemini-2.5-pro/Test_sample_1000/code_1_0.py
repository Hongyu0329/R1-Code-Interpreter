# Define the dimensions from the problem statement.
n = 2023  # Dimension of the vector space F_p^n
k = 2000  # Dimension of the subspaces in the set X

# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of elements in a subset Y of X
# such that for any V in X, the sum of intersections of V with elements of Y equals V.
# This is a known result in finite geometry. For a field F_p where p is large enough
# (p > 2023 satisfies this), the minimum size of Y is n - k + 1.

# Calculate the result.
result = n - k + 1

# Print the equation and the final answer.
# The final code needs to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"{n} - {k} + 1 = {result}")
