    "Based on my research into drug identification databases, I will identify the numerical imprints for each capsule and then write a Python script to display them.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Find the specific numerical imprint for the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule. This is `3107`.\n2.  Find the specific numerical imprint for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule. This is `3105`.\n3.  Create a Python script that assigns these numbers to variables.\n4.  The script will then print two clear sentences, one for each capsule, stating the number imprinted on it. This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number\".\n\n```python\n# The number imprinted on a Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule.\nimprint_10mg = \"3107\"\n\n# The number imprinted on a Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule.\nimprint_20mg = \"3105\"\n\nprint(f\"The number on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<3107 and 3105>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
