    # I: Incorrect premise. Naloxone is a safety feature against misuse.
    # II: Correct. Subutex is preferred for specific populations (e.g., pregnancy).
    # III: Correct. When taken as prescribed, safety profiles are similar due to low naloxone bioavailability.
    # IV: Incorrect. The topic is well-understood, not a major unknown.
    # V: Incorrect. Contains a factual error; Suboxone's safety feature is the PRESENCE, not lack, of naloxone.
