    print("  - The rule for a sentence is L = S V C '.' EOF.")
    print("    This means every valid sentence must end with a period '.'.")
    print("  - The grammar contains the rule 'REC = REC ADJ'.")
    print("    This is a direct left-recursive rule.")
    print("  - Standard Recursive Descent (RD) and Packrat (PR) parsers are known")
    print("    to fail on left-recursive grammars by entering an infinite loop.")
    print("  - The problem states we must not transform the grammar or modify the algorithms.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Statement B
    print("3. Analysis of Statement B:")

    valid_nouns = {'frogs', 'snakes'}
    valid_adjectives = {'red', 'or alike'}
    print("  - The sentence contains the word 'snake' (singular). The grammar defines N as 'frogs' or 'snakes' (plural).")
    print("  - The sentence contains the word 'big'. This word is not a defined terminal for ADJ.")
    print("  - The sentence is not in the language L, so neither parser would accept it.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate Statement C
    print("4. Analysis of Statement C:")
    print("  Statement: Both RD and PR accept \"jump or alike frog swiftly.\" and do not run infinitely.")

    print("  - The sentence does not follow the grammar's structure, so it is not in the language L.")
