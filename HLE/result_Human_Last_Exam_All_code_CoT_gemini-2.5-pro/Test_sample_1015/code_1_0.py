    explanation = """
The primary difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the core principle of body alignment, specifically the placement of the hips.

1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method is known for its strict adherence to anatomical principles and maintaining a square torso. In a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep both hips perfectly square to the front. The backbend is initiated from the upper back, maintaining the stability and alignment of the pelvis. This results in a pure, controlled spinal articulation.

2.  **Balanchine Method:** This style often emphasizes speed, musicality, and exaggerated lines. To achieve a deeper and more visually dramatic backbend in a cambré derrière, the Balanchine technique often allows the dancer to release the hip. This means the hip of the working leg can open up, which in turn allows for a greater degree of backbend and a different aesthetic quality.

Therefore, the most fundamental difference is the 'Placement of hip'. While other aspects like head placement (E) and the degree of the backbend (D) also differ, they are often a direct result of the difference in hip placement.
