    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the core question, which is to find the name of the US city the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  I will access my internal knowledge base and look for plot summaries or details about this specific movie.\n3.  Once the city is identified, I will write a simple Python script.\n4.  This script will store the name of the city in a variable and then use a `print()` function to display the answer in a full sentence, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know which US city the character Tommaso moves to in the movie 'Ovosodo'.\n# I have found the information in my knowledge base by looking up the plot of the film.\n# This script will now print the answer.\n\n# The city Tommaso moves to in the movie.\ncity = \"Philadelphia\"\n\nprint(f\"In the 1997 movie 'Ovosodo', Tommaso moves to {city}, USA.\")\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
