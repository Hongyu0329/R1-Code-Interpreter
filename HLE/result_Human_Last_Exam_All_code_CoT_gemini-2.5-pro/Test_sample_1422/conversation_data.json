    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological relations for Feynman diagrams in a scalar $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### My thinking process:\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Interaction:** The problem specifies an \"interacting scalar field theory.\" The simplest and most common example is the $\\phi^4$ theory, where the interaction vertex involves four scalar field lines meeting at a point.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Parameters:**\n    *   `L`: The number of loops. We are given `L = 2`.\n    *   `V`: The number of vertices. This is what we want to minimize.\n    *   `I`: The number of internal lines (propagators).\n    *   `E`: The number of external lines (incoming/outgoing particles).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Topological Equations:**\n    *   **Equation 1 (Loop Formula):** For any connected Feynman diagram, the number of loops is related to the number of internal lines and vertices by the formula:\n        `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   **Equation 2 (Vertex Rule):** In $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has 4 lines attached. These lines are either internal or external. An internal line connects two vertices (consuming two line \"ends\"), and an external line connects to one vertex (consuming one line \"end\"). This gives us the relation:\n        `4 * V = 2 * I + E`\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations to Minimize V:**\n    *   Our goal is to find the minimum possible integer value for `V`, given `L = 2`.\n    *   Let's rearrange Equation 1 to express `I` in terms of `V` and `L`:\n        `I = L + V - 1`\n        Since `L = 2`, this becomes: `I = 2 + V - 1 = V + 1`.\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `I` into Equation 2:\n        `4V = 2 * (V + 1) + E`\n        `4V = 2V + 2 + E`\n    *   Solve for `V`:\n        `2V = 2 + E`\n        `V = 1 + E / 2`\n\n5.  **Find the Minimum Value:**\n    *   The final equation `V = 1 + E / 2` shows that the number of vertices `V` depends on the number of external lines `E`.\n    *   To minimize `V`, we must minimize `E`.\n    *   The number of external lines `E` must be a non-negative integer. Furthermore, for `V` to be an integer, `E / 2` must be an integer, which means `E` must be an even number.\n    *   The smallest possible value for `E` is `0`. This corresponds to a \"vacuum bubble\" diagram, which has no external particles.\n    *   Substituting `E = 0` into our final equation gives the minimum possible value for `V`:\n        `V_min = 1 + 0 / 2 = 1`.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices is 1. This corresponds to a two-loop vacuum bubble diagram, often depicted as a \"figure-eight,\" where a single vertex has two propagators looping back to connect to itself.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # L: number of loops\n    # V: number of vertices\n    # I: number of internal lines\n    # E: number of external lines\n\n    # The topological relations are:\n    # 1) L = I - V + 1\n    # 2) 4V = 2I + E (for phi^4 theory)\n\n    # We are given L = 2.
