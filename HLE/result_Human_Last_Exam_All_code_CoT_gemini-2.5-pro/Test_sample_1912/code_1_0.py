# Define the numbers for the problem we need to solve.
a = 6
b = 12

# The pattern discovered from the sequence is: a * b + a - (b / a)
# Let's calculate each part of the formula.
term1 = a * b
term2 = a
# In the formula, the division is integer division.
term3 = b // a
result = term1 + term2 - term3

# Print the final equation showing how the result is obtained, as requested.
