    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The index of a linear boundary-value problem for a system of $n$ ordinary differential equations with $m$ linearly independent boundary conditions is given by the formula: `index = n - m`. This formula applies to Fredholm problems, which this problem is.\n\n2.  **Determine the system dimension (n):** The vector function $x(t)$ is defined as $x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))$. This means the system consists of 2024 differential equations. Therefore, the dimension of the system is $n = 2024$. The mention of 202000 in the definitions of matrix A and vector I appears to be a typo, as it contradicts the explicit definition of $x(t)$ and the components used in the boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of independent boundary conditions (m):** The problem provides six boundary conditions. We need to find the number of these that are linearly independent.\n    The given conditions are:\n    *   $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    *   $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0 \\implies x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0 \\implies x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0 \\implies x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0 \\implies x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\n    By inspecting these equations, we can see that the four conditions involving $x_2$ are all scalar multiples of each other. Thus, they represent only one independent condition. The conditions on $x_1$ and $x_{2024}$ are independent of each other and of the condition on $x_2$ because they involve different variables.\n    So, we have three linearly independent boundary conditions:\n    1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    3.  $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n    Therefore, $m = 3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the index:** Using the formula `index = n - m`, we can calculate the index of the problem.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically determine `m` by calculating the rank of the coefficient matrix of the boundary conditions and then compute the index.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the dimension of the system, n.\n# The vector x(t) is defined with 2024 components.\nn = 2024\n\n# Step 2: Define the boundary conditions and find the number of independent ones (m).\n# We represent the 6 boundary conditions as a coefficient matrix.\n# The variables are ordered as [x_1(0), x_1(T), x_2(0), x_2(T), ..., x_2024(0), x_2024(T)].\n# The size of the matrix is (number of conditions) x (2 * n).\nnum_conditions = 6\nnum_vars = 2 * n\nbc_matrix = np.zeros((num_conditions, num_vars))\n\n# Condition 1: x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\nbc_matrix[0, 2 * (1 - 1)] = -1  # Coeff for x_1(0)\nbc_matrix[0, 2 * (1 - 1) + 1] = 1   # Coeff for x_1(T)\n\n# Condition 2: x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\nbc_matrix[1, 2 * (2 - 1)] = -1  # Coeff for x_2(0)\nbc_matrix[1, 2 * (2 - 1) + 1] = 1   # Coeff for x_2(T)\n\n# Condition 3: 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0\nbc_matrix[2, 2 * (2 - 1)] = -5\nbc_matrix[2, 2 * (2 - 1) + 1] = 5\n\n# Condition 4: 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0\nbc_matrix[3, 2 * (2 - 1)] = -100\nbc_matrix[3, 2 * (2 - 1) + 1] = 100\n\n# Condition 5: 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\nbc_matrix[4, 2 * (2 - 1)] = 1000\nbc_matrix[4, 2 * (2 - 1) + 1] = -1000\n\n# Condition 6: 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0\nbc_matrix[5, 2 * (2024 - 1)] = -100\nbc_matrix[5, 2 * (2024 - 1) + 1] = 100\n\n# The number of linearly independent conditions (m) is the rank of this matrix.\nm = np.linalg.matrix_rank(bc_matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem using the formula: index = n - m.\nindex = n - m\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed values.\nprint(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is m = {m}.\")\nprint(\"The index of the problem is calculated as n - m.\")\nprint(f\"{n} - {m} = {index}\")\n```\n<<<2021>>>"
