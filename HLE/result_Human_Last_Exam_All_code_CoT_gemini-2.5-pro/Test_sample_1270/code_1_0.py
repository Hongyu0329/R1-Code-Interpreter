# The name "mercedesbenzene" suggests a combination of a benzene ring and the Mercedes logo.

# 1. A benzene molecule (C6H6) has 6 carbon atoms.
carbons_in_benzene = 6

# 2. The Mercedes-Benz logo is a three-pointed star. We can interpret this
#    as representing 3 additional carbon atoms.
points_in_mercedes_logo = 3

# 3. Calculate the total number of carbons in the fictitious molecule.
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene + points_in_mercedes_logo

# Print the reasoning and the final equation with all the numbers.
print(f"A benzene ring provides {carbons_in_benzene} carbons.")
print(f"The Mercedes logo's three points add {points_in_mercedes_logo} carbons.")
print(f"The final calculation for mercedesbenzene is: {carbons_in_benzene} + {points_in_mercedes_logo} = {total_carbons}")
