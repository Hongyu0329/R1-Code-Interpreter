    print("The problem describes a structure that is a cofinal sequence in a specific partial order.")
    print("Let's define the partial order:")
    print("  - The set: P = {x | x is an uncountable subset of omega_1}")
    print("  - The relation: x >= y if and only if |y \\ x| is countable (y is 'almost a subset' of x).")
    print("\nA 'tower' <x_alpha : alpha < delta> is a sequence where:")
    print("1. For alpha < beta, x_alpha > x_beta (since |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable but x_alpha != x_beta).")
    print("2. There is no uncountable y such that x_alpha >= y for all alpha < delta.")
    print("\nThis means the sequence <x_alpha> is a cofinal decreasing chain in the partial order (P, >=).")
    print("The question asks for the minimal possible delta, which is the cofinality of this partial order.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Proving the minimal delta must be greater than omega_1 ---")
    print("Let's assume for contradiction that a tower of length delta = omega_1 exists.")
    print("So, we have a sequence <x_alpha : alpha < omega_1>.")
    print("\nTo simplify, we can create a new sequence x'_alpha = INTERSECTION(x_gamma for gamma <= alpha).")
    print("This new sequence is genuinely decreasing (x'_beta is a subset of x'_alpha for alpha < beta)")
    print("and is equivalent to the original tower for our purposes.")
    print("The tower property implies that the intersection of all sets in the sequence, INTERSECTION(x'_alpha for alpha < omega_1), must be a countable set.")
    print("(If the intersection were uncountable, it would be a lower bound, contradicting the tower definition).")

    print("\nNow, we construct an uncountable set 'y' that acts as a lower bound, creating a contradiction.")
    print("We can construct y = {y_beta : beta < omega_1} by transfinite recursion:")
    print("For each beta < omega_1:")
    print("  1. Let s_beta = sup({y_gamma : gamma < beta}). Since beta is a countable ordinal, s_beta is the sup of a countable set of countable ordinals, so s_beta < omega_1.")
    print("  2. The set x'_beta is uncountable, so it is not bounded below omega_1. Thus, we can choose an element y_beta from x'_beta such that y_beta > s_beta.")
    print("\nThis process gives a strictly increasing sequence <y_beta>, so the set y = {y_beta : beta < omega_1} is uncountable.")
    print("\nIs 'y' a lower bound? Let's check |y \\ x'_alpha| for a fixed alpha < omega_1.")
    print("  - If beta > alpha, then by construction y_beta is in x'_beta.")
    print("  - Because the sequence is decreasing, x'_beta is a subset of x'_alpha.")
    print("  - So, for all beta > alpha, y_beta is in x'_alpha.")
    print("  - The only elements of y that might not be in x'_alpha are those in the set {y_beta : beta <= alpha}.")
    print("  - This set has size |alpha + 1|, which is countable because alpha < omega_1.")
    print("Therefore, |y \\ x'_alpha| is countable for all alpha < omega_1.")

    print("\nThis contradicts the definition of a tower, as we have found a lower bound 'y'.")
    print("Our initial assumption must be false. No tower of length omega_1 can exist.")
    print("So, delta must be strictly greater than omega_1.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: The Final Answer ---")
    print("We have shown that delta > omega_1.")
    print("The smallest cardinal number greater than omega_1 is omega_2.")
    print("It is a highly non-trivial result of advanced set theory that the cofinality of this partial order is exactly omega_2.")
    print("This means a tower of length omega_2 can be constructed, and it is the shortest possible one.")
