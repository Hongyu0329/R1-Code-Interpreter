    Solves the problem based on the properties of the block B.

    The problem states:
    - Defect group D = (C_2)^5, so |D| = 2^5 = 32.
    - Inertial quotient E has order 5.
    - We need to compute k(B) - l(B).

    Plan:
    1. Calculate l(B), the number of irreducible Brauer characters.
       l(B) is the number of irreducible characters of the inertial quotient E.
    2. Calculate k(B), the number of irreducible ordinary characters.
       k(B) is the number of orbits of E acting on the character group Irr(D).
    3. Compute the difference.
