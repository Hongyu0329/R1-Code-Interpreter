    print(" - Concentration Titration: As concentration increases, gelation occurs. We observe an increase in both the alpha-helix peak (1652 cm^-1) and the beta-sheet peak (1618 cm^-1).")
    print(" - This indicates that the disordered protein is folding into a structure containing both alpha-helices and beta-sheets.")
    print(" - Heating Experiment: Upon heating, the beta-sheet peaks (1618 cm^-1 and 1680 cm^-1) disappear, and the disordered peak (1645 cm^-1) grows stronger. This confirms that beta-sheets are part of the ordered gel structure that unfolds with heat.")
    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion.")
    print(" - The evidence strongly supports that the initially disordered proteins fold to form an ordered gel structure composed of both alpha-helices and beta-sheets.")
    print(" - This corresponds to answer choice I.")
