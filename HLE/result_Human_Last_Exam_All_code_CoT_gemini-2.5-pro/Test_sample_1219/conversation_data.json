    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Recognize the Need for High Precision:** The number `10^100` (a 1 followed by 100 zeros) is far too large for standard floating-point data types. I will use Python's `decimal` module, which allows for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n2.  **Use Trigonometric Identity:** The `tan(x)` function has a period of `π`. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The problem then simplifies to calculating `tan(y)` where `y = 10^100 mod π`.\n3.  **Calculate the Modulo:** To compute `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need a value of `π` with a precision greater than the number of digits in `10^100`. Since `10^100` has 101 digits, I will set the precision of the `decimal` module to 120 digits to ensure accuracy for the modulo operation and subsequent calculations.\n4.  **Implement `tan()`:** The `decimal` module does not have a built-in `tan` function. I will calculate it using the identity `tan(y) = sin(y) / cos(y)`.\n5.  **Implement `sin()` and `cos()`:** I will implement the `sin()` and `cos()` functions using their Taylor series expansions. These series converge for any real number, and with the high precision set in the `decimal` module, they will provide an accurate result.\n6.  **Extract and Print the Result:** After computing the high-precision value of `tan(10^100)`, I will convert the result to a string, locate the decimal point, and extract the first three digits that follow it. Finally, I will print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Taylor series implementation for sin(z) for a Decimal object z\ndef sin(z):\n    \"\"\"Computes sin(z) for a Decimal z using Taylor series.\"\"\"\n    z_squared = z * z\n    term = z\n    current_sum = z\n    n = 1\n    # Loop until the term becomes too small to affect the sum at the current precision\n    while True:\n        n += 2\n        # Next term is derived from the previous: term_new = -term_old * z^2 / (n * (n-1))\n        term *= -z_squared / (n * (n - 1))\n        new_sum = current_sum + term\n        # If the sum no longer changes, we have converged\n        if new_sum == current_sum:\n            break\n        current_sum = new_sum\n    return current_sum\n\n# Taylor series implementation for cos(z) for a Decimal object z\ndef cos(z):\n    \"\"\"Computes cos(z) for a Decimal z using Taylor series.\"\"\"\n    z_squared = z * z\n    term = decimal.Decimal(1)\n    current_sum = decimal.Decimal(1)\n    n = 0\n    # Loop until the term becomes too small to affect the sum at the current precision\n    while True:\n        n += 2\n        # Next term is derived from the previous: term_new = -term_old * z^2 / (n * (n-1))\n        term *= -z_squared / (n * (n - 1))\n        new_sum = current_sum + term\n        # If the sum no longer changes, we have converged\n        if new_sum == current_sum:\n            break\n        current_sum = new_sum\n    return current_sum\n\n# --- Main Calculation ---\n\n# 1.
