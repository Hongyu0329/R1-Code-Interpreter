    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the question, followed by the code.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the main characters of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* and their primary motivations and psychological states.\n\n1.  **Kris Kelvin**: The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the space station. A central element of his character is his deep, melancholic nostalgia for Earth, which is often represented by memories of his father's house, a nearby lake, and the sound of rustling leaves.\n2.  **Hari**: Kris's deceased wife, recreated by the Solaris ocean. Her journey is one of becoming human and understanding her own artificial existence, not of missing Earth.\n3.  **Snaut**: A cyberneticist on the station. He is cynical and world-weary, having long since adapted to his strange environment. He is the one who observes Kris's homesickness and tells him not to be ashamed of it.\n4.  **Sartorius**: A biologist who is cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of Solaris. He actively suppresses emotion and would not be the character to miss earthly sounds.\n5.  **Gibarian**: Kris's mentor who dies by suicide just before Kris arrives. He is seen only in recordings and as a \"guest,\" expressing regret and fear, but the specific shame of missing Earth's sounds is tied to Kris.\n\nBased on this analysis, Kris Kelvin is the character whose homesickness and shame for it are a key plot point. The code will therefore identify Kris as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film \"Solaris\"\n    who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The main character, Kris Kelvin, is defined by his profound nostalgia for Earth.\n    # This longing is symbolized by recurring sounds and images of nature from his home.\n    # Dr. Snaut explicitly tells Kris he should not be ashamed of his very human homesickness,\n    # confirming that Kris is the character experiencing this emotion.\n    character_name = \"Kris\"\n    answer_choice = \"A\"\n\n    print(f\"The character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is: {character_name}\")\n    print(f\"The correct answer choice is: {answer_choice}\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
