    "This is a question from the field of mathematics, specifically topology. The answer is a known mathematical fact established through a series of proofs by mathematicians like Bing, Jones, Rogers, and finally completed by Oversteegen and Tymchatyn. The task is to count the number of distinct types (homeomorphism classes) of mathematical objects known as homogeneous planar continua.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the established, distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua based on the complete classification theorem.\n2.  Create a Python script that lists these classes.\n3.  The script will then count the number of items in the list to arrive at the final answer.\n4.  To satisfy the requirement of showing the \"equation,\" the script will print a simple summation representing the count of each class.\n\n```python\ndef count_homogeneous_planar_continua_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the known homeomorphism classes of\n    homogeneous planar continua based on the classification theorem in topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the complete classification by Oversteegen and Tymchatyn,\n    # any homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following four spaces.\n    classes = [\n        \"The point\",\n        \"The simple closed curve (circle)\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc\",\n        \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n    ]\n\n    count = len(classes)\n\n    print(\"The established homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    for i, description in enumerate(classes):\n        print(f\"- {description}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number, we sum the count for each class.\")\n\n    # Create and print the equation string, e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\"\n    sum_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation = \" + \".join(sum_parts) + f\" = {count}\"\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {count} homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\ncount_homogeneous_planar_continua_classes()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
