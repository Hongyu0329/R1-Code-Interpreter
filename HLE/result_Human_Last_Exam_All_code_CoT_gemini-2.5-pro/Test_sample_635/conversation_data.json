    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the concatenated matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has a full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Define the relationship $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. This equation imposes constraints on the elements of $D(s)$ to ensure that the resulting matrix $N(s)$ consists entirely of polynomials.\n2.  I will construct a simple, low-degree polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that adheres to these constraints. The goal is to find a solution that makes the determinant of $D(s)$ match the poles of $H(s)$, leading to a minimal factorization.\n3.  Once $D(s)$ is determined, I will compute $N(s)$ using the equation from step 1.\n4.  I will then perform two verification checks:\n    a. Confirm that $D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ indeed equals the original $H(s)$.\n    b. Verify the coprimeness by checking if the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all values of $s$. This is done by showing that the greatest common divisor of all $2 \\times 2$ minors of this matrix is a non-zero constant.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations and verifications.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies a left coprime factorization for the given\n    transfer function matrix H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n    print(\"Given transfer function H(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H_s)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Propose a polynomial matrix D(s).\n    # Based on the condition D(s)H(s) = N(s), where N(s) must be a polynomial matrix,\n    # we can derive the structure of D(s).\n    # A minimal D(s) can be found by making it upper triangular and satisfying the polynomial conditions.\n    # d21=0.
