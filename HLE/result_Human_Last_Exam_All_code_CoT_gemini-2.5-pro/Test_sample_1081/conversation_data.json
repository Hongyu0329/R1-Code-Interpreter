    "To find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can use a known result from the theory of algebraic groups.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  State the general formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a connected reductive group $G$. The formula is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, where $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$ and $T_0$ is a maximally $\\mathbb{F}_q$-split maximal torus of $G$.\n2.  Provide the specific formula for the order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ for a group of type $E_8$. This depends on the rank, the number of positive roots, and the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the associated Weyl group.\n3.  Provide the formula for the order of $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n4.  Combine these to get the final formula for the number of tori.\n5.  Write a Python script that constructs and prints this formula, explicitly listing the numerical parameters involved, as requested.\n\nThe key parameters for a group of type $E_8$ are:\n*   **Rank ($n$)**: 8\n*   **Number of positive roots ($N$)**: 120\n*   **Degrees of fundamental invariants ($d_i$)**: 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\n\nThe following Python code will print the exact formula for the number of tori and highlight these parameters.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and displays the formula for the number of\n    F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the reductive group G of type E_8\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n    rank = 8\n    num_positive_roots = 120\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # Construct the formula string\n    # Numerator part: |G(F_q)|\n    product_terms = []\n    for d in degrees:\n        product_terms.append(f\"(q^{d} - 1)\")\n    \n    numerator_str = f\"q^{num_positive_roots} * {' * '.join(product_terms)}\"\n\n    # Denominator part: |T_0(F_q)|\n    denominator_str = f\"(q - 1)^{rank}\"\n\n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"The exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type {group_type} is given by the formula N, where q is the number of elements in the field F_q:\")\n    print(f\"N = ({numerator_str}) / ({denominator_str})\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The specific numerical parameters in this formula for type E_8 are:\")\n    print(f\"- The rank of the group: {rank}\")\n    print(f\"- The number of positive roots (exponent of q in the leading factor): {num_positive_roots}\")\n    \n    degree_list_str = ', '.join(map(str, degrees))\n    print(f\"- The degrees of the fundamental invariants (exponents in the polynomial factors): {degree_list_str}\")\n\nsolve_e8_tori_number()\n```\n<<<(q^120 * (q^2 - 1) * (q^8 - 1) * (q^12 - 1) * (q^14 - 1) * (q^18 - 1) * (q^20 - 1) * (q^24 - 1) * (q^30 - 1)) / ((q - 1)^8)>>>"
