# The smallest possible number of complements is 0.
# The included point topology provides an example of a topology that is neither
# trivial nor discrete but has no complements.
#
# However, if we consider only topologies that have at least one complement,
# the question becomes about the minimum non-zero number of complements.
# This is a known result in topology. For a set X with |X| >= c,
# there exists a topology with exactly 2 complements, and no topology
# (that is not trivial or discrete) has exactly 1 complement.
# Thus, the smallest non-zero number of complements is 2.

# The numbers in the final equation
num1 = 2
num2 = 0
result = 2

# Printing each number in the final equation
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
