# Step 1: The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.
# A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron whose vertices are the same
# as the great icosahedron's vertices.

# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is composed of faces that are already triangles.
# We need to find the number of these triangular faces.

# Step 3: By definition, a regular icosahedron has 20 faces.
number_of_triangles = 20

# The problem is to find the number of visible triangles on the outer-hull.
# Since the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron with 20 triangular faces,
# the final answer is 20.
