    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the \"outer-hull\" of a great icosahedron is.\n\n1.  **Identify the object and its hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex star polyhedron. Its vertices are the same as the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron. The \"outer-hull\" (more formally, the convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the vertices. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Analyze the hull's faces:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. Its surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n\n3.  **Count the triangles:** The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer surface. Since the surface is already made of triangles, no further triangulation is necessary. Therefore, the number of triangles is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** A regular icosahedron has 20 faces. All of these faces are on the outer surface and are visible from the outside.\n\nThe following Python code states this conclusion and prints the final number.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron whose vertices are the same\n# as the great icosahedron's vertices.\n\n# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is composed of faces that are already triangles.\n# We need to find the number of these triangular faces.\n\n# Step 3: By definition, a regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\nnumber_of_triangles = 20\n\n# The problem is to find the number of visible triangles on the outer-hull.\n# Since the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron with 20 triangular faces,\n# the final answer is 20.\n\nprint(\"The number of triangles on the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"Final Answer:\")\nprint(number_of_triangles)\n```\n<<<20>>>"
