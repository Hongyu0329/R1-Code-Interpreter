    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, I will find the official formula used by Terraria to calculate boss health in Expert Mode multiplayer. This formula relates the boss's health to the number of players in the world.\n\nSecond, I will identify the specific numbers for the formula's variables: the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode and the health scaling factor per player.\n\nFinally, I will set up the full equation and analyze what happens as the number of players approaches infinity. The python script will display this equation with all the relevant numbers and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the official Terraria Wiki, which references the game's source code,\n    # the health of a boss in Expert Mode is determined by a scaling formula.\n    \n    # 1. Define the base parameters for the calculation.\n    base_health_eoc = 3640  # Base health of Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    player_health_scaler = 0.35  # Health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    num_players_symbol = \"N\" # We use 'N' to represent the number of players.\n\n    # 2. Explain the formula and its components.\n    print(\"The formula for boss health in Expert Mode multiplayer is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = Base Health * (1 + (Number of Players - 1) * Player Health Scaler)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, the specific values are:\")\n    print(f\"Base Health = {base_health_eoc}\")\n    print(f\"Player Health Scaler = {player_health_scaler}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Players = {num_players_symbol}\")\n\n    # 3. Present the final equation with the numbers substituted.\n    print(\"\\nPlugging these numbers into the formula, we get the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_eoc} * (1 + ({num_players_symbol} - 1) * {player_health_scaler})\")\n\n    # 4. Analyze the equation as the number of players approaches infinity.\n    print(\"\\nIn this case, the number of players (N) is considered to be infinite.\")\n    print(\"As 'N' approaches infinity, the term '(N - 1)' also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"When this infinitely large number is multiplied by the positive constants (0.35 and 3640), the result is also infinity.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players is infinite.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<infinite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the source code of the video game Terraria, in Expert Mode what is the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu given an infinite number of players?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
