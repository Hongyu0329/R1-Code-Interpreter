    # The question relates to the chemotopic organization of the rat olfactory bulb.
    # The principle is that the length of an odorant's carbon chain is mapped
    # spatially along the bulb's anterior-posterior axis.
    
    # Rule 1: Short carbon chains are processed in the ANTERIOR region.
    # Rule 2: Long carbon chains are processed in the POSTERIOR region.
    
    # Based on these rules, option C is a correct statement.
    
    chosen_answer = "C"
    explanation = "Short chain molecules tended to be processed more anteriorly in the olfactory bulb"
