    print(f"The length {delta} of the shortest such maximal tower is a cardinal invariant known as the 'tower number'.")
    print(f"This is a generalization of the standard tower number from \u03C9 to {omega_2}, denoted as t({omega_2}).")

    print(f"The cardinal {omega_2} is regular. Therefore, we must have t({omega_2}) > {omega_2}.")

    print(f"1. Smallest Value: It is consistent with ZFC that t({omega_2}) = {omega_3}. For example, if we assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), then 2^{omega_2} = {omega_3}, which forces t({omega_2}) to be {omega_3}. Thus, the smallest possible value for {delta} is {omega_3}.")
    print(f"2. Second Smallest Value: The next cardinal after {omega_3} is {omega_4}. It is also consistent with ZFC that t({omega_2}) = {omega_4}. Set theorists can construct models of ZFC where this is true.")
    print(f"In fact, t({omega_2}) can consistently be any regular cardinal between {omega_3} and 2^{omega_2}.")
