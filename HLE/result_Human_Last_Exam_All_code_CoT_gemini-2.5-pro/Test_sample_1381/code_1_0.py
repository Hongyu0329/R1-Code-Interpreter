def solve_equilibria():
    """
    Calculates the number of possible equilibria for the generalized Lotka-Volterra system
    with N species.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Equilibria are found by setting the time derivatives of abundances to zero.
    2. The structure of the equations implies that at any equilibrium, the species
       can be partitioned into a set of survivors and a set of extinct species.
    3. The condition for survival is dictated by the parameter A_i. A species can
       survive only if its A_i value is above a certain threshold determined by the
       state of the whole system.
    4. This leads to the conclusion that the set of surviving species must correspond
       to a group with the highest A_i values.
    5. By varying parameters, specifically making all A_i values distinct, we can
       have N possible non-trivial equilibria, each corresponding to the survival
       of the top k species (for k=1 to N).
    6. Including the trivial equilibrium (all species extinct), the total number
       of possible equilibria is N + 1.
