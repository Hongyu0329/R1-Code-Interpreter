    "This is a problem from the mathematical theory of integral lattices. The solution involves using known classification results for these objects, primarily from the work of Conway and Sloane. A direct computation from first principles is not feasible.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish that such lattices can exist by checking the necessary conditions from the theory.\n2.  Any positive definite even lattice `L` of determinant 2 can be uniquely decomposed as an orthogonal sum of indecomposable lattices. Since the determinant of the whole lattice is the product of the determinants of its indecomposable components, exactly one of these components must have a determinant of 2, while all others must have a determinant of 1.\n3.  This means we can write `L = M ⊕ U`, where `M` is an indecomposable positive definite even lattice with `det(M) = 2`, and `U` is a positive definite even unimodular lattice (i.e., `det(U) = 1`).\n4.  A fundamental result states that the dimension of an even unimodular lattice must be a multiple of 8.\n5.  Since the total dimension is 17 (`dim(M) + dim(U) = 17`), we can enumerate the possible dimensions for `U` (0, 8, 16) and count the number of lattices in each case using the known classifications.\n6.  The total number of lattices is the sum of the counts from these disjoint cases.\n\nThe Python code below implements this counting argument, with comments explaining where each number comes from based on the classification tables of lattices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lattice_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17\n    and determinant 2 based on known mathematical classification results.\n\n    The method is to count the number of ways to form such a lattice L\n    as an orthogonal sum L = M ⊕ U, where M is an indecomposable lattice with\n    det(M)=2 and U is a unimodular lattice (det(U)=1).
