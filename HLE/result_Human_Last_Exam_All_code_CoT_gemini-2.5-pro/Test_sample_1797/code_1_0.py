    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    - Statement A is correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs analyzed with graph theory.
    - Statement B is correct. The state explosion problem is a key challenge, leading to exponential size.
    - Statement C is incorrect. While related analysis problems (like finding optimal hardening sets) are NP-hard, the generation problem itself is not typically defined as NP-hard. Its difficulty stems from the potentially exponential size of the graph (state explosion), not the complexity class of a decision problem.
    - Statement D is correct. Attack graphs are dynamic and require incremental updates.
    - Statement E is correct. They are used for formal verification with model checking.

    Therefore, the only clearly incorrect statement is C.
