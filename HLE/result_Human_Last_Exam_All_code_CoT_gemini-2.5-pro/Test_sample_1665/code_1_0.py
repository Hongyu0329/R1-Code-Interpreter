    print("Analysis: The high-permeability ferromagnetic cylinder will capture the magnetic field lines from the dipole and guide them efficiently along its length. This flux guiding effect concentrates the magnetic field at the far end.")
    print("Result: A STRONG magnetic field at the other end.")

    print("\n[Scenario 2: The cylinder is a hollow tube made of an ideal superconducting material.]")
    print("Analysis: The superconducting material will expel the magnetic field. It acts as a shield, forcing the field lines to go around the exterior of the tube. This will weaken the field in the general region of the cylinder's far end, especially on its axis.")
    print("Result: A WEAK magnetic field at the other end.")

    print("\n[Scenario 3: The cylinder consists of a ferromagnetic core surrounded by an ideal superconducting shell.]")
    print("Analysis: The outer superconducting shell will provide perfect magnetic shielding. It will prevent the dipole's external magnetic field from ever reaching the ferromagnetic core. The core cannot be magnetized and therefore cannot guide the field.")
    print("Result: A VERY WEAK (shielded) magnetic field at the other end.")

    print("\n[Scenario 4: The cylinder consists of a superconducting core surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell.]")
    print("Analysis: The outer ferromagnetic shell will capture and guide the magnetic field lines, just like in Scenario 1. The inner superconducting core will repel any field trying to enter it, forcing all the guided magnetic flux to be confined within the ferromagnetic material. This confinement can make the flux guiding even more effective.")
    print("Result: A STRONG magnetic field at the other end, comparable to or even stronger than Scenario 1.")

    print("\n[Scenario 5: There is no cylinder, only air.]")
    print("Analysis: This is the baseline case. The dipole's magnetic field spreads out in all directions and its strength decreases rapidly with distance (as 1/r³).")
    print("Result: A WEAK magnetic field at the other end (our reference for 'weak').")

    print("Comparing the outcomes, the magnetic field is made significantly stronger only in the scenarios where a ferromagnetic material provides an uninterrupted path for the magnetic flux from the dipole to the other end.")
