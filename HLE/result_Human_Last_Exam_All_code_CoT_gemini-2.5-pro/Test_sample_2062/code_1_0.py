# Part (a): On the condition for similarity of diagonal matrices.
# A fundamental result in linear algebra states that two diagonalizable matrices
# are similar if and only if they have the same characteristic polynomial.
# The characteristic polynomial is determined by the multiset of eigenvalues.
# Diagonal matrices are, by definition, diagonalizable. Their eigenvalues are their
# diagonal entries.
# Thus, two diagonal matrices A and B are similar if and only if their multisets
# of diagonal entries are identical. This is precisely the same as stating that
# the multiplicities of each eigenvalue are identical for both matrices.
answer_a = "Yes"
print("(a) Is it true that A and B are similar if and only if the multiplicities of each eigenvalue are identical?")
print(f"Answer: {answer_a}\n")

# Part (b): Counting similarity classes for n=3.
# A similarity class for a diagonal matrix is uniquely determined by the multiset of its eigenvalues.
# The problem asks for the number of similarity classes for n=3, where the eigenvalues
# are composed of the three distinct values {alpha, beta, gamma}. This is equivalent to
# counting the number of distinct multisets of size 3 that can be formed from a set of 3 distinct items.
# This is a "combinations with repetition" problem. The formula is C(k + n - 1, k),
# where n is the number of items to choose from, and k is the size of the multiset.
n_choices = 3  # Number of distinct eigenvalues {alpha, beta, gamma}
k_size = 3     # The dimension of the matrix, n=3
num_classes = math.comb(k_size + n_choices - 1, k_size)

print("(b) For n = 3 and eigenvalues alpha, beta, gamma (distinct), how many similarity classes exist?")
print(f"This is a combinations with repetition problem: choosing {k_size} items from {n_choices} types.")
print(f"The number of classes is C({k_size} + {n_choices} - 1, {k_size}) = C({k_size + n_choices - 1}, {k_size}).")
print(f"C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10.")
answer_b = num_classes
print(f"Answer: {answer_b}\n")

# Part (c): Growth rate of the number of similarity classes.
# The number of similarity classes for diagonal matrices in M_n(F) where |F|=q is
# the number of distinct multisets of size n from the q elements of F.
# Using the combinations with repetition formula, this number is C(n + q - 1, n).
# For a fixed q, C(n + q - 1, n) = (n + q - 1)...(n + 1) / (q - 1)!
# This is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
# Polynomial growth (like n^k) is significantly slower than exponential growth (like c^n for c > 1).
# Therefore, the number of classes does not grow exponentially with n.
answer_c = "No"
print("(c) Does the number of similarity classes for diagonal matrices in M_n(F) grow exponentially with n for fixed q?")
print("The number of classes, C(n+q-1, n), is a polynomial in n. This is not exponential growth.")
