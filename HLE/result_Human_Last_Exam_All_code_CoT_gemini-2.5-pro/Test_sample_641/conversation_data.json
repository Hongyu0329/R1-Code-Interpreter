    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow a plan based on the principles of finite group theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and the Task**: The group is PSU(n, q), specifically the projective special unitary group. The notation `PSU(4, 997)` refers to the group with parameters n=4 and q=997, which is defined over the finite field with q^2 elements, GF(997^2). An involution is an element `x` of the group that is its own inverse (`x^2 = 1`) but is not the identity element.\n\n2.  **Use the Group Structure**: The number of involutions is determined by the group's structure, specifically its conjugacy classes. We can find this number by relating the involutions in `PSU(4, q)` to certain elements in its covering group, the special unitary group `SU(4, q^2)`.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula**:\n    *   The group `PSU(4, q)` is the quotient `SU(4, q^2) / Z`, where `Z` is the center of `SU(4, q^2)`.\n    *   An element `gZ` in `PSU` is an involution if and only if `g` is not in the center `Z` and `g^2` is in `Z`.\n    *   For `PSU(4, 997)`, the center `Z` has two elements: the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n    *   Therefore, we need to count the elements `g` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I` (and `g` is not `I` or `-I`).\n    *   Through analysis of the conjugacy classes of `SU(4, q^2)`, it can be shown that these elements belong to two types of classes. The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is the sum of the sizes of the corresponding classes in `PSU`.\n    *   This analysis yields the formula for the number of involutions, `I`, in `PSU(4, q)`:\n        `I = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We will use a Python script to compute this value for `q = 997`. The script will calculate each term of the formula separately and then multiply them to get the final result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n# This corresponds to the projective special unitary group PSU(n, q)\n# with n=4 and q=997.\n\n# The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q^2) is:\n# I = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)\n\n# Set the value of q\nq = 997\n\n# Calculate each term in the formula\nterm1 = q**4\nterm2 = q**2 + 1\nterm3 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n# Calculate the final result by multiplying the terms\n# Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so overflow is not an issue.\nresult = term1 * term2 * term3\n\n# Print the final result in a descriptive equation format as requested.\nprint(\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is calculated using the formula:\")\nprint(\"Number = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)\")\nprint(\"\\nFor q = 997, the values of the terms are:\")\nprint(f\"q^4 = {term1}\")\nprint(f\"q^2 + 1 = {term2}\")\nprint(f\"q^2 - q + 1 = {term3}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Number = {term1} * {term2} * {term3}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of involutions: {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<976239122394548443913330>>>"
