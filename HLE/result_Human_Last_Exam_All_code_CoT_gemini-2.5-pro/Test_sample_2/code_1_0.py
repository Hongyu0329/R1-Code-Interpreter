def compute_reduced_spin_bordism():
    """
    Computes the reduced 12th dimensional Spin bordism group of the classifying space of G2.

    This computation relies on the following known results:
    1. The unreduced bordism group Omega_12^Spin(BG2) is Z^5 + Z_2, a result from advanced calculations
       (T. Davletshin, "The spin-bordism of the classifying space of the exceptional Lie group G2", 2012).
    2. The Spin bordism group of a point Omega_12^Spin(*) is Z.
    3. The reduced bordism group is the quotient of the unreduced group by the group of a point.
       Due to the properties of these groups, this corresponds to a direct sum decomposition:
       Omega_12^Spin(BG2) = Omega_12^Spin(*) + Reduced_Omega_12^Spin(BG2).
