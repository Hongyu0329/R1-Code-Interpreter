def solve_resolvability():
    """
    This function solves for the value of n in the given problem.

    The problem describes a tame functor F within the context of poset representation theory.
    The properties described, particularly the concept of "tameness" and the existence
    of a structure-preserving exact functor from a finite-type category, point towards
    a fundamental invariant in the theory of tame algebras.

    In the classification of tame algebras (e.g., tubular algebras), the defining
    characteristic equation is related to the number 2. For instance, a canonical
    algebra is tame if the sum of its weight-related terms equals 2. This number
    is a deep invariant associated with the geometry of the module category.

    Therefore, the most plausible value for "n" in the term "n-resolvable" is 2.
