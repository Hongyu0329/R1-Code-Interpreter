    Analyzes topological sets to determine if they are 'closepact'.

    The problem defines 'closepact' for a set Y in itself. This definition
    is equivalent to the topological property of being an 'H-closed' space.
    For all the given choices, which are subspaces of real or complex numbers,
    the space is 'regular'. In a regular space, being H-closed is equivalent
    to being 'compact'.

    Therefore, this script identifies which of the sets are necessarily compact.
