    Calculates and prints the sum described in the problem.

    The problem asks for the sum over all natural dimensions `d` of a ratio `R_d = X_d / Y_d`.

    - X_d is the expected volume of the convex hull of the origin and d points
      P_i = r_i * e_i, where r_i ~ U(-1, 1). This is derived as:
      X_d = 1 / (d! * 2^d)

    - Y_d is the expected pairwise distance between any two points in the set
      {O, P_1, ..., P_d}. This is derived as:
      Y_d = (1 + (d-1) * C_dist) / (d+1), where C_dist is the expected
      distance between two points on orthogonal axes.

    The final sum is S = sum_{d=1 to inf} R_d.
