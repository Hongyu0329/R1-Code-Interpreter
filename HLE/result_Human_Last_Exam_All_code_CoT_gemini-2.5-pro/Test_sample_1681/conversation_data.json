    "When we translate the classic Prisoner's Dilemma into a quantum game using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, the players' strategic options expand from simple choices to a range of quantum operations (unitary transformations). The key to altering the game's outcome lies in the initial state, which we can design to be a maximally entangled quantum state.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Set up the Quantum Game:** We'll use the standard EWL protocol. The players' classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), are represented by specific quantum gates. The game starts from an initial state |CC> = |C>⊗|C> that is passed through an entangling operator `J`. We will choose the entanglement level `γ` to be `π/2` (maximal entanglement), as this is optimal for creating a new, favorable equilibrium.\n2.  **Identify the Equilibrium Strategy:** Unlike in the classical game where Defection is dominant, the quantum version with maximal entanglement establishes a new Nash Equilibrium. This equilibrium occurs when both players choose the \"Cooperate\" strategy, represented by the identity operator `I`.\n3.  **Verify the Equilibrium:** To confirm that (Cooperate, Cooperate) is indeed an equilibrium, we must show that neither player can achieve a better payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We calculate the payoff for a player who chooses an arbitrary quantum strategy while the other player continues to cooperate. The calculation will demonstrate that the maximum possible payoff is achieved by cooperating, meaning there is no incentive to deviate.\n4.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Payoff:** We will calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD) when both players choose the Cooperate strategy in the maximally entangled game. Using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix, we will compute the final equilibrium payoff for each player.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculating the probabilities and demonstrating the final payoff calculation at the quantum equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_payoff_at_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the payoff for the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting.\n\n    In the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for the Prisoner's Dilemma,\n    with maximal entanglement (gamma = pi/2), a new Nash Equilibrium emerges\n    where both players choose the 'Cooperate' (C) strategy.\n\n    This function calculates the final payoff at this (C, C) equilibrium point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Payoff matrix values\n    # R: Reward (C, C), S: Sucker (C, D), T: Temptation (D, C), P: Punishment (D, D)\n    R = 5  # Payoff for Alice/Bob if (C, C)\n    S = 0  # Payoff for Alice if (C, D)\n    T = 7  # Payoff for Alice if (D, C)\n    P = 1  # Payoff for Alice/Bob if (D, D)\n\n    # Bob's payoffs for (C,D) and (D,C) are T and S respectively.\n    # Alice's payoff is calculated as: P_A = R*p_cc + S*p_cd + T*p_dc + P*p_dd\n\n    # In the (C, C) equilibrium, the quantum state collapses entirely to the\n    # classical |CC> outcome.
