    "To determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*, we will consult paleontological findings. The scientific literature, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al. titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\", describes the skull of this dinosaur in detail.\n\nBased on this primary source, the large recess on the lateral surface of the lacrimal bone is subdivided by a bony lamina. This subdivision creates a smaller anterodorsal depression and a larger posteroventral depression.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Assigns the count of each type of depression to a variable.\n2.  Calculates the total by adding these counts.\n3.  Prints a clear statement explaining the calculation and showing the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the description by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess\n# of Irritator challengeri is subdivided into two distinct depressions.\n\n# Number of smaller, anterodorsal depressions\nanterodorsal_depressions = 1\n\n# Number of larger, posteroventral depressions\nposteroventral_depressions = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions\ntotal_depressions = anterodorsal_depressions + posteroventral_depressions\n\n# Print the result with the full equation\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is subdivided into an anterodorsal depression and a posteroventral depression.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, it contains a total of {total_depressions} depressions.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {anterodorsal_depressions} + {posteroventral_depressions} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
