# Step 1: Determine the function f(x)
# The function is given as f(x) = A_coeff*e^(2x) + B_coeff*e^x + C_coeff.
# Note: We use A_coeff, B_coeff, C_coeff for the coefficients to avoid confusion with the
# integration limits `a` and `b` from the second part of the problem.

# From the condition lim_{x -> -inf} (f(x) + 3) / e^x = 1:
# lim_{x -> -inf} (A_coeff*e^(2x) + B_coeff*e^x + C_coeff + 3) / e^x = 1
# For the limit to be finite, the numerator must go to 0 as the denominator does.
# As x -> -inf, e^x -> 0 and e^(2x) -> 0.
# So, lim_{x -> -inf} (A_coeff*e^(2x) + B_coeff*e^x + C_coeff + 3) = C_coeff + 3 = 0, which means C_coeff = -3.
# Substituting C_coeff = -3 and simplifying the limit expression:
# lim_{x -> -inf} (A_coeff*e^(2x) + B_coeff*e^x) / e^x = lim_{x -> -inf} (A_coeff*e^x + B_coeff) = B_coeff.
# From the given limit, we find B_coeff = 1.

# From the condition f(ln(2)) = 0:
# We have f(x) = A_coeff*e^(2x) + 1*e^x - 3.
# f(ln(2)) = A_coeff*e^(2*ln(2)) + e^(ln(2)) - 3 = 0
# A_coeff * e^(ln(4)) + 2 - 3 = 0
# 4*A_coeff - 1 = 0, which means A_coeff = 1/4.

# Step 2: Analyze the integral identity
# The problem asks to find `a` and `b` that satisfy the identity:
# integral from 0 to a of g(x)dx + integral from ln(2) to ln(b) of f(x)dx = a*ln(b)
# where g(x) is the inverse of f(x).
# This identity holds if and only if a = f(ln(b)).

# Step 3: Solve for a and b
# The equation a = (1/4)b^2 + b - 3 has a family of solutions.
# However, the problem asks for a unique value of a+b, implying a specific solution.
# We look for a special point on the solution curve a = f(ln(b)) that is suggested by the problem's conditions.
# One of the conditions is f(ln(2)) = 0.
# Let's choose b such that ln(b) = ln(2), which means b = 2.
# If b = 2, our condition a = f(ln(b)) becomes a = f(ln(2)).
# Since we know f(ln(2)) = 0, this gives a = 0.
