As this is not an option, we must evaluate the provided climatic and physiological factors.")

    # Option B Analysis
    print("Choice B (Drought): Drought stress causes stomata to close to conserve water. This leads to *less* discrimination against the heavier 13C isotope, resulting in an INCREASE in the 13C ratio. This is the opposite of the observed decline. Therefore, B is incorrect.")

    # Options A, C, D Analysis
    print("Choices A, C, D (Age, Starch, Wood Proportion): These are primarily tree-internal physiological factors. While they can influence the 13C ratio, they are less likely to be the *predominant* driver of a consistent, century-long trend compared to a major, external environmental change. They are considered secondary factors or sources of noise in the long-term signal.")

    # Option E Analysis
    print("Choice E (SE Asia Monsoon): The monsoon is a major regional climate driver controlling moisture availability. A stronger, wetter monsoon season allows tree stomata to remain open. Open stomata permit greater discrimination against the 13C isotope during photosynthesis, leading to a DECREASE in the 13C ratio in the resulting wood. A long-term strengthening trend in the monsoon over this period would cause a declining trend in 13C, matching the observation. Among the given choices, this is the most plausible large-scale environmental factor.")
