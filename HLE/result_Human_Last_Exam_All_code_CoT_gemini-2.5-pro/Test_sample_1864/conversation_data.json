    "For a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure the accuracy of your results. This involves controls for setting baseline fluorescence, correcting for spectral overlap (compensation), and accurately defining the boundaries of your target population (gating).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** A fundamental control consisting of your cells/beads without any fluorescent labels. This is used to measure autofluorescence and set initial detector voltages.\n2.  **Compensation Controls:** For a multi-color experiment, you must correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes. This requires a single-stained control for each fluorochrome you are using.\n3.  **Bead-Specific Control:** Since streptavidin beads can sometimes non-specifically bind to fluorescent reagents, it's essential to have a control with just the beads and all your fluorescently labeled antibodies/probes to measure this background.\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For sorting, accurately identifying your positive population is paramount. FMO controls, which include all stains *except* for the one of interest, are the gold standard for setting precise gates, especially when a positive signal is not distinctly separated from the negative.\n\nBased on this plan, the following python code calculates the total number of essential controls for your experiment.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the number of fluorochromes/channels from the user's query\n    num_fluorochromes = 5\n    \n    # 1. Unstained Control: For setting baseline fluorescence.\n    unstained_control = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each fluorochrome.\n    compensation_controls = num_fluorochromes\n    \n    # 3. Bead-Specific Control: For assessing non-specific binding to streptavidin beads.\n    bead_control = 1\n    \n    # 4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: Crucial for accurate gating in sorting.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = unstained_control + compensation_controls + bead_control + fmo_controls\n    \n    # --- Output Section ---\n    print(\"To ensure high-quality data from your five-color sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
