    "To determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore, we need to find its start and end years.\n\n1.  **Start Year**: The war begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* in the year **2504**.\n2.  **End Year**: The war concludes with the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, \"Into the Void,\" which takes place in the year **2508**.\n3.  **Calculation**: To find the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year.\n4.  **Rounding**: The result is an integer, so rounding it up does not change its value.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in 2504 with the events of Wings of Liberty.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war concluded in 2508 with the epilogue of Legacy of the Void.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The problem asks to round up the result.\n# Since the duration is an exact number of years, math.ceil() will not change the value.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(\"The duration of the Second Great War is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total length of the war was {final_duration} years.\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
