    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` followed by a Python script to display the final result.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nIn finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a system is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a neutral scalar field `φ`, this is:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dφ exp(-S_E[φ])`\n\nwhere `S_E[φ]` is the Euclidean action. For a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the action is defined as:\n\n`S_E[φ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ 1/2 (∂_τ φ)² + 1/2 (∇φ)² + 1/2 m² φ² ]`\n\nHere, `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate integrated from `0` to `β` (where `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature), `x` represents the `d` spatial dimensions, `∂_τ` is the derivative with respect to `τ`, and `∇` is the spatial gradient. The numbers `1/2` are the coefficients in the standard Lagrangian density.\n\nThe action is quadratic in the field `φ` and can be expressed in a more compact form using an inner product notation:\n\n`S_E[φ] = 1/2 (φ, D φ)`\n\nHere, `D` is a differential operator, and the inner product `(f, g)` is defined as `∫ dτ d^d x f(x,τ)g(x,τ)`.\n\nTo find the explicit form of the operator `D`, we can perform integration by parts on the derivative terms in the action. Using the periodicity of the field in imaginary time (`φ(0, x) = φ(β, x)`) and assuming the field vanishes at spatial infinity, the boundary terms are zero. This leads to:\n\n`S_E[φ] = 1/2 ∫ dτ d^d x φ [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] φ`\n\nBy comparing this with `S_E[φ] = 1/2 (φ, D φ)`, we can identify the operator `D` as:\n\n`D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nThe inner product `(φ, D_φ)` is therefore `(φ, D_φ) = ∫ dτ d^d x φ D φ`. From the relation `S_E[φ] = 1/2 (φ, D φ)`, we find that the inner product is simply twice the action:\n\n`(φ, D_φ) = 2 * S_E[φ]`\n\nSubstituting the original expression for the action, we get:\n\n`(φ, D_φ) = 2 * ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ 1/2 (∂_τ φ)² + 1/2 (∇φ)² + 1/2 m² φ² ]`\n\nMultiplying by 2 simplifies the expression by removing all `1/2` coefficients:\n\n`(φ, D_φ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ 1*(∂_τ φ)² + 1*(∇φ)² + 1*m² φ² ]`\n\nThe following Python script prints this final equation, clearly showing the numerical coefficients.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the final expression for the inner product (φ, D_φ).\n\n# The numerical coefficients in the final, simplified equation are all 1.\ncoeff1 = 1\ncoeff2 = 1\ncoeff3 = 1\n\n# Construct the output string for the equation.\n# We use unicode characters for a better mathematical representation.\nfinal_equation = f\"(φ, Dφ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ dᵈx⃗  [ {coeff1}⋅(∂_τ φ)² + {coeff2}⋅(∇φ)² + {coeff3}⋅m²φ² ]\"\n\nprint(\"The inner product (φ, D_φ) for a neutral scalar field is given by the following equation:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(final_equation)\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(\"  - φ = φ(τ, x⃗) is the scalar field.\")\nprint(\"  - τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β (inverse temperature).\")\nprint(\"  - x⃗ represents the d spatial dimensions, integrated over all space.\")\nprint(\"  - (∂_τ φ)² is the square of the derivative with respect to imaginary time.\")\nprint(\"  - (∇φ)² is the square of the spatial gradient.\")\nprint(\"  - m is the mass of the field.\")\n```\n<<<(φ, D φ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ (∂_τ φ)² + (∇φ)² + m²φ² ]>>>"
