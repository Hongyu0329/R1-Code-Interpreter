    "Here is a plan to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Equation**: The equation involves a complex variable $z$ and the complex number $i$. The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex power, which needs careful definition.\n2.  **Express $i^z$**: The complex power $a^b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log(a)}$. The complex logarithm $\\log(a)$ is multi-valued. For $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i\\arg(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    So, $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. Each integer $k$ corresponds to a different branch of the function $i^z$. We need to find solutions for any possible choice of $k$.\n3.  **Set up Equations**: Let $z = x+iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We substitute this into the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n    *   The left-hand side (LHS) is: $z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n    *   The right-hand side (RHS) is: $i^z = e^{(x+iy)i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{(xi-y)(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n4.  **Solve for Special Cases**: The resulting system of equations is generally hard to solve. We can find solutions by testing for special cases:\n    *   **Real solutions**: Assume $z$ is a real number, so $y=0$ and $z=x$.\n    *   **Purely imaginary solutions**: Assume $z$ is purely imaginary, so $x=0$ and $z=iy$.\n5.  **Real Solutions ($z=x, y=0$)**:\n    *   LHS = $x \\cdot i$.\n    *   RHS = $i^x = e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)) + i\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$.\n    *   Equating LHS and RHS, the real part of the RHS must be 0: $\\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)) = 0$. This implies the argument must be $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n    *   The imaginary parts must be equal: $x = \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$. Since the argument makes the cosine zero, the sine will be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   This leads to two families of solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$, which can be shown to be solutions for any branch $k$.\n6.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions ($z=iy, x=0$)**:\n    *   LHS = $(iy)i = -y$.\n    *   RHS = $i^{iy} = e^{iy \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n    *   The equation becomes $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n    *   We can show that this equation only has non-zero solutions for $y$ when $k \\le -1$.\n    *   These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function, $W(s)$, which is defined by $s = W(s)e^{W(s)}$. The solutions are given by $y_k = \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n7.  **Coding Solution**:\n    *   Write a Python script to present the solutions.\n    *   For the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, verify that they satisfy the equation using the principal branch ($k=0$).\n    *   For the purely imaginary solutions, loop through several negative values of $k$ (e.g., $k=-1, -2, -3, \\dots$).\n    *   For each $k$, use `scipy.special.lambertw` to compute the value of $y_k$.\n    *   Verify each solution by computing the LHS ($-y_k$) and the RHS ($e^{-y_k(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$) and showing they are equal.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and verifies solutions to the complex equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving for z in the equation z*i = i^z\\n\")\n\n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"--- Real Solutions ---\")\n    \n    # Solution z = 1\n    z1 = 1 + 0j\n    # For z=1, i^1 is typically evaluated using the principal branch k=0\n    # alpha = pi/2 + 2*k*pi.

The solutions can be categorized as follows:\n1.  **Two real solutions**: $z=1$ and $z=-1$. These are solutions for any branch of $i^z$.\n2.  **An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions**: For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k = iy_k$. These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function as $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n3.  There also exist other complex solutions ($z=x+iy$ with $x\\neq0, y\\neq0$), but they are not straightforward to find analytically.\n\nThe provided Python code calculates and verifies the two real solutions and the first five purely imaginary solutions.\n>>>"
