# A symbolic derivation to find the maximum length of a line segment on a unit sphere
# where the unit ball is metrically convex.

# Let p and q be the endpoints of a line segment that lies on the unit sphere S.
# The length of this segment is L = ||p-q||.

# --- Step 1: Properties of the line segment on the sphere ---
# By definition, the endpoints are on the sphere:
norm_p = 1
norm_q = 1

# Since the entire segment is on the sphere, its midpoint m = (p+q)/2 must also be on the sphere.
# Therefore, ||m|| = ||(p+q)/2|| = 1.
# From this, we can deduce the norm of the sum p+q:
# (1/2) * ||p+q|| = 1  =>  ||p+q|| = 2
norm_p_plus_q = 2

print("--- Step 1: Analysis of the line segment ---")
print(f"The endpoints p and q are on the unit sphere, so ||p|| = {norm_p} and ||q|| = {norm_q}.")
print(f"The midpoint is also on the sphere, which implies ||p + q|| = {norm_p_plus_q}.")
print("-" * 40)

# --- Step 2: Using the metric convexity of the unit ball B ---
# The problem states that the unit ball B is metrically convex.
# This means for any u in B, the Menger interval [u, -u] is contained in B.
# The interval is defined as {x : ||u-x|| + ||x+u|| = ||u-(-u)||}.
# If we choose u such that ||u|| = 1, the condition simplifies:
# If ||u-x|| + ||x+u|| = 2, then x must be in B, so ||x|| <= 1.

print("--- Step 2: Applying the metric convexity property ---")
print("The metric convexity of the unit ball implies the following:")
print("If we have a vector u with ||u||=1, and a vector x satisfying:")
print("||u-x|| + ||x+u|| = 2")
print("Then it must be true that ||x|| <= 1.")
print("-" * 40)

# --- Step 3: Combining the properties ---
# Let's choose u and x based on our segment endpoints p and q.
# Let u = (p+q)/2. From Step 1, we know ||u|| = 1.
# Let x = (p-q)/2.
# Now we check if this choice of u and x satisfies the condition from Step 2.

# Calculation:
# u - x = (p+q)/2 - (p-q)/2 = q
# u + x = (p+q)/2 + (p-q)/2 = p
#
# The sum of norms is ||u-x|| + ||x+u|| = ||q|| + ||p||.
sum_of_norms = norm_q + norm_p

print("--- Step 3: Deriving the length constraint ---")
print("We choose u = (p+q)/2 and x = (p-q)/2.")
print(f"We check the sum: ||u-x|| + ||x+u|| = ||q|| + ||p|| = {norm_q} + {norm_p} = {sum_of_norms}.")

# Since the sum is 2, the condition from Step 2 applies to x.
# Therefore, ||x|| <= 1.
# Substituting x = (p-q)/2, we get: ||(p-q)/2|| <= 1.
# This can be rewritten as: (1/2) * ||p-q|| <= 1.

inequality_lhs_factor = 0.5
inequality_rhs = 1

# Let L be the length of the segment, L = ||p-q||.
# The inequality is 0.5 * L <= 1.
# Solving for L gives: L <= 1 / 0.5 = 2.
max_L = inequality_rhs / inequality_lhs_factor

print("\nThe sum is 2, so the condition holds. This means ||x|| <= 1.")
print("Substituting x, we get the final equation for the length L = ||p-q||:")
print(f"||(p-q)/2|| <= {inequality_rhs}")
print(f"{inequality_lhs_factor} * ||p-q|| <= {inequality_rhs}")
print(f"L <= {inequality_rhs} / {inequality_lhs_factor}")
print("-" * 40)

# --- Step 4: Final conclusion ---
# The derivation shows the length L must be less than or equal to 2.
# Norms such as the L1-norm or L-infinity norm have metrically convex unit balls
# and feature line segments of length 2 on their unit spheres.
# Therefore, the largest possible length is 2.
print("--- Step 4: Conclusion ---")
print(f"The maximum possible length of the segment is {max_L}.")
print("\nThe final derived equation is:")
print(f"Length <= {int(max_L)}")
