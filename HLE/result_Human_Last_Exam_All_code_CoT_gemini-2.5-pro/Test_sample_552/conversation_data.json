    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a historical question. I will provide you with a Python script that will print the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the key historical figure whose work on statistical mechanics was a direct and primary influence on Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. While Einstein's paper does not cite \"lectures\" in the way a modern paper might, it is built upon the foundational principles developed by this physicist.\n2.  I will store the name of this scientist and the year of the paper in variables within the Python code.\n3.  Finally, the script will print a clear sentence that answers your question, including the number from the year for completeness.\n\n```python\ndef find_influential_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose work\n    was a major influence on Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The year of Einstein's paper on Brownian motion\n    year = 1905\n    \n    # The scientist whose work in statistical mechanics provided the foundation for Einstein's paper.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    \n    print(f\"Albert Einstein's paper on Brownian motion in the year {year} was built upon the foundations of statistical mechanics.\")\n    print(\"While he did not cite 'lectures' directly, his work was heavily influenced by the principles developed by:\")\n    print(scientist_name)\n\nfind_influential_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
