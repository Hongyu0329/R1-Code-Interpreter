# The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3
# is a topic in the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations.
#
# The full group of symmetries is technically infinite-dimensional. This is due to
# a "gauge-like" symmetry related to the pressure term. Specifically, if (v, P)
# is a solution, then so is (v, P + c(t)) for any arbitrary smooth function c(t),
# since the gradient of c(t) is zero.
#
# However, the question is typically interpreted as asking for the dimension of the
# maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries, which is often
# referred to as the "principal Lie algebra". This algebra corresponds to physically
# significant transformations.
#
# We can find this dimension by counting the number of independent infinitesimal
# generators for these transformations. The generators are categorized as follows:

# 1. Time translation: The equations are autonomous in time.
# t -> t + s
dim_time_translation = 1

# 2. Space translations: The equations are homogeneous in space.
# x -> x + a
dim_space_translations = 3

# 3. Spatial rotations: The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).
# x -> R*x, v -> R*v (where R is a rotation matrix)
dim_rotations = 3

# 4. Galilean boosts: Transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame.
# x -> x + c*t, v -> v + c
dim_galilean_boosts = 3

# 5. Scaling (Dilation): A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure
# leaves the equations invariant.
# t -> a^2*t, x -> a*x, v -> a^-1*v, P -> a^-2*P
dim_scaling = 1

# 6. Constant pressure shift: The pressure can be shifted by an arbitrary constant.
# P -> P + C. This is the one-dimensional remnant of the infinite-dimensional
# gauge symmetry that is included in the finite-dimensional algebra.
dim_pressure_shift = 1

# The total dimension of the principal Lie algebra is the sum of the dimensions
# of these individual symmetry groups.
