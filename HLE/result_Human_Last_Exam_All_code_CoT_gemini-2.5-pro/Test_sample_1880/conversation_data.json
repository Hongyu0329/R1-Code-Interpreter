    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I will determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Eisenstein's criterion is a suitable method for this.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial provides crucial information. I will calculate it using the standard formula for a quartic polynomial. I will then check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This determines if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with the quartic. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., whether it has a rational root) is the next critical piece of information for classifying the group.\n4.  **Determine the Galois Group and its Order**: By combining the results from the previous steps—specifically, the irreducibility of the polynomial, whether the discriminant is a square, and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic—I can identify the specific Galois group. The order of this group is the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing the calculations and reasoning at each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # For the form x^4 + px^2 + qx + r, the coefficients are p=0, q=8, r=14.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(\"Computing the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q using Eisenstein's criterion\n    print(\"Step 1: Irreducibility Check\")\n    prime = 2\n    print(f\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = {prime}:\")\n    print(\"1.
