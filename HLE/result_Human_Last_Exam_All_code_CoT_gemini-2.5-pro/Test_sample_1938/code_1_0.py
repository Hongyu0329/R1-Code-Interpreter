# The target probability of Alice winning.
p = 0.95

# The equation for q_0^4 is derived from the self-consistency equation:
# p = 1 - (1 - q_0^4 * p^3)^3
# We solve for q_0 with p = 0.95.

# Numerator of the expression for q_0^4: 1 - (1 - p)^(1/3)
numerator = 1 - (1 - p)**(1/3)

# Denominator of the expression for q_0^4: p^3
denominator = p**3

# Calculate q_0^4
q0_pow_4 = numerator / denominator

# Calculate q_0
q0 = q0_pow_4**(1/4)

# Calculate the final result as per the problem statement
final_result = math.floor(100 * q0)

# Output the numbers involved in the calculation
