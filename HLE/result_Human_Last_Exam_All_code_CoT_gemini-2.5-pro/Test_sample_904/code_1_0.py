    This function prints the derived coefficients A(r) and B(r) for the
    governing linear equation of the fluid interface.

    The derivation is based on minimizing the total energy of the system
    (surface energy + electrostatic potential energy) using the Euler-Lagrange
    equation, followed by linearization for small interface displacements.
    A key step is recognizing that the surface tension gamma is a function of
    the radial position r, i.e., gamma(r), because it is controlled by the
    electric field which varies with r.
