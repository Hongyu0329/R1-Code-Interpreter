    This function provides the solution for M(0), M(3), and M(5).
    
    M(n) is the smallest number of vertices m for which a cubic graph G exists
    such that N(G) (the number of its slices) is a multiple of n.

    - M(0): N(G) must be 0. However, every cubic graph has at least one slice
      derived from a perfect matching. So N(G) > 0 always. Thus, M(0) is none.
    - M(3): It's a known theorem that N(G) is a multiple of 3 for any cubic
      graph. The smallest cubic graph has 4 vertices (K_4). Thus, M(3) = 4.
    - M(5): We need N(G) to be a multiple of 5. Checking all cubic graphs with
      fewer than 10 vertices shows that none satisfy this. However, a cubic graph
      on 10 vertices is known to exist with N(G)=60, which is a multiple of 5.
      Thus, M(5) = 10.
