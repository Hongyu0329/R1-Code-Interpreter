    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces required to construct the canonical Red-Blue-Hackenbush game for the value $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the type of number:** The number $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a dyadic rational, as it can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$. Here, the numerator is $m=13$ and the denominator is $16 = 2^4$, so $k=4$.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for game complexity:** For a non-integer dyadic rational number $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ (where $m$ is odd), there's a known formula for the number of edges (pieces) in its canonical Hackenbush representation. The formula is:\n    $N = (k + 1) + v_2(m - 1) + v_2(m + 1)$\n    where:\n    *   $N$ is the total number of pieces.\n    *   $k$ is the exponent of 2 in the denominator.\n    *   $m$ is the odd numerator.\n    *   $v_2(n)$ is the valuation of $n$ at prime 2, which is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides $n$. This is equivalent to counting the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of $n$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the components of the formula:**\n    *   For $\\frac{13}{16}$, we have $m = 13$ and $k = 4$.\n    *   Calculate $k+1$.\n    *   Calculate $v_2(m-1) = v_2(12)$.\n    *   Calculate $v_2(m+1) = v_2(14)$.\n\n4.  **Sum the components:** Add the three parts together to get the total number of pieces.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef v2(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 2-adic valuation of n.\n    This is the number of times n is divisible by 2, or the number of trailing\n    zeros in its binary representation.\n    Returns 0 if n is 0 or odd.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        # The valuation of 0 is sometimes considered infinite.\n        # For this formula's context, let's assume it doesn't apply or is 0.\n        # Given m is odd and > 1, m-1 and m+1 will be non-zero.\n        return 0\n    # (n & -n) isolates the lowest set bit. log2 gives its position.\n    return int(math.log2(n & -n))\n\n# Given fraction 13/16\nm = 13\ndenominator = 16\n\n# 1. Find k such that denominator = 2^k\nk = int(math.log2(denominator))\n\n# 2. Calculate the components of the formula N = (k+1) + v2(m-1) + v2(m+1)\nk_plus_1 = k + 1\nm_minus_1 = m - 1\nm_plus_1 = m + 1\n\nv2_m_minus_1 = v2(m_minus_1)\nv2_m_plus_1 = v2(m_plus_1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total number of pieces\ntotal_pieces = k_plus_1 + v2_m_minus_1 + v2_m_plus_1\n\n# 4. Print the final result and the equation\nprint(f\"The number of pieces for 13/16 is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"N = (k + 1) + v2(m - 1) + v2(m + 1)\")\nprint(f\"k = log2({denominator}) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"m = {m}\")\nprint(f\"v2(m - 1) = v2({m_minus_1}) = {v2_m_minus_1}\")\nprint(f\"v2(m + 1) = v2({m_plus_1}) = {v2_m_plus_1}\")\nprint(f\"Total Pieces = ({k} + 1) + {v2_m_minus_1} + {v2_m_plus_1} = {k_plus_1} + {v2_m_minus_1} + {v2_m_plus_1} = {total_pieces}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
