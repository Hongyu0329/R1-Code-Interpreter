    "My plan is to solve this chess puzzle by following these steps:\n1.  First, I will determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Next, I will figure out the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any bishop attacking another. A good strategy is to use the squares on the outermost columns ('a' and 'h'), as bishops on the same column don't attack each other. I will then identify and resolve any attacks between bishops on column 'a' and column 'h'.\n3.  Finally, I will calculate the number of empty edge squares by subtracting the maximum number of bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n4.  The Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_on_edge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many edge squares on a chessboard would lack bishops\n    if the maximum number of non-attacking bishops were placed on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\n    # An 8x8 board has 64 squares. The inner 6x6 grid has 36 squares.\n    # So, the number of edge squares is 64 - 36 = 28.\n    # Alternatively, it's 4 sides of 8 squares minus the 4 double-counted corners: 4*8 - 4 = 28.\n    total_edge_squares = 28\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # A simple and optimal configuration is to use the first and last columns ('a' and 'h').\n    # All 16 squares on these two columns are edge squares.\n    # Bishops on the same column cannot attack each other.\n    # We only need to check for attacks between column 'a' and column 'h'.\n    # A bishop at (a1) attacks (h8). A bishop at (a8) attacks (h1).\n    # These are the only two pairs of attacking bishops in this configuration.\n    # To resolve these two conflicts, we must remove one bishop from each pair.\n    # For example, we can remove the bishops at a1 and a8.\n    # This leaves 16 - 2 = 14 non-attacking bishops. This is the maximum.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = 14\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    # This is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\n    print(\"This problem asks for the number of empty edge squares when the maximum number of non-attacking bishops are placed.\")\n    print(f\"Total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board: {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"Maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these edge squares: {max_bishops_on_edge}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total minus the number of bishops placed:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_on_edge()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
