    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers. This involves forming a composite matrix by stacking the two matrices and then using elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a simpler form.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two polynomial matrices, `P1` and `P2`, using the `sympy` library in Python.\n2.  Create a single augmented matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n3.  Apply a sequence of elementary row operations to `M`. These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying `M` by unimodular matrices. The goal is to transform `M` into a block matrix of the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a square matrix and `0` is a zero matrix.\n4.  The resulting matrix `G` will be a greatest common right divisor of `P1` and `P2`.\n5.  The Python code will perform these row operations step-by-step and print the final resulting GCRD matrix.\n\nThe elementary row operations used are:\n*   Swapping two rows.\n*   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n*   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nThe process will systematically use pivot rows to reduce the polynomial degrees of elements in other rows, eventually leading to the simplified form containing the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set up the symbolic variable and matrices\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s], [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # The GCRD is found by forming an augmented matrix M = [P1; P2] and\n    # reducing it to the form [G; 0] using elementary row operations.\n\n    # Form the augmented matrix M\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # Step 1: Use row 3 (original M[2,:]) to reduce rows 1 and 2.\n    # R1_new = R1 - (s+1)*R3\n    M.row_op(0, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - (s + 1) * M[2, j]))\n    # R2_new = R2 + s*R3\n    M.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M[2, j]))\n\n    # Step 2: Use row 3 to reduce row 4.\n    # R4_new = R4 + R3\n    M.row_op(3, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + M[2, j]))\n    \n    # At this point, the matrix is:\n    # [  0   ,   -s  ]\n    # [ -1   ,  s**2 ]\n    # [  s   ,    0  ]\n    # [ -1   ,    1  ]\n\n    # Step 3: Reorder rows to bring simpler rows (with constants) to the top for pivoting.\n    M = sympy.Matrix([M.row(3), M.row(1), M.row(2), M.row(0)])\n    \n    # At this point, the matrix is:\n    # [ -1   ,    1  ]\n    # [ -1   ,  s**2 ]\n    # [  s   ,    0  ]\n    # [  0   ,   -s  ]\n\n    # Step 4: Use the new row 1 ([-1, 1]) to eliminate elements in the first column.\n    # R2_new = R2 - R1\n    M.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - M[0, j]))\n    # R3_new = R3 + s*R1\n    M.row_op(2, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M[0, j]))\n\n    # At this point, the matrix is:\n    # [ -1   ,     1    ]\n    # [  0   , s**2 - 1 ]\n    # [  0   ,     s    ]\n    # [  0   ,    -s    ]\n\n    # Step 5: Use row with [0, s] to simplify the second column.
