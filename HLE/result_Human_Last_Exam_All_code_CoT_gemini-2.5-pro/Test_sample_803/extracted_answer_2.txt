The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are precisely the semidirect products $G = Q \rtimes C_2$, where:
1.  $Q$ is a nonabelian Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$ (which requires its order $q^m$ to have $m \ge 3$).
2.  The action of the generator of $C_2$ on $Q$ is given by a non-trivial automorphism $\phi \in \text{Aut}(Q)$ of order 2.
3.  The set of elements in $Q$ that are inverted by this automorphism, $K = \{u \in Q \mid \phi(u) = u^{-1}\}$, is a non-abelian set. That is, there exist at least two elements in $K$ that do not commute.
