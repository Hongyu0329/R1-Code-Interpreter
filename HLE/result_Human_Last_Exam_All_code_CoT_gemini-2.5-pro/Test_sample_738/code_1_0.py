# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instructions.
# These are the different commands the rover can receive.
stop_instructions = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the minimum number of bits required to store one instruction.
# To represent N unique states, we need ceil(log2(N)) bits.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(total_distinct_instructions))

# Step 3: Determine the total number of instructions for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds long.
# We convert this duration to Earth minutes.
total_minutes_in_sol = (24 * 60) + 39 + (35.244 / 60)

# An instruction is sent each Earth minute. To cover the entire Martian day,
# we need to round up the total minutes to the next whole number.
total_instructions_for_day = math.ceil(total_minutes_in_sol)

# Step 4: Calculate the total memory size in bits and then convert to bytes.
total_bits = total_instructions_for_day * bits_per_instruction
# There are 8 bits in a byte.
total_bytes = total_bits / 8

# Final Output
