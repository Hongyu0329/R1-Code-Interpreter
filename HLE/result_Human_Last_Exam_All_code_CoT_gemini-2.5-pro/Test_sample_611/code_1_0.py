    # Step 1: Characterize V_n
    # V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by a sausage from a conditioned Brownian motion.
    # V_n = |B_n intersect S| / |B_n|, where S is the sausage.
    # By an ergodic principle, V_n converges in probability to the asymptotic density of the sausage.
    # We will estimate this density.

    # Step 2: Estimate the time T_n spent by the process X_t in the disk B_n.
    # The radial part of the process, R_t = |X_t|, has dynamics similar to a 2D Bessel process,
    # for which the time to reach a radius 'r' is on the order of r^2.
    # The disk B_n = {z: |z-n| <= n/3} is roughly contained in an annulus from r_1 = 2n/3 to r_2 = 4n/3.
    # The time to cross this annulus is proportional to r_2^2 - r_1^2, which is proportional to n^2.
    # The time T_n spent inside B_n is also proportional to n^2.
    # Let's represent this as: T_n = k * n^2 for some constant k > 0.
    print("Step 1: The time T_n spent in the disk B_n is of the order n^2.")

    # Step 3: Estimate the area of the sausage generated during this time.
    # The process is locally like a standard 2D Brownian Motion because its diffusive component
    # dominates its drift component for large n.
    # The area of a radius-1 sausage generated by a 2D Brownian Motion over a time T is
    # A(T) ~ pi * T / ln(T).
    # So, the area of the sausage created inside B_n is approximately:
    # Area_sausage_n ~ pi * T_n / ln(T_n) ~ pi * (k * n^2) / ln(k * n^2).
    # For large n, ln(k*n^2) = ln(k) + 2*ln(n), which is dominated by 2*ln(n).
    print("Step 2: The area of the sausage generated in this time is A(T_n) ~ pi * T_n / ln(T_n).")

    # Step 4: Calculate the limit of V_n.
    # The area of the disk B_n is |B_n| = pi * (n/3)^2 = pi * n^2 / 9.
    # V_n = Area_sausage_n / |B_n|
    # V_n ~ (pi * k * n^2 / (ln(k) + 2*ln(n))) / (pi * n^2 / 9)
    # V_n ~ (9 * k * n^2) / (n^2 * (ln(k) + 2*ln(n)))
    # V_n ~ (9 * k) / (ln(k) + 2*ln(n))
    print("Step 3: The relative area V_n is the ratio of sausage area to disk area.")
    print("V_n ~ (9*k) / (ln(k) + 2*ln(n)).")

    # Step 5: Find the limit of V_n and the final probability.
