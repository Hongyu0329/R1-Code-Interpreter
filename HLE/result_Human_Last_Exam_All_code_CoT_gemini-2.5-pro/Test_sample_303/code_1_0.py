    print("The script is written in the esoteric programming language 'Chef'.")
    print("Its goal is to compute Fibonacci numbers using a recursive recipe called 'Caramel Sauce'.")

    print("Step 2: Identifying the Critical Error")
    print("The 'Caramel Sauce' recipe is supposed to be recursive, meaning it calls itself.")
    print("Indeed, its method contains the line 'Serve with caramel sauce' twice. These are the recursive calls.")
    print("However, a valid recursive function must have a 'base case' - a condition where it stops calling itself.")
    print("The script lacks any conditional logic (like an 'if' statement) to create a base case.")
    print("This means the 'Caramel Sauce' recipe will call itself unconditionally and endlessly.")

    print("Options A, B, C, D, E, and H are minor changes that do not add a base case or fix the core logical flaw.")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("Removing the 'Serve with caramel sauce.' line eliminates the recursive call.")
    print("This is the only option that fixes the fatal error of infinite recursion, allowing the program to terminate.")
    print("Although this change also means the recipe no longer works recursively as intended, the original script was so fundamentally broken that it couldn't work at all. Fixing the termination error is the most critical step.")
    print("Therefore, removing the line that causes the infinite loop is the correct answer.")
