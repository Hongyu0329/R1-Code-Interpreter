    # The problem seeks the smallest 'z' for the equation A = z*B - C.
    # A: A correlation matrix (positive semidefinite, unit diagonal).
    # B: A "nice" matrix (covariance matrix of unbiased +-1 Bernoulli random variables).
    # C: A positive semidefinite matrix.
    # The equation is equivalent to finding the smallest z such that for any correlation matrix A,
    # there exists a "nice" matrix B for which z*B - A is positive semidefinite.

    # of matrices xx^T where x is a vector of +-1s.
