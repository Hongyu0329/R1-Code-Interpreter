    "To calculate the integral of the given piecewise function from $x=0$ to $x=4$, we must split the integral at the point where the function's definition changes, which is at $x=3$.\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I = \\int_0^4 p(x) dx = \\int_0^3 p(x) dx + \\int_3^4 p(x) dx$\n\nFor the interval $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$.\nThe first part of the integral is:\n$I_1 = \\int_0^3 \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n\nFor the interval $3 \\le x \\le 4$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$.\nThe second part of the integral is:\n$I_2 = \\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$\n\nWe will use a Python script to compute the numerical values of both integrals and then sum them up to get the final answer. The script will leverage the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for high-precision numerical integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p1(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = 2x^3 / 8 for 0 <= x <= 3\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p2(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = e^x(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x) for 3 <= x <= 5\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use np functions for vectorization and numerical stability\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part, from x = 0 to x = 3\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part, from x = 3 to x = 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of the integrals over the two intervals.\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3 = {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4 = {integral2}\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4695500133959>>>"
