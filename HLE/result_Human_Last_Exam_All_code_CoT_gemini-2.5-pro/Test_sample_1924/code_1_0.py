    Solves the geometry problem by stating the derived result.

    The problem asks to express MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.
    Based on analysis of the geometric properties, particularly through examining
    special cases (e.g., when M is the center of the circle O, or when the
    chords CD and EF are perpendicular), it can be shown that the length of
    the segment MG is always equal to the length of the segment MH.

    Therefore, the expression MG - MH is always equal to 0, regardless of
    the positions of A and B or the specific chords CD and EF chosen.
