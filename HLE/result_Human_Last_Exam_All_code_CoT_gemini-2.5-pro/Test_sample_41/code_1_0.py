def find_most_negative_factor():

    This function identifies the number in the provided dataset that has the
    greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis.

    The analysis shows an environment with extreme kinematic support (shear, helicity)
    and strong thermodynamic instability (CAPE). The primary inhibiting factor
    is Convective Inhibition (CINH), which acts as a "cap" preventing storms
    from initiating.

    The Surface-based CINH (SFC CINH) is -38 J/kg. This represents a barrier
    that must be overcome for a surface-based storm to form. In an otherwise
    explosive environment, this cap is the most significant obstacle to
    tornadogenesis.
