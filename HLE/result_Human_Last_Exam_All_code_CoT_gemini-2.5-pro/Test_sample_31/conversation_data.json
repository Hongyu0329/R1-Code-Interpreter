    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum amount of information required to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases is present. A PLL case is defined by the permutation of the 4 top-layer corners and 4 top-layer edges.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Information Needed:** To identify the PLL case, we must know the exact permutation of all 8 pieces on the last layer (4 corners and 4 edges).\n\n2.  **Parity Constraint:** A key property of the Rubik's Cube is that the parity of the corner permutation must always match the parity of the edge permutation. An even corner permutation implies an even edge permutation, and an odd corner permutation implies an odd edge permutation. We can use this rule to our advantage.\n\n3.  **Identifying Corners:** A corner piece has 2 non-top-facing stickers. To uniquely identify a corner piece and its position, we must see both of these stickers. To know the complete permutation of the 4 corners, we only need to identify 3 of them. Once 3 corners are located, the position of the 4th is automatically known.\n    *   Number of corner stickers to see = 3 corners Ã— 2 stickers/corner = 6 stickers.\n\n4.  **Identifying Edges:** An edge piece has 1 non-top-facing sticker. To identify an edge piece and its position, we must see this sticker. Naively, we would need to identify 3 edges (requiring 3 stickers) to know the full edge permutation. However, we can use the parity rule.\n\n5.  **Using Parity:** If we determine the full corner permutation (using 6 stickers), we know its parity (whether it's an even or odd permutation). By the parity rule, the edge permutation must have the same parity.\n\n6.  **Reducing Edge Information:** If we identify just 2 edge pieces (requiring 2 stickers), we know their positions. The remaining 2 edges must be in the remaining 2 slots. This leaves only two possibilities: they are in their correct slots, or they are swapped. A swap changes the parity of the permutation. Since we already know the required parity from the corners, only one of these two possibilities is valid.\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Stickers to fully determine the corner permutation: 6\n    *   Stickers to determine the edge permutation up to a single, parity-resolvable swap: 2\n    *   Total minimum stickers = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_min_pll_stickers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Determine stickers needed for the corner permutation ---\n    \n    # There are 4 corners in the last layer.\n    num_corners = 4\n    # To determine the permutation of N items, we only need to locate N-1 of them.\n    # The position of the last item is then fixed.\n    corners_to_identify = num_corners - 1\n    \n    # Each corner piece has 2 non-top-facing (side) stickers.\n    stickers_per_corner = 2\n    \n    # Calculate the number of stickers needed to identify the corner permutation.\n    corner_stickers_needed = corners_to_identify * stickers_per_corner\n    \n    print(f\"To determine the corner permutation of {num_corners} pieces, we need to identify {corners_to_identify}.\")\n    print(f\"Stickers needed for corners = {corners_to_identify} corners * {stickers_per_corner} stickers/corner = {corner_stickers_needed}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Determine stickers needed for the edge permutation using parity ---\n\n    # There are 4 edges in the last layer.\n    num_edges = 4\n    # By determining the full corner permutation, we know its parity.\n    # The edge permutation must have the same parity.\n    # We only need to identify N-2 edges.
