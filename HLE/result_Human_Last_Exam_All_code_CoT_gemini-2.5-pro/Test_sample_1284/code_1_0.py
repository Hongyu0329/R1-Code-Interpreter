    This function determines the smallest dimension n for which the given inequality fails.

    The inequality is:
    ||E f||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_eps * R^eps * ||f||_2

    The failure of this inequality depends on the dimension n. According to the analysis of
    anisotropic ("plate") counterexamples, the ratio ||E f|| / ||f||_2 can be shown
    to scale like R^exponent, where the exponent depends on n.

    The exponent can be calculated as (n-2)/8.
    For the inequality to fail, this exponent must be strictly positive.
    We are looking for the smallest integer n >= 2 for which (n-2)/8 > 0.
