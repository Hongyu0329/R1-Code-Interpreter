# The problem asks for the value of the limit inferior, which is a known result in number theory.
# For the ring of integers Z, the limit is given by Landau's theorem as e^(-gamma),
# where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
# The same result holds for the affine function ring R of a global function field.
# The value is independent of the characteristic q, genus g, or class number h.

# Value of Euler-Mascheroni constant
gamma = math.gamma

# The final equation is lim = e^(-gamma). We will compute this value.
result = math.exp(-gamma)
