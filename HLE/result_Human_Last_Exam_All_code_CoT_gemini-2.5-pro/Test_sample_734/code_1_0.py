    explanation = """
The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).

His specialized terminology centered around the concept of "seminal reasons" (in Latin, *rationes seminales*), which can be thought of as causal principles or latent potentialities that God embedded within creation from the very beginning.

1.  **The Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that the virgin birth was not a violation of nature's laws, but the actualization of a potential that God had placed within creation. In his view, God's power could activate these hidden potentials, making the miracle an event that worked through a higher, hidden natural law rather than against the established one.

2.  **The Fall:** Likewise, the negative changes in the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing "thorns and thistles," human mortality) could be understood as the activation of dormant negative potentials. Sin did not cause God to arbitrarily change the laws, but rather it triggered a shift in how nature functioned based on these pre-existing, embedded principles.

This framework allowed Augustine to maintain that God's single, perfect act of creation contained the potential for all subsequent events, including both miracles and the consequences of sin.
