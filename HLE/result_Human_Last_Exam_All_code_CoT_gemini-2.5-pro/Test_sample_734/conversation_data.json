    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the core elements of the question: a specific Christian theologian, the development of \"specialized terminology,\" and the application of this terminology to both the virgin birth and changes in nature at the Fall.\n2.  I will search through prominent theologians like Augustine, Aquinas, and others to see whose work best fits this unique combination of ideas.\n3.  The theologian who most clearly fits this description is Augustine of Hippo, particularly with his concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons).\n4.  I will then construct a Python script. The script will use a print statement to output a detailed explanation of who the theologian is and how his specific terminology applies to both the virgin birth and the Fall, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the theologian who developed terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\n\nHis specialized terminology centered around the concept of \"seminal reasons\" (in Latin, *rationes seminales*), which can be thought of as causal principles or latent potentialities that God embedded within creation from the very beginning.\n\n1.  **The Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that the virgin birth was not a violation of nature's laws, but the actualization of a potential that God had placed within creation. In his view, God's power could activate these hidden potentials, making the miracle an event that worked through a higher, hidden natural law rather than against the established one.\n\n2.  **The Fall:** Likewise, the negative changes in the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing \"thorns and thistles,\" human mortality) could be understood as the activation of dormant negative potentials. Sin did not cause God to arbitrarily change the laws, but rather it triggered a shift in how nature functioned based on these pre-existing, embedded principles.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to maintain that God's single, perfect act of creation contained the potential for all subsequent events, including both miracles and the consequences of sin.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
