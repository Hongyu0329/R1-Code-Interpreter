# Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports?
# Reasoning: The definition of cross 1-intersecting families requires that for any
# multiset F in family F and any multiset G in family G, their intersection
# |F intersect G| must be at least 1. If there existed a multiset F_0 in F and
# a multiset G_0 in G that had disjoint supports, they would share no elements.
# This would mean |F_0 intersect G_0| = 0, which violates the condition.
# Therefore, this is not possible for any cross 1-intersecting families,
# including sum maximal ones.
answer_a = "No"

# Part (b): If k=2 and m=5, what is |F|+|G| for sum maximal cross 1-intersecting families?
# We assume the families F and G are non-empty, a standard convention in such problems.

# A key result in extremal combinatorics for multisets (an extension of the
# Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem) states that for non-empty cross t-intersecting families
# F, G, if m >= k+t, the maximal sum is |F| + |G| <= 2 * C(m+k-t-1, k-t).
# First, we check the condition m >= k+t.
# 5 >= 2 + 1  => 5 >= 3. The condition is satisfied.
# The maximal sum is achieved when F and G are identical "full star" families,
# i.e., all k-multisets that contain a specific fixed element.
n_comb = m + k - t - 1
k_comb = k - t
comb_val = combinations(n_comb, k_comb)
max_sum = 2 * comb_val
answer_b = int(max_sum)

# Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element to achieve maximality?
# Reasoning: This asks if the optimal families must have the "full star" structure.
# While the "full star" structure is optimal, it is not always uniquely optimal.
# Specifically, for the boundary case m = k+1 (with t=1), other families can also
# achieve the maximal sum.
# Counterexample: Let m=3, k=2. Here m = k+1.
# The maximal sum is 2 * C(3+2-2, 2-1) = 2 * C(3, 1) = 6.
# A "full star" family, e.g., S_1 = {{1,1}, {1,2}, {1,3}}, has size 3. Taking F=G=S_1
# gives the maximal sum 3+3=6.
# However, consider the family H = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}}. This is the family of all
# 2-element *sets* on [3]. It is an intersecting family, so F=G=H is cross-intersecting.
# The sum |F|+|G| = 3+3 = 6, which is also maximal.
# But H is not a full star family (e.g., it's missing {1,1} from S_1).
# Since a case exists where maximality is achieved by a non-star family, the answer is no.
