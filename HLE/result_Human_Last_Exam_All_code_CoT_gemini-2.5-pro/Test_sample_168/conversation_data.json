    "My plan is to determine which of the listed animals has the auditory capability to detect very low-frequency sounds, such as those produced by muscle contractions. I will analyze the hearing range of each animal and select the one best suited for this task. Finally, I will present this information within a Python script that explains the reasoning as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_with_super_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing capabilities of different animals to determine\n    which one could potentially hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the type of sound.\n    # Human muscle twitches produce very faint, low-frequency sounds (infrasound),\n    # which are below the typical human hearing range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.\n    print(\"Analyzing the hearing ranges of the given animals:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each animal's hearing.\n    # We represent the choices with letters A through E.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Dog: Hears high frequencies (ultrasound) well, but low-frequency hearing is similar to humans.',\n        'B': 'Bat: Specializes in extremely high-frequency ultrasound for echolocation.',\n        'C': 'Herring: Possesses a unique auditory system connecting its swim bladder to its inner ear.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
