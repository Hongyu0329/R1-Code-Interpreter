    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of combinatorics. A \"cap set\" in an n-dimensional vector space over the field of 3 elements, $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, is a set of points such that no three are collinear. The size of the largest cap set is a difficult open problem.\n\nLower bounds for the size of cap sets are established by explicitly constructing a cap set of a certain size. While simple constructions (like the product of smaller cap sets) can provide decent bounds, the best-known bounds often come from more sophisticated and recent mathematical research.\n\nThe following Python script will explain the context and provide the best-known lower bound for dimension 8 based on current literature.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_cap_set_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set\n    in the 8-dimensional vector space over the field of 3 elements, AG(8, 3).\n\n    This value is not derived from a simple calculation but is the result of\n    dedicated mathematical research and complex constructions.\n    \"\"\"\n    dimension = 8\n    \n    # The best known lower bounds for cap sets are found through construction.\n    # While simple constructions exist, like the product construction r_3(n+m) >= r_3(n)*r_3(m),\n    # which would give r_3(8) >= r_3(6)*r_3(2) = 112 * 4 = 448, better constructions have been found.\n    # The current record for dimension 8 was established by Elsholtz and PÃ¡lfy in 2022.\n\n    best_known_lower_bound = 496\n\n    print(f\"The problem asks for the best known lower bound on the size of a cap set in dimension {dimension}.\")\n    print(f\"Based on recent mathematical research, a cap set of size {best_known_lower_bound} has been constructed in this space.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the best known lower bound is {best_known_lower_bound}.\")\n\nfind_cap_set_lower_bound()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
