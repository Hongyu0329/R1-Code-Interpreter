# Given constants
alpha = 10**16
# R is given as ln(100/99)
# We can calculate it, but e^R - 1 is simpler to derive analytically first.
# R = math.log(100/99)
# eR = math.exp(R) # This is 100/99
# eR_minus_1 = eR - 1 # This is 1/99
eR_minus_1 = 1/99

# The solvability condition leads to the equation:
# t0^2 / 3 * (e^R - 1) = alpha
# t0^2 = 3 * alpha / (e^R - 1)
numerator = 3 * alpha
denominator = eR_minus_1
t0_squared = numerator / denominator

# We need the positive value of t0
t0 = math.sqrt(t0_squared)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is t0 = sqrt(3 * alpha / (e^R - 1))
