    This function analyzes the clinical case and determines the most likely root cause.

    The patient's initial symptoms (agitation, hypersexuality, etc.) are characteristic of a manic episode,
    often associated with Bipolar Disorder. The standard treatment for this is Lithium.
    A common and significant side effect of Lithium is hypothyroidism.
    Hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of decreased libido and sexual dysfunction.
    Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is:
    Mania -> Lithium prescription -> Lithium-induced hypothyroidism -> Sexual dysfunction.
