    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n\nFirst, I will identify a list of rivers mentioned in the epic poem. Then, I will find their real-world approximate lengths. Finally, I will write a Python script to sort these rivers by length and display the top three.\n\n1.  **Nile (*Nilus*)**: Mentioned on the shield of Aeneas in Book VIII, depicting the Battle of Actium. Length: ~6,650 km.\n2.  **Danube (*Ister*)**: Mentioned in Book VIII on Aeneas's shield as a nation conquered by Rome. Length: ~2,850 km.\n3.  **Euphrates**: Also depicted on the shield in Book VIII as one of the conquered rivers in Augustus's triumph. Length: ~2,800 km.\n4.  **Tigris**: Another major river of the East, often associated with the Euphrates. Mentioned in Book VI by Anchises. Length: ~1,900 km.\n5.  **Rhine (*Rhenus*)**: Mentioned in Book VIII on the shield. Length: ~1,233 km.\n6.  **Po (*Eridanus*)**: Mentioned several times, notably in Book VI in the underworld. Length: ~652 km.\n7.  **Tiber (*Tiberis*)**: The main river in the second half of the epic, flowing through Latium. Length: ~406 km.\n\nThe script below will process this data and output the three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    It stores a list of these rivers and their approximate lengths, sorts them,\n    and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples containing (River Name, Length in km)\n    # Sources for mentions are in Virgil's Aeneid, primarily Books VI and VIII.\n    rivers = [\n        (\"Nile\", 6650),\n        (\"Danube\", 2850),\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800),\n        (\"Tigris\", 1900),\n        (\"Rhine\", 1233),\n        (\"Po\", 652),\n        (\"Tiber\", 406)\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order\n    # The key=lambda item: item[1] tells sorted() to use the second element (length) for sorting\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, river in enumerate(top_three):\n        # The output format is \"1.
