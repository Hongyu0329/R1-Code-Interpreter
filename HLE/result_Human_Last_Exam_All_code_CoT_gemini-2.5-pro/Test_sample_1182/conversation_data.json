    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ over the prime $p=2$. This is a problem in arithmetic geometry. The number of double points can be determined by analyzing how the branch points of the curve cluster together in the 2-adic metric.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the genus of the curve.** The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. Its genus $g$ is determined by the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$.\n2.  **Identify the branch points and their 2-adic valuations.** The branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree of $f(x)$ is odd). We need to determine the 2-adic valuations of these branch points. This can be done using the Newton polygon method.\n3.  **Group the branch points into clusters.** Two branch points $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ belong to the same cluster if the 2-adic valuation of their difference, $v_2(\\alpha - \\beta)$, is positive. The point at infinity requires special handling.\n4.  **Determine the structure of the stable reduction.** The stable reduction consists of several components, each corresponding to a cluster of branch points. The genus of each component is determined by the number of branch points in its cluster.\n5.  **Calculate the number of double points.** Finally, we use a formula that relates the genus of the original curve, the genera of the components of the stable reduction, and the number of double points ($\\delta$).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the number of double points.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8x over the prime p=2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the curve and calculate its genus\n    # The curve is y^2 = f(x) where f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x\n    # The degree of the polynomial f(x) is d.\n    d = 5\n    # The genus g of a hyperelliptic curve is given by g = floor((d-1)/2)\n    g = math.floor((d - 1) / 2)\n\n    print(f\"The curve is given by y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve is g = floor(({d}-1)/2) = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify branch points and their properties.\n    # The branch points are the 5 roots of f(x) (r_0, ..., r_4) and the point at infinity (r_inf).\n    # From an analysis using Newton polygons over the 2-adic numbers, we find the valuations of the roots:\n    # v2(r_0) = infinity (since r_0 = 0)\n    # v2(r_1) = -1\n    # v2(r_2) = -1\n    # v2(r_3) = -1\n    # v2(r_4) = 3\n    print(\"The branch points are the 6 roots of the equation in the projective line over the 2-adic field.\")\n    print(\"By analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the branch points, we can group them into clusters.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Group the branch points into clusters.\n    # Two branch points alpha, beta are in the same cluster if v2(alpha - beta) > 0.\n    # A finite branch point alpha clusters with infinity if v2(alpha) < 0.\n    # - r_0 and r_4 cluster together because v2(r_0 - r_4) = v2(-r_4) = v2(r_4) = 3 > 0.\n    # - r_1, r_2, r_3 cluster with infinity because their valuations are -1 < 0.\n    # This gives us two clusters.\n    \n    n1 = 2  # Cluster 1: {r_0, r_4}\n    n2 = 4  # Cluster 2: {r_1, r_2, r_3, r_inf}\n    N = 2   # Total number of clusters\n\n    print(f\"There are {N} clusters of branch points.\")\n    print(f\"Cluster 1 has size n1 = {n1}.\")\n    print(f\"Cluster 2 has size n2 = {n2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the genera of the components of the stable reduction.\n    # The genus gi of a component corresponding to a cluster of size ni is gi = floor((ni - 1)/2).\n    g1 = math.floor((n1 - 1) / 2)\n    g2 = math.floor((n2 - 1) / 2)\n    \n    print(\"Each cluster corresponds to a component in the stable reduction curve.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the first component is g1 = floor(({n1}-1)/2) = {g1}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the second component is g2 = floor(({n2}-1)/2) = {g2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the number of double points (delta).\n    # The formula relating these quantities is: g - 1 = (g1 - 1) + (g2 - 1) + delta\n    # We solve for delta: delta = (g - 1) - (g1 - 1) - (g2 - 1)\n    # delta = g - g1 - g2 + 1\n    \n    delta = (g - 1) - (g1 - 1) - (g2 - 1)\n\n    print(\"The number of double points (delta) is found using the formula:\")\n    print(\"g - 1 = (g1 - 1) + (g2 - 1) + delta\")\n    print(f\"{g} - 1 = ({g1} - 1) + ({g2} - 1) + delta\")\n    print(f\"{g - 1} = {g1 - 1} + {g2 - 1} + delta\")\n    print(f\"{g - 1} = {g1 - 1 + g2 - 1} + delta\")\n    print(f\"delta = {g - 1} - ({g1 - 1 + g2 - 1}) = {delta}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of double points is {delta}.\")\n    \n    return delta\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_double_points()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
