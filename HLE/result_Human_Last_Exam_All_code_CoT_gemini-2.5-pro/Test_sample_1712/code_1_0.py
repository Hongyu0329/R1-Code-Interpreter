# The value of the series is given by the expression: 1 - (pi^2 / 12) + (ln(2)^2 / 2)
# We will calculate the value of each term and combine them.

# The numbers in the final equation are 1, 12, 2.
# pi and ln(2) are well-known mathematical constants.
pi = math.pi
ln2 = math.log(2)

term1 = 1
term2 = pi**2 / 12
term3 = ln2**2 / 2
