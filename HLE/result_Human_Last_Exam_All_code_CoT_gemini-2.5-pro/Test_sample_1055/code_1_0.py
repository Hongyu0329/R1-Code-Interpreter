# Steps 3, 4, 6-9: The theoretical argument
# The index [G:H] = [G:Gamma(2)] * [Gamma(2):H]
# Gamma(2) is a free group of rank 2.
# H = <a, b> is a non-cyclic (non-abelian) subgroup of Gamma(2).
# As a non-cyclic subgroup of a free group, H must be a free group of rank >= 2.
# Since H is generated by 2 elements, its rank is <= 2.
# Thus, rank(H) = 2.
# By Nielsen-Schreier rank formula: rank(H) - 1 = [Gamma(2):H] * (rank(Gamma(2)) - 1)
# 2 - 1 = [Gamma(2):H] * (2 - 1)
# 1 = [Gamma(2):H] * 1
# So, [Gamma(2):H] = 1, which means H = Gamma(2).
# The problem reduces to finding [G:Gamma(2)].
# [G:Gamma(2)] is the order of the group SL_2(Z/2Z).
# The group SL_2(Z/2Z) consists of 2x2 matrices over the field with 2 elements, with determinant 1.
# The order is (2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.
