    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Re-framing the problem:** A category with one object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n2.  **Setting up the monoid:** Let the three morphisms be represented by the set `M = {0, 1, 2}`. We must designate one element as the identity. By convention, let `0` be the identity element. The remaining two elements are `1` and `2`.\n\n3.  **Defining the structure:** The monoid's operation is composition. A composition table (or Cayley table) defines the result of composing any two elements. For a monoid of size 3, this is a 3x3 table.\n    *   Since `0` is the identity, the first row and first column of the table are fixed: `0∘x = x` and `x∘0 = x` for any `x` in `M`.\n    *   This leaves 4 entries in the table to be determined: `1∘1`, `1∘2`, `2∘1`, and `2∘2`.\n    *   Each of these 4 entries can be any of the 3 elements (`0`, `1`, or `2`). This gives a total of `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^4 = 81` possible structures.\n\n4.  **Checking the monoid axioms:** We will iterate through all 81 possibilities and check which ones satisfy the monoid axioms.\n    *   **Identity:** This is already satisfied by our setup.\n    *   **Associativity:** We must check if `(a∘b)∘c = a∘(b∘c)` for all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the set `M`.\n\n5.  **Accounting for isomorphism:** Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be turned into the other by relabeling its non-identity elements. In our case, with non-identity elements `{1, 2}`, the only non-trivial relabeling is to swap `1` and `2`.\n    *   For each valid (associative) monoid we find, we will also generate its \"swapped\" version.\n    *   To get a unique count, we will define a \"canonical form\" for each isomorphic pair (e.g., the one that comes first lexicographically) and add only that canonical form to a set to count the unique structures.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Morphisms are represented by {0, 1, 2}, where 0 is the identity.\n    morphisms = [0, 1, 2]\n    \n    # We will store the canonical form of each unique monoid in a set to avoid duplicates.\n    unique_monoids = set()\n    num_associative = 0\n\n    # The 4 compositions to determine are 1*1, 1*2, 2*1, and 2*2.\n    # We iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities.\n    possible_compositions = itertools.product(morphisms, repeat=4)\n\n    for comps in possible_compositions:\n        c11, c12, c21, c22 = comps\n        \n        # The composition table.
