# The user is asking to identify the correct treatment based on the provided medical text.
# The text describes the treatment guidelines for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

# The question asks for the NCCN category 1 recommended treatment for patients whose disease progresses after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.
# This describes the second-line treatment setting, as the first-line treatment is often a combination including a taxane and trastuzumab (like the THP regimen mentioned).

# Let's review the text for second-line recommendations:
# 1. The text states: "In 2022 TDXd replaced T-DM1 as second-line therapy on the basis of superior results reported in the DESTINY-Breast03 trial."
# 2. It further clarifies: "Upon disease progression TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."
# 3. TDXd is the abbreviation for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan.

# Let's evaluate the answer choices:
# A. Tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine: The text states this is a preferred "third-line" regimen.
# B. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1): The text says this was "replaced" by TDXd as the second-line therapy.
# C. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (TDXd): The text explicitly states this is "recommended in the second-line setting" after progression.
# D. Chemotherapy: This is a general category and not the specific NCCN recommended regimen in this context.
# E. None of the above: This is incorrect as option C is directly supported by the text.

# Therefore, the correct answer is Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan.
