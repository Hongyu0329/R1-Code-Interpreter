Let's analyze the move (2, 4):
1.  This move places the White stone at (2, 5) in 'atari' (immediate danger), leaving it with only one liberty at (1, 5).
2.  It also removes the critical liberty at (2, 4) from the larger White group.
3.  This forces White to respond at (1, 5) to save the stone.
4.  After White's forced move, Black can continue a forcing sequence that traps the entire White group. The group is completely surrounded and cannot make two 'eyes' to live, leading to its eventual capture.
5.  Other moves are not as effective because they allow White to connect their stones or gain enough liberties to survive."""
