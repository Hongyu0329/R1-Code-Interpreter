    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two polynomial equations with two variables, x and y.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nMy plan is to use a symbolic computation approach to find the exact number of real solutions.\n1.  First, I will treat the two equations as polynomials in one variable (say, `y`), with coefficients that are themselves polynomials in the other variable (`x`).\n2.  Then, I will use a mathematical tool called the \"resultant\" to eliminate the variable `y`. The resultant of these two polynomials is a single polynomial in `x` whose roots are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.\n3.  Finally, I will find the number of distinct real roots of this resultant polynomial. Each real root for `x` corresponds to a real intersection point (provided the corresponding `y` value is also real, which is the case here). This count will give us the number of real intersection points.\n\nI will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_quadric_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points for two quadric equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')\n\n    # The two quadric equations given by the user.\n    eq_str1 = \"164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\"\n    eq_str2 = \"864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\"\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of real intersection points for the quadrics:\")\n    print(f\"1. {eq_str1.replace('**', '^')} = 0\")\n    print(f\"2. {eq_str2.replace('**', '^')} = 0\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Convert the string expressions to symbolic expressions\n    eq1 = sp.sympify(eq_str1)\n    eq2 = sp.sympify(eq_str2)\n\n    # Represent the equations as polynomials in y, with coefficients in x.\n    poly1_y = sp.Poly(eq1, y)\n    poly2_y = sp.Poly(eq2, y)\n\n    # Compute the resultant of the two polynomials to eliminate y.\n    # The resultant is a polynomial in x whose roots are the x-coordinates\n    # of the intersection points.\n    resultant_poly = sp.resultant(poly1_y, poly2_y)\n\n    # The resultant is a polynomial in x.
