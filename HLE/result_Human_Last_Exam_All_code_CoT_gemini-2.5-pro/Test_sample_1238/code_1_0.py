    answer = "No."

    explanation = """
For the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with smooth, periodic, and divergence-free initial data, a finite-time blow-up is not possible.

Here is a brief explanation:

1.  **Global Regularity in 2D:** It is a classical mathematical theorem, first established by Jean Leray and others in the 1930s, that for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, smooth initial data always leads to a unique solution that remains smooth for all time (t > 0). This property is called "global well-posedness" or "global regularity".

2.  **No Finite-Time Blow-up:** Because a smooth solution is guaranteed to exist for all of time, it logically follows that the solution (and its derivatives) cannot become infinite at any finite time T. If they did, the solution would cease to be smooth at that point, which contradicts the theorem.

3.  **Contrast with the 3D Case:** This result is specific to two dimensions. The same question for the 3D Navier-Stokes equation is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems and remains a major open problem in mathematics. In 3D, it is unknown whether all smooth initial data lead to globally smooth solutions or if a finite-time blow-up can occur.

Therefore, there is no such initial data u_0 that would cause a blow-up for the 2D problem.
