    Calculates the critical exponent nu within a G-four theoretical framework.

    The problem asks for the value of the critical exponent ν in a G₄-theoretical framework.
    This framework is generally understood as the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson φ⁴ theory,
    which is fundamental to the study of critical phenomena.

    The most general and foundational result from this theory comes from the mean-field
    approximation. This approximation is exact for systems with spatial dimensions 'd'
    at or above the upper critical dimension, which for a φ⁴ theory is d_u = 4.

    In mean-field theory, the correlation length (ξ) scaling near the critical
    temperature (T_c) is derived from the free energy functional. The result is that
    the inverse correlation length squared is proportional to the distance from the
    critical temperature:

    ξ⁻² ∝ (T - T_c)

    This can be rewritten in terms of the correlation length ξ itself:

    ξ ∝ (T - T_c)⁻¹/²

    The definition of the critical exponent ν is given by the relation:

    ξ ∝ (T - T_c)⁻ν

    By comparing these two expressions, we can identify the value of ν.
