    # Part (b)
    # The question is whether a 3-primitive vector x in Z^8 can be 3-isotropic
    # such that the resulting 3-neighbor N_3(x) is even.
    # For N_3(x) to be an even lattice, it must satisfy several strong conditions.
    # A key one is that `sum(x_i^2)` must be a multiple of 18.
    # Another is that M_3(x) must be an even lattice, which implies that all
    # components of x must be congruent modulo 3, i.e., x_i = 3*m_i + k for some
    # fixed k in {1, 2}.
    # Let's check if `sum(x_i^2)` can be a multiple of 9 under this condition.
    # sum(x_i^2) = sum((3*m_i + k)^2) = 9*sum(m_i^2) + 6*k*sum(m_i) + 8*k^2.
    # For this to be divisible by 9, we need 6*k*sum(m_i) + 8*k^2 = 0 (mod 9).
    # If k=1: 6*S + 8 = 0 (mod 9) => 6*S = 1 (mod 9), which has no solution as gcd(6,9)=3.
    # If k=2: 12*S + 32 = 0 (mod 9) => 3*S + 5 = 0 (mod 9), which has no solution as gcd(3,9)=3.
    # Since these conditions are contradictory, such a vector x cannot exist.

    # This is equivalent to counting non-zero vectors v in (Z/2Z)^12
