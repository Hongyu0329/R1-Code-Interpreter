    This function explains and provides the theoretical lower bound on the number of queries
    for learning a two-hidden-layer ReLU network in the Statistical Query (SQ) model.

    The problem states:
    - Learning Algorithm: Any Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm.
    - Target Function: A two-hidden-layer ReLU network with a size polynomial in 'd'.
    - Input Distribution: d-dimensional standard normal distribution N(0, I_d).
    - Query Tolerance (tau): Not negligible, i.e., tau >= 1 / poly(d).
    - Goal: Achieve squared loss <= 1 / poly(d).

    Theoretical Result:
    Learning problems involving hidden structures (like the weight vectors of neurons) in
    high-dimensional spaces are known to be hard for SQ algorithms with non-negligible
    tolerance. The algorithm cannot easily distinguish the true hidden parameters from
    random noise because the statistical properties of the corresponding distributions are
    too similar.

    Formal results in computational learning theory have established that any SQ algorithm
    solving this problem requires a number of queries that is exponential in the dimension 'd'.
    This is often expressed using Big Omega notation.
