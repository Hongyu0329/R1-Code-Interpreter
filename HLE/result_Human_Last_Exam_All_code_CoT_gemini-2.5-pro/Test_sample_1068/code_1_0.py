# The problem asks for the value of the function l(p) for p = 14.
p = 14

# After simplifying the complex mathematical definitions, the function l(p)
# is found to have a simple closed-form expression: l(p) = 2 * p * log(2).
# We use this formula to calculate the final result.

# The numbers in the final equation are 2, p, and the mathematical constant log(2).
coefficient = 2
log_of_2 = np.log(2)

# Calculate the result for p = 14
result = coefficient * p * log_of_2

# The final equation is l(14) = 2 * 14 * log(2).
# We print the components and the final result as requested.
