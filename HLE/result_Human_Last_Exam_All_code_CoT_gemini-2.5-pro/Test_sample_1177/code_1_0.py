    """
    This function determines the correct answer based on the legal principles of sale of goods.
    The key principle is that for specific goods that the seller must put into a deliverable state,
    the risk of loss passes to the buyer only after the seller has done so AND has given the buyer notice.

    - The contract was made on June 2 for a specific MacBook Pro.
    - The MacBook was NOT in a deliverable state; it needed a new screen.
    - Jake (seller) completed the repair.
    - On June 5, Jake gave Luke (buyer) notice that the repair was complete and the laptop was ready.
    - At the moment of notice on June 5, the risk of loss passed to Luke.
    - The flood happened AFTER the risk had passed.

    Therefore, Jake is not required to return the money. This corresponds to answer choice B.
