    "When a genus `g` curve defined over a valuation field has a Jacobian with good reduction, its stable reduction must have specific properties. According to the theory of Néron models and stable reduction of curves, this implies that the special fiber of the stable model, let's call it `C_s`, must be a nodal curve satisfying two key conditions:\n\n1.  **The dual graph of its irreducible components is a tree.** This means there are no cycles of components. This arises from the fact that the torus part of the identity component of the Néron model of the Jacobian must be trivial.\n2.  **The sum of the geometric genera of its irreducible components equals the genus of the original curve.** In our case, if `C_s` is formed by components `C_1, C_2, ..., C_n` with geometric genera `g_1, g_2, ..., g_n`, then `sum(g_i) = 4`. This comes from the fact that the abelian part of the special fiber of the Jacobian corresponds to the product of the Jacobians of the components.\n\nThe stable reduction `C_s` must also be a *stable curve*. For a curve made of components `C_i`, the stability condition requires that for each component, `2*g_i - 2 + d_i > 0`, where `d_i` is the number of nodes on that component (which is also the degree of the corresponding vertex in the dual graph).\n\nThis translates our problem into a combinatorial task: we need to count the number of non-isomorphic, genus-labeled trees where the sum of the genera is 4, and every vertex satisfies the stability condition.\n\nThe Python code below enumerates these possibilities based on the number of genus 0 components and calculates the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    with good reduction Jacobians by solving the equivalent combinatorial problem.\n\n    The problem is equivalent to counting the number of non-isomorphic stable\n    curves whose components form a tree structure and whose geometric genera sum to 4.\n    A component with genus g and d nodes is stable if 2g - 2 + d > 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We categorize the count by the number of genus 0 components (k).\n    # A g=0 component requires d >= 3 to be stable.\n    # A g=1 component requires d >= 1 to be stable.\n    # A g>=2 component is always stable in a connected tree (d>=1).\n\n    # Case k=0: No components with genus 0.\n    # All component genera are positive and sum to 4.\n    print(\"Enumerating cases with 0 components of genus 0:\")\n    # Partition (4): 1 component, g=4.
