def solve_enzyme_kinetics_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the enzyme kinetics troubleshooting scenario and determines the best course of action.

    The key information is:
    1. The enzyme is an obligate dimer (must be in a two-unit complex to function).
    2. The assay is chilled on ice before measurement.

    This combination strongly suggests "cold lability," where low temperatures cause the
    dimer to dissociate into inactive monomers. When the reaction is started (at a
    warmer temperature), the monomers must re-associate, causing a "lag phase"
    where the reaction rate starts slow and increases over time. This is a non-linear curve.

    To troubleshoot this, we need to encourage the formation of the active dimer.
    Increasing the temperature will increase the rate of re-association, shortening the
    lag phase and helping to achieve a linear reaction rate more quickly.
