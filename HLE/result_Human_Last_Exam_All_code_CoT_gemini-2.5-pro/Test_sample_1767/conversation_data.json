    "When two topological systems are combined, the topological invariant of the composite system is typically the sum of the invariants of the individual systems. The Chern number is a topological invariant. Therefore, when two Chern insulators are joined, the Chern number of the resulting system is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for each of the two insulators.\n2.  Calculate the sum of these two numbers to find the Chern number of the junction.\n3.  Use a python script to perform the calculation and print the result. The output will explicitly show the numbers used in the final sum.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators.\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The principle of additivity for topological numbers states that the\n# Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the first insulator is C1 = 1.\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the second insulator is C2 = 1.\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C1 + C2.\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
