# The legal question asks for the correct advice a lawyer would give Lewis
# regarding his dispute with Marcel over a painting, based on the Sale of Goods Act (SGA).

# Step 1: Determine the nature of the contract.
# The contract is for a custom-made painting. While it involves Marcel's skill (a service),
# the ultimate goal is the transfer of a tangible object (a good).
# In law, this is considered a contract for the sale of "future goods,"
# meaning the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) applies.

# Step 2: Identify the relevant terms of the agreement.
# - Subject Matter: "a very detailed and large landscape painting of Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay during Autumn."
# - Purpose: "the centrepiece of their living room."
# - Price: five thousand dollars ($5000)
# - Delivery Date: March 1, 2022

# Step 3: Analyze the performance against the SGA's implied conditions.
# The SGA implies certain conditions into contracts for the sale of goods.
# - Implied Condition of Fitness for Purpose: Lewis told Marcel the specific purpose (a centrepiece)
#   and relied on Marcel's skill. The small, hasty painting delivered was not fit for this purpose.
# - Implied Condition of Correspondence with Description: The painting was described as being of
#   "Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay." The delivered painting of a local creek did not match this description.

# Step 4: Determine the remedy for the breach.
# Marcel breached at least two key implied *conditions* of the contract. A breach of a condition
# is a fundamental breach, which entitles the buyer (Lewis) to reject the goods,
# terminate the contract, and demand the return of the purchase price.

# Step 5: Evaluate the given answer choices.
# - A & B are incorrect because the SGA does apply.
# - C is incorrect because the painting did not match the specific contractual description.
# - E is incorrect because the SGA's conditions are implied by law and do not need to be expressly stated in the contract.
# - D is correct. It accurately states that Lewis's understanding is correct, a condition of the SGA was breached,
#   and he is entitled to have his money returned.
