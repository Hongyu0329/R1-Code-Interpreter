# The Employment Rights Act 1996 grants the power to amend the relevant part of the Act
# and specifies the procedure for doing so in separate sections.
#
# 1. The power to make an order (a type of statutory instrument) to amend Part IVA
#    (which includes section 43FA) is granted by section 43J(1).
#
# 2. The general rule that this power is exercisable by statutory instrument is
#    established in section 236(1).
#
# 3. The specific parliamentary procedure for an order made under section 43J is
#    dictated by section 236(4), which requires the affirmative procedure.
#
# Therefore, these three subsections are the key provisions for determining the procedure.

# The final list of relevant subsections as a comma-separated string.
relevant_sections = "43J(1),236(1),236(4)"

# Print the final answer as requested.
