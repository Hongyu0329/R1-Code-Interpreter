    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is non-zero, we will use a result from algebraic K-theory.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The user is asking about the algebraic K-groups of the ring `R = Z/27`. This ring is of the form `Z/p^k`, where `p` is a prime number and `k` is a positive integer. For `Z/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem:** A key result in algebraic K-theory, established by Christophe Soulé, describes when the even K-groups of such rings are non-zero. For an odd prime `p`, the K-group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is a finite `p`-group, and it is non-zero if and only if `n` is less than Euler's totient function of `p^k`. The condition is:\n    `K_{2n}(Z/p^k) ≠ 0  ⇔  1 ≤ n < φ(p^k)`\n    where `φ(m)` is Euler's totient function. For a prime power `p^k`, this function is calculated as `φ(p^k) = p^k * (1 - 1/p) = p^(k-1) * (p-1)`.\n3.  **Apply the theorem:** We need to find the largest natural number `n` that satisfies this condition for `p=3` and `k=3`.\n4.  **Calculate the bound:** We will calculate `φ(27) = 3^(3-1) * (3-1)`.\n5.  **Determine the largest `n`:** The largest integer `n` strictly less than this bound will be our answer.\n6.  **Generate Python code:** Write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the steps and the final answer, ensuring all numbers in the final calculation are displayed.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_k_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group\n    of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ring is Z/27.
