def count_connected_subgraphs():
    """
    This function calculates the number of connected induced subgraphs
    in a 3-dimensional cube graph (Q_3).

    The problem of finding the maximum number of Mexican standoffs is modeled as
    finding the maximum number of simple cycles in a specific type of planar graph.
    Our analysis leads to a construction of a graph G (a cube with a pyramid on one face)
    for which the number of cycles is equivalent to the number of connected induced
    subgraphs of its dual structure, which is the cube graph Q_3.

    The cube graph has 8 vertices and 12 edges. We represent it with an
    adjacency list. Vertices are numbered 0 to 7, corresponding to the
    binary representations from '000' to '111'.
