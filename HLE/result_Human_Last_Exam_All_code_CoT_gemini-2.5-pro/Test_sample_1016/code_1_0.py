    Calculates the number of iterations for the Optimized Schwarz Relaxation Method
    for the 1D wave equation.

    The problem specifies absorbing boundary conditions at the interfaces. This defines
    the method as an Optimized Schwarz Waveform Relaxation method. For the 1D wave
    equation, this optimized method has a well-known, exact convergence property.

    - Iteration 1 corrects the waves propagating in one direction (e.g., right-going).
    - Iteration 2 corrects the waves propagating in the opposite direction (left-going).

    After these two iterations, the solution is exact everywhere. The number of
    iterations is therefore a constant, independent of the propagation speed c,
    the final time T, or the overlap size M.
