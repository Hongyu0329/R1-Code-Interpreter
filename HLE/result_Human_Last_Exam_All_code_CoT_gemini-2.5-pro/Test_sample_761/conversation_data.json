    "This is a question about biochemistry, not a coding problem. I will provide a clear explanation to answer it.\n\nNo, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. This is true even for homopolynucleotides. They are two fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules with distinct monomers, chemical bonds, and overall structures.\n\nHere is a step-by-step comparison:\n\n1.  **Monomers (Building Blocks):**\n    *   **Polysaccharides:** The monomers are **monosaccharides**, which are simple sugars like glucose or fructose. These are carbohydrates, typically with the chemical formula (CHâ‚‚O)n.\n    *   **Polynucleotides:** The monomers are **nucleotides**. Each nucleotide is a much more complex molecule made of three distinct components: a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (A, T, C, G, or U).\n\n2.  **Chemical Bonds:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides:** Monosaccharide monomers are linked together by **glycosidic bonds**.\n    *   **Polynucleotides:** Nucleotide monomers are linked together by **phosphodiester bonds**, which form a repeating sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\n3.  **Backbone Structure:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides:** The backbone consists of a chain of sugar units linked directly to each other (e.g., sugar-sugar-sugar).\n    *   **Polynucleotides:** The backbone is a **sugar-phosphate backbone** (e.g., sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate). The nitrogenous bases are attached to this backbone but are not part of it.\n\n4.  **Elemental Composition:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides:** They are primarily composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).\n    *   **Polynucleotides:** In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, they always contain **nitrogen** (N) in their bases and **phosphorus** (P) in their phosphate groups.\n\nIn summary, because their monomers, the bonds connecting them, their backbone structure, and their elemental composition are all fundamentally different, polynucleotides are not a type of polysaccharide.\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
