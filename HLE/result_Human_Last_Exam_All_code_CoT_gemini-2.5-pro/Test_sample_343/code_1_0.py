    # --- Problem Definitions ---

    # PCount: What is the SUM of the counts of these three structures?

    # --- Analysis of PDecide (Statements A and B) ---
    # The subproblems of finding a k-clique, an induced k-matching, or an induced
    # k-by-k-biclique are all individually W[1]-hard.
    # A disjunction of W[1]-hard problems can be FPT if a Ramsey-type theorem applies,
    # meaning any sufficiently large graph must contain one of the structures.
    # However, for these specific three structures, it is known that arbitrarily
    # large graphs exist that contain none of them for a given k.
    # Thus, the Ramsey-based FPT argument fails. The problem contains a canonical
    # W[1]-hard problem (k-Clique) and is not simplified by the other conditions.
    # Therefore, PDecide is W[1]-hard.

    # --- Analysis of PCount (Statements C and D) ---
    # PCount is the counting version. Counting problems are generally at least as hard
    # as their decision versions.
    # Since PDecide is W[1]-hard, PCount is expected to be at least as hard in the
    # counting complexity hierarchy, which is #W[1]-hard.
    # Furthermore, PCount involves counting k-cliques, and #k-Clique is the canonical
    # #W[1]-complete problem. It is extremely unlikely that adding other counts
    # would make the problem FPT.
