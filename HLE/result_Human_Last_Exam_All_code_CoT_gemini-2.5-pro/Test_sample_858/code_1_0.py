def solve_cardinality_of_non_block_points():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    in an aposyndetic continuum.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  A key theorem in continuum theory (by F. B. Jones) states that a continuum X
        is aposyndetic if and only if for every point p in X, the subspace X \\ {p}
        is continuum-connected.

    2.  By definition, a point p is a non-block point if X \\ {p} contains a dense
        continuum-connected subset.

    3.  From the theorem in step 1, if X is an aposyndetic continuum, then for any
        point p, the space X \\ {p} is itself continuum-connected. A space is always
        a dense subset of itself.
        
    4.  Therefore, in an aposyndetic continuum, X \\ {p} serves as its own dense
        continuum-connected subset. This implies that every point p in an aposyndetic
        continuum is a non-block point.

    5.  This means the set of non-block points is the entire space X. The problem is
        thus equivalent to finding the smallest possible cardinality of an aposyndetic
        continuum X.

    6.  A continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The smallest
        possible non-empty space is a single-point space, X = {p}.

    7.  Let's verify if X = {p} is an aposyndetic continuum:
        - It is a continuum: It is non-empty, compact (being finite), connected (cannot be
          partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets), and Hausdorff (vacuously true).
        - It is aposyndetic: The definition of aposyndesis applies to every pair of
          *distinct* points. Since a single-point space has no distinct points, the
          condition is vacuously true.

    8.  Therefore, the smallest aposyndetic continuum is a single-point space. The
        cardinality of this space is 1. Since the set of non-block points is the
        space itself, its cardinality is also 1.
