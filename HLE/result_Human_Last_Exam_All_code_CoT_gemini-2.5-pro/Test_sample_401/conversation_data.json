    "This is a question from the field of topology. To answer it, we need to understand the definitions and rely on established mathematical theorems. I will walk through the logic that leads to the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the terms**: Briefly explain what an indecomposable continuum and a composant are. The \"not necessarily metric\" part of the question is crucial.\n2.  **Eliminate N=1**: I will use a proof by contradiction to show that an indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant. The core of the argument is that if it had one composant, it could be decomposed, which contradicts its definition.\n3.  **Establish N=2 as a possibility**: I will cite the known mathematical result that an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum with exactly two composants has been constructed.\n4.  **Conclude the minimum**: Since the number of composants must be greater than 1, and 2 is known to be possible, the smallest possible number is 2.\n5.  **Present the logic in a Python script**: The script will use `print` statements to explain the reasoning step-by-step and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composant_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    It does so by explaining the logical proof based on established mathematical theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Understanding the problem ---\n    # An 'indecomposable continuum' is a connected, compact space that cannot be\n    # written as the union of two of its proper, smaller subcontinua.\n    # A 'composant' of a point 'p' is the set of all points that can be joined to 'p'\n    # by a proper subcontinuum. Composants partition the space.\n\n    # We want to find the minimum possible number of these composants.\n\n    # --- Step 2: Can the number of composants be 1? ---\n    # Let's test this with a proof by contradiction.\n    test_number = 1\n    print(f\"Let's assume, for contradiction, that the number of composants is {test_number}.\")\n\n    # If there is only one composant, it means that for any two points in the space,\n    # there is a *proper* subcontinuum that contains both of them.\n\n    # The proof proceeds as follows:\n    # 1. Let X be an indecomposable continuum. Pick any proper subcontinuum, K0.\n    # 2. Pick a point 'p' inside K0 and a point 'q' outside K0.\n    # 3. Because we assumed there is only one composant, there must be a proper subcontinuum, K1, containing both p and q.\n    # 4. Now consider the union, X' = K0 U K1. Since K0 and K1 are both proper subcontinua, if X' = X,\n    #    then we have written X as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    # 5. This contradicts the definition of an indecomposable continuum.\n\n    print(\"This assumption leads to a logical contradiction.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of composants must be greater than {test_number}.\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 3: Can the number of composants be 2? ---\n    # For metric spaces, the number of composants is uncountably infinite.\n    # However, the question allows for non-metric spaces.\n    # Mathematician D. P. Bellamy constructed an example of an indecomposable\n    # (non-metric) continuum that has exactly 2 composants.\n    known_example_number = 2\n    print(f\"\\nA known mathematical result confirms that an indecomposable continuum with exactly {known_example_number} composants can exist.\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---\n    # The number of composants must be greater than 1.\n    # The number 2 is known to be possible.\n    # Therefore, the smallest possible number is 2.\n    final_answer = 2\n    print(f\"\\nThe smallest possible number of composants is {final_answer}.\")\n\n\nsolve_composant_problem()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
