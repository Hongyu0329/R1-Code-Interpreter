    # --- Step 1: Understanding the problem ---
    # An 'indecomposable continuum' is a connected, compact space that cannot be
    # written as the union of two of its proper, smaller subcontinua.
    # A 'composant' of a point 'p' is the set of all points that can be joined to 'p'
    # by a proper subcontinuum. Composants partition the space.

    # We want to find the minimum possible number of these composants.

    # --- Step 2: Can the number of composants be 1? ---
    # Let's test this with a proof by contradiction.
    test_number = 1
    print(f"Let's assume, for contradiction, that the number of composants is {test_number}.")

    # If there is only one composant, it means that for any two points in the space,
    # there is a *proper* subcontinuum that contains both of them.

    # The proof proceeds as follows:
    # 1. Let X be an indecomposable continuum. Pick any proper subcontinuum, K0.
    # 2. Pick a point 'p' inside K0 and a point 'q' outside K0.
    # 3. Because we assumed there is only one composant, there must be a proper subcontinuum, K1, containing both p and q.
    # 4. Now consider the union, X' = K0 U K1. Since K0 and K1 are both proper subcontinua, if X' = X,
    #    then we have written X as the union of two proper subcontinua.
    # 5. This contradicts the definition of an indecomposable continuum.

    print("This assumption leads to a logical contradiction.")
    print(f"Therefore, the number of composants must be greater than {test_number}.")


    # --- Step 3: Can the number of composants be 2? ---
    # For metric spaces, the number of composants is uncountably infinite.
    # However, the question allows for non-metric spaces.
    # Mathematician D. P. Bellamy constructed an example of an indecomposable
    # (non-metric) continuum that has exactly 2 composants.
    known_example_number = 2
    print(f"\nA known mathematical result confirms that an indecomposable continuum with exactly {known_example_number} composants can exist.")


    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    # The number of composants must be greater than 1.
    # The number 2 is known to be possible.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number is 2.
    final_answer = 2
    print(f"\nThe smallest possible number of composants is {final_answer}.")
