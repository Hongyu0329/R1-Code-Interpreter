def find_starting_material():
    """
    This function identifies the starting material for a given chemical reaction.
    The reaction is a Robinson annulation between an unknown compound and methyl vinyl ketone
    to produce ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate.
    
    The analysis proceeds via retrosynthesis:
    1.  The reaction is identified as a Robinson annulation.
    2.  The product's substituents (4-methyl, 4a-carboxylate) are mapped back to the
        starting material based on the mechanism of the annulation.
    3.  This mapping reveals the structure and thus the name of the starting compound.
