    # C is plausible but less precise; the core issue is the firm's duty and lack of consent, not just the partners' access.
    # D correctly states that the consent of the prejudiced party (the former client) is required, and it has been denied.

        f"1.  **Possession of Confidential Information:** NC LLP possesses sensitive confidential information about its former client, {former_client}.\n"
        f"2.  **Adverse Interests:** The new client, {new_client}, has interests that are directly adverse to the former client, as it is attempting to acquire them.\n"
        f"3.  **Substantially Related Matter:** The matters are 'substantially related' because the confidential information the firm holds is directly material to the new acquisition matter.\n"
        f"4.  **Requirement of Consent:** In such a situation, a law firm can only proceed if the former, prejudiced client gives informed consent.\n"
