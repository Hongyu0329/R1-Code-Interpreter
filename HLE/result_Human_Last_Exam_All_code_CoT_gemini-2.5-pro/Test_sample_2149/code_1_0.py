# Step 1: Define the single-digit integer variables X1 through X11 based on the clues.

# Clue 1 points to Edwin Drake's 1859 oil well.
# Y1 = X1X2X3X4 = 1859
X1 = 1
X2 = 8
X3 = 5
X4 = 9

# Clue 3 points to the reactants of the original Heck reaction: Iodobenzene and Styrene.
# Their properties are used to find the remaining variables.
# Y3 = X3X4X8X6 = 59X8X6. Using Styrene's molar mass (~104), let X8=0, X6=1.
# Y2 = X5X6X2X7X6 = X518X71. Using Iodobenzene's molar mass (~204), let X5=4, X7=2.
# Y4 = X9X10X11. Using Iodobenzene's boiling point (188 C).
X5 = 4
X6 = 1
X7 = 2
X8 = 0
X9 = 1
X10 = 8
X11 = 8

# Step 2: Construct the full integer values for Y1 and Y4 from the digits.
# f-strings are used to concatenate the digits into strings, which are then cast to integers.
Y1 = int(f"{X1}{X2}{X3}{X4}")
Y4 = int(f"{X9}{X10}{X11}")

# Step 3: Perform the final calculation.
# "Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state indices" suggests the ratio Y4 / Y1.
result = Y4 / Y1

# Step 4: Print the final answer, showing each number in the equation.
print(f"The value of Y1 is: {Y1}")
print(f"The value of Y4 is: {Y4}")
print("\nThe final calculation for the Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state indices is:")
print(f"{Y4} / {Y1} = {result}")

# The final answer is the result of the division.
# To match the requested final format, we output the numerical result.
print(f"\n<<<{result}>>>")
