    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Knots**: The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). I only need to consider these three unique types, as the mirror of the trefoil has the same relevant properties for this calculation, and the figure-eight knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n2.  **Understand Integral Surgery**: An integral surgery on a knot K results in a homology 3-sphere (an element of the group we're interested in) only if the surgery coefficient `p` is either +1 or -1.\n3.  **Identify Distinct Elements**: To distinguish the resulting 3-manifolds as elements of the homology cobordism group, I will use the Casson invariant, denoted by `lambda`. Two homology spheres obtained by integral surgery on knots are considered the same element in this group if and only if they have the same Casson invariant.\n4.  **Calculate Invariants**: The Casson invariant for a homology sphere M(K, p) obtained by p-surgery on a knot K is calculated using the formula: `lambda = (p/2) * Delta_K''(-1)`, where `Delta_K''(-1)` is the second derivative of the knot's Alexander polynomial evaluated at t = -1.\n5.  **Count Unique Elements**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations for each knot and for both `p = +1` and `p = -1`. The number of unique values of `lambda` found will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group\n    representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n    This is done by calculating the Casson invariant for each possible surgery.\n    The Casson invariant for a homology sphere M(K, p) obtained by p-surgery\n    on a knot K is given by lambda = (p/2) * Delta_K''(-1), where Delta_K is\n    the Alexander polynomial of K.
