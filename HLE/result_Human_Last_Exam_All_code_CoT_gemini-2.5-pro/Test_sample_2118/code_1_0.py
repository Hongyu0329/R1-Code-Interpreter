    Determines the number of nonzero terms, up to and including the term in x^{-100},
    in the asymptotic expansion of the function f(x) satisfying
    (f(x^2) + f(x))(x^2 - x) = 1.
    
    Explanation:
    The equation can be rewritten as f(x^2) + f(x) = 1/(x^2 - x).
    For large x, the right-hand side can be expanded as a series:
    1/(x^2 - x) = 1/x^2 + 1/x^3 + 1/x^4 + ... = sum_{k=2 to inf} x^{-k}
    
    We assume an asymptotic expansion for f(x) of the form f(x) = sum_{n=2 to inf} c_n x^{-n}.
    Substituting this into the equation gives:
    (sum_{n=2 to inf} c_n x^{-2n}) + (sum_{n=2 to inf} c_n x^{-n}) = sum_{k=2 to inf} x^{-k}
    
    By comparing coefficients of x^{-n}, we derive the following recurrence relations for the coefficients c_n:
    - For n=2: c_2 = 1.
    - For odd n >= 3: c_n = 1.
    - For even n >= 4: c_n + c_{n/2} = 1, which implies c_n = 1 - c_{n/2}.
    
    We need to count the number of integers n in the range [2, 100] for which c_n is not zero.
    We analyze the recurrence relation by writing n = 2^k * m, where m is an odd integer.
    
    1. If n is odd (k=0, m >= 3): c_n = 1. These are all non-zero.
    
    2. If n is a power of 2 (m=1, n = 2^k):
       c_2 = 1 (k=1, odd)
       c_4 = 1 - c_2 = 0 (k=2, even)
       c_8 = 1 - c_4 = 1 (k=3, odd)
       c_{2^k} is non-zero if and only if k is odd.
       
    3. If n = 2^k * m with m >= 3 (odd) and k >= 1 (even):
       c_{2m} = 1 - c_m = 1 - 1 = 0
       c_{4m} = 1 - c_{2m} = 1 - 0 = 1
       c_{2^k * m} is non-zero if and only if k is even.
       
    The code below counts the number of non-zero terms based on these conditions.
