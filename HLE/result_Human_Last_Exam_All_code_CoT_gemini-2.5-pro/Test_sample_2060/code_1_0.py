    Analyzes potential visual pathways in the monkey brain to identify the impossible one.

    The monkey visual "what" pathway (ventral stream) is responsible for object recognition.
    Key areas in the ventral stream: V1, V2, V4, TEO, TE.
    Key area in the dorsal ("where") stream: V3a (processes motion).

    We will evaluate each proposed pathway based on known anatomical connections and
