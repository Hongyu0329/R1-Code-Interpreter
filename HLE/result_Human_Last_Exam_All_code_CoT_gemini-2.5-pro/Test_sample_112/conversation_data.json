    "This is a literature question. I will find the name of the book of manners that was preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal\". Then, as instructed, I will create a Python script to present this answer. The script will store the book's title in a variable and then print a sentence that directly answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem \"Sir Launfal\" is found in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n    # This manuscript also contains a well-known 15th-century book of manners.\n    book_title = \"The Babees Book\"\n    \n    # Print the answer in a complete sentence.\n    print(f\"The poem 'Sir Launfal' was preserved alongside the book of manners known as '{book_title}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Babees Book>>>"
