    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, we need to count the distinct genes that encode for these microRNAs. The let-7 family consists of several closely related microRNAs, some of which are encoded by multiple gene paralogs.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the core members of the human let-7 family. These are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n2.  For each member, identify the number of distinct precursor genes that produce it.\n    *   let-7a is encoded by 3 genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3).\n    *   let-7f is encoded by 2 genes (let-7f-1, let-7f-2).\n    *   The other 7 members (let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98) are each encoded by a single gene.\n3.  Sum these counts to find the total number of let-7 family member genes.\n4.  The Python script below will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# In humans, the let-7 family of microRNAs is encoded by several genes.\n# We will sum the number of genes for each member of the family.\n\n# Dictionary mapping let-7 family members to the number of genes encoding them.\nlet7_genes = {\n    \"let-7a\": 3,\n    \"let-7b\": 1,\n    \"let-7c\": 1,\n    \"let-7d\": 1,\n    \"let-7e\": 1,\n    \"let-7f\": 2,\n    \"let-7g\": 1,\n    \"let-7i\": 1,\n    \"miR-98\": 1, # miR-98 is a member of the let-7 family\n}\n\n# Get the counts for each member\ngene_counts = list(let7_genes.values())\n\n# Calculate the total number of genes\ntotal_members = sum(gene_counts)\n\n# Create the equation string for printing\n# The string.join() method requires strings, so we convert numbers to strings\nequation_parts = [str(count) for count in gene_counts]\nequation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The total number of human let-7 family members is the sum of genes for each type:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_members}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
