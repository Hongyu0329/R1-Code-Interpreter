# Step 1: Define the given probability of measuring |0> in the output state.
p_out_0 = 0.36

# Step 2: Calculate the probability of measuring |1> in the output state.
# The sum of probabilities for all outcomes must be 1.
# P_out(0) + P_out(1) = 1
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0

print(f"The probability of measuring the output state as |0>, P_out(0), is given as: {p_out_0}")
print("From the rule that probabilities sum to 1, we can find the probability of measuring |1>:")
print(f"P_out(1) = 1 - P_out(0)  =>  P_out(1) = 1 - {p_out_0} = {p_out_1}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Apply our interpretation of Property 1 to relate output to input.
# Property 1 states: P_out(1) = (P_in(0))^2, where P_in(0) is |α|^2.
# So, p_out_1 = (p_in_0)^2
p_in_0_squared = p_out_1

print("Based on the problem's properties, we have the relation: P_out(1) = (P_in(0))^2")
print(f"Substituting the value of P_out(1), we get: {p_in_0_squared} = (P_in(0))^2")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Solve for P_in(0), which is equal to |α|^2.
# p_in_0 = sqrt(p_in_0_squared)
alpha_squared = math.sqrt(p_in_0_squared)

print("To find P_in(0), we take the square root:")
print(f"P_in(0) = sqrt({p_in_0_squared}) = {alpha_squared}")

# Final Answer
print(f"The value of |α|^2 is equal to P_in(0).")
print(f"Therefore, the final answer for |α|^2 is: {alpha_squared}")
