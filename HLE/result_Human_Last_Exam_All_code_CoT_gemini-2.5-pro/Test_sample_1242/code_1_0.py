    1. The question asks for features that determine the complexity of individual WORDS, not entire texts.

    2. Features like 'number of unique words' and 'number of word categories' measure the lexical diversity of a TEXT. They are not properties of a single word. Therefore, any option containing these features is likely incorrect for this specific task. This eliminates options A, B, C, and E.

    3. Option D includes:
        - word length: A measure of structural complexity.
        - word familiarity rating: A psycholinguistic measure of exposure and processing ease.
        - syllable count: A phonological measure related to reading effort.
        - concreteness rating: A measure of semantic complexity (abstract vs. concrete).

    4. This combination of four features (word length, familiarity, syllable count, and concreteness) provides a comprehensive model of word-level complexity by assessing a word's structural, frequency-based, and semantic properties. This set is widely recognized in psycholinguistic research.
