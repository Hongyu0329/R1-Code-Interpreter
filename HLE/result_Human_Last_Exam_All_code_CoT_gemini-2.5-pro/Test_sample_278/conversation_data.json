    "To solve this problem, we need to find the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions. The side length of the smallest enclosing square will be the maximum of the figure's width and height.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the x-coordinate:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)`. As `t` varies from `0` to `2π`, `cos(t)` covers its full range, which is `[-1, 1]`. Therefore, the minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum x-value is 1. The width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the y-coordinate:** The y-coordinate's definition is split into two parts:\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, `y` is in `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. Therefore, `5 * sin(t)` ranges from 0 down to -5 and back to 0. So, `y` is in `[-5, 0)`.\n    *   Combining both parts, the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`. The height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Determine the enclosing square:** The figure has a width of 2 and a height of 6. To enclose this shape, the side length of the square must be at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n    *   Side length `s = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is `side * side`.\n    *   Area = `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates these values and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Determine the range of the x-coordinates.\n# x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2pi).\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\nwidth = x_max - x_min\n\n# Step 2: Determine the range of the y-coordinates.\n# For t in [0, pi], y = sin(t), so y is in [0, 1].\n# For t in (pi, 2pi), y = 5*sin(t), so y is in [-5, 0).\n# The total range for y is the union of these two intervals.\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 3: The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length * side_length\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation for the area.\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is {side_length}.\")\nprint(f\"The area of the square is {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
