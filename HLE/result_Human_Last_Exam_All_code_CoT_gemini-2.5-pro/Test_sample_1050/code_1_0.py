    Calculates the minimum number of attempts Turbo needs to guarantee a win.

    The problem can be simplified to finding the one "safe column" that has no monsters.
    There are 2023 columns and 2022 monsters. This means there are 2022 unsafe columns
    and exactly 1 safe column.

    In the worst-case scenario, Turbo must identify every unsafe column before he can
    be certain which one is the safe column.

    Let's analyze the attempts:
    - Attempt 1: Turbo tests a column. In the worst case, he finds a monster. 1 unsafe column found.
    - Attempt 2: Turbo tests another column. In the worst case, he finds another monster. 2 unsafe columns found.
    - ...
    - Attempt 2022: Turbo tests the 2022nd column. In the worst case, he finds the last monster. 2022 unsafe columns found.

    After 2022 failed attempts, Turbo has found all 2022 monsters and ruled out 2022 columns.
    He now knows with certainty that the single remaining column is the safe one.

    - Attempt 2023: Turbo walks down the identified safe column. This attempt is guaranteed to succeed.

    Therefore, the minimum number of attempts to GUARANTEE a win is 2022 (failures) + 1 (success).
