    This function determines the necessary assumptions and formats the answer
    in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

    The analysis identifies that for a proof of EIG converging to zero
    in a general agent-environment setting, one must ensure the true model is
    identifiable from the agent's experience. This requires assumptions about
    both the environment's structure and the agent's behavior.

    - Assumption (b) provides necessary regularity conditions on the environment (MDP).
    - Assumption (c) provides necessary stability conditions on the agent's policy,
      ensuring the data stream becomes asymptotically stationary.

    Both are considered necessary for a general proof. The answer is b AND c.
