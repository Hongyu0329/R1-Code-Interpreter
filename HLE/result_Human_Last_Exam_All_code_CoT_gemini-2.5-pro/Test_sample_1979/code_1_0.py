    Determines if the set Sigma is empty and computes the required value.

    The problem defines Sigma based on the condition A+A being a subset of A x A.
    As explained in the plan, this is interpreted in two ways:
    1. Literal interpretation: A must be the empty set, making Sigma empty.
    2. Typo interpretation: The condition is A+A subset A*A.

    This script performs a search under the second, more complex interpretation.
    If no solution is found, it confirms that Sigma is likely empty under both
    interpretations, and the answer is 0.
