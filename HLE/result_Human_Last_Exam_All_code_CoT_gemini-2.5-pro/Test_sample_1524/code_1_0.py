Thinking Process:

1.  **The Bose-Einstein Distribution:** The physics of a Bose gas is governed by the Bose-Einstein distribution, which gives the average number of particles `n(ε)` in an energy state `ε`:

    n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)

    Here, μ is the chemical potential, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

2.  **The Fundamental Physical Constraint:** For `n(ε)` to be a positive number (as it must be), the denominator of the fraction must be positive.

    exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0

3.  **Deriving the Limit on μ:** This inequality requires that `exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T))` must be greater than 1. Taking the natural log of both sides gives:

    (ε - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0

    Since temperature T is positive, this simplifies to the fundamental relationship:

    μ < ε

4.  **The Universal Limit:** This condition must hold for ALL energy states `ε`. The most restrictive requirement is therefore set by the lowest possible energy state, the ground state `ε_0`. This gives the universal limit for the chemical potential in any Bose system:

    μ < ε_0

5.  **Application to a Free Bose Gas:** For a gas of free particles, it is conventional to define the ground state energy as zero, so `ε_0 = 0`. In this common and important case, the fundamental limit becomes:

    μ < 0

    Bose-Einstein condensation occurs when the temperature is lowered to a critical point where μ approaches 0 from the negative side. This allows the occupation of the ground state `n(ε_0)` to become macroscopically large.

6.  **Conclusion from Answer Choices:** Based on this reasoning, the statement "μ must be less than zero" (Choice A) is the correct description of the fundamental limit for a conventional Bose gas. The reasoning attached to choice A in the prompt is confusingly phrased, but the physical statement itself is correct.
