    "The primary threat from quantum computers against symmetric key cryptography is Grover's algorithm. This algorithm can search an unstructured database, such as the entire space of possible cryptographic keys, much faster than a classical computer.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how we determine the necessary key length:\n\n1.  **Classical Security**: For a symmetric key of length 'n' bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer performing a brute-force attack would need, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to find the key. The complexity is considered to be O(2^n). A 128-bit key is currently considered the standard for strong security against classical computers.\n\n2.  **Quantum Threat (Grover's Algorithm)**: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup. This means it can search the 2^n keyspace in approximately sqrt(2^n) operations, which is 2^(n/2).\n\n3.  **Effective Security Reduction**: This quadratic speedup effectively halves the security strength (in bits) of a symmetric key. A 128-bit key, when attacked by a quantum computer, offers only 128 / 2 = 64 bits of security, which is not considered safe.\n\n4.  **Required Key Length**: To achieve the equivalent of 128-bit classical security in a post-quantum world, we need a key length 'n' such that its effective quantum security (n/2) is at least 128.\n    *   n / 2 = 128\n    *   n = 128 * 2\n    *   n = 256\n\nTherefore, to maintain a 128-bit security level against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_safe_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against\n    a quantum computer attack using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The baseline security level we want to maintain, which is the current\n    # standard for classical computers (e.g., AES-128).\n    classical_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the\n    # bit strength of a symmetric key. So, the key length must be doubled.\n    quantum_impact_factor = 2\n\n    # Calculate the required key length for quantum resistance.\n    quantum_safe_key_length = classical_security_level * quantum_impact_factor\n\n    print(\"To be secure against a quantum computer, a symmetric key's strength must be doubled.\")\n    print(f\"The desired classical security level is {classical_security_level} bits.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{classical_security_level} * {quantum_impact_factor} = {quantum_safe_key_length}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least {quantum_safe_key_length} bits long.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_safe_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
