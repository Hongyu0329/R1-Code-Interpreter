    "This puzzle contains a word visually encoded using `t` and `b` characters on a grid. The key to solving it is to realize that the word is formed not by the characters themselves, but by the empty space between them (the negative space).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Parse the text from the `verbatim` block into a 2D grid, preserving the exact spacing.\n2.  The characters (`t` and `b`) are laid out on a grid where characters are placed on even-numbered columns, and odd-numbered columns are used for spacing. I will create a condensed grid by only looking at the even-numbered columns.\n3.  Some characters in the original text are placed on odd-numbered columns. These are red herrings and will be ignored by the parsing logic.\n4.  Finally, I will generate and print an \"inverted\" image from this condensed grid. In this new image, the original `t` and `b` characters will be replaced by spaces, and the original spaces will be replaced by a block character (`#`).\n5.  This inverted image will clearly show the hidden word.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this transformation and reveal the word:\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_decode():\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses the visual encoding and prints the decoded word shape.\n    The word is found in the \"negative space\" of the original image.\n    \"\"\"\n    verbatim_text = \"\"\"t b b t t t t b b b\nb\nb\nb\nt\nb\nt b t t b b b b b b\n                  b\n                  b\n                  t\n                  t\n                  b\nb b t t t t b t b b\"\"\"\n\n    lines = verbatim_text.split('\\n')\n    \n    # Determine the maximum width to create a consistent grid\n    max_width = 0\n    for line in lines:\n        if len(line) > max_width:\n            max_width = len(line)\n\n    # Create a grid, padding all lines to the same width\n    grid = []\n    for line in lines:\n        grid.append(list(line.ljust(max_width)))\n\n    # Create a condensed matrix using only the even-indexed columns,\n    # which contain the actual characters of the drawing.\n    condensed_matrix = []\n    height = len(grid)\n    # The width of the condensed matrix is half the original width.\n    condensed_width = (max_width + 1) // 2 \n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        matrix_row = []\n        for c in range(condensed_width):\n            # Map matrix column 'c' to original grid column 'c*2'\n            original_col_index = c * 2\n            if original_col_index < len(grid[r]):\n                matrix_row.append(grid[r][original_col_index])\n            else:\n                matrix_row.append(' ') # Should not happen with ljust\n        condensed_matrix.append(matrix_row)\n        \n    print(\"The decoded message is formed by the shapes below:\")\n    # Print the inverted matrix to reveal the word in the negative space.\n    for r in range(height):\n        output_line = \"\"\n        for c in range(condensed_width):\n            char = condensed_matrix[r][c]\n            if char in ('t', 'b'):\n                # Replace original characters with space\n                output_line += \" \"\n            else:\n                # Replace original spaces with '#' to show the word\n                output_line += \"#\"\n        print(output_line)\n\nsolve_and_decode()\n```\n<<<ILO>>>"
