    This function determines the smallest possible number of nondegenerate,
    locally connected components for the set F.

    The set F is a closed subset of the unit square [0,1]^2 satisfying:
    F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
    where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}.

    There are two possible solutions for F that are closed subsets of [0,1]^2:
    1. The empty set F = {}.
    2. The non-empty compact attractor A of the Iterated Function System.

    Case 1: F is the empty set.
    The empty set has 0 components. Therefore, the number of nondegenerate,
    locally connected components is 0.

    Case 2: F is the attractor A.
    The attractor is the set A = C x [0,1], where C is a Cantor set.
    The components of A are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
    The number of such components is the cardinality of the Cantor set, which is uncountable.
    Each component is a line segment, which is nondegenerate and locally connected.

    The question asks for the smallest possible number. Comparing the two cases
    (0 and uncountable), the smallest is 0.
