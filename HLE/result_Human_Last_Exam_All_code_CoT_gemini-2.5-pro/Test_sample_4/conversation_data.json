    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie Algebra Structure**: First, I will determine the properties of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. Specifically, I will check if it is a nilpotent Lie algebra by computing its descending central series.\n2.  **Apply the Relevant Mathematical Theorem**: For nilpotent Lie algebras, there is a powerful theorem that simplifies the computation of the Poincaré polynomial. The theorem states that the homology of a nilpotent Lie algebra is isomorphic to the homology of its abelianization. The Poincaré polynomial is therefore determined by the dimension of this abelianization.\n3.  **Compute Key Dimensions**: I will calculate the dimension of the commutator subalgebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$, and then use it to find the dimension of the abelianization $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab} = \\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.\n4.  **Construct the Poincaré Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial of an $m$-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is $(1+x)^m$. I will use the dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab}$ to find the specific polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final polynomial in a clear format, showing each term and its coefficient as requested.\n\n### Mathematical Derivation\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4, [e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\n1.  **Nilpotency Check**: We compute the descending central series $\\mathfrak{g}^k = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^{k-1}]$.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^0 = \\mathfrak{g}$\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^1 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is spanned by the results of the commutators, so $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^1]$ is spanned by brackets of elements from $\\mathfrak{g}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}^1$. The only non-zero bracket is $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. So, $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2]$ involves bracketing elements with $e_4$. All such brackets are zero, so $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = \\{0\\}$.\n    Since the series terminates, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Polynomial of Nilpotent Lie Algebras**: For a nilpotent Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ over a field of characteristic zero (like $\\mathbb{R}$), its homology is determined by its abelianization, $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab} = \\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$. The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the same as that of the abelian Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab}$. For an $m$-dimensional abelian algebra, the Poincaré polynomial is $(1+x)^m$.\n\n3.  **Dimension of the Abelianization**:\n    *   The dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6.\n    *   The commutator subalgebra is $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$. Since $e_3, e_4, e_6$ are basis vectors of $\\mathfrak{g}$, they are linearly independent. Thus, the dimension of $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is 3.\n    *   The dimension of the abelianization is $m = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_{ab}) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n\n4.  **Final Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$ is therefore $(1+x)^3$. Expanding this gives:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^3 = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the coefficients and prints this polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the dimensions of the Lie algebra and its commutator subalgebra.\n    # The Lie algebra g is 6-dimensional.\n    dim_g = 6\n\n    # The commutator subalgebra [g, g] is spanned by the results of the non-zero brackets:\n    # [e1, e2] = e3, [e1, e3] = e4, [e1, e5] = e6.\n    # Thus, [g, g] = span{e3, e4, e6}.\n    # Since e3, e4, e6 are basis vectors, they are linearly independent.\n    dim_gg = 3\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the dimension of the abelianization.\n    # The Lie algebra is nilpotent.
