    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Parameters:** We are given the weights of the ambient weighted projective space `WCP(w_1, ..., w_n)` as `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`. The number of variables is `n = 5`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n    `d = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5`\n    `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    (We proceed with `d=225` based on the Calabi-Yau condition, assuming the term `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` in the polynomial is a typo, as its weighted degree is 224, not 225).\n\n3.  **Apply the Crawley-Nordström Invariant Formula:** The formula for the invariant `μ` is:\n    `μ = ( (n-2)! * d^(n-3) ) / (w_1 * w_2 * ... * w_n)`\n\n4.  **Calculate and Simplify:** We will substitute the values of `n`, `d`, and the weights into the formula and simplify the resulting fraction.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Define the weights and number of variables\nweights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\nn = len(weights)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the degree 'd' based on the Calabi-Yau condition\nd = sum(weights)\n\n# Step 3: Apply the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n# Numerator = (n-2)! * d^(n-3)\nn_minus_2_fact = math.factorial(n - 2)\nd_pow_n_minus_3 = d ** (n - 3)\nnumerator = n_minus_2_fact * d_pow_n_minus_3\n\n# Denominator = w1 * w2 * ... * wn\ndenominator = math.prod(weights)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final invariant and simplify the fraction\ninvariant = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Print the calculation steps with the actual numbers\nprint(\"The formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant μ is:\")\nprint(\"μ = ( (n-2)! * d^(n-3) ) / (w_1 * w_2 * ... * w_n)\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"Weights = {weights}\")\nprint(f\"d = sum(weights) = {d}\\n\")\n\nweight_product_str = \" * \".join(map(str, weights))\nprint(f\"μ = ( ({n}-2)! * {d}^({n}-3) ) / ( {weight_product_str} )\")\nprint(f\"μ = ( {n_minus_2_fact} * {d_pow_n_minus_3} ) / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"μ = {numerator} / {denominator}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The simplified Crawley-Nordström invariant is:\")\nprint(f\"μ = {invariant.numerator} / {invariant.denominator}\")\n\n```\n<<<81/31262>>>"
