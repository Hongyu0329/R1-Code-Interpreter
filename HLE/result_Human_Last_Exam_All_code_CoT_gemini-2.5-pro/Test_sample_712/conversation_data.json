    "To answer this question, I will perform a search within my knowledge base to identify the specific genus of bacterium known for producing a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties. My plan is to store the name of this genus in a variable and then use a print statement to display the answer in a clear and complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_triboluminescent_bacterium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the genus of a bacterium\n    known to produce a compound with triboluminescent properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is identified through a knowledge base lookup.\n    # While primarily known for bioluminescence, Photorhabdus luminescens\n    # is the bacterium whose light-emitting properties are sometimes\n    # associated with the term triboluminescence.\n    genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n    \n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is: {genus}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nfind_triboluminescent_bacterium()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
