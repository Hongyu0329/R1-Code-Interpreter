    "Of the noble gases, Radon (Rn) is the rarest. Because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life, its abundance on Earth at any given moment is extremely low. It is continuously produced from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust, but it also decays away very quickly. Its concentration is highly variable, but it is consistently the least abundant noble gas.\n\nThe second rarest, and the rarest *stable* noble gas, is Xenon (Xe). However, Radon is significantly rarer than Xenon.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the estimated percentage of Radon relative to the total mass of the Earth. The values for the total mass of Radon in the atmosphere and the mass of the Earth are well-established estimates. The year 2002 does not significantly affect these figures.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the abundance of the rarest noble gas (Radon)\n    as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n    \"\"\"\n    gas_name = \"Radon\"\n    \n    # Estimated total mass of Radon in the entire Earth's atmosphere at any given time, in kg.\n    # Sources estimate this to be on the order of a few thousand kilograms. We'll use 2000 kg.\n    mass_of_gas_kg = 2000.0\n    \n    # Mass of the Earth in kg.\n    mass_of_earth_kg = 5.972e24\n    \n    # Calculate the percentage.\n    percentage = (mass_of_gas_kg / mass_of_earth_kg) * 100\n    \n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is extremely low.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the estimated total mass of the gas on Earth divided by the total mass of the Earth.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"({mass_of_gas_kg} kg / {mass_of_earth_kg} kg) * 100 = {percentage:.4g}%\")\n\ncalculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
