    "This is a music theory question that requires knowledge of The Beatles' discography. Here is my plan to identify the song:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: The user is asking for a Beatles song that starts with a specific chord progression: from the tonic chord (the \"I\" chord, or the home chord of the key) to the minor fifth chord (the \"v\" chord).\n2.  **Music Theory Analysis**: In a major key, the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale is naturally a major chord (the V chord, or dominant). For example, in the key of C major, the tonic is C major, and the fifth chord is G major. A minor fifth chord (G minor in this case) is a \"borrowed\" chord, typically taken from the parallel minor key (C minor). This I -> v progression is distinctive and not as common as a standard I -> V progression.\n3.  **Search and Identify**: I will mentally scan or search through The Beatles' catalog for songs that feature this specific opening progression. Many Beatles songs have famous openings, but this particular change is unique. The song \"I'll Follow the Sun\" from the album *Beatles for Sale* fits this description perfectly.\n4.  **Confirmation**: The song is in the key of C major. The first line of the verse, \"One day, you'll look...\", is sung over a C major chord (the tonic). The very next line, \"...to see I've gone\", moves to a G minor chord (the minor fifth), before progressing to a C7 and then F major. This C -> Gm change is the exact \"jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\" described.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will create a Python script to present this answer. The script will define variables for the band, song, key, and the specific chords, and then print a formatted string that clearly explains the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song matching the musical criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"I'll Follow the Sun\"\n    band_name = \"The Beatles\"\n    song_key = \"C Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"C Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"G minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by {band_name} that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {song_key}.\")\n    print(f\"The vocal phrase begins on the tonic chord ({tonic_chord}, the 'I' chord).\")\n    print(f\"It then 'jumps' to the minor fifth chord ({minor_fifth_chord}, the 'v' chord) on the line '...to see I've gone'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<I'll Follow the Sun>>>"
