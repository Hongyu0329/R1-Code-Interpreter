# The first part of the problem is to find the condition for a (p,q) pair to be "good".
# As derived in the explanation, a strong necessary condition is that there are no isolated vertices in the graph,
# which simplifies to n >= 2 * min(p, q). We will use this as the condition.

# The second part is to find the limit of Pr(n) as n -> infinity.
# Pr(n) is the probability that a randomly selected coprime pair (p,q) is also a "good" pair.
# Let A be the event that a pair is good: n >= 2 * min(p, q) or min(p,q) <= n/2.
# Let B be the event that a pair is bad: min(p,q) > n/2, which means p > n/2 AND q > n/2.

# We are looking for lim P(A | coprime). This is 1 - lim P(B | coprime).

# The density of coprime pairs in a large region is uniform.
# So, the probability is the ratio of the areas of the "good" region to the "total" region.
# Total region for (p,q) is the square [1,n] x [1,n]. Area = n^2.
# The "bad" region is the square (n/2, n] x (n/2, n]. Area = (n/2)^2 = n^2 / 4.
# The area of the "good" region is n^2 - (n^2 / 4) = (3/4) * n^2.

# The limit of the probability is the ratio of the good area to the total area.
# lim Pr(n) = ( (3/4) * n^2 ) / ( n^2 ) = 3/4.

limit_value = 3/4
