    "In the famous didactic poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the 25 prophets that are obligatory for a Muslim to know are listed consecutively.\n\nThe enumeration of the names begins at **Bayt 28** and concludes at **Bayt 31**. Verse 27 serves as an introduction to the list, stating the necessity of knowing them, and verse 32 offers a prayer upon them, marking the end of the section.\n\nThe Python code below will display the specific four verses (abyat) where the names of the prophets are mentioned, providing the verse number, the original Arabic text, and an English translation for each.\n\n```python\ndef display_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    verses = [\n        {\n            \"number\": 28,\n            \"arabic\": \"هُمْ آدَمٌ ادْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 29,\n            \"arabic\": \"لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\",\n            \"translation\": \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well; Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed suit.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 30,\n            \"arabic\": \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and Al-Yasa'; Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 31,\n            \"arabic\": \"إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n            \"translation\": \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya; 'Isa and Taha (Muhammad), the seal, so leave misguidance.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"In 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt 28 to Bayt 31.\\n\")\n    \n    for verse in verses:\n        print(f\"Bayt {verse['number']}:\")\n        print(f\"  Arabic:      {verse['arabic']}\")\n        print(f\"  Translation: {verse['translation']}\\n\")\n\n    start_bayt = verses[0]['number']\n    end_bayt = verses[-1]['number']\n    \n    print(f\"Therefore, the names are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
