    # Step 1 & 2: The denominator of A_m is the integral of sin^2(sqrt(lambda_m)*x) from 0 to l.
    # The result of this definite integral is: l/2 - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda_m))/(4*sqrt(lambda_m)).
    
    # Step 3: Compare the calculated denominator with the given form.
    # Calculated form, after factoring: (1 / (2*sqrt(lambda_m))) * (l*sqrt(lambda_m) - (1/2)*sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda_m)))
    # Given form: (1 / (K1*sqrt(lambda_m))) * (K2*l*sqrt(lambda_m) + K3*sin(K4*l*sqrt(lambda_m)))

    # The smallest eigenvalue can be made arbitrarily close to 0 by choosing large values for l.
    # For the inequality to hold true for any choice of l and k, K must be a lower bound for all possible
    # positive values of sqrt(lambda_m). The greatest lower bound is 0.
