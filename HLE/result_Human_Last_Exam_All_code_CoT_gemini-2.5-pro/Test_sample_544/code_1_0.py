# The reaction described is a Pummerer reaction.
# 1. Activation: Methyl phenyl sulfoxide is activated by triflic anhydride
#    to form a sulfoxonium intermediate.
# 2. Intermediate Formation: This intermediate eliminates triflic acid to
#    form a highly reactive thionium ion, [Ph-S+=CH2].
# 3. Nucleophilic Attack: Trimethylsilyl cyanide provides a cyanide nucleophile (CN-),
#    which attacks the thionium ion.
#
# The resulting product is Ph-S-CH2-CN.
#
# IUPAC Naming of Ph-S-CH2-CN:
# - Principal functional group: Nitrile (-CN). Parent name is acetonitrile.
# - Numbering: The nitrile carbon is C1, the adjacent CH2 carbon is C2.
# - Substituent: A phenylthio (Ph-S-) group is on C2.
#
# The final name is 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile.
