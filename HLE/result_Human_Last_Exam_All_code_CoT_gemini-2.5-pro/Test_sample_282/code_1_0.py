    # Step 1: Identify the group and its dimension.
    # The group is G = SL_2(R), the set of 2x2 real matrices with determinant 1.
    # As a Lie group, its dimension 'd' is 3.
    d = 3

    # The problem concerns the product set X^3, which is the product of n=3 sets.
    n = 3

    # Step 2 & 3: Apply the Brunn-Minkowski inequality to find a lower bound for K.
    # For G = SL_2(R), the Brunn-Minkowski inequality states that for compact sets A and B,
    # mu(AB)^(1/d) >= mu(A)^(1/d) + mu(B)^(1/d).
    # This can be extended to a product of n sets:
    # mu(X^n)^(1/d) >= n * mu(X)^(1/d).
    # Raising both sides to the power of d gives:
    # mu(X^n) >= n^d * mu(X).
    # In our case, n=3 and d=3.
    K_lower_bound = n**d

    # Step 4: Establish the upper bound for K.
    # The bound derived from the Brunn-Minkowski inequality is sharp.
    # This can be seen by considering a small compact neighborhood X of the identity element.
    # For such sets, the Haar measure mu behaves like the Lebesgue volume in the Lie algebra
    # sl_2(R), which is a vector space of dimension d=3.
    # The product set X^3 corresponds to the 3-fold Minkowski sum of the neighborhood in the algebra.
    # For a small ball B, vol(B+...+B) (n times) = vol(nB) = (n^d)*vol(B).
    # This implies that we can find sets X where the ratio mu(X^n)/mu(X) is arbitrarily
    # close to n^d. Thus, K cannot be larger than n^d.
    K_upper_bound = n**d

    # Step 5: Conclude the value of K.
    # Since K >= K_lower_bound and K <= K_upper_bound, the value of K is determined.
    K = K_lower_bound
