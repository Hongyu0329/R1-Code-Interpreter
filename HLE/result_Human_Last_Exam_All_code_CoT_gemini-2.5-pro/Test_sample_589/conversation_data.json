    "My plan is to identify the movie based on the specific and memorable scene described in your query.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scene:** The query describes a teenager on a pink bike pedaling directly into the path of an oncoming car. This is a very dramatic and specific visual.\n2.  **Recall/Search for the Film:** This scene is a key moment in the 1995 coming-of-age film *Now and Then*.\n3.  **Verify the Details:**\n    *   **Film:** *Now and Then* (1995).\n    *   **Studio:** New Line Cinema, which is a major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** The character is a young Samantha Albertson (played by Gaby Hoffmann).\n    *   **Action:** Upset after a fight with her mother, she gets on her pink bicycle and plays a game of \"chicken\" by pedaling furiously toward an oncoming car, which swerves away at the last moment.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the title of the movie that features this scene.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_pink_bike_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Hollywood film\n    matching the described scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The query describes a key scene from the 1995 film \"Now and Then\".\n    # In the film, the character Samantha, a teenager, rides her pink bike\n    # directly toward an oncoming car in a game of chicken.\n    movie_title = \"Now and Then\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film with the described scene is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_with_pink_bike_scene()\n```\n<<<Now and Then>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
