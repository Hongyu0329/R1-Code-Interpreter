    "My plan is to identify the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\" into the legal system. Research indicates that this principle was formally and broadly established in a major piece of legislation concerning contracts. I will then use a Python script to print the name of this law, ensuring it adheres to the user's specific formatting requirements of not including \"the\" at the beginning or the year at the end.\n\n```python\ndef get_israeli_statute():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n  to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n  \"\"\"\n  statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n  print(statute_name)\n\nget_israeli_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
