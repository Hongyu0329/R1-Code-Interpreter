    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.** We will check for a pattern of the form `next_term = multiplier * current_term + constant`.\n2.  **Identify the pattern.** It appears the relationship is `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`, where `c_n` is a variable that changes with each step. This pattern starts from the second term.\n3.  **Calculate the sequence `c_n`.** By applying the formula from step 2 to the given sequence, we will find the first few terms of `c_n`.\n4.  **Find the pattern within the sequence `c_n`.** We will analyze the sequence `c_n` by looking at the differences between its terms.\n5.  **Predict the next term of `c_n`.** Based on the pattern found in its differences, we will calculate the next term of the `c_n` sequence.\n6.  **Calculate the final missing number.** Using the predicted next term of `c_n` and the formula from step 2, we will calculate the missing number in the original sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle and explains the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    a = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The given sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, a))}, ...\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the relationship between terms.
