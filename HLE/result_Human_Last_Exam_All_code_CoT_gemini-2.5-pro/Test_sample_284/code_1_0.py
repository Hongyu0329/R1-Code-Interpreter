    This function calculates the critical exponent p for a spectral synthesis problem.

    The problem asks for the largest p such that no L^p function on R^n
    can have its Fourier support on a d-dimensional manifold.

    The critical exponent is given by the formula p_c = 2n/d.
    The property holds for p > p_c. The question asks for the boundary value p_c.
