    "To find the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta), we will use the principles of statistical mechanics. The core idea, supported by large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov, is that the equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate that has the highest probability of occurring. This corresponds to the state with the maximum entropy, subject to any physical constraints.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the derivation:\n1.  **Identify the System and Constraints**: We are dealing with a gas of photons. These are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is that the total number of photons is not conserved. Therefore, the only constraint on the system is the conservation of total energy, which we denote as `E`.\n2.  **Maximize Entropy**: The entropy `S` of a system is related to the number of microscopic ways `W` a macroscopic state can be realized (`S = k_B * ln(W)`). We will maximize the entropy `S` for a Bose-Einstein system subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `E = Σ n_i * ε_i`, where `n_i` is the number of photons in the energy level `ε_i`.\n3.  **Find Equilibrium Distribution**: Using the method of Lagrange multipliers to perform this constrained maximization, we will first find the equilibrium distribution of photons among the energy levels, i.e., the average occupation number `<n_i>`. This result is the famous Planck distribution.\n4.  **Derive Equilibrium Energy and Entropy**: With the equilibrium distribution `<n_i>` known, we will substitute it back into the definitions of total energy and entropy to find their functional forms at equilibrium. The total energy `E` is the sum of `ε_i * <n_i>` over all levels. The entropy `S` can be calculated either by plugging `<n_i>` into the statistical formula for entropy or by using the thermodynamic relationship involving the free energy.\n\nThe following Python script will print out the final formulas for the equilibrium mean energy `E` and entropy `S`.\n\n```python\ndef print_equilibrium_formulas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the equilibrium formulas for the mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas (Bose case) based on statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script provides the equilibrium values (formulas) for mean energy (E) and entropy (S) for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe derivation is based on maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy subject to energy conservation.\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
