    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. The two are distinct individuals. Therefore, there is no record of Goodluck Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that prints a clear explanation of this fact to address the user's query.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_clarification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"Based on public records, the full name of the former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\\n\"\n        \"The name 'Azikiwe' is not part of his registered name.\\n\"\n        \"The user might be thinking of Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria (from 1963 to 1966).\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, there is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' because it is not his name.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_name_clarification()\n```\n<<<There is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe, as that is not his name. The name likely being confused is that of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.>>>"
