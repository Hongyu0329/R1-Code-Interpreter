    "My plan is to first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for the specific philosophical distinction mentioned. Based on my knowledge of Polish philosophy and semiotics, the concept of decomposing a \"hallmark\" (or *cecha* in Polish) into \"symptoms\" (fallible indicators) and \"signals\" (infallible, meaning-constitutive indicators) is a key contribution of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\nI will then create a simple Python script to present this answer, as requested by the prompt's format. The script will store the philosopher's name in a variable and then print it out in a full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher\n    who distinguished between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is {philosopher}.\")\n\nsolve_philosophy_question()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
