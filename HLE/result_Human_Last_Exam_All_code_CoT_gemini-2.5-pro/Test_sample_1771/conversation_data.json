    "This problem requires us to trace the linguistic evolution of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word through several stages of the Germanic language family. This is done by applying a series of established sound laws.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE Root:** Start with `*seh₂gieti` and identify the key sounds that will change.\n2.  **Apply changes for Proto-Germanic (PGmc):**\n    *   **Laryngeal Coloring:** The `*h₂` laryngeal changes the preceding `*e` to `*ā` and is then lost.\n    *   **Vowel Shift:** PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Reconstruct the Verb:** The PIE suffix `*-ieti` becomes the PGmc suffix for Class 1 weak verbs, yielding the infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n3.  **Derive the Daughter Languages from PGmc `*sōkijaną`:**\n    *   **For Old Norse (ON):** Apply i-umlaut, where the `*j` in the suffix fronts the root vowel `*ō` to `œ`.\n    *   **For Old English (OE):** Apply i-umlaut (`*ō` > `ē`) and then palatalization, where the `*k` becomes `ċ` (`[tʃ]`) before the new front vowel.\n    *   **For Old High German (OHG):** Apply the High German Consonant Shift, where `*k` becomes `hh` (`[x]`) after a vowel, and the vowel shift where `*ō` becomes `uo`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the results for each stage.\n\n```python\ndef trace_linguistic_evolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the evolution of a PIE word through Germanic languages\n    by printing the application of sound laws.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    print(f\"Starting with the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form: {pie}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Proto-Germanic\n    print(\"--- 1.
