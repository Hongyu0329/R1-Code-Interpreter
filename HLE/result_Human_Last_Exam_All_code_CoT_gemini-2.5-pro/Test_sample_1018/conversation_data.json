    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface**: The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$.\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product**: For two closed, orientable manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M_1 \\times M_2$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $\\|M_1 \\times M_2\\| = \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\|$.\n    In our case, $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are surfaces, so their dimension is 2. Thus, $n_1 = 2$ and $n_2 = 2$.\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, we calculate the simplicial volume of each surface:\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 120$\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 64$\n    *   Next, we calculate the binomial coefficient:\n        *   $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$\n    *   Finally, we multiply these values together according to the product formula:\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Step 2: Define the dimensions of the surfaces.\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface Sigma_g is 4g - 4.\nsv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\nsv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_{g1} is ||Sigma_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_{g2} is ||Sigma_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula.\n# The formula is C(n1+n2, n1).\nC = math.comb(n1 + n2, n1)\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the product formula is C({n1+n2}, {n1}) = {C}\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the simplicial volume of the product.\n# ||Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2|| = C(n1+n2, n1) * ||Sigma_g1|| * ||Sigma_g2||\nresult = C * sv1 * sv2\n\n# Step 6: Print the final calculation and result.\nprint(\"\\nThe final computation is:\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{g1} x Sigma_{g2}|| = {C} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
