    Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA.
            This is a directed ortho-metalation reaction where the amide and amino
            groups synergistically direct lithiation to position 2.
            
    Step 2: The resulting aryllithium intermediate is quenched with methyl iodide.
            The lithium at position 2 is replaced by a methyl group.
