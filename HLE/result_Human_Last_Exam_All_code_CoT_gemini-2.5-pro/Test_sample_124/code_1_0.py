    # Based on the step-by-step analysis:
    # A: True. For exact inference on general graphs, JTA is asymptotically optimal.
    # B: False. JTA is not resilient to high treewidth.
    # C: True. JTA nodes (cliques) hold potentials representing joint distributions.
    # D: False. Premise is false.
    # E: True. This is the main limitation of JTA.
    # F: False. Same as D.
    # G: True. The reason for non-resilience is the need for joint distributions over large cliques.
    # H: False. Efficiency diminishes exponentially, not linearly.
    # I: True. Complexity is exponential in the size of the largest clique.
    # J: False.
    # L: True. This is a correct characterization of the running intersection property.
