    "The user is asking for the common name of a specific mathematical transformation of a physical function used in the field of nuclear criticality.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Function and Transformation:** The function is the \"generalized pair correlation function,\" which describes the probability of finding two neutrons at specific positions and times. The transformation is a \"space-time, double Fourier transform.\" In physics, when dealing with correlation functions, this typically means a Fourier transform with respect to the difference in spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$) and the difference in time coordinates ($t = t_2 - t_1$).\n2.  **Identify the Resulting Physical Quantity:** The Fourier transform of a correlation function in the time domain yields a power spectrum in the frequency domain. Therefore, the result is a Power Spectral Density (PSD).\n3.  **Find the Specific Name:** In the nuclear engineering and criticality safety community, the analysis of neutron population fluctuations is called \"neutron noise analysis.\" The fundamental equation describing the power spectral density of these fluctuations, derived from first principles and analogous to the shot noise in electronic circuits, is known as the **Schottky formula**.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** I will create a simple Python script that uses the `print()` function to state the name of this quantity and display the core mathematical form of the well-known simplified model for it, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef get_transform_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name for the space-time, double Fourier\n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function in nuclear criticality.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The quantity is the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron fluctuations (or \"noise\").\n    # A famous and fundamental model for this quantity in the nuclear community is the Schottky formula.\n    name = \"Schottky formula for the Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density\"\n\n    print(\"In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is known as the:\")\n    print(f\"'{name}'\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n    print(\"This describes the frequency spectrum of neutron population fluctuations.\")\n    print(\"A simplified version for a point reactor, considering only prompt neutrons, has the following frequency dependence:\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting the \"numbers\" in the final equation.\n    # We will represent the components of this famous equation as text.\n    numerator = \"S\"\n    denominator_part_1 = \"alpha^2\"\n    denominator_part_2 = \"omega^2\"\n\n    print(f\"PSD(omega) = {numerator} / ({denominator_part_1} + {denominator_part_2})\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where the terms in the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  '{numerator}': The noise source strength, related to fission rate and the statistical nature of neutron emission.\")\n    print(f\"  '{denominator_part_1}': The square of the prompt neutron decay constant, 'alpha' (also known as the Rossi-alpha).\")\n    print(f\"  '{denominator_part_2}': The square of the angular frequency, 'omega'.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_transform_name()\n```\n<<<Schottky formula>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function commonly called in the nuclear criticality community? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
