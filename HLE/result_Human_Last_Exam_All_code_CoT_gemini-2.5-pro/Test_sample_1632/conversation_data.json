    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. There is no simple mathematical formula for this, so we will use a computational approach.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Backtracking Algorithm:** I will implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible paths starting from the origin (0,0).\n2.  **Path Representation:** The path will be stored as a set of visited coordinates. Using a set allows for efficient O(1) average time complexity for checking if a point has already been visited.\n3.  **Recursive Function:** The core of the solution will be a function, `count_saw(x, y, n, visited)`, which calculates the number of `n`-step self-avoiding walks starting from position `(x, y)`, given the set of `visited` points.\n4.  **Base Case:** The recursion terminates when the number of remaining steps `n` becomes 0. This indicates that a valid walk of the desired length has been found, and the function returns 1.\n5.  **Recursive Step:** For each of the four possible directions (North, South, East, West), the function calculates the next position. If the new position has not been visited, it adds it to the visited set and makes a recursive call for a walk with `n-1` remaining steps. The results from all valid directions are summed up.\n6.  **Symmetry Optimization:** To reduce computation time, I will leverage the symmetry of the square lattice. The number of walks starting with a step in any of the four cardinal directions is the same. Therefore, I can calculate the number of walks that start with a specific first step (e.g., North, from (0,0) to (0,1)) and then multiply the result by 4 to get the total number of walks.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate a(10).\n\n```python\ndef count_saw(x, y, n, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n    Args:\n        x: The current x-coordinate.\n        y: The current y-coordinate.\n        n: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n        visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing the path taken so far.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of n-step self-avoiding walks from the current position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    count = 0\n    # Define the four possible moves: North, South, East, West.\n    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    # Explore each possible move.\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        \n        # If the next position has not been visited yet.\n        if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            # Add the new position to the visited set for the recursive call.\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            # Recursively call the function for the next step.\n            count += count_saw(nx, ny, n - 1, visited)\n            # Backtrack: remove the new position to explore other paths from the current state.\n            visited.remove((nx, ny))\n    \n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 10\n    \n    # We use symmetry to speed up the calculation.
