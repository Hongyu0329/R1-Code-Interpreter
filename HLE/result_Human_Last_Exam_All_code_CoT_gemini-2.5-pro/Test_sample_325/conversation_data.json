    "To solve this problem, we need to find the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the given curve. This value is determined by the geometry of the curve and the dimension of the ambient space. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifold and Space:** The problem gives a curve, which is a 1-dimensional manifold, in the space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. So the dimension of the space is $d=3$.\n\n2.  **Check for Non-Degeneracy:** The sharp exponent formula applies to \"non-degenerate\" curves. A curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is non-degenerate if its velocity, acceleration, and higher derivatives up to order $d$ (i.e., $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(d)}(t)$) are linearly independent. For the given helix $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, it is a standard result that this curve is non-degenerate. This can be verified by showing that the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent for all $t$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Decoupling Theorem Formula:** The renowned $l^2$ Decoupling Theorem by Bourgain and Demeter establishes the sharp decoupling exponent for non-degenerate curves. For a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling inequality holds for the exponent $p \\ge p_{crit}$, where the critical exponent $p_{crit}$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ p_{crit} = \\frac{2(d+1)}{d-1} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Exponent:** We will substitute $d=3$ into this formula to find the specific exponent for the given problem. The following Python code performs this calculation and prints out each step as requested.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the ambient space for the curve is d.\nd = 3\n\n# The formula for the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent p for a non-degenerate\n# curve in R^d is: p = 2 * (d + 1) / (d - 1).\n\n# Numerator of the formula\nnumerator = 2 * (d + 1)\n\n# Denominator of the formula\ndenominator = d - 1\n\n# Calculate the final exponent p\np = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation of the exponent\nprint(\"The formula for the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent p is:\")\nprint(\"p = 2 * (d + 1) / (d - 1)\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The given curve is in R^3, so the dimension d = {d}.\")\nprint(\"Substituting d = 3 into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"p = 2 * ({d} + 1) / ({d} - 1)\")\nprint(f\"p = 2 * {d + 1} / {d - 1}\")\nprint(f\"p = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"p = {p}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
