    The incorrect statement is C.

    Here is the reasoning:
    During the Tang and Song dynasties, it was indeed a custom for brides to use a fan to cover their faces when leaving their homes. This practice was known as 'zhang shan' (障扇).

    However, the statement specifies the use of 'folding fans' (摺扇, zheshan). This is historically inaccurate for the period. The type of fan used for this custom was the rigid, round silk fan (團扇, tuanshan).

    Folding fans were introduced to China from Japan or Korea around the Northern Song Dynasty but did not become widely popular or commonly used until the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, the claim that brides customarily used 'folding fans' during the Tang and Song dynasties is incorrect. The other statements are generally accurate descriptions of the customs in their respective eras.
