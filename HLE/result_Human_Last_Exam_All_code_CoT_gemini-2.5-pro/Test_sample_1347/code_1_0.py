    # --- Component 1: Number of grass areas ignited by one tree ---
    # A single burning tree ignites grass at a rate of (b * pg).
    # A burning tree's "burning period" ends if it's extinguished (rate 𝛾t) or if it naturally dies (rate 𝜇t).
    # So, the total rate of removal for a burning tree is (𝛾t + 𝜇t).
    # The average burning period is the reciprocal of this rate: 1 / (𝛾t + 𝜇t).
    # Number of grass ignited = (rate of ignition) * (average burning period)
    component1 = "(b * pg) / (𝛾t + 𝜇t)"

    # --- Component 2: Probability of ignited grass becoming infectious ---
    # After being ignited, grass enters a latent period. It can either become intensely burning (at rate τ)
    # or die naturally (at rate 𝜇g). These are competing processes.
    # The probability of it successfully becoming intensely burning is the ratio of the success rate to the total rate of exiting the latent state.
    # Probability = (rate of becoming infectious) / (total rate of leaving latent state)
    component2 = "τ / (τ + 𝜇g)"

    # --- Component 3: Number of trees ignited by one infectious grass area ---
    # An intensely burning grass ignites trees at a rate of (c * pt).
    # It stops burning when it dies, which happens at a rate of 𝜇g.
    # The average burning period for grass is the reciprocal of this rate: 1 / 𝜇g.
    # Number of trees ignited = (rate of ignition) * (average burning period)
    component3 = "(c * pt) / 𝜇g"
