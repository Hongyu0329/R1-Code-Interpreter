    # This is a key observation about the surface fluid dynamics.
    
    # Let's analyze the forces:
    # B. Arc Drag, C. Arc Pressure, and D. Lorentz Force all generally cause an outward
    # or downward-and-outward flow from the center of the arc. This contradicts the observation.
    
    # E. Buoyancy Force is a body force related to density and is generally weaker than
    # the surface forces in GTAW, and does not primarily explain the strong inward surface flow.
    
    # A. Marangoni Force is driven by gradients in surface tension. Fluid flows from low
    # surface tension to high surface tension.
    # In materials like 304 stainless steel, the presence of surface-active elements (like sulfur)
    # causes the temperature coefficient of surface tension to be positive.
    # This means the hottest part of the pool (the center) has the HIGHEST surface tension.
    # Therefore, the fluid on the surface flows from the cooler outer edges (low tension)
    # inwards to the hotter center (high tension).

    print("The inward flow is caused by a surface tension gradient. In stainless steels, trace elements like sulfur cause surface tension to increase with temperature. The liquid metal flows from the cooler outer edges (lower surface tension) to the hotter center (higher surface tension). This phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect or Marangoni force.")
