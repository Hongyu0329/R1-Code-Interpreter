# Step 1: Define the problem based on the dominant balance analysis.
# The asymptotic solution is of the form y(x) = A * x^n.
# The analysis showed that n = -1 and A must satisfy the equation A^3 = -6.

# Step 2: Solve for the coefficient A.
# We need the real cube root of -6.
A_cubed = -6
# In Python, we can calculate this as -(6^(1/3)).
A_exact = -math.pow(abs(A_cubed), 1/3)

# Step 3: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.
A_rounded = round(A_exact, 2)

# Step 4: Define the exponent n.
n = -1

# Step 5: Print the final analytical expression, showing each number in the equation.
