    "My plan is to identify the specific protein based on the biological process described. The process involves a protein being \"broken down\" (cleaved) to tag amyloid, which then signals macrophages for \"engulfment\" (phagocytosis). This describes the process of opsonization, a key function of the immune system's complement cascade. I will identify the central protein in this pathway and then write a Python script to print its name and a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the protein that, when broken down,\n    facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3\"\n    protein_abbreviation = \"C3\"\n    \n    # The breakdown product that tags the amyloid is C3b.\n    breakdown_product = \"C3b\"\n    \n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name} ({protein_abbreviation}).\")\n    print(f\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(f\"{protein_name} is a key part of the immune system's complement cascade.\")\n    print(f\"It is cleaved (broken down) into fragments, including {breakdown_product}.\")\n    print(f\"{breakdown_product} binds to the surface of targets like amyloid plaques, a process called opsonization.\")\n    print(\"This acts as an 'eat me' signal, allowing macrophages and microglia to recognize and engulf the amyloid.\")\n\nfind_protein()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
