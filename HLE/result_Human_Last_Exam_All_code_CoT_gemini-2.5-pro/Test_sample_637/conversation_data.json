    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the observer error dynamics at the origin (z=0).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The observer dynamics are given by `x_hat(k+1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`. The error dynamics are `e(k+1) = (A - L*C)*e(k)`. For a deadbeat observer, we want to choose `L` such that all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - L*C)` are zero. This makes the matrix nilpotent, ensuring the error `e(k)` becomes zero in a finite number of steps (at most `n`, the order of the system).\n\n2.  **Use the Duality Principle**: The problem of finding an observer gain `L` to place the poles of `(A - L*C)` is dual to the problem of finding a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the system defined by `(A.T, C.T)`. Specifically, the eigenvalues of `(A - L*C)` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A.T - C.T * K)`, where `L = K.T`.\n\n3.  **Apply Pole Placement**: We will solve the dual problem: find a controller gain `K` that places all poles of the system `(A.T, C.T)` at `z=0`. This is a standard pole placement problem. We will use the `place` function from the `python-control` library, which is a robust tool for this task.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Gain**: The Python script will perform the following actions:\n    *   Define the system matrices `A` and `C`.\n    *   Set the desired pole locations for the deadbeat observer, which are all zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n    *   Use `control.place(A.T, C.T, poles)` to calculate the controller gain `K` for the dual system.\n    *   The final observer gain matrix `L` is obtained by transposing `K`.\n    *   The script will then print the resulting gain matrix `L`.\n\nYou may need to install the `python-control` library if you haven't already:\n`pip install control`\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the observer gain matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve_deadbeat_observer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system\n    by calculating the observer gain matrix L.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices from the problem description\n    A = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n                  [ 1, 0, 0, 2],\n                  [ 0, 1, 0, -1],\n                  [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n\n    C = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n    # The state-space dimension is n=4.\n    n = A.shape[0]\n    \n    # For a deadbeat observer, all observer poles must be at the origin.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # First, we check if the system is observable. Pole placement is only\n    # possible for observable systems.\n    observability_matrix = ct.obsv(A, C)\n    if np.linalg.matrix_rank(observability_matrix) < n:\n        print(\"The system is not observable, so arbitrary pole placement is not possible.\")\n        return\n\n    # We solve the dual state-feedback controller problem.\n    # The dual system is (A.T, C.T). We want to find a gain K such that\n    # the eigenvalues of (A.T - C.T * K) are the desired poles.\n    # The control.place function finds K for (A - B*K), so we use A.T as the\n    # system matrix and C.T as the input matrix.\n    try:\n        K = ct.place(A.T, C.T, desired_poles)\n\n        # The observer gain L is the transpose of the controller gain K.\n        L = K.T\n\n        print(\"The deadbeat observer gain matrix L is:\")\n        # Print each row of the matrix for clarity\n        for i, row in enumerate(L):\n            print(f\"  Row {i+1}: {row}\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during pole placement: {e}\")\n\n# Run the function to get the solution\nsolve_deadbeat_observer()\n\n```\n<<<[[ 0., -1.], [ 2.,  1.], [-1., -1.], [-1.,  1.]]>>>"
