def solve_riddle():
    """
    This function solves the riddle based on geographical and historical clues.

    The key clues are:
    1.  The contrast between smoggy 19th-century northern European cities and Milan.
    2.  Something visible from Milan in clear air that wouldn't be seen in smog.
    3.  The subject is plural ("THEM").

    The solution is the Alps mountain range, which is famously visible from Milan on clear days.
    The "imagination" clue refers to the Romantic-era appreciation of the sublime beauty of nature.
    "Kasimir Graf" is a red herring.
