    "My plan is to solve this geographical riddle by breaking down the clues.\n\n1.  **Remoteness**: The key clue \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\" points to one of the most isolated places on Earth. Top candidates are Easter Island (Rapa Nui) and Tristan da Cunha.\n2.  **Geography**: The town \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\". This means the location is volcanic. Both Easter Island and Tristan da Cunha are volcanic.\n3.  **Naming**: The town, bay, and caldera \"shares the town's name\". This is the crucial clue for identifying the exact place.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. This name doesn't match a bay or caldera.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: The main town is **Hanga Roa**. It is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. This perfectly matches the clue that the town and bay share a name. The entire island is a volcanic structure, and the bay is a feature created by this volcanism, which fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Hanga Roa. I will now write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: Extreme remoteness (> 500km from another inhabited island).\n    # This points to Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    # The distance from Easter Island to the nearest inhabited land (Pitcairn Islands)\n    # is over 2,000 kilometers.\n    distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km = 2075 # Approx. to Pitcairn\n\n    # Clue 2: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    # Easter Island is a volcanic island.\n\n    # Clue 3: The town, bay, and caldera share the town's name.\n    # The main town on Easter Island is Hanga Roa.\n    # The town is located on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    # The name matches for the town and the bay.\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n\n    print(f\"The riddle describes an island town more than {500} kilometers from another inhabited island.\")\n    print(f\"The town sits on a bay that shares its name.\")\n    print(f\"Based on these clues, the answer is the main town on Easter Island.\")\n    print(f\"Town Name: {town_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
