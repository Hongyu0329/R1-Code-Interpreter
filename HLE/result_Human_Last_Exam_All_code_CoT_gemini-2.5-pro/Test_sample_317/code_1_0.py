    """
    Analyzes Kenneth Burke's concept of the "Tribal No"
    to determine if it falls within the realm of motion or action.
    """

    # Step 1: Define Burke's core concepts.
    # Motion: The realm of the non-symbolic, the merely physical and biological.
    # It is behavior without intent or choice. E.g., a planet orbits, a body digests.
    motion_description = "Non-symbolic, physical, without choice or motive."

    # Action: The realm of the symbolic. It involves language, choice, motive,
    # and interpretation. It is the sphere of human drama and morality.
    action_description = "Symbolic, motivated, involves language and choice."

    # A crucial element of Action is "The Negative," the ability to say "no."
    # Burke argues that the negative does not exist in nature (the realm of Motion).
    # A tree is a tree; it is not "not a chair." The concept of "not" is a human,
    # linguistic invention.

    # Step 2: Characterize the "Tribal No."
    # The "Tribal No" refers to the foundational prohibitions, taboos, and commandments
    # that structure a society (e.g., "Thou shalt not...").
    # These are fundamentally linguistic and symbolic constructs designed to
    # govern behavior.

    # Step 3: Classify the "Tribal No" and evaluate the options.
    # Since the "Tribal No" is a product of language and governs choice, it is
    # definitively in the realm of Action, not Motion. This eliminates B and D.
    
    options = {
        'A': 'Action; it is imaginal.',
        'B': 'Motion; it is abstract.',
        'C': 'Neither; the Tribal No is in the realm of social imagination.',
        'D': 'Motion; it is sensory.',
        'E': 'Action; it is rational.'
    }

    # Analysis of remaining options:
    # C is incorrect because "social imagination" is precisely what Burke means by
    # the symbolic realm of Action. It's not a separate category.
    #
    # We must choose between A and E.
    # E ('Action; it is rational'): While some prohibitions might be based on reason,
    # many "Tribal Nos" are rooted in myth, tradition, or religion, which are not
    # strictly "rational."
    #
    # A ('Action; it is imaginal.'): This is the best fit. For Burke, the ability
    # to conceive of the negative—of what is *not* the case, of what one *should not*
    # do—is an act of imagination. It requires a symbolic leap beyond the tangible
    # reality of Motion. This imaginal capacity is what gives rise to the "Tribal No."
