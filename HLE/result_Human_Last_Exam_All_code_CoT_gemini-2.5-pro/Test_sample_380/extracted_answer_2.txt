No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial. The use of "Y and Z components" to calculate helicity for field-aligned waves like AICs is justified because the analysis is performed in a **Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system**. In this system, the coordinates have been mathematically rotated so that the new X-axis is parallel to the local average magnetic field. Therefore, the new Y and Z components are, by definition, the components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, which is the correct physical basis for the calculation.
