    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the corresponding Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The problem requires using the epsilon (`ϵ`) expansion from renormalization group theory to find a critical exponent. This method works by performing a perturbation expansion around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n2.  **Define Key Parameters:**\n    *   The spatial dimension is given as `d = 3`.\n    *   For the universality class containing the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n    *   The expansion parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n    *   The problem concerns the specific heat exponent `α`. We will need the general formula for `α` to first order in `ϵ`.\n    *   The formula depends on `n`, the number of components of the order parameter. We will assume the most common case, the Ising model, where `n=1`.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` in an `n`-component model is given by:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   Calculate `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n    *   Substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula.\n    *   Solve for `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the steps clearly, including the formula with the substituted numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n\n    In renormalization group theory, the epsilon expansion is used to calculate\n    critical exponents near the upper critical dimension (d_c). For the Ising\n    universality class, d_c = 4. The expansion is done in terms of the\n    small parameter epsilon = d_c - d.\n\n    The formula for the specific heat exponent alpha to first order in epsilon\n    for an n-component model is:\n    alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    # Upper critical dimension for this model class\n    d_c = 4\n    # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for the Ising model)\n    n = 1\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # 1. Calculate the expansion parameter epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # 2. Calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n    # 3.
