    "The reaction described is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and it is being treated with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze E2 Stereochemistry**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. For a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (both in axial positions, on adjacent carbons, pointing in opposite directions).\n\n3.  **Determine the Substrate's Structure**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry signifies that the bromo group and the methyl group are on opposite sides of the ring, making them *trans* to each other.\n\n4.  **Find the Reactive Conformation**: A cyclohexane ring exists as a pair of rapidly interconverting chair conformations. The E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is in an **axial** position.\n    *   In a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, if one substituent is axial, the other must also be axial.\n    *   Therefore, the reactive conformation is the one where both the bromine atom (on C1) and the methyl group (on C2) are in axial positions. Although this diaxial conformation is less stable than the diequatorial one, the reaction must proceed through it.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**: With the Br locked in an axial position, we examine the β-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: Since the methyl group is axial, the hydrogen on C2 must be equatorial. An equatorial hydrogen cannot be trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Thus, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (which would give 1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) is **not possible**.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen is perfectly positioned in a trans-diaxial arrangement relative to the axial bromine.\n    \n6.  **Conclusion**: The base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6. Consequently, the double bond forms between carbon C1 and C6. The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and\n    identifies the major product based on stereochemical requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the E2 elimination of {substrate} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the reactive chair conformation, the Br group must be axial.\")\n    print(\"Because the substrate is the trans isomer, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon must also be axial.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nEvaluating elimination pathways:\")\n    print(\"  1.
