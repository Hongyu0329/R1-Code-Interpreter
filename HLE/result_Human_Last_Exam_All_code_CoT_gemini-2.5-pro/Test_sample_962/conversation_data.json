    "This problem requires designing a t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme that is both secure and efficient, specifically completing the signing process in only two rounds. The Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme provides an excellent foundation for this, leading to the well-regarded Boldyreva scheme.\n\n### Plan and Design Explanation\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan for designing and implementing such a scheme.\n\n1.  **Foundation: BLS Signatures**\n    *   We will use BLS signatures, which are based on elliptic curve pairings. Their key feature is **signature aggregation**: multiple signatures can be combined into a single, compact signature. This is what makes a non-interactive, two-round protocol possible.\n\n2.  **Key Generation: Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**\n    *   To operate without a trusted party, a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol is used. For simplicity in this demonstration, we will simulate a \"trusted dealer\" to set up the keys.\n    *   **Step 1:** The dealer defines a secret polynomial `f(x)` of degree `t-1`, like `f(x) = a₀ + a₁x + ... + a_{t-1}x^{t-1}`. The coefficients `aᵢ` are random numbers.\n    *   **Step 2:** The master secret key for the entire group is `sk = f(0) = a₀`. The master public key is `pk = g * sk`, where `g` is a generator point on the elliptic curve.\n    *   **Step 3:** Each of the `n` participants `Pᵢ` is given a secret key share `skᵢ = f(i)`.\n\n3.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds)**\n    *   Let's assume a subset `S` of `t` participants wants to sign a message `m`.\n    *   **Round 1: Partial Signatures**\n        *   Each participant `Pᵢ` in the set `S` independently computes a *partial signature* using their secret share: `partial_sigᵢ = skᵢ * H(m)`, where `H(m)` is the message hashed to a point on the curve.\n        *   Each participant sends their partial signature to a designated coordinator (who can be one of the signers).\n    *   **Round 2: Aggregation**\n        *   The coordinator collects `t` partial signatures. To combine them, the coordinator uses **Lagrange Interpolation**. The goal is to combine the `partial_sigᵢ` values in a way that corresponds to the master secret `sk`.\n        *   The coordinator computes a Lagrange coefficient `Lᵢ` for each signer `i`. This coefficient is calculated as `Lᵢ = ∏ (j / (j - i))` for all other signers `j` in the set `S`.\n        *   The final, complete signature `σ` is then calculated by summing the partial signatures weighted by their Lagrange coefficients: `σ = ∑ (Lᵢ * partial_sigᵢ)`.\n        *   By the properties of Lagrange interpolation, `∑ (Lᵢ * skᵢ) = sk`, which means `σ = sk * H(m)`. This is a valid BLS signature for the master public key.\n\nThis design is tightly secure and completes in two rounds of communication: one for distributing partial signatures and one for the coordinator to aggregate and publish the final signature.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this two-round signing protocol. It simulates the key generation and then executes the signing and aggregation steps, printing out the components of the final signature equation.\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom typing import List, Set, Tuple\n\n# This code requires the 'py_ecc' library.\n# You can install it using: pip install py_ecc\nfrom py_ecc.bls import G2_uncompressed as g2, hash_to_g1, sign, verify, aggregate_signatures, aggregate_pubkeys\nfrom py_ecc.bls.ciphersuites import G2_BASIC\nfrom py_ecc.bls.utils import privtopub\nfrom py_ecc.typing import BLSPubkey, BLSSignature, G1Uncompressed\n\n# Curve parameters from the BLS12-381 standard\nCURVE_ORDER = 25519106679412162953284894144439160937929038198753384803433583258833938633393\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef modular_inverse(a: int, m: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m using Fermat's Little Theorem.\"\"\"\n    return pow(a, m - 2, m)\n\ndef get_lagrange_coeff(signer_id: int, signer_ids: Set[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Lagrange basis polynomial L_i(0) for a given signer_id.\n    L_i(0) = product of (j / (j - i)) for all j in signer_ids where j != i.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = 1\n    for j in signer_ids:\n        if j != signer_id:\n            numerator = (numerator * j) % CURVE_ORDER\n            denominator = (denominator * (j - signer_id)) % CURVE_ORDER\n    return (numerator * modular_inverse(denominator, CURVE_ORDER)) % CURVE_ORDER\n\ndef aggregate_partial_signatures(\n    partial_sigs: List[BLSSignature],\n    lagrange_coeffs: List[int]\n) -> BLSSignature:\n    \"\"\"\n    Aggregates partial signatures using their Lagrange coefficients.\n    sigma = sum(lagrange_coeff_i * partial_sig_i)\n    \"\"\"\n    from py_ecc.bls.point_compression import decompress_g1\n    from py_ecc.bls.point_manipulation import add, multiply\n    from py_ecc.bls.point_compression import compress_g1\n\n    # Decompress points to perform elliptic curve operations\n    decompressed_sigs = [decompress_g1(sig) for sig in partial_sigs]\n    \n    # Perform scalar multiplication: lagrange_coeff * partial_sig\n    scaled_sigs = [\n        multiply(sig, coeff) for sig, coeff in zip(decompressed_sigs, lagrange_coeffs)\n    ]\n\n    # Sum the resulting points\n    aggregated_sig_decompressed = scaled_sigs[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(scaled_sigs)):\n        aggregated_sig_decompressed = add(aggregated_sig_decompressed, scaled_sigs[i])\n\n    # Compress the final point back to its signature representation\n    return compress_g1(aggregated_sig_decompressed)\n\n# --- Main Demonstration ---\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Demonstrates a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
