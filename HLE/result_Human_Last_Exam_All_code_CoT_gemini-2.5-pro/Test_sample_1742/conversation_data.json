    "Answering this question requires several concepts from representation theory of algebras, specifically for path algebras. Let's break down the process.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Algebra and its Modules:** The algebra is $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the path algebra of the linearly oriented quiver $A_3$. Its indecomposable modules are well-understood and can be represented as intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules.\n    *   $M_1 = [1,1] = S_1$ (simple module at vertex 1)\n    *   $M_2 = [2,2] = S_2$ (simple module at vertex 2)\n    *   $M_3 = [3,3] = S_3$ (simple module at vertex 3)\n    *   $M_4 = [1,2]$\n    *   $M_5 = [2,3]$\n    *   $M_6 = [1,3]$\n\n2.  **Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules:**\n    *   For a hereditary algebra like this one, a **$\\tau$-tilting module** is the same as a **tilting module**. A tilting module $T$ is a module with three properties:\n        a. It has projective dimension at most 1 (always true for hereditary algebras).\n        b. It is rigid, i.e., $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n        c. It is a generator for the category of A-modules, which means there is a short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to T_0 \\to T_1 \\to 0$ where $T_0, T_1$ are direct sums of copies of summands of $T$. For hereditary algebras, this is equivalent to the module being **sincere** (its support includes all vertices {1, 2, 3}).\n\n    *   A **slice module** is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a **section** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. A section is a specific type of full subquiver that is \"convex\" and \"cuts\" the AR quiver, containing exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit.\n\n3.  **Classify Tilting and Slice Modules for $A_3$:**\n    *   It is a known result (from Happel and Unger) that for the path algebra of $A_3$ with linear orientation, there are exactly **four** basic tilting modules.\n    *   The AR quiver for this algebra has the following structure, with arrows representing irreducible maps:\n    ```\n          [1,3]\n         /     \\\n       [1,2]   [2,3]\n      /     \\ /     \\\n    [1,1]   [2,2]   [3,3]\n    ```\n    *   By checking the convexity property of sections, we can identify which of the four tilting modules are slice modules.\n        *   $T_1 = [1,3] \\oplus [2,3] \\oplus [3,3]$ (the projective modules): This forms a section and is a **slice module**.\n        *   $T_2 = [1,3] \\oplus [1,2] \\oplus [1,1]$ (the injective modules): This forms a section and is a **slice module**.\n        *   $T_3 = [1,3] \\oplus [1,2] \\oplus [2,2]$: This forms a section and is a **slice module**.\n        *   $T_4 = [1,3] \\oplus [2,3] \\oplus [2,2]$: The set of summands $\\{[1,3], [2,3], [2,2]\\}$ is not a section because it is not convex. The path of irreducible maps $[2,2] \\to [1,2] \\to [1,3]$ has its endpoints in the set, but the intermediate module $[1,2]$ is not in the set. Therefore, this is **not a slice module**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Unique Module:** Based on the classification, there is only one tilting module that is not a slice. This is $T_4$.\n\n5.  **Present the Answer:** The module is the direct sum of the indecomposables $[1,3]$, $[2,3]$, and $[2,2]$. We can represent these modules by their dimension vectors (the dimension of the vector space at each vertex).\n    *   $[1,3]$ has dimension vector $(1,1,1)$.\n    *   $[2,3]$ has dimension vector $(0,1,1)$.\n    *   $[2,2]$ has dimension vector $(0,1,0)$.\n\nThe following Python code will define these modules and print the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice for the\n    path algebra A = C(1 -> 2 -> 3) and prints its composition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For the path algebra of the quiver 1 -> 2 -> 3, it is a known result\n    # that there are four basic tilting modules.
