    "To answer this question, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will first search for a list of all French ships that were sunk by German U-boats during World War II.\n2.  I will filter this list to include only the ships sunk before the Franco-German armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940.\n3.  For each ship in the filtered list, I will find its displacement, typically measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) for merchant vessels.\n4.  Finally, I will identify the ship with the highest displacement from this list to determine the answer.\n\nBased on this research, the ship in question is the oil tanker **Sheherazade**. I will now generate a Python script to present this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ship details based on historical records\n    ship_name = \"Sheherazade\"\n    ship_type = \"oil tanker\"\n    displacement_grt = 13467\n    sinking_date = \"June 21, 1940\"\n    u_boat = \"U-47\"\n    armistice_date = \"June 22, 1940\"\n\n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of {armistice_date} was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {sinking_date} by the German submarine {u_boat}.\")\n    print(f\"The ship's displacement was {displacement_grt} GRT (Gross Register Tonnage).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Sheherazade>>>"
