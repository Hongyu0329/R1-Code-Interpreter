    "To find an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (also known as the $6_1$ knot) using Vogel's algorithm, we will apply the algorithm's formula to the knot's standard minimal crossing diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Knot Diagram**: We start with the standard minimal 6-crossing diagram of the three-twist knot. We will determine the number of Seifert circles, which correspond to the vertices in the Seifert graph. Let this number be `c2`.\n2.  **Construct the Seifert Graph**: We determine the properties of the Seifert graph associated with the diagram. This includes the number of vertices (`c2`), the number of edges (equal to the number of crossings), and the sign of each edge. For a standard diagram of the $6_1$ knot with writhe -6, all crossings are negative.\n3.  **Find the Optimal Spanning Tree**: Vogel's formula depends on a spanning tree of the Seifert graph. To get the best (lowest) upper bound, we must choose a spanning tree that maximizes a value `c1`, which is the sum of the signs of the edges *not* in the tree (the co-tree).\n4.  **Apply Vogel's Formula**: We use the formula for the upper bound on the braid index `b(K)`:\n    `b(K) <= c2 - c1`\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**: We will substitute the values of `c2` and the maximized `c1` into the formula to compute the upper bound.\n\nThis entire process will be implemented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_vogel_bound_for_three_twist_knot():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (6_1)\n    using Vogel's algorithm on its standard minimal diagram.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define properties of the Seifert graph for the 6_1 knot.\n    # The knot is the three-twist knot, 6_1.
