# The problem simplifies to calculating 2**81, as shown in the step-by-step derivation.
# The complex expression for f(p) is constructed to be independent of the specific large prime p.

# The final equation is f(p) = 2^81
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# Print the numbers in the final equation and the result
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the equation: f(p) = {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The value of f(p) is: {result}")
