    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Diagram:** The problem describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions. In a typical scalar field theory (like $\\lambda\\phi^4$), this corresponds to a vacuum diagram where two interaction vertices are connected to each other by four propagators. This is sometimes called a \"melon\" diagram.\n\n2.  **Understand the Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, denoted as 'S', is a crucial concept in quantum field theory. It's an integer that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams that arise from Wick's theorem expansion. The value of S is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which means it's the number of ways you can permute the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) without changing its structure.\n\n3.  **Identify the Symmetries:** We need to find all the permutations of the diagram's elements that leave it unchanged.\n    *   **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are identical. If we swap their positions, the diagram remains exactly the same. The number of ways to permute these two vertices is $2! = 2$.\n    *   **Propagator (Line) Symmetry:** The four propagators connect the same two vertices. They are functionally identical, and we can interchange any of them without altering the diagram's topology. The number of ways to permute these four lines is $4! = 24$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the individual symmetry factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n    *   S = (Vertex Symmetry Factor) Ã— (Propagator Symmetry Factor)\n    *   S = $2! \\times 4!$\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that calculates this value using the `math.factorial` function and prints the final equation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be permuted\n    num_vertices = 2\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the two vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting vertices\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting propagators\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"The symmetry factor (S) is the product of the symmetries from permuting identical vertices and identical propagators.\")\n    print(\"\\nS = (Symmetry of vertices) * (Symmetry of propagators)\")\n    print(f\"S = {num_vertices}! * {num_propagators}!\")\n    print(f\"S = {vertex_symmetry} * {propagator_symmetry}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated symmetry factor is: {total_symmetry_factor}\")\n\ncalculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
