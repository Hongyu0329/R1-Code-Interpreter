    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC:\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: First, I'll find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec.\n2.  **Identify Candidates**: By looking at a map of Canada, the two closest candidates outside of Quebec are the province of Ontario (to the west and south across the southern part of James Bay) and the territory of Nunavut (which includes Akimiski Island, north-west of Waskaganish in James Bay).\n3.  **Find Closest Points**: I will identify the coordinates for the closest point in Ontario (the ON/QC border on James Bay) and the closest point in Nunavut (the southeastern tip of Akimiski Island).\n4.  **Calculate Distances**: I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance from Waskaganish to both the Ontario and Nunavut points.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: Finally, I will compare the two distances to determine which province or territory is closer.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform these calculations and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance in kilometers between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n\n    distance = R * c\n    return distance\n\n# Coordinates for the locations\n# 1. Waskaganish, Quebec\nwaskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.1944, -78.7592\n\n# 2. Closest point in Ontario (ON/QC border on James Bay coast)\nontario_lat, ontario_lon = 51.47, -79.50\n\n# 3. Closest point in Nunavut (SE tip of Akimiski Island)\nnunavut_lat, nunavut_lon = 52.90, -81.30\n\n# Calculate distances\ndist_to_ontario = haversine_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, ontario_lat, ontario_lon)\ndist_to_nunavut = haversine_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, nunavut_lat, nunavut_lon)\n\n# Print the comparison\nprint(f\"Finding the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC ({waskaganish_lat:.2f} N, {abs(waskaganish_lon):.2f} W)...\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(\"Candidate 1: Ontario\")\nprint(f\"Closest point in Ontario is at {ontario_lat:.2f} N, {abs(ontario_lon):.2f} W.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: distance(Waskaganish({waskaganish_lat}, {waskaganish_lon}), Ontario({ontario_lat}, {ontario_lon}))\")\nprint(f\"Result: The distance is approximately {dist_to_ontario:.1f} km.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(\"Candidate 2: Nunavut\")\nprint(f\"Closest point in Nunavut is at {nunavut_lat:.2f} N, {abs(nunavut_lon):.2f} W.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: distance(Waskaganish({waskaganish_lat}, {waskaganish_lon}), Nunavut({nunavut_lat}, {nunavut_lon}))\")\nprint(f\"Result: The distance is approximately {dist_to_nunavut:.1f} km.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Determine the closest one\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    closest_location = \"Ontario\"\nelse:\n    closest_location = \"Nunavut\"\n\nprint(f\"Comparing the distances, {closest_location} is closer to Waskaganish than the other candidate.\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"<<<{closest_location}>>>\")\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
