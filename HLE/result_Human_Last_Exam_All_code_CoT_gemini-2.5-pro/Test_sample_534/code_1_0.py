    Solves the topological problem by reasoning about the space's structure.
    
    The space X is the union of the line segment S1 = [0,1]x{0}x{0} and four
    Î -shaped sets P_c = {c} x P for c in {0, 1/4, 1/2, 1}. The sets are all
    connected to S1, so X is a connected space.

    The point of interest is a = (0, 1, 0).
    This point lies on the base of the P_0 set, which is the line segment
    L = {0} x [0,1] x {0}. The point a is an endpoint of this segment.

    We are looking for the intersection, let's call it I, of all compact
    connected neighborhoods of 'a' within X.

    Let's analyze the local structure of X around 'a'. The point 'a' is not
    a limit point of any complex sequence of points; it is simply an endpoint
    of a line segment. The space X near 'a' is just the segment L.

    Consider a family of sets N_eps = {0} x [1-eps, 1] x {0} for any eps > 0.
    1. Each N_eps is a subset of X (it's part of L).
    2. Each N_eps is a closed and bounded line segment, so it is compact and connected.
    3. Each N_eps contains 'a' = (0, 1, 0).
    4. Each N_eps is a neighborhood of 'a' in X, because for any eps > 0, we can
       find a small ball B(a, r) (e.g., with r=eps) such that the intersection
       of the ball with X is contained within N_eps.

    The intersection of all such neighborhoods, I, must therefore be a subset of
    the intersection of all N_eps for eps > 0.
    
    Intersection(N_eps for eps > 0) = Intersection({0} x [1-eps, 1] x {0})
                                     = {0} x {1} x {0}
                                     = {(0, 1, 0)}
                                     = {a}

    Since 'a' must be in I, and I is a subset of {a}, we must have I = {a}.

    The resulting set is a single point. A set with a single point has exactly one
    connected component.
