    print("4. Are there any others? Any other proper subcontinuum C of X must either be a proper subcontinuum of K1 (or K2), or a union of proper subcontinua of both. Since K1 and K2 are indecomposable, any proper subcontinuum of them has an empty interior. Thus, no other proper subcontinuum of X can be regular.")
