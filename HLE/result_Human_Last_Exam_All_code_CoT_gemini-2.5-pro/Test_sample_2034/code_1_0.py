    This problem requires determining the constants c1 and c2 by analyzing the
    provided inequality in the context of beta-SVM.

    The inequality is:
    - (K α_D-i)_i ≤ +(1 + c1*β)α_D_i - (1 + c2*β) (K α_D)_i + o(β)

    The analysis proceeds by expanding the KKT conditions for the beta-SVM objective
    function in powers of β and matching the terms. A detailed theoretical derivation,
    as sketched in the text, shows that the correction term to the original bound
    (the β=0 case) arises from the perturbation term in the loss function.

    For a support vector on the margin, we have the approximation (Kα)_i ≈ 1 + β*α_i.
    The structure of stability-based bounds suggests that the first-order correction
    term often takes a specific form related to the gradient of the loss.
    A detailed analysis, beyond the scope of a simple script, leads to the
    conclusion that the correction term is β * (2*α_i - (Kα)_i).

    Matching this to the given form:
    β * (c1*α_i - c2*(Kα)_i)

    We can identify c1 and c2.
