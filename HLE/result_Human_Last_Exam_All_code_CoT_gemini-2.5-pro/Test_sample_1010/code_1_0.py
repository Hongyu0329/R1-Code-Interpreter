    print("  This means the similarity metric is fundamentally flawed because it makes the distance between two pairs dependent on the magnitudes of their constituent sentence embeddings in a combined, non-intuitive way. For example, a pair of long sentences will have a large denominator, systematically changing its similarity score relative to a pair of short sentences, regardless of the actual paraphrase relationship.")
