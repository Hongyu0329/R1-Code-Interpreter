    # Step 1: Determine delta, the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities.
    # X is the set of singular cardinals kappa such that aleph_1 < kappa < aleph_{omega_2}.
    # The indices for these cardinals are the limit ordinals alpha such that
    # omega <= alpha < omega_2 and alpha is not omega_1.
    # The order type of the countable limit ordinals is omega_1.
    # The order type of the limit ordinals between omega_1 and omega_2 is omega_2.
    # So, delta = (order type of countable limits) + (order type of limits between omega_1 and omega_2)
    # delta = omega_1 + omega_2
    # In ordinal arithmetic, since omega_1 < omega_2, the sum is omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 2: Determine gamma, the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set.
    # gamma = cf(2^omega). 2^omega is some aleph_alpha from the set X.
    # So, gamma = cf(aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha).
    # Since alpha < omega_2, cf(alpha) must be a regular cardinal less than omega_2.
    # The possible values for gamma are therefore omega or omega_1.
    gamma_case_1 = "omega"
    gamma_case_2 = "omega_1"

    # Step 3: Calculate the final ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # We need to compute delta + gamma, which is omega_2 + gamma.
    # For any ordinal beta < omega_2, the sum omega_2 + beta = omega_2.

    # Case 1: gamma = omega
    result_case_1 = "omega_2"  # omega_2 + omega = omega_2

    # Case 2: gamma = omega_1
    result_case_2 = "omega_2"  # omega_2 + omega_1 = omega_2

    # The result is the same in all possible cases.
    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # We will display the calculation for the first case.
    print("The problem is to find the value of delta + gamma.")

    print(f"The value of gamma can be either {gamma_case_1} or {gamma_case_2}.")

    print(f"\nCase 1: gamma = {gamma_case_1}")
