    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: I will represent the flag of Tonga as a matrix `M`. As per the problem description, every red pixel gets a value `a`, and every white pixel gets a value `b`.\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure**: The flag has a simple geometric design: a large red field and a canton in the top-left corner. The canton is white with a red cross. This simple structure means that there are very few different kinds of rows in the matrix.\n3.  **Identify Unique Row Vectors**: I will demonstrate that regardless of the matrix's dimensions (i.e., the resolution of the image), all rows must belong to one of only two types:\n    *   A row that is entirely red.\n    *   A row that passes through the white background of the canton.\n4.  **Relate Rank to Rows**: The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows it has. Therefore, the rank of our matrix `M` is the number of linearly independent vectors among the identified row types. Since there are only two types, the rank can be at most 2.\n5.  **Determine Maximal Rank**: To find the *maximal* rank, we need to see if it's possible to choose values for `a` and `b` that make these two row types linearly independent. I will set up the equations for linear independence and show that by choosing `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, we can ensure the two row types are independent.\n6.  **Formulate the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that walks through this reasoning and prints the final conclusion. The code itself will not process an image but will serve as a self-contained explanation of the mathematical deduction, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tonga_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the structure of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga\n    to determine its maximal possible rank.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Analysis of the Maximal Rank of the Tonga Flag Matrix ###\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Defining the Matrix\")\n    print(\"We model the flag of Tonga as a matrix M.\")\n    print(\"Every red pixel is assigned a value 'a'.\")\n    print(\"Every white pixel is assigned a value 'b'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identifying the Unique Row Structures\")\n    print(\"The flag's design results in only two distinct types of rows in the matrix M:\")\n    print(\"\\n  - Type 1: A row that is entirely red.\")\n    print(\"    This occurs for rows in the main red field or rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the red cross in the canton.\")\n    print(\"    Let's call this vector 'v_red'.
