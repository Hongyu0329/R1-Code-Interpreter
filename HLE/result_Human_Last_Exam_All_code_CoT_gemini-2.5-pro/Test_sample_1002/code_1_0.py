    This function calculates the value of the limit based on the derived formula.

    The problem asks to compute lim_{m -> infinity} (ln f(m)) / (ln m).
    Through analysis based on extremal graph theory, the asymptotic behavior of f(m)
    is found to be f(m) = Theta(m^{1 - 1/(2k)}).

    Plugging this into the limit expression gives:
    lim_{m -> infinity} (ln(C * m^{1 - 1/(2k)})) / (ln m)
    = lim_{m -> infinity} (ln(C) + (1 - 1/(2k)) * ln(m)) / (ln m)
    = lim_{m -> infinity} (ln(C)/ln(m) + 1 - 1/(2k))
    As m -> infinity, ln(C)/ln(m) -> 0.
    The limit is 1 - 1/(2k).

    This script computes the value for a given k.
