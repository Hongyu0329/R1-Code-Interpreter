# The following code prints the answers to the theoretical questions based on the analysis
# of variational methods for nonlinear partial differential equations.

# (a) The Pohozaev identity P(u,v)=0 is a necessary condition for a solution, not a sufficient one.
# A function can satisfy the identity without being a critical point of the energy functional J.

# (b) The existence of a unique scaling factor t to place a function on the manifold P=0
# typically requires the kinetic and nonlinear energy components to be positive. This is not
# true for *any* arbitrary function in the space.

# (c) A minimizer of the energy J on the Pohozaev manifold P=0 is a ground state solution.
# Such solutions are also on the Nehari manifold and satisfy the stability condition
# phi''(1) < 0 for standard nonlinearities, indicating J is maximized along the fiber at t=1.
