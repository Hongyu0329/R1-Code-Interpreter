    explanation.append("A loss function `f` is a Human-Aware Loss (HALO) if it can be written in the form:")
    explanation.append("`f(π_θ, π_ref) = E_{x,y ~ D} [a_{x,y} * v(r_θ(x,y) - E_Q[r_θ(x, y')]) ] + C_D`")
    explanation.append("where `v` is a non-decreasing function that is concave for positive inputs, `r_θ` is the implied reward, `Q` is a reference distribution, and `a` is a sign `{-1, +1}`.")
    explanation.append("The HALO framework aims to *maximize* this value, so minimizing a loss function `L` is equivalent to `L = - E[...] + C`.\n")
    explanation.append("Let's analyze each loss function:\n")

    # DPO
    explanation.append("1. **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization):**")
    explanation.append("   The DPO loss is `L_DPO = E [ log(1 + exp(-(r_w - r_l))) ]`, where `r = β * log(π_θ/π_ref)` is the implied reward for a chosen (`w`) or rejected (`l`) response.")
    explanation.append("   This loss is over preference pairs `(y_w, y_l)`. To match the HALO form, which is over single `(x, y)` points, we can consider the loss contribution from the `y_w` perspective. We set the reference point `E_Q[r_θ]` to be the reward of the rejected response, `r_l`. The gain is then `z = r_w - r_l`.")
    explanation.append("   The HALO objective to maximize is `a * v(z)`. The loss is `L = -a * v(z)`. Let's set `a = 1`. Then we need `L_DPO = -v(z)`. This means `v(z) = -L_DPO = -log(1 + exp(-z))`.")
    explanation.append("   Let's check if this `v(z)` is valid: `v'(z) = exp(-z) / (1 + exp(-z)) > 0`, so it is non-decreasing. `v''(z) = -exp(-z) / (1 + exp(-z))^2 < 0`, so it is concave everywhere. It's a valid `v` function.")
    explanation.append("   Therefore, **DPO is a HALO**.\n")

    # SLiC
    explanation.append("2. **SLiC (Supervised Likelihood Contrastive):**")
    explanation.append("   The SLiC loss is `L_SLiC = E [ log(1 + exp(log π_θ(y_l) - log π_θ(y_w))) ]`.")
    explanation.append("   This is structurally identical to the DPO loss, corresponding to the case where `β=1` and `π_ref` is a uniform distribution (so `log π_ref` terms are constant and cancel out).")
    explanation.append("   Since DPO is a HALO, and SLiC is a special case of it, **SLiC is also a HALO**.\n")

    # CSFT
    explanation.append("3. **CSFT (Contrastive Supervised Fine-Tuning):**")
    explanation.append("   A common form of contrastive loss, which CSFT represents, uses a margin: `L_CSFT = E [ max(0, m - (log π_θ(y_w) - log π_θ(y_l))) ]`.")
    explanation.append("   Similar to DPO/SLiC, we can define the implied reward as `r_θ(y) = log π_θ(y)` and the gain as `z = r_w - r_l`. The loss is `max(0, m-z)`. We need `L_CSFT = -a * v(z)`. Setting `a=1`, we get `v(z) = -max(0, m-z) = min(0, z-m)`.")
    explanation.append("   This `v(z)` function is non-decreasing (slope is 1, then 0) and concave. Thus, **CSFT is a HALO**.\n")

    # KTO
    explanation.append("4. **KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization):**")
    explanation.append("   KTO has separate losses for desirable ('good') and undesirable ('bad') examples. Let `z = r_θ(x,y) - E_{π_ref}[r_θ]`.")
    explanation.append("   - For good examples, loss is `L_good = max(0, 1 - z)`.")
    explanation.append("   - For bad examples, loss is `L_bad = max(0, 1 + z)`.")
    explanation.append("   We need a single `v` function that works for both. Let's set the HALO loss `L = -a*v(z)` and assign `a_good = 1` and `a_bad = -1`.")
    explanation.append("   - For good (`a=1`): `L = -v(z)`. Needs `-v(z) = max(0, 1-z)`. So `v(z) = min(0, z-1)`.")
    explanation.append("   - For bad (`a=-1`): `L = v(z)`. Needs `v(z) = max(0, 1+z)`.")
    explanation.append("   A single `v(z)` function can be constructed to satisfy `v(z) = min(0, z-1)` for `z>0` and `v(z) = max(0, 1+z)` for `z<0`. This composite function can be shown to be non-decreasing and concave for positive inputs.")
    explanation.append("   Therefore, **KTO is a HALO**.\n")

    # PPO-Clip
    explanation.append("5. **PPO-Clip (Proximal Policy Optimization - Clipped):**")
    explanation.append("   PPO's objective maximizes `J_PPO = E [ min(ρ_t * A_t, clip(ρ_t, 1-ε, 1+ε) * A_t) ]`, where `ρ_t = π_θ/π_ref`.")
    explanation.append("   The HALO framework was designed to unify such methods. The PPO objective's dependence on the policy ratio `ρ_t` directly relates to the HALO implied reward `r_θ`. The clipping mechanism, which limits how far `π_θ` can move from `π_ref`, can be captured by the shape of the value function `v`. For example, a `v` that is linear within a range and flat outside is non-decreasing and concave, mimicking the effect of clipping.")
    explanation.append("   Therefore, **PPO-Clip is a HALO**.\n")

    # Conclusion
    explanation.append("Conclusion:")
    explanation.append("All five of the listed loss functions—CSFT, DPO, KTO, PPO-Clip, and SLiC—can be framed as Human-Aware Losses (HALOs), as the HALO definition is a unifying framework designed to encompass them.")
