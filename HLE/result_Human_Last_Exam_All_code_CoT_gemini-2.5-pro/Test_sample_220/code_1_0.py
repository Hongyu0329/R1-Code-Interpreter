    Calculates the speed of gas jets from bursting bubbles using a scaling law.

    The jet velocity (V) is modeled to be proportional to the inverse fourth root
    of the bubble radius (R), based on physical models combining film retraction
    speed and film thickness scaling. The formula used is V = K * R**(-1/4),
    where K is an empirically determined constant for the system.
