    # The core challenge is translating a plot-critical, English-specific pun or auditory ambiguity.
    # We need to find which practices can make the plot work in a target language.

    # I. Transcreation: Create a new, analogous pun in the target language. This works.
    # II. Audio links: Fails for non-English-speaking audience.
    # III. Change setting: Can provide a context (e.g., bilingual area) for a new pun. This can work.
    # IV. Foreigner character: Can provide a narrative reason for a linguistic mistake/pun. This can work.
    # V. Illustration: The problem is auditory, not visual. This does not work.
    # VI. Footnotes: Explains the original pun, making the plot logically coherent. This works.

    # The capable practices are I, III, IV, and VI.
    # The final answer should be these Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
