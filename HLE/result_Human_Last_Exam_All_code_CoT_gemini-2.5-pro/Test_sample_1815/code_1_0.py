Step 1: Understanding the topological structure.
A group topology on the integers, (Z, +), is called 'totally bounded' if for every open neighborhood U of 0, a finite number of translates of U can cover all of Z. A key theorem states that a group topology on Z is totally bounded if and only if it is 'coarser' than the profinite topology. This means that every open neighborhood of 0 must contain a subgroup of the form nZ for some positive integer n. The collection of these subgroups forms a basis for the topology at 0. Let S be the set of these integers n. For the topology to be consistent, if n1*Z and n2*Z are open neighborhoods, their intersection lcm(n1, n2)*Z must also be open. So, the set S must be closed under taking the least common multiple (lcm).

Step 2: The condition of "no nontrivial convergent sequences".
A sequence is 'nontrivial' if it is not eventually constant. A topological group has no nontrivial convergent sequences if and only if it is a 'P-group'. For a group topology on Z defined by a set S as above, this P-group property has a specific meaning: for any countable collection of numbers {n1, n2, n3, ...} from S, their least common multiple, L = lcm(n1, n2, n3, ...), must be a finite number and must also be an element of S.

Step 3: Analyzing the consequence of the P-group property.
The set S itself is countable. According to the P-group condition, we can take the entire set S and find its least common multiple, let's call it M = lcm(S). This M must be a finite integer and M must be in S.
If M exists, then for any n in S, n must divide M. This means that nZ contains MZ. Consequently, MZ is the smallest open neighborhood of 0, and it is the intersection of all open neighborhoods of 0.

Step 4: Contradiction from the properties.
We now have two cases for our topology:

Case A: The topology is Hausdorff.
For a Hausdorff topology, the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 must be {0}. In our case, this intersection is MZ. For MZ = {0}, M would have to be infinite, but the P-group condition requires M to be a finite number. Thus, no Hausdorff topology can satisfy the P-group condition.
Alternatively, even without the P-group argument, one can show any Hausdorff totally bounded group topology on Z must have a nontrivial convergent sequence. Let S = {n1, n2, ...} be the (infinite) set of indices for the open subgroups. The sequence x_k = lcm(n1, ..., n_k) can be shown to converge to 0, but it is not eventually zero.

Case B: The topology is not Hausdorff.
This means the intersection of neighborhoods of 0 is MZ for some integer M > 1. This defines a topology where a set is open if and only if it is a union of cosets of MZ.
Let's check for convergent sequences in this topology. A sequence (x_k) converges to a point x if and only if it is eventually in every neighborhood of x. The smallest neighborhood of x is the coset x + MZ. So, convergence means x_k is in x + MZ for all k greater than some N.
Now, consider the sequence defined by x_k = x + k*M for k = 1, 2, 3, ...
This sequence is entirely contained in the coset x + MZ, so it converges to x. However, the sequence is clearly not eventually constant. This is a nontrivial convergent sequence.

Step 5: Conclusion.
Both Hausdorff and non-Hausdorff totally bounded group topologies on the integers inevitably possess nontrivial convergent sequences. The conditions given in the problem are contradictory. Therefore, there are no topologies that satisfy all the given criteria.
