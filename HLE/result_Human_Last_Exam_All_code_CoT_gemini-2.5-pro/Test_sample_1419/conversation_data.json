    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in ϕ⁴ theory, followed by a Python script that carries out the steps.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem concerns the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis of `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. We are looking for a non-trivial fixed point of the RG flow, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n2.  **Define the fixed point condition:** A fixed point, denoted `u*`, is a specific value of the coupling constant `u` where its scaling with energy, described by the beta function `β(u)`, vanishes. Thus, `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **State the beta function:** For `ϕ⁴` theory, the one-loop beta function is a standard result from quantum field theory: `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u²) / (16π²)`.\n4.  **Solve for the fixed point:** I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to set up the equation `β(u*) = 0` and solve it for `u*`.\n5.  **Identify the non-trivial solution:** The equation yields two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point (`u* = 0`), and the other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is the one we are interested in.\n6.  **Present the final expression:** The script will print the steps of the derivation and display the final expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, explicitly showing each number and symbol in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script symbolically derives the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols to be used in our equations.\n    # u_star represents the fixed point coupling u*\n    # u represents the generic coupling constant\n    # epsilon is the small parameter in d = 4 - epsilon\n    u_star, u, epsilon = sympy.symbols('u* u epsilon')\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: State the context and the beta function ---\n    print(\"In ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (d = 4 - ε), the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the coupling 'u' is described by the beta function.\")\n    print(\"To leading order (one-loop), the beta function is:\")\n\n    # Define the beta function expression\n    beta_function_expr = -epsilon * u + (3 * u**2) / (16 * pi**2)\n    beta_function_eq = sympy.Eq(sympy.Symbol('β(u)'), beta_function_expr)\n\n    # Use sympy.pprint for a nicely formatted console output\n    sympy.pprint(beta_function_eq, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Explain the fixed point condition ---\n    print(f\"A fixed point, denoted as {u_star}, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero.\")\n    print(f\"We must solve the equation β({u_star}) = 0:\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Set up and solve the equation ---\n    # Substitute u with u_star and set the expression to 0\n    fixed_point_eq = sympy.Eq(beta_function_expr.subs(u, u_star), 0)\n    sympy.pprint(fixed_point_eq, use_unicode=True)\n\n    # Solve the equation for u_star\n    solutions = sympy.solve(fixed_point_eq, u_star)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis equation has two solutions: {solutions}\")\n\n    # --- Step 5 & 6: Identify and present the non-trivial solution ---\n    gaussian_fp = solutions[0]\n    wilson_fisher_fp = solutions[1]\n\n    print(f\"The solution {gaussian_fp} corresponds to the trivial Gaussian fixed point (a free theory).\")\n    print(\"The non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which describes critical phenomena.\")\n\n    # Extract the components of the final answer to print them explicitly\n    coeff = wilson_fisher_fp / epsilon\n    numerator = sympy.numer(coeff / pi**2)\n    denominator = sympy.denom(coeff / pi**2)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling is:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number and symbol shown clearly\n    final_eq_str = f\"{u_star} = ({numerator} * π² / {denominator}) * ε\"\n    print(\"\\n\" + final_eq_str + \"\\n\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point()\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
