    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this task, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110:** I will create a mapping (like a Python dictionary) that holds the logic for Rule 110. For each of the 8 possible 3-cell binary neighborhoods (e.g., `111`, `110`, `101`, etc.), the mapping will define the state of the central cell in the next generation.\n2.  **Initialize the Grid:** I'll set up a 1-dimensional grid (a list in Python) representing the cells. To accommodate the pattern's growth over 20 generations, the grid will be initialized with a sufficient number of cells, all in state `0`, except for a single cell in state `1` at the very center.\n3.  **Simulate Generations:** I will loop 20 times. In each loop (representing one generation), I'll calculate the state of every cell in the next generation by looking at its current 3-cell neighborhood and applying Rule 110. The results will be stored in a new grid. At the end of the loop, this new grid will replace the old one.\n4.  **Format and Print the Final Pattern:** After 20 generations, the grid will contain the final pattern, but it will be padded with many leading and trailing zeros. I will trim these off to isolate the significant pattern. Finally, I will convert this pattern into a single binary string and print it, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single cell and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
