    This function identifies and explains the correct answer to the user's question.

    The question asks for the primary reason for adding bypass notches in sheet metal forming dies.

    Analysis of Options:
    - The core challenge in sheet metal forming is controlling the flow of the material from a flat blank into a 3D shape.
    - Complex geometries (like small radii, sharp corners) can restrict or "lock" this material flow.
    - Restricted material flow leads to excessive stretching, thinning, and eventually tearing in the part.
    - Uncontrolled or excessive material flow leads to compressive stresses and wrinkling.
    - "Bypass notches" are features cut into the blank's perimeter specifically to manage this material flow. They can create a path for material to move more easily into a restricted area or change the stress distribution to prevent wrinkles.
    - Option D: "To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex geometries..." perfectly encapsulates this fundamental principle. It is the root cause that other issues like thinning (I) or wrinkling (A) stem from.

    Therefore, 'D' is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.

    explanation = "The primary purpose of bypass notches is to manage and control the flow of material from the blank into the die cavity, especially around complex geometric features where material flow might be restricted or difficult to control."
