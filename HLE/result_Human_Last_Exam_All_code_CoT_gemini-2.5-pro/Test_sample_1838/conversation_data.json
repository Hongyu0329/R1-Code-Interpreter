    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the central pixel:\n1.  First, we will implement Bresenham's line algorithm for the given start and end points to generate all the pixel coordinates along the line.\n2.  The algorithm will start at (1, 1). Since the change in x (10) is greater than the change in y (4), we will iterate along the x-axis.\n3.  In each step, we will increment x by 1 and use a decision parameter to determine if y should also be incremented.\n4.  All the generated pixel coordinates will be stored in a list.\n5.  Finally, we will find the total number of pixels in the list and calculate the index of the middle element. The coordinate at this central index is our answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coordinates of the central pixel on a line from (1,1) to (11,5)\n    using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the start and end points of the line\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # Calculate the change in x and y\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Store all pixels of the line in a list\n    pixels = []\n    \n    # Initialize current coordinates and the decision parameter\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    # Pre-calculate constants for the loop\n    const1 = 2 * dy\n    const2 = 2 * (dy - dx)\n\n    # Add the starting pixel\n    pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # Iterate from the start to the end point\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            p += const1\n            # y does not change\n        else:\n            p += const2\n            y += 1\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # Find the central pixel in the list of pixels\n    # We use integer division to get the middle index\n    mid_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels[mid_index]\n\n    # Print the coordinates of the central pixel\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are: ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
