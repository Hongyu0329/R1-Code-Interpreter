    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\n1.  **Define the Matrix**: I will first represent the given 3x3 matrix `A` using the NumPy library in Python, which is ideal for matrix operations.\n2.  **Use NumPy's Determinant Function**: I will use the `numpy.linalg.det()` function to calculate the determinant of the matrix. This is a standard and efficient method.\n3.  **Show the Calculation Steps**: To meet the requirement of showing the numbers in the final equation, I will print out the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant and then substitute the matrix's values into it, showing the step-by-step arithmetic before printing the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the adjacency matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Calculate the determinant using numpy's linear algebra module\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n# Extract the individual elements of the matrix to display the calculation\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(\"The given matrix is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nThe determinant is calculated using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from the matrix:\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Calculate the value of each sub-determinant\nterm1_val = (e * i) - (f * h)\nterm2_val = (d * i) - (f * g)\nterm3_val = (d * h) - (e * g)\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a})*({term1_val}) - ({b})*({term2_val}) + ({c})*({term3_val})\")\n\n# Calculate the final terms of the sum\nfinal_term1 = a * term1_val\nfinal_term2 = -b * term2_val\nfinal_term3 = c * term3_val\nprint(f\"Determinant = {final_term1} + {final_term2} + {final_term3}\")\n\n# Print the final result, rounding to handle potential floating point inaccuracies\nprint(f\"\\nThe final computed determinant is: {int(round(determinant))}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
