    "The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov. Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The key clues are the connection to the poet Andrei Voznesensky, the description \"a joy-discovering sailor,\" the question about a lost grave (\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"), and the fact that the grave's location was found in the late 1980s.\n\n2.  **Connect to Voznesensky:** Andrei Voznesensky's most famous work involving a historical explorer is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n\n3.  **Identify the Protagonist:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian diplomat and explorer Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The opera romanticizes his 1806 expedition to California.\n\n4.  **Verify the Grave Story:** Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his return journey. He was buried in the Voskresensky Cathedral cemetery. This cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, and his grave was lost.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Rediscovery:** In the late 1970s and 1980s, thanks to the popularity of the rock opera, interest in Rezanov surged. His burial place was re-identified, and in 1989 (fitting the \"late 1980s\" clue), a new monument was erected at the site.\n\nThe following Python code will print his last name.\n\n```python\n# The man is Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian explorer and diplomat.\n# He is the central figure in Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# Rezanov's grave was lost when a cathedral was demolished during the Soviet era.\n# His burial site was rediscovered and a monument was erected in the late 1980s.\n\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
