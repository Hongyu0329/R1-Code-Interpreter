# Each of the component spaces is a homogeneous space. This means that for any
# two points within a component, there is a self-homeomorphism of that component
# mapping one point to the other. Therefore, each component space consists of a
# single equivalence class.

# Number of equivalence classes for the torus
torus_classes = 1

# Number of equivalence classes for the sphere
sphere_classes = 1

# Number of equivalence classes for the real line
real_line_classes = 1

# Number of equivalence classes for a three-point discrete space
discrete_3_classes = 1

# Number of equivalence classes for a five-point discrete space
discrete_5_classes = 1

# Since any auto-homeomorphism of the total space must map each of these
# topologically distinct components to itself, the total number of equivalence
# classes is the sum of the number of classes in each component.
total_classes = torus_classes + sphere_classes + real_line_classes + discrete_3_classes + discrete_5_classes
