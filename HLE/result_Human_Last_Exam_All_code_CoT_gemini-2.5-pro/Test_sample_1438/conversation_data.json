    "In the path integral formalism for quantum field theory, fermions are described by anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The properties of these variables and their integration rules are designed to correctly reproduce the fermionic behavior, most notably the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle in Grassmann Algebra:** I will first explain that the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, is mathematically encoded in the fundamental property of Grassmann variables. If `η` is a Grassmann variable representing a fermionic state, this principle is expressed as `η^2 = 0`.\n2.  **Grassmann Integration (Berezin Integral):** The integration over these variables is defined by a specific set of rules, known as Berezin integration. The two fundamental rules for an integral over a single Grassmann variable `η` are:\n    *   `∫ dη = 0`\n    *   `∫ dη η = 1`\n3.  **Calculating the Measure:** The question asks for the \"value of the measure\" that maintains the Pauli principle. A direct way to interpret this is to find the value of the integral for a state that violates the principle—a doubly occupied state. In this formalism, such a state is represented by `η^2`. Therefore, the task is to calculate the value of the integral `∫ dη η^2`.\n4.  **Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print out the step-by-step evaluation of this integral, which demonstrates how the formalism enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, resulting in a value of zero for such a state.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fermionic_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the value of the integral measure for a\n    doubly-occupied fermionic state in the Grassmann path integral formalism.\n\n    This value is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
