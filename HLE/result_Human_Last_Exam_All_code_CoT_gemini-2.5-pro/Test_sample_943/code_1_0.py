# The problem is to find K in the expression for the slice rank.
# Based on the analysis, the asymptotic base of the slice rank is 2.
# The formula given in the problem has an asymptotic base of (3 / 2**K).
# We set these bases equal to each other to find K.
# The equation is: 2 = 3 / (2**K)

# Define the numbers in the equation
a = 2
b = 3
c = 2

# We solve for K:
# a = b / (c**K)
# c**K = b / a
# K = log_c(b / a)

# In Python, this is calculated as:
K = math.log(b / a, c)

print(f"The equation to solve is: {a} = {b} / ({c}**K)")
print(f"Solving for K gives: K = log_{c}({b}/{a})")
print(f"The value of K is: {K}")
