    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct a rank 4 group from the irreducible finite Weyl groups. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible ones, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. This problem is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to realize it with irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **List Irreducible Groups:** First, we'll list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. We must account for known isomorphisms, such as W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃) and W(Bₙ) ≅ W(Cₙ).\n2.  **Partitions of 4:** We will consider all integer partitions of 4, which represent the possible rank combinations:\n    *   4 (an irreducible group of rank 4)\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  **Count Combinations:** For each partition, we'll count how many distinct combinations of irreducible groups exist.\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan by defining the available groups for each rank and calculating the possibilities for each partition.\n\n```python\ndef count_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    The rank of a Weyl group that is a product of irreducible components is the\n    sum of the ranks of those components.
