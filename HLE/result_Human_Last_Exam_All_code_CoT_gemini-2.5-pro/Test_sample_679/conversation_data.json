    "Here is a step-by-step plan to deduce the structure of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is C7H14. We will first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine if there are any rings or double/triple bonds. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**: We will examine the number of signals, their chemical shifts (ppm), and their multiplicities (s, d, t, q).\n    *   The number of signals (6) is less than the number of carbons (7), which indicates molecular symmetry. Two carbons must be chemically equivalent.\n    *   The chemical shifts tell us about the electronic environment of the carbons (e.g., alkene vs. aliphatic).\n    *   The multiplicities tell us how many hydrogens are attached to each carbon: s = quaternary C (0 H), d = CH (1 H), t = CH2 (2 H), q = CH3 (3 H).\n3.  **Identify Structural Fragments**: Based on the NMR analysis, we will identify the small pieces that make up the molecule.\n4.  **Deduce Symmetry and Hydrogen Count**: By comparing the hydrogens counted from the multiplicities with the molecular formula, we can confirm which signal corresponds to the two equivalent carbons.\n5.  **Assemble the Structure**: We will connect the identified fragments in a chemically logical way that is consistent with all the data.\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is determined, we will name it according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\nThis process will be implemented in the following Python script, which will print out the logical deductions at each step.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical structure puzzle based on molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula and Calculate DoU ---\n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula: {formula}\")\n    \n    # Extract C and H counts from the formula string\n    match = re.match(r\"C(\\d+)H(\\d+)\", formula)\n    num_c = int(match.group(1))\n    num_h = int(match.group(2))\n    \n    # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    dou = num_c + 1 - (num_h / 2)\n    print(f\"   - Number of Carbons: {num_c}\")\n    print(f\"   - Number of Hydrogens: {num_h}\")\n    print(f\"   - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = {num_c} + 1 - ({num_h}/2) = {int(dou)}\")\n    print(\"   - A DoU of 1 indicates one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data ---\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data)\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(f\"   - Signals: {nmr_data}\")\n    print(f\"   - There are {num_c} carbons but only {num_signals} signals.\")\n    print(\"   - This implies symmetry: two carbons are chemically equivalent.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Identify Fragments from NMR Multiplicities ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Identify Fragments and Check Hydrogen Count\")\n    multiplicity_map = {'s': ('Quaternary C', 0), 'd': ('CH', 1), 't': ('CH2', 2), 'q': ('CH3', 3)}\n    fragments = []\n    h_from_signals = 0\n    for shift, mult in nmr_data.items():\n        frag_name, h_count = multiplicity_map[mult]\n        fragments.append(frag_name)\n        h_from_signals += h_count\n        \n    print(f\"   - Fragments based on multiplicities: {fragments}\")\n    print(f\"   - Total hydrogens counted from these 6 signals: {h_from_signals} H\")\n    print(f\"   - The molecular formula requires {num_h} H.
