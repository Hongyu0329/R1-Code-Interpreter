    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n2.  **Use the Formula for Christoffel Symbols:** The Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$) are calculated from the metric tensor ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$) and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor and $x^\\mu$ are the coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n\n3.  **Automate with Code:** Since manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ components is tedious and prone to error, we will use Python with the `sympy` library. The script will:\n    *   Define the coordinates and the Schwarzschild metric tensor symbolically.\n    *   Calculate the inverse of the metric tensor.\n    *   Compute the partial derivatives of the metric with respect to each coordinate.\n    *   Apply the Christoffel symbol formula for all combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$.\n    *   Simplify the resulting expressions and count how many are non-zero. We will count the unique components, taking into account the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints the non-zero Christoffel symbols and their total count.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n    This function defines the Schwarzschild metric, calculates the Christoffel\n    symbols using their formula, and then counts and prints the unique\n    non-zero components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
