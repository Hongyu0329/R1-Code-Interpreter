    This function explains the solution to the topological problem.

    The problem asks for the number of connected components of a space Y, which is
    constructed from a subset of the unit square by identifying a set of points.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. Let the resulting space be Y and the identified point be p*.
    2. Let C be the connected component of Y containing p*.
    3. We show that the image of the set A (where x-coordinates are endpoints 'q' from Q)
       is entirely contained in C. This is because for any q in Q, the image of the
       fiber {q} x D has p* in its closure. A set and its closure must belong to the
       same connected component.
    4. We then show that the image of A, denoted pi(A), is dense in the entire space Y.
       This relies on the fact that Q is dense in the Cantor set K and D is dense in [0,1].
    5. A connected component is always a closed set. Since C contains pi(A), it must
       also contain the closure of pi(A).
    6. From steps 4 and 5, we have Y = closure(pi(A)) which is a subset of C.
    7. Since C is a subset of Y, we must have Y = C. This means the entire space Y
       is connected.
    8. A connected space has exactly one component.
