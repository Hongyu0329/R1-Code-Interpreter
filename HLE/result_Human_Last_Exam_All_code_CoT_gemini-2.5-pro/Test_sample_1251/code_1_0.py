    print("1. Q is a linear quiver of type A_n, with arrows a_i: e_i -> e_{i+1} and a_i*: e_{i+1} -> e_i.")
    print("2. The algebra is the preprojective algebra Pi(Q), with relations at each vertex e_k (for 0<k<n) given by rho_k = a_k*a_k - a_{k-1}a_{k-1}* = 0.")
    print("3. The automorphism 'g' preserves the ideal of relations of Pi(Q).")
    print("4. The unspecified automorphism 'sigma' is identified with the given reflection automorphism 'g'. This is the most natural interpretation that makes the questions coherent.")

    print("\n### (a) Analysis ###")
    print("Question: If the axis of reflection passes through a vertex j, is it true that sigma(a_j) = c_j a_{j-1}* for some c_j in k?")
    print("\nStep 1: Condition for the axis passing through vertex j.")
    print("The condition g . e_j = e_j implies e_j = e_{n-(d+j)}. We work with indices modulo n.")
    print("This means j = n - (d+j) (mod n), which simplifies to 2j + d = kn for some integer k.")
    print("\nStep 2: Calculate the action of g on the arrow a_j.")
    print("The general action is g . a_j = mu_j * a_{n-(d+j+1)}*.")
    print("Let's substitute d = kn - 2j into the index of the arrow:")
    print("n - (d+j+1) = n - ((kn - 2j) + j + 1) = n - kn + j - 1 = j - 1 (mod n).")
    print("So, g . a_j = mu_j * a_{j-1}*.")
    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion for (a).")
    print("This result, g(a_j) = mu_j * a_{j-1}*, matches the form sigma(a_j) = c_j a_{j-1}* by setting sigma=g and c_j=mu_j.")

    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the premise of the implication: sigma(a_j*) = c_j* a_j.")
    print("With sigma = g, the premise is g(a_j*) = c_j* a_j.")

    print("For the equality to hold, their targets must be equal: g(e_j) = e_{j+1}.")
    print("However, the axis of reflection passes through j, which means g(e_j) = e_j by definition.")
    print("This leads to the contradiction e_j = e_{j+1}, which is impossible as vertices are distinct.")
    print("\nStep 2: Conclusion for (b).")
    print("The premise 'sigma(a_j*) = c_j* a_j' is false because it leads to a contradiction.")
    print("In logic, an implication with a false premise (P -> Q) is always true, regardless of the conclusion Q.")

    print("\n### (c) Analysis ###")
    print("Question: If sigma(a_i) is non-zero for an edge not intersected by the reflection axis, must lambda^2 * mu_i * mu_i* = 1?")
    print("\nStep 1: Impose the condition that g preserves the preprojective relations.")
    print("For g to be an automorphism of Pi(Q), the image of any relation g(rho_k) must be a multiple of another relation.")
    print("A detailed calculation shows this implies that the product mu_k * mu_k* must be constant for all k. Let mu_k * mu_k* = C.")
    print("\nStep 2: Interpret the parameter lambda.")
    print("The parameter lambda typically arises if g is a twisted automorphism, scaling certain canonical objects. In the context of the preprojective algebra, the action of g on relations does not introduce a scaling factor, which suggests we should take lambda = 1.")
    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate the claim.")
    print("With sigma = g, sigma(a_i) = g(a_i) is never zero since mu_i is a non-zero scalar. So the premise holds.")
    print("With lambda = 1, the claim simplifies to: must mu_i * mu_i* = 1?")
    print("We only know that mu_i * mu_i* = C for some constant C. There is no information that forces C=1.")
    print("For instance, a consistent choice of parameters could be mu_k = 2 and mu_k* = 1 for all k, which gives C = 2.")
    print("Since we can find valid scenarios where mu_i * mu_i* is not 1, the statement is not necessarily true.")
