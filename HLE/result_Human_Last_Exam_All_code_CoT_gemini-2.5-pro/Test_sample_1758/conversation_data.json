    "To phonetically transcribe how the English borrowing \"shock absorber\" would be pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish, we need to apply several key phonological rules of that dialect to the original English sounds.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the adaptation:\n1.  **Initial Sound Adaptation**: The English \"sh\" sound, /ʃ/, does not exist in Spanish. It is typically adapted to the \"ch\" sound, /tʃ/. So, \"shock\" begins as \"choc\".\n2.  **Consonant Cluster Simplification**: The consonant cluster /-bs-/ in \"absorber\" is awkward in Spanish phonotactics. It is simplified to /s/, a common process (similar to how `obscuro` is often pronounced `oscuro`). This turns \"absorber\" into \"asorber\".\n3.  **Vowel Mapping**: The English vowels are mapped to the nearest of the five Spanish vowels. The /ɑ/ in \"shock\" becomes /o/, the /ɔɹ/ in \"sorber\" becomes /oɾ/, and the final /ɚ/ becomes /eɾ/.\n4.  **Word Combination & Linking**: The two words are treated as a single compound. The final consonant of the first word (`choc`) links with the initial vowel of the second (`asorber`), creating the structure `cho-ca-sor-ber`.\n5.  **Intervocalic Consonant Softening**: The `/b/` sound, now between two vowels (`a` and `e`), softens to a fricative sound, represented as [β].\n6.  **Lambdaism**: This is a defining feature of Puerto Rican Spanish, where the liquid consonant /ɾ/ (the single 'r' sound) in a syllable-final position is pronounced as an [l]. In the syllabified form `[tʃo.ka.soɾ.βeɾ]`, this rule applies twice:\n    *   The `/ɾ/` at the end of the syllable `sor` changes to `[l]`, making it `[sol]`.\n    *   The final `/ɾ/` at the end of the syllable `ber` also changes to `[l]`, making it `[bel]`.\n7.  **Final Transcription**: Assembling these changes and placing the stress on the \"sol\" syllable, which aligns with the stress in the original English word, gives us the final phonetic transcription.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription\n# for \"shock absorber\" as pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish, based on the\n# phonological rules described above.\n\n# 1. /ʃ/ -> /tʃ/ (sh -> ch)\n# 2. /bs/ -> /s/ (absorber -> asorber)\n# 3. Linking: choc + asorber -> [tʃo.ka.soɾ.βeɾ]\n# 4. Lambdaism (/ɾ/ -> /l/): sor -> sol, ber -> bel\n# 5. Final Assembly with stress on the 'sol' syllable.\n\nphonetic_transcription = \"[tʃo.ka.ˈsol.βel]\"\nprint(phonetic_transcription)\n```\n<<<[tʃo.ka.ˈsol.βel]>>>"
