    "This problem is a sequence puzzle. While the description hints at a deep problem in number theory related to the \"sum of three cubes,\" this is likely a misdirection. A common technique for solving such sequence puzzles, when no other clear pattern emerges, is to assume the sequence is generated by a polynomial. We can find this polynomial's next value using the method of finite differences.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Represent the given sequence as a list of numbers.\n2.  Repeatedly calculate the differences between consecutive terms in the list until only one number remains. This creates a difference table.\n3.  Assuming the sequence is generated by a polynomial, the last list of differences we calculated will be constant.\n4.  Extrapolate the sequence by adding this constant difference back up through the difference table to find the next term in the original sequence.\n5.  Finally, print the equation that computes the final term, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle by assuming it's a polynomial and using\n    the method of finite differences to extrapolate the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296]\n    \n    # Generate the difference table\n    diffs = [sequence]\n    while len(diffs[-1]) > 1:\n        last_diff_list = diffs[-1]\n        new_diff_list = [last_diff_list[i] - last_diff_list[i-1] for i in range(1, len(last_diff_list))]\n        diffs.append(new_diff_list)\n        \n    # Extrapolate to find the next term\n    # The last difference is assumed to be constant\n    constant_diff = diffs[-1][0]\n    diffs[-1].append(constant_diff)\n    \n    for i in range(len(diffs) - 2, -1, -1):\n        next_val = diffs[i][-1] + diffs[i+1][-1]\n        diffs[i].append(next_val)\n        \n    original_last_term = sequence[-1]\n    added_difference = diffs[1][-1]\n    final_answer = diffs[0][-1]\n    \n    print(\"The sequence can be extended by assuming it follows a polynomial pattern.\")\n    print(\"Using the method of finite differences, we extrapolate the next term.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is adding the last term of the original sequence to the next term in the sequence of first differences.\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {original_last_term} + {added_difference} = {final_answer}\")\n    \n    # The final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
