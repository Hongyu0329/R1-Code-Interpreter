    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will create a Python script. This script will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will define a data structure, specifically a dictionary, to store the most common allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors.\n2.  The script will then extract the unique colors from this dictionary.\n3.  Finally, it will count the number of unique colors and print out an equation showing each color contributing to the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the number of distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping major allotropes of phosphorus to their observed colors.\n    # While shades exist (e.g., white can turn yellow, red has a scarlet variant),\n    # these are the four primary distinct color categories.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"White\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    # Extract the unique colors from the dictionary values\n    distinct_colors = sorted(list(set(allotropes.values())))\n\n    # Get the total count of distinct colors\n    color_count = len(distinct_colors)\n\n    # Build the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts) + f\" = {color_count}\"\n\n    print(\"The main colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of distinct colors, we can represent it as the following sum:\")\n    print(equation_string)\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
