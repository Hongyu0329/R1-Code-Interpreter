    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Product:** The given product starts from n=3. I will express it in terms of the more standard product that starts from n=1. This can be done by taking the product from n=1 and dividing out the first two terms (for n=1 and n=2).\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  **Use a Known Identity:** The infinite product starting from n=1 can be evaluated using an identity derived from the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega^2)} $$\n    where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $\\omega^2 = e^{-i2\\pi/3}$ are the complex cube roots of unity, and $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\n\n3.  **Combine and Simplify:** By substituting the identity from step 2 into the expression from step 1 with $x=z$, we get the final closed-form expression. The terms in the denominator are simplified as $1^3=1$ and $2^3=8$.\n\n4.  **Present the Result:** I will provide a Python script that prints this final formula in a clear and readable format, ensuring all numbers from the derivation are explicitly included in the output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n    P = product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n    \n    The final equation is derived using the Weierstrass product representation\n    of the Gamma function.
