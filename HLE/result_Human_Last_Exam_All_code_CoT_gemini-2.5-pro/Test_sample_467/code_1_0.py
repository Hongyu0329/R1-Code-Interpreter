# Step 1: Define the degrees of the numerator and denominator of the Gauss map g(z) = z / (z**3 + 2)
deg_P = 1  # Degree of the numerator z
deg_Q = 3  # Degree of the denominator z**3 + 2

# Step 2: Calculate the degree of the Gauss map.
# The degree of a rational function is the maximum of the degrees of its numerator and denominator.
deg_g = max(deg_P, deg_Q)

print(f"The degree of the Gauss map g(z) is: {deg_g}")

# Step 3: Apply the Jorge-Meeks formula for the Morse index: Index = 2 * deg(g) - 1
morse_index = 2 * deg_g - 1

# Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result.
print("The Morse index is calculated using the Jorge-Meeks formula: 2 * deg(g) - 1")
print(f"Index = 2 * {deg_g} - 1 = {morse_index}")
