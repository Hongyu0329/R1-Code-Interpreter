    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to assess if they meet the fundamental physical requirements for this nonlinear optical process. My plan is to use a Python script to outline this assessment logically.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Requirement for SPDC:** The script will first state that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, which requires the medium to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  **Analyze the Material's Properties:** The script will then examine the relevant property of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). Specifically, it will look at their crystal symmetry.\n3.  **Connect Property to Requirement:** A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics is that materials with a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric) cannot have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. The script will check if borophene is centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Formulate a Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the script will print a final conclusion. It will also print the numbers from the key equation `χ⁽²⁾ = 0` to satisfy the prompt's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_borophene_for_spdc():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis: Would free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)?\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the primary requirement for SPDC.\n    print(\"Step 1: The physical requirement for SPDC.\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"For this process to occur, the material must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, written as χ⁽²⁾.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Examine the relevant property of boron nanosheets.\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the crystal structure of boron nanosheets.\")\n    print(\"The most common and stable forms (polymorphs) of free-standing boron nanosheets, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, have a crystal structure with a center of inversion symmetry.\")\n    print(\"Materials with this property are called 'centrosymmetric'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Connect the material property to the physical requirement.\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply the rules of nonlinear optics.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental principle in physics dictates that for any centrosymmetric material, the second-order susceptibility is necessarily zero.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the governing equation for ideal boron nanosheets: χ⁽²⁾ = 0.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Because ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion, as the process is symmetry-forbidden.\\n\")\n\n    # As requested, output the numbers from the final equation: χ⁽²⁾ = 0\n    print(\"Outputting the numbers from the key equation 'χ⁽²⁾ = 0':\")\n    superscript_number = 2\n    result_number = 0\n    print(f\"Number in the superscript of χ: {superscript_number}\")\n    print(f\"Number on the right side of the equation: {result_number}\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nanalyze_borophene_for_spdc()\n```\n<<<No, because the common polymorphs of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, making the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion symmetry-forbidden.>>>"
