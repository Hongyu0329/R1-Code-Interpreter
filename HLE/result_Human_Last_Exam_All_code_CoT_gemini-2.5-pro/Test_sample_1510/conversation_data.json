    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we must identify which of the 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The two point groups of order 2 are:\n    *   **C2:** Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   **D1 (or m):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\n2.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to Point Groups:** Next, we need to know which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to these point groups (C2 and D1).\n\n3.  **Count the Groups:** Finally, we will count how many wallpaper groups fall into these categories.\n\nThe following Python script automates this process by using dictionaries to store the crystallographic data and then iterating through them to find and count the matching groups.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the orders of the 2D crystallographic point groups.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        'C1': 1,\n        'C2': 2,\n        'C3': 3,\n        'C4': 4,\n        'C6': 6,\n        'D1': 2,  # Also known as 'm'\n        'D2': 4,\n        'D3': 6,\n        'D4': 8,\n        'D6': 12\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Map each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its corresponding point group.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': 'C1',\n        'p2': 'C2',\n        'pm': 'D1',\n        'pg': 'D1',\n        'cm': 'D1',\n        'p2mm': 'D2',\n        'p2mg': 'D2',\n        'p2gg': 'D2',\n        'c2mm': 'D2',\n        'p3': 'C3',\n        'p3m1': 'D3',\n        'p31m': 'D3',\n        'p4': 'C4',\n        'p4mm': 'D4',\n        'p4gm': 'D4',\n        'p6': 'C6',\n        'p6mm': 'D6'\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Find and count the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    matching_groups = []\n    for group, point_group in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(point_group) == 2:\n            matching_groups.append(group)\n    \n    # Sort the list for consistent output\n    matching_groups.sort()\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are: {', '.join(matching_groups)}\")\n    \n    count = len(matching_groups)\n    \n    # Create and print the sum equation as requested\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The total count is derived from the sum: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_question()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
