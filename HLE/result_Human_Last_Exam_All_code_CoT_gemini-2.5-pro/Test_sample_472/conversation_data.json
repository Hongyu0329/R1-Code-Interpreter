    "My plan is to scan the Latin line provided by determining the length of each syllable and then grouping them into metrical feet.\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision**: First, I will break the line down into syllables. I will also handle elision, where a vowel at the end of a word is dropped before a word starting with a vowel. The line is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". The words `bene esse` will elide to become `benesse`, which is syllabified as `be-nes-se`. This results in a 14-syllable line.\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Quantity (Long/Short)**: I will determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard Latin prosody rules:\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n    *   Diphthongs are long.\n    *   Other vowels are long or short by nature (I'll use common knowledge for these).\n    *   The final syllable of a line is conventionally treated as long.\n\n3.  **Applying Plautine Conventions**: The line is from the Roman playwright Plautus, whose meter has special rules. A key one is *iambic shortening* (or *brevis brevians*), where a two-syllable sequence of Short-Long (an iamb) can be \"shortened\" to a Short-Short sequence. I will apply this where it helps resolve the meter.\n    *   `benesse` scans as Short-Long-Short (`S L S`). The first two syllables (`be-nes`) form an iambic `S L` pair, which can be shortened to `S S`. Thus, `benesse` can be scanned as `S S S`.\n    *   Similarly, `sibi sit` scans as Short-Short-Long (`S S L`). The last two syllables (`bi sit`) form an `S L` pair, which can be shortened to `S S`. Thus, `sibi sit` can be scanned as `S S S`.\n\n4.  **Grouping into Feet**: The meter of this line is a trochaic septenarius, which consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) plus a final long syllable, though Plautus uses many substitutions. Based on the scansion derived, I will group the syllables into the most likely metrical feet (e.g., trochee, dactyl, tribrach).\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The python code will print the final scansion, with 'L' for long and 'S' for short, and with spaces separating the feet.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the provided Latin line and prints the metrical scansion.\n\n    The line is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    The meter is a modified trochaic septenarius.\n\n    Scansion breakdown:\n    1. et tibi: Scanned as a dactyl (L S S). 'et' is long by position.\n    2. bene esse: Elides to 'benesse'. Scanned as S L S. Due to iambic shortening,\n       the initial S L ('be-nes') becomes S S. The foot becomes a tribrach (S S S).\n    3. soli: Scanned as a trochee (L S). 'o' is long by nature.\n    4. quom: A single long syllable, often marking the caesura (mid-line pause). (L)\n    5. sibi sit: Scanned as S S L. Due to iambic shortening, the S L ('bi sit')\n       becomes S S. The foot becomes a tribrach (S S S).\n    6. male: Scanned as an iamb (S L), with the final syllable long by convention at the end of a verse.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The final scansion is derived from the steps above.\n    # Feet are: (L S S) (S S S) (L S) (L) (S S S) (S L)\n    foot1 = \"L S S\"\n    foot2 = \"S S S\"\n    foot3 = \"L S\"\n    foot4 = \"L\"\n    foot5 = \"S S S\"\n    foot6 = \"S L\"\n\n    final_scansion = f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6}\"\n    print(final_scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S S S S S L S L S S S S L>>>"
