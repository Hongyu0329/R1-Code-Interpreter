    Solves the three-part question about dessins d'enfants and group theory.

    (a) True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    (b) State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple.
    (c) Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.

    # Part (a) Analysis:
    # A smooth covering implies N has a trivial intersection with the cyclic subgroups <b
    # and <w>. The stabilizer of a vertex g<b > is N intersect g<b >g^-1.
    # As N is normal, this is g(N intersect <b >)g^-1 = g{1}g^-1 = {1}.
    # The action is semi-regular. The logic is the same for faces. So, (a) is True.

    # Part (b) Analysis:
    # The definition of a quasi-simple group is that it is perfect (G=G') and G/Z(G) is simple.
    # The question asks if G must be perfect, given it is quasi-simple. This is true by definition.
    # So, (b) is True.

    # Part (c) Analysis:
    # The conditions imply that G has a minimal normal subgroup N that acts regularly on the set of faces.
    # A quasiprimitive group with a regular normal subgroup N must have N as its socle.
    # A known theorem for regular maps (a type of dessin) states that for smooth regular coverings,
    # the kernel N is soluble. A soluble minimal normal subgroup must be elementary abelian.
    # An abelian socle corresponds to the Holomorph Affine (HA) type.
    # So, (c) is (HA).
