    "In the context of a film's dance scene, the auditory elements are layered to best support the visual storytelling of the dance itself. The hierarchy is determined by which element drives the scene and which elements provide support or texture. Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the ranking:\n\n1.  **Music:** Music is the foundational and most critical element. It dictates the tempo, rhythm, mood, and emotional arc of the dance. The choreography is created and performed in direct response to the music, making it the primary driver of the scene.\n2.  **Sound Effects:** Sound effects are secondary and serve to enhance the realism and impact of the dance. This includes the sounds of feet on the dance floor (taps, slides, stomps), the swish of fabric, or synchronized breathing. These sounds ground the dance in a physical reality but are almost always mixed to be subordinate to the music.\n3.  **Speech:** Speech or dialogue is the least important element and is often completely absent during a dance sequence. The focus is on non-verbal communication through movement. If speech is present, it's typically minimal and does not drive the action, unlike the music.\n\nThe following Python code will print this hierarchy in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in film dance scenes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The hierarchy is defined with ranks: 1 is most important.\n    sound_importance = {\n        \"Music\": 1,\n        \"Sound Effects\": 2,\n        \"Speech\": 3\n    }\n\n    # Sort the sound elements based on their importance rank.\n    sorted_elements = sorted(sound_importance, key=sound_importance.get)\n\n    # Format the list into the required string format.\n    result = \", \".join(sorted_elements)\n    \n    # Print the final ordered list.\n    print(result)\n\nget_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
