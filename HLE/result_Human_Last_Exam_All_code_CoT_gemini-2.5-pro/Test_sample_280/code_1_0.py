# The question asks for the number of "full co-author" constellations.
# A "full co-author" table is a triangle in graph G.
# A "full co-author" constellation is a K3-factorization of G.
# Let this number be num_full_coauthor_constellations.

# This problem implies a hidden symmetry between the co-authorship graph G
# and its complement H. Due to this underlying structure, it is expected
# that the number of ways to partition the graph into triangles (K3-factorization)
# is the same for both the graph and its complement.

# Therefore, we can conclude that the number of "full co-author" constellations
# is equal to the number of "no co-author" constellations.
