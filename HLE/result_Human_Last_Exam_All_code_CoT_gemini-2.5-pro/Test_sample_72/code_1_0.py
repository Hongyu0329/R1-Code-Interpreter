# The problem is a linguistic puzzle requiring the identification of a grammatical rule and the sentence that violates it.
#
# Let's analyze the grammar, focusing on sentences with the verb 'otazsij' that also have a second noun (an object).
#
# Key observation: The presence or absence of the word 'esku' is critical.
#
# Let's look at the sentences with 'otazsij' but WITHOUT 'esku'.
# Sentence 4: Kergoet dokuje otazsij ga.
# The object is 'dokuje', which is the base form of the noun.
#
# Sentence 6: Dokujet kergoe otazsij ga.
# The object is 'kergoe', which is the base form of the noun.
#
# From these two sentences, we can form a rule:
# In a sentence with the verb 'otazsij' and no 'esku', the object must be in its base form.
#
# Now let's test Sentence 12 against this rule.
# Sentence 12: Ketannet ezsuet otazsij gosa.
# This sentence has the verb 'otazsij' and no 'esku'.
# The object is 'ezsuet'. This is the '-t' form of the noun, not the base form ('ezsue').
#
# This violates the rule derived from sentences 4 and 6.
# Therefore, sentence 12 is the one that is not grammatically well-formed.
