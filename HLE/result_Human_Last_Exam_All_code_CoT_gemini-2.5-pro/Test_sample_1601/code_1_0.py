# Analytical Reasoning (Steps 2, 3, 4 summarized):
# The second equation is a'(t) = -b(t)a(t). This is a linear ODE for a(t), with solution
# a(t) = a(0) * exp(-integral(b(tau) dtau)).
# The exponential term is always positive. This means a(t) must always have the same sign as a(0).
# The problem requires a(t) -> +infinity, which means a(t) must be positive.
# Therefore, a necessary condition is a(0) > 0.
# The given domain for a(0) is [-10, 1], so we only need to consider a(0) in (0, 1].
# For any initial condition with a(0) in (0, 1] and b(0) in [10, 20], analysis shows that b(t)
# will inevitably become negative, while a(t) remains positive. This leads to the desired
# blow-up condition where a(t) -> +inf and b(t) -> -inf.
# This suggests that the set Omega is precisely the region (0, 1] x [10, 20].
