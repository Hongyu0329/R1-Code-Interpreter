    "Based on the Justified True Belief (JTB) model and the constraint that our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, here are two significant problems the theory encounters, ignoring Gettier problems:\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification**: The \"J\" in JTB requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, this raises the question: what justifies the justification? If every justification must itself be a justified belief, we fall into an infinite regress. For S to know P, S must have a justified belief J1 for P. But for J1 to be a valid justification, S must have a justified belief J2 for J1, and so on, endlessly. This makes it impossible for a finite mind to ever complete the chain of justification, meaning no belief can ever be practically justified and thus no knowledge can be attained. This is also known as Agrippa's Trilemma, where the chain of justification must end in one of three unsatisfactory ways: an infinite regress, a circular argument, or an arbitrary, unjustified foundational belief.\n\n2.  **The Belief Condition Problem**: The JTB model defines knowledge as a specific *type* of belief (one that is both true and justified). This implies that knowledge is a subset of belief, meaning that if you know something, you must also believe it. However, if Knowledge and Belief are our only two epistemic states, this hierarchical relationship is problematic. One could argue that Knowledge and Belief are fundamentally distinct and mutually exclusive states. In this view, achieving Knowledge means you are no longer in a state of mere Belief; the uncertainty or lack of direct access implied by \"belief\" is superseded. For example, you might *believe* a package will arrive today, but once it's in your hands, you *know* it has arrivedâ€”you are no longer simply \"believing\" it. By insisting that belief is a necessary component of knowledge, the JTB model fails to account for the possibility that knowledge is a different kind of state altogether, not just an enhanced belief.\n\n<<<The two problems are The Regress Problem of Justification and The Belief Condition Problem. The first argues that the need for justification leads to an impossible infinite regress. The second argues that JTB incorrectly assumes knowledge is a type of belief, when they could be distinct, mutually exclusive epistemic states.>>>"
