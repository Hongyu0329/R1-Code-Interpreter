def solve():
    """
    This function determines the complexity bounds for the graph process.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Analyze the game's rules to find a determining factor for the number of steps.
    2. It can be shown that in each step, any vertex `v` that has the maximum degree `d_v` in the current graph loses exactly 1 unit of life and is thus removed.
    3. This simplifies the process to a "peeling" of layers of maximum-degree vertices.
    4. The number of steps `T` is the length of the sequence of unique maximum degrees that appear, which is bounded by the initial maximum degree, `Δ`.
    5. A construction of a forest of disjoint stars shows this bound is tight, so `T = Θ(Δ)`.
    6. This relationship is used to determine the complexity for the three given cases.
