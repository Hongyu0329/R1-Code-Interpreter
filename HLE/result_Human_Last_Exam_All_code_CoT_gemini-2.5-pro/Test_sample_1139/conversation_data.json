    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question related to the theory of disordered electronic systems, specifically concerning the non-linear sigma model used to describe them.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Identify the correct mathematical space that describes the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for symmetry class D with `n` replicas. This space is known to be the symmetric space `O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`.\n2.  The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is its dimension. The dimension of a quotient space `G/K` is given by `dim(G) - dim(K)`.\n3.  The formula for the dimension of the orthogonal group `O(N)` is `N * (N - 1) / 2`.\n4.  Set the number of replicas `n` to 2, as specified in the problem.\n5.  Calculate the dimensions of the group `G = O(2*2) = O(4)` and the subgroup `K = O(2) x O(2)`. The dimension of a product of groups is the sum of their individual dimensions, so `dim(K) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2))`.\n6.  Substitute these values into the formula `dim(G) - dim(K)` to find the final result.\n7.  The Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation with all the intermediate values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_sigma_model_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the bosonic sector of the\n    supersymmetric sigma-model with n=2 replicas for symmetry class D.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    n = 2\n\n    # The bosonic sector is parametrized by the symmetric space O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n)).\n    # We need to calculate the dimension of this space.\n\n    def dim_orthogonal_group(N):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(N).\"\"\"\n        if N <= 0:\n            return 0\n        return N * (N - 1) // 2\n\n    # Parameters for the main group G = O(2n) and subgroup K = O(n) x O(n)\n    N_G = 2 * n\n    N_K = n\n\n    # Calculate the dimension of the main group G\n    dim_G = dim_orthogonal_group(N_G)\n\n    # Calculate the dimension of the subgroup K\n    # dim(K) = dim(O(n)) + dim(O(n))\n    dim_K_component = dim_orthogonal_group(N_K)\n    dim_K_total = 2 * dim_K_component\n\n    # The number of variables is the dimension of the quotient space G/K\n    num_variables = dim_G - dim_K_total\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of the symmetric space O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n)) for n=2.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the space O({N_G}) / (O({N_K}) x O({N_K})).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe dimension is calculated as: dim(G) - dim(K)\")\n    print(f\"dim(O({N_G})) = {N_G}*({N_G}-1)/2 = {dim_G}\")\n    print(f\"dim(O({N_K})) = {N_K}*({N_K}-1)/2 = {dim_K_component}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"dim(O({N_G})) - (dim(O({N_K})) + dim(O({N_K}))) = {dim_G} - ({dim_K_component} + {dim_K_component}) = {num_variables}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, {num_variables} non-Grassmann variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector.\")\n\nsolve_sigma_model_dimension()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
