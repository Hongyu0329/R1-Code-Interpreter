    # Part (a): Is VEST #W[2]-hard with S=I and commuting T_i?
    # The VEST framework's complexity depends on the underlying query.
    # We can instantiate VEST with a #W[2]-hard problem like #k-DominatingSet.
    # The problem becomes computing Sum_{D is a k-dominating set} Product_{u in D} T_u.
    # Commutativity of T_i makes the product well-defined.
    # We can show this is #W[2]-hard by a simple reduction from #k-DominatingSet.
    # If we choose all T_i to be the 1x1 identity matrix [1] (which are scalars and thus commute),
    # the VEST problem computes the number of k-dominating sets.
    # Therefore, the problem remains #W[2]-hard.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Is VEST #W[1]-hard with T_i being diagonal Z_2-matrices with at most one non-zero entry?
    # We check for #W[1]-hardness by reducing a known #W[1]-hard problem, #k-Clique.
    # We instantiate VEST to count k-cliques: Sum_{C is a k-clique} Product_{u in C} T_u.
    # The allowed matrices are either the zero matrix or E_jj (a single 1 on the diagonal).
    # These matrices are diagonal and thus commute.
    # We can set T_u = E_11 for every vertex u. E_11 satisfies the constraints.
    # The product over a clique C is Product_{u in C} E_11 = E_11.
    # The VEST problem then calculates (#k-cliques) * E_11 * v, for a vector v.
    # By choosing v=e_1, the result's first component is the number of k-cliques.
    # This shows the problem is #W[1]-hard.
    answer_b = "Yes"

    # Part (c): Complexity of decision-VEST if T_i have one non-zero entry per row?
    # These are "row-functional" matrices. The decision version of VEST for a W[1]-hard problem
    # like k-Path (finding a simple path of length k) is W[1]-complete.
    # The row-functional property makes matrix operations computationally cheaper, but the
    # combinatorial nature of enumerating or detecting paths in a general graph is the main
    # source of hardness. An algorithm enumerating all k-paths would be in XP, i.e., O(n^f(k)).
    # It is not apparent that this structural constraint on matrices is sufficient to permit
    # an FPT algorithm, for example, via dynamic programming or color-coding, as the state
    # space of matrix products could still be too large.
    # Thus, the problem most likely remains W[1]-hard.
    answer_c = "W[1]-hard"
