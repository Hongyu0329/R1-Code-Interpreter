    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I will first explain the `6-311G**` notation to clarify how the number of primitive Gaussian functions is determined. This involves breaking down the meaning of `6-`, `311G`, and `**` for both hydrogen and heavier atoms.\n2.  **Establish Rules for Primitives:** Based on the notation, I will establish the fixed number of primitive Gaussians for a Hydrogen atom and for a typical \"heavy\" atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen) from the second row of the periodic table.\n    *   Heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O): 32 primitives.\n    *   Hydrogen atom (H): 8 primitives.\n3.  **Develop a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that automates the calculation for any given molecule.\n4.  **Implement the Script:** The script will:\n    *   Take a chemical formula as a string (e.g., `\"C8H10N4O2\"` for caffeine).\n    *   Parse the formula to count the number of each type of atom.\n    *   Apply the rules established in step 2 to calculate the subtotal of primitives for each element.\n    *   Sum the subtotals to get the final count for the entire molecule.\n    *   Print a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, including the final equation with all its components, as requested.\n5.  **Provide the Final Answer:** After the code block, I will provide the final calculated number for the example molecule (caffeine) in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_primitives_for_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for a given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user did not specify a molecule, so we will use Caffeine (C8H10N4O2)\n    # as a representative example.
