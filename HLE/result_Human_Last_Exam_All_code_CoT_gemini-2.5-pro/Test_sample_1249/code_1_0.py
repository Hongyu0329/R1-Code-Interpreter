# This script is designed to solve the provided mathematical problem.
# The reasoning is outlined in the accompanying text. The core of the solution
# relies on deriving the formula for the action of x^d on r.
#
# Assumptions made due to ambiguity in the problem statement:
# 1. The action is associative: (hk).r = h.(k.r).
# 2. The action of g commutes with the action of x: g.(x.r) = x.(g.r).
# 3. The action of g on w is trivial in a specific way: g.w = 0, where w = x.1_R.
#
# Derived Formula: x^k . r = w^k * r

# (a) Condition for x^d a . r = 0
# From the formula, x^d a . r = x^d . (a . r) = w^d * (a . r).
# For this to be universally zero, we need the coefficient w^d to be zero.
# The number d is given by the order of the group-like element g, g^d = 1.
answer_a_expr = "w^d = 0"

# (b) Expression for x^d . r
# As derived in the thinking steps, the expression is w^d multiplied by r.
# The number d is given by the order of the group-like element g, g^d = 1.
answer_b_expr = "w^d * r"

# (c) Can x^j a . r for j >= M be zero?
# The reference to 'M' in the question likely points to a condition such as w^M = 0.
# If w^M = 0, then for any j >= M, w^j = w^M * w^(j-M) = 0.
# This would make x^j . r = w^j * r = 0, and thus x^j a . r = 0.
# Therefore, under this plausible interpretation, the answer is yes.
answer_c_expr = "yes"

# Final output formatted as requested.
# The expression w^d = 0 means w raised to the power of d equals zero.
# The expression w^d * r means w raised to the power of d multiplied by r.
# The numbers d and 0 are part of the equation.
print(f"(a) {answer_a_expr} (b) {answer_b_expr} (c) {answer_c_expr}")
