    "To identify the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, we need to examine the etymology and phonological development of each word. Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word. A word that hasn't undergone this process would be one that either retains its long vowel or had a short vowel to begin with.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  I will create a data structure in Python containing the linguistic information for each word: its root form, the historical vowel sound, the current vowel sound, and an explanation of whether laxing occurred.\n2.  The code will then iterate through this data, printing the analysis for each word.\n3.  The word that did not have a long vowel in its root to be shortened is the correct answer. The code will identify and print this word as the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_word_without_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone\n    vowel laxing (shortening) during its historical development.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"word\": \"southern\",\n            \"root\": \"south\",\n            \"root_vowel\": \"/aʊ/ (tense diphthong)\",\n            \"derived_vowel\": \"/ʌ/ (lax vowel)\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The tense diphthong in 'south' becomes a lax vowel in 'southern'.
