    # Step 1: Analyze the prediction of standard physical theories (like General Relativity).
    # For a source moving at a constant velocity, the force field (gravitational or electric)
    # points to the instantaneous position, not the retarded (time-delayed) position.
    # This is because the simple aberration effect (a "lag") is perfectly cancelled by
    # velocity-dependent terms in the field equations.
    # Therefore, standard physics predicts no effective shift for constant velocity motion.
    standard_theory_predicts_shift = False

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices in the context of standard vs. non-standard physics.
    
    # Choices B and E describe features of General Relativity (GR), the standard theory of gravity.
    # Therefore, they predict no shift.
    # Choice A is physically incorrect (tensors are covariant, not invariant).
    # Choice D is unphysical (implies constant field strength regardless of distance).
    
    # Choice C proposes a non-standard force law: Strength ∝ 1/Time.
    # Since propagation time is proportional to distance (Time ≈ Distance/c), this implies
    # Strength ∝ 1/Distance. This is a 1/R force law, not the standard 1/R^2 law of gravity.
    
    # In a new, non-standard theory, the precise mathematical cancellation that occurs in
    # standard 1/R^2 theories is not guaranteed to hold.
    non_standard_theory_predicts_shift = True

    # Step 3: Conclude based on the question's premise.
    # The question's premise is that a shift *does* occur.
    # We must therefore choose the assumption that allows for this shift, which means
    # stepping outside of the standard theory where the shift is cancelled.
