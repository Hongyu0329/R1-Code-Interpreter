    "My plan is to identify the Oscar-nominated film that matches the specific scene described. The key elements are a character sealing their fate, the phrase \"Thank you,\" and the setting of a bus. I will analyze my knowledge of film history to find the movie that contains this sequence of events. Based on these clues, the film is \"Midnight Cowboy,\" where the character Ratso Rizzo's fate is sealed on a bus trip to Florida, a trip for which he is profoundly grateful to his friend Joe Buck.\n\nI will then provide the answer in a Python code block, using a print statement to output the name of the film as per the instructions.\n\n```python\n# The Oscar-nominated film in question is \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969).\n# In the film, the sick and destitute character Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman)\n# dreams of escaping New York for the warm weather of Florida.\n# His friend, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), manages to get the money for two bus tickets.\n# Ratso's gratitude for this final act of friendship is a key emotional point.\n# He boards the bus with Joe, but his fate is sealed as he dies during the journey,\n# just before they arrive in Miami.\n\nfilm_title = \"Midnight Cowboy\"\nprint(f\"The film is: {film_title}\")\n```\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
