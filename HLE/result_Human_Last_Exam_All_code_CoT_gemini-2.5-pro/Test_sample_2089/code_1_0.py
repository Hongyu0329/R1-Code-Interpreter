# The Oscar-nominated film in question is "Midnight Cowboy" (1969).
# In the film, the sick and destitute character Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman)
# dreams of escaping New York for the warm weather of Florida.
# His friend, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), manages to get the money for two bus tickets.
# Ratso's gratitude for this final act of friendship is a key emotional point.
# He boards the bus with Joe, but his fate is sealed as he dies during the journey,
# just before they arrive in Miami.
