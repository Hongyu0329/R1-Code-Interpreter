    This function determines the smallest number of topologically distinct
    compactifications of the ray with a given remainder X.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of topologically distinct compactifications
    of the ray [0, 1) with a remainder X, where X is an arbitrary non-degenerate,
    locally-connected, compact metric space.

    1.  For complex remainders like an interval X = [0, 1] or a circle X = S^1,
        it's possible to construct infinitely many topologically distinct
        compactifications. These differ in their "set of accessible points".

    2.  To find the minimum, we must consider the simplest possible space for X
        that meets the criteria. The simplest such space is a finite set of
        points with the discrete topology. Let's choose a two-point space,
        X = {a, b}.

    3.  For the remainder to be X = {a, b}, the ray must have both 'a' and 'b'
        as limit points. This means the path must oscillate between 'a' and 'b'
        infinitely often near its end.

    4.  All such constructions for X = {a, b} result in spaces that are
        homeomorphic to each other. The topological structure is uniquely defined
        by a ray having two intertwined limit points. Thus, for X = {a, b},
        there is only one distinct compactification.

    5.  Since we found a case with 1 compactification and the number cannot be 0,
        the minimum number is 1.
