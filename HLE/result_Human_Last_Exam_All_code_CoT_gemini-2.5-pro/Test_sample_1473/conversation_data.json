    "My plan to solve this integral is as follows:\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The expression involves `arccsc` of a complex term. I will use trigonometric and inverse trigonometric identities to simplify `arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))`. A key identity here is `arccsc(y) = arccot(sqrt(y^2 - 1))` for `y > 1`.\n2.  **Symmetry**: I will analyze the simplified integrand for symmetry over the integration interval $[0, \\pi]$. This will allow me to change the integration limits, often simplifying the problem. The integrand is symmetric about `x = pi/2`, so `∫[0,π] f(x)dx = 2 * ∫[0,π/2] f(x)dx`.\n3.  **Substitution**: After simplifying the limits, I will perform a series of substitutions to transform the integral into a more manageable form. A good sequence of substitutions is `t = csc(x)` followed by `t = sec(θ)`.\n4.  **Feynman's Trick (Differentiation Under the Integral Sign)**: The resulting integral is a known, non-trivial integral. I will introduce a parameter and use differentiation under the integral sign to solve it. This involves creating a function `J(a)`, differentiating it with respect to `a`, integrating the result, and then determining the constant of integration to find the value of `J(1)`, which is related to our original integral `I`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Once the analytical form of the integral is found, I will substitute the values to get the final answer. The final python code will print out these steps and calculate the final numerical result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the analytical solution to the integral\n    I = ∫[0, π] (csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))) dx\n    and calculates its numerical value.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Determining the value of I = ∫[0, π] (csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))) dx\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the integrand.\")\n    print(\"We use the identity arccsc(y) = arccot(sqrt(y^2 - 1)) for y > 1.\")\n    print(\"Let y = sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)).
