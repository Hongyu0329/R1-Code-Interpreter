    print("Step 1: Understanding the phrase 'my love for humanity'.")
    print("The phrase treats 'love', an abstract emotion, as if it were a concrete substance or a possession.")
    print("It can be possessed ('my' love) and can be quantified or directed ('for humanity').")
    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the types of conceptual metaphors.")
    print("A. Conceptual metaphor: This is the overarching category, not a specific type.")
    print("C. Orientational metaphor: This deals with spatial orientations like up/down or in/out (e.g., 'feeling up'). The phrase does not express a spatial orientation.")
    print("D. Structural metaphor: This is when one concept is understood and structured in terms of another more concrete concept. For example, ARGUMENT is structured as WAR.")
    print("\nStep 3: Connecting the phrase to the best-fitting category.")
    print("The phrase 'my love for humanity' relies on the underlying metaphor LOVE IS A SUBSTANCE or LOVE IS A POSSESSION.")
    print("This metaphor *structures* our abstract concept of 'love' using the properties of a physical substance or object (it can be held, measured, given).")
    print("While this has elements of an 'ontological metaphor' (treating an abstraction as an entity), that is not an option. Ontological metaphors are often considered a type of structural metaphor because they impose the structure of an object onto a concept.")
    print("Therefore, the phrase expresses a structural metaphor, as it structures the concept of 'love' in terms of a 'possession' or 'substance'.")
    print("\nConclusion: The best fit from the given options is 'Structural Metaphor'.")
