# The value of the integral is given by the expression: pi * (1 - log(2*pi))
# Here, we calculate this value.

# Final equation: Integral = pi - pi*log(2) - pi*log(pi)
# We can also write this as: Integral = pi * (1 - log(2*pi))

# Define the constants and intermediate values
pi = math.pi
log_2 = math.log(2)
log_pi = math.log(pi)

# Calculate the terms in the equation
# Term 1: pi
term1 = pi
# Term 2: -pi * log(2)
term2 = -pi * log_2
# Term 3: -pi * log(pi)
term3 = -pi * log_pi
# Term 4: pi (from the subtraction)
# The full expression is term1 + term2 + term3, but let's calculate from pi(1-log(2pi))

# Value of 2*pi
two_pi = 2 * pi
# Value of log(2*pi)
log_two_pi = math.log(two_pi)
# Value of 1 - log(2*pi)
factor = 1 - log_two_pi

# The final value of the integral
integral_value = pi * factor

# Output the numbers in the final equation and the result
