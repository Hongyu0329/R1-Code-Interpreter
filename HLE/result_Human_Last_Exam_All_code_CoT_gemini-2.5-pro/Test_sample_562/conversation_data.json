    "To find the radical for the character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the character**: I will first look at the character 謄 and break it down into its constituent parts.\n2.  **Identify the radical**: The character 謄 is composed of two parts: 言 (gen, gon, koto, iu - meaning \"word\" or \"to say\") on the left and 朕 (chin - an archaic \"I\" or \"we\") on the right. In characters structured this way, the left-hand component is typically the radical. Therefore, the radical is 言.\n3.  **Find the radical's name**: When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known by a specific name. This name is ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: I will convert the hiragana ごんべん into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Create the script**: I will write a simple Python script to print this answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the radical for the Japanese character 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    character = '謄'\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言.\n    # When this radical appears on the left side of a character,\n    # its name is ごんべん (gonben).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu (radical) in the character '{character}' is called '{radical_name_hepburn}'.\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
