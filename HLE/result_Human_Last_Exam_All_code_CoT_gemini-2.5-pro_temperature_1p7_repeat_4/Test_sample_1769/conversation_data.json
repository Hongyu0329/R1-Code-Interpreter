    "If the Norse had never invaded the British Isles, their language, Old Norse, would not have influenced Old English to the same extent. Many core English words today, including \"sky\", \"leg\", \"skin\", \"egg\", and \"sister\", are direct borrowings from Old Norse.\n\nTo figure out what the modern word for \"sister\" would be, we need to do the following:\n\n1.  **Identify the original Old English word:** Before the Old Norse \"systir\" was adopted, Anglo-Saxons used the word \"sweoster\".\n2.  **Trace its evolution:** We need to predict how \"sweoster\" would have changed through Middle English and into Modern English, following standard sound change rules. We can look at how similar words evolved. For example, the Old English word \"brēost\" evolved into the modern word \"breast\".\n3.  **Determine the final form:** Following a similar phonological path, the `eo` sound in \"sweoster\" would likely have simplified to a short `e` sound in Middle English, resulting in \"swester\". This form would likely have remained stable, giving us the final modern word.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this linguistic journey and prints the final hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the modern English word for 'sister'\n    without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the current word and its origin.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    norse_origin = \"systir\"\n\n    # Step 2: Define the original Old English word that was replaced.\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n\n    # Step 3: Define the hypothetical Modern English word by tracing the evolution.\n    # The evolution of a word like Old English \"brēost\" to Modern English \"breast\"\n    # serves as a good model for the sound changes.\n    # Old English \"sweoster\" -> Middle English \"swester\" -> Modern English \"swester\"\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(f\"The current word '{current_word}' comes from the Old Norse word '{norse_origin}'.\")\n    print(f\"Without Norse influence, the native Old English word '{old_english_word}' would have evolved instead.\")\n    print(\"Based on known sound changes (like OE 'brēost' -> 'breast'), the most likely evolution would be:\")\n    print(f\"Old English: {old_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"-> Middle English (hypothetical): swester\")\n    print(f\"-> Modern English (hypothetical): {hypothetical_modern_word}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the Modern English word would likely be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_modern_word)\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n<<<swester>>>"
