    # The problem asks for the smallest number of topologically distinct
    # compactifications of the ray with a remainder X, where X is a
    # nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space.

    # This number, N(X), depends on the choice of the space X. To find the
    # minimum possible value of N(X), we can examine N(X) for a few simple
    # choices of X.

    # Candidate A: X is the closed interval [0,1].
    # The interval [0,1] is a valid choice for X. It has two topologically
    # distinct endpoints, 0 and 1. This feature allows for precisely two
    # different kinds of compactifications:
    # 1. One where the endpoints are "principal points" (the ray approaches them directly).
    # 2. One where all points are "sewed points" (the ray oscillates and doesn't
    #    approach any point 'directly').
    # It is a known result in topology that N([0,1]) = 2.
    num_compactifications_interval = 2

    # Candidate B: X is the circle S^1.
    # The circle S^1 is also a valid choice for X. It is a homogeneous space,
    # meaning it has no special points; all its points are topologically alike.
    # Due to this symmetry, any way of attaching the ray such that all of S^1
    # is the remainder results in the same topological space (up to homeomorphism).
    # All points in the remainder are necessarily "sewed points".
    # Therefore, N(S^1) = 1.
    num_compactifications_circle = 1

    # We are looking for the smallest number among all possible choices for X.
    # We have found a space (the circle) that gives 1 compactification and another
    # (the interval) that gives 2. Since a compactification must exist, N(X) >= 1.
    # The minimum number is therefore the minimum of the values we have found.
    min_number = min(num_compactifications_interval, num_compactifications_circle)

    # Output the reasoning and the final answer, showing the numbers involved.
