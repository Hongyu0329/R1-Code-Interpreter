    print(f"\n1. Baseline and Metal Ion Analysis:")
    print(f"   - The control reaction has a kcat of {kcat_control}/s. This is our baseline.")
    print(f"   - With MgCl2, kcat increases from {kcat_control} to {kcat_mg}/s. This indicates Mg2+ is a cofactor or activator.")
    print(f"   - With CaCl2, kcat remains at {kcat_ca}/s, showing no effect.")
    print(f"   - With CuCl2, kcat decreases from {kcat_control} to {kcat_cu}/s, indicating Cu2+ is an inhibitor.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the function of Al1 and Al2
    print(f"\n2. Analysis of Al1 and Al2:")
    print(f"   - Al1 increases kcat from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al1}/s. Therefore, Al1 is a potent activator.")
    print(f"   - Al2 decreases kcat from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al2}/s. Therefore, Al2 is an inhibitor.")
    print(f"   - When both Al1 and Al2 are added, the kcat is {kcat_al1_al2}/s. This value is identical to the kcat with Al2 alone.")
    print(f"   - This result strongly suggests that Al1 and Al2 compete for the same allosteric binding site. The inhibitor (Al2) 'wins' this competition, and its effect dominates.")
    print(f"   - Conclusion: Al1 and Al2 are allosteric modulators that bind to the same site on Zma1.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the function of XAG1 (for comparison)
    print(f"\n3. Analysis of XAG1 (Reversible Inhibitor):")
    print(f"   - XAG1 is a strong inhibitor, reducing kcat from {kcat_control} to {kcat_xag1}/s.")
    print(f"   - However, when substrate concentration is increased, the inhibition is overcome, and kcat recovers significantly to {kcat_xag1_substrate}/s (close to the original {kcat_control}/s).")
    print(f"   - This is the classic characteristic of a competitive reversible inhibitor, which competes with the substrate for the active site.")
    
    # Step 4: Analyze the function of Rga1
    print(f"\n4. Analysis of Rga1:")
    print(f"   - Rga1 is also a strong inhibitor, reducing kcat from {kcat_control} to {kcat_rga1}/s.")
    print(f"   - When substrate concentration is increased, the kcat remains low at {kcat_rga1_substrate}/s. The inhibition is NOT overcome.")
    print(f"   - This indicates Rga1 is NOT a competitive reversible inhibitor. Its mechanism is different from XAG1. This behavior is consistent with non-competitive or irreversible inhibition.")
    print(f"   - Given the answer choices, 'irreversible inhibitor' is the most fitting description for this type of non-competitive behavior.")

    # Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices
    print("\n5. Evaluating the Answer Choices based on the analysis:")
    print("   - A is incorrect because Rga1 is not a simple 'reversible inhibitor'; its inhibition is not overcome by substrate.")
    print("   - B is incorrect because CaCl2 has no effect and is not a cofactor.")
    print("   - C: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.' -> This matches our analysis perfectly.")
    print("   - D is incorrect because XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor, not irreversible.")
    print("   - F is incorrect because CaCl2 is not a cofactor and CuCl2 is an inhibitor.")
    print("   - G is incorrect because Al2 is an inhibitor, not an activator, and they bind to the same site.")
    print("   - H is incorrect because calling Rga1 a 'reversible inhibitor' is misleading given the data.")

    print("\n----------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The function of Al1 is an allosteric activator.")
    print("The function of Rga1 is an irreversible or non-competitive inhibitor.")
    print("The evidence points to Choice C as the most accurate description.")
