    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to consider the material's properties and the physical requirements for the SPDC process.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics of SPDC:** First, I'll identify the fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect, which depends on a material property called the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  **Examine the Symmetry Requirement:** A key principle in nonlinear optics is that for the bulk dipole contribution to χ⁽²⁾ to be non-zero, the material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Investigate Boron Nanosheet Structure:** I will check the crystal structure of common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene). I need to determine if these structures are centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Based on the symmetry of boron nanosheets, I will conclude whether they are expected to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and thus exhibit SPDC.\n5.  **Develop the Code:** Since the answer to the primary question is \"no,\" a direct calculation for SPDC in borophene is not possible. To satisfy the coding requirement, I will create a Python script that demonstrates the underlying principle of energy conservation in a hypothetical SPDC process. The script will calculate the wavelengths of the down-converted photons for a common laser wavelength in the degenerate case (where the two new photons have equal energy) and display the governing equation with the calculated values.\n\n**Execution of the Plan:**\n\n1.  **SPDC Requirement:** As established, SPDC requires a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Materials with a center of inversion have χ⁽²⁾ = 0.\n3.  **Boron Nanosheet Structure:** The most widely studied and stable free-standing borophene structures (like the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are known to be centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because they are centrosymmetric, free-standing boron nanosheets have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero. Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to demonstrate the energy conservation principle in a general SPDC process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spdc_degenerate_case(pump_wavelength_nm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates energy conservation in degenerate Spontaneous Parametric\n    Downconversion (SPDC), a process not expected in centrosymmetric materials\n    like boron nanosheets but fundamental to nonlinear optics.\n\n    In SPDC, a high-energy pump photon splits into two lower-energy photons\n    (called signal and idler). The conservation of energy is described by the equation:\n    1 / pump_wavelength = 1 / signal_wavelength + 1 / idler_wavelength\n\n    This function calculates the outcome for the 'degenerate' case, where the\n    signal and idler photons have the same wavelength.\n\n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the pump laser in nanometers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In the degenerate case, signal_wavelength equals idler_wavelength.\n    # The equation simplifies to: 1 / pump = 1 / degenerate + 1 / degenerate\n    # Which is: 1 / pump = 2 / degenerate\n    # Therefore: degenerate_wavelength = 2 * pump_wavelength\n    degenerate_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n\n    # Display the results\n    print(f\"This script demonstrates energy conservation for a hypothetical SPDC process.\")\n    print(f\"Given a pump photon with a wavelength of {pump_wavelength_nm} nm:\")\n    print(f\"In degenerate SPDC, it would split into two photons, each with a wavelength of {degenerate_wavelength_nm} nm.\")\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n\n    # Output the final equation with each number, as requested.\n    # We use integer casting for a clean representation of the equation.\n    pump = int(pump_wavelength_nm)\n    degen = int(degenerate_wavelength_nm)\n    \n    print(\"The final energy conservation equation is:\")\n    print(f\"1 / {pump} = 1 / {degen} + 1 / {degen}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# We will use the wavelength of a common violet laser pointer as an example pump source.\nPUMP_WAVELENGTH = 405.0\n\ncalculate_spdc_degenerate_case(PUMP_WAVELENGTH)\n```\n<<<No, because the common stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, which forbids the second-order nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
