    # The problem is to identify very low-frequency alleles in a microbial population.
    # Key requirements for this task are:
    # 1. High accuracy to distinguish true rare variants from sequencing errors.
    # 2. High sequencing depth to ensure the rare allele is sampled enough times to be detected confidently.

    # Analysis of Option A:
    # "Conduct a thorough library preparation and increase the sequencing depth from 40X to 80X
    # and then compare these reads to the alleles of interest."
    # - "Thorough library preparation": Maximizes data quality and minimizes errors from the start. This is crucial.
    # - "Increase the sequencing depth from 40X to 80X": Directly increases the statistical power to find rare events.
    # - Implies using standard high-accuracy short-read sequencing (like Illumina), which is the correct tool for this job.
    # This option addresses the two most critical factors directly.

    # Analysis of other options:
    # - Options B, C, E suggest using MinION (long-read sequencing). While useful for other applications, its higher
    #   error rate makes it unsuitable for reliably detecting low-frequency single-nucleotide variants.
    # - Option D suggests a "quality check", which is a standard but reactive step. "Thorough library preparation" (Option A)
    #   is a more fundamental, proactive step to ensure high quality.
