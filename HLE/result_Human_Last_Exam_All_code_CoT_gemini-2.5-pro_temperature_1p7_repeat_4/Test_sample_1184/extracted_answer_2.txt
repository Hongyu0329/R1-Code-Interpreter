--- 1. Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 Subunit ---
These residues in the beta-1 subunit's 'Beta Interaction Domain' (BID) are critical for binding to the alpha-1 subunit.

Residue: W316                                Role: Forms deep hydrophobic pocket for AID binding
Residue: Y318                                Role: Contributes to the hydrophobic binding pocket
Residue: I357                                Role: Hydrophobic contact with the AID helix
Residue: F391                                Role: Key hydrophobic residue in the binding groove
Residue: Y393                                Role: Forms part of the hydrophobic wall of the binding pocket
Residue: W440                                Role: Critical hydrophobic anchor point for the AID helix
Residue: E441                                Role: Forms a key salt bridge with a conserved arginine on the AID


--- 2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation of alpha-1 Subunit ---
These residues and domains in the beta-1 subunit fine-tune the gating behavior of the channel.

Residue/Region: N-terminal Domain (residues 1-86)   Role: Significantly modulates the speed and voltage-dependence of channel inactivation
Residue/Region: Y169                                Role: Alters the voltage-dependence of channel activation. Mutation affects how readily the channel opens in response to voltage changes
Residue/Region: D1-D2 Linker (residues 87-164)    Role: Contributes to the regulation of voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics
