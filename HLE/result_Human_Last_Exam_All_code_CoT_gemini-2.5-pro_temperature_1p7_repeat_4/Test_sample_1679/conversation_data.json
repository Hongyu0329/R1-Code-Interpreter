    "To find the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks:** There are two. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Create a Chronological List of Winners:** I will list the Academy Award winners for Best Picture chronologically, starting from the first award.\n3.  **Analyze Film Settings:** I will check the setting of each film on the list. I'm looking for films set in either Paris (specifically featuring the Place de la Concorde) or Luxor, Egypt.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Match:** By moving through the list from the earliest winner, I will identify the first film that contains a scene with either obelisk. Research indicates that many musicals and dramas were set in Paris. *An American in Paris* (winner for 1951) famously features a long ballet sequence with stylized sets of Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. Films preceding it, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), were set in France but did not depict this specific landmark.\n\nI will now write a Python script that contains this researched data and programmatically finds and prints the correct film.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    This function contains a curated list of Best Picture winners and notes on whether they depict\n    a Luxor Obelisk (located in Paris, France or Luxor, Egypt). It iterates through the list\n    chronologically to find the first instance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of Best Picture winners by year of award ceremony (year film was released is year-1)\n    # The 'depicts_obelisk' flag is based on film analysis.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1929: {\"title\": \"The Broadway Melody\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1930: {\"title\": \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"setting\": \"Germany/France (WWI)\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1931: {\"title\": \"Cimarron\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1932: {\"title\": \"Grand Hotel\", \"setting\": \"Germany\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1933: {\"title\": \"Cavalcade\", \"setting\": \"UK\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1934: {\"title\": \"It Happened One Night\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1935: {\"title\": \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"setting\": \"Sea/Tahiti\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1936: {\"title\": \"The Great Ziegfeld\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1937: {\"title\": \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"setting\": \"France\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1938: {\"title\": \"You Can't Take It with You\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1939: {\"title\": \"Gone with the Wind\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1940: {\"title\": \"Rebecca\", \"setting\": \"UK\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1941: {\"title\": \"How Green Was My Valley\", \"setting\": \"UK\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1942: {\"title\": \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"setting\": \"UK\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1943: {\"title\": \"Casablanca\", \"setting\": \"Morocco\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1944: {\"title\": \"Going My Way\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1945: {\"title\": \"The Lost Weekend\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1946: {\"title\": \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1947: {\"title\": \"Gentleman's Agreement\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1948: {\"title\": \"Hamlet\", \"setting\": \"Denmark\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1949: {\"title\": \"All the King's Men\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1950: {\"title\": \"All About Eve\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1951: {\"title\": \"An American in Paris\", \"setting\": \"France\", \"depicts_obelisk\": True},\n        1952: {\"title\": \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        1953: {\"title\": \"From Here to Eternity\", \"setting\": \"USA (Hawaii)\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n    }\n\n    # Sorting the years to ensure chronological order\n    sorted_years = sorted(best_picture_winners.keys())\n\n    # Note: 'Wings' (1927/28) is excluded as it doesn't feature the obelisk.\n    # The list starts from 1929 for brevity but includes the first confirmed result.\n\n    for year in sorted_years:\n        film_info = best_picture_winners[year]\n        if film_info[\"depicts_obelisk\"]:\n            # The award is for films released in the previous year.\n            release_year = year - 1\n            print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk was '{film_info['title']}'.\")\n            print(f\"It won the award in {year} for films released in {release_year}.\")\n            print(\"The obelisk is located at the Place de la Concorde in Paris and is shown during the film's final ballet sequence.\")\n            # We use sys.exit() to stop after finding the first match.\n            sys.exit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
