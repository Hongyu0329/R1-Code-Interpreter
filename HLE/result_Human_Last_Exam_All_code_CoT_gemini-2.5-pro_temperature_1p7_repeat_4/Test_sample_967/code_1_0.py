# Step 1: Define the properties of the Petersen graph.
petersen_vertices = 10
petersen_edges = 15
petersen_degree = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the properties of the line graph of the Petersen graph.
# The number of vertices in a line graph is the number of edges in the original graph.
line_graph_vertices = petersen_edges

# The degree of each vertex in the line graph of a k-regular graph is 2*(k-1).
line_graph_degree = 2 * (petersen_degree - 1)

# The number of edges in a d-regular graph with V vertices is (V * d) / 2.
line_graph_edges = (line_graph_vertices * line_graph_degree) / 2

# Step 3: Compute the first l^2-Betti number using the simplified formula.
# Based on the problem's construction, this simplifies to |E| - |V| for the underlying graph.
l2_betti_number = line_graph_edges - line_graph_vertices

# Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result.
