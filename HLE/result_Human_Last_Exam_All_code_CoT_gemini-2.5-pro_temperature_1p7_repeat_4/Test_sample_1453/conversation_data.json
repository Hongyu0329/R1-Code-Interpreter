    "This problem requires determining the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a protein coiled-coil sequence. The key to solving this lies in analyzing the repeating pattern of amino acids, specifically the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The identity of these residues, particularly their size and side-chain branching, dictates the most stable packing geometry according to the \"knobs-into-holes\" model.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Heptad Register Identification:** The first step is to find the correct heptad repeat register. A coiled-coil buries hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions to form a stable core. I will write a script to test all seven possible registers (or \"frames\") for the sequence. For each frame, I will identify the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n2.  **Scoring and Frame Selection:** The best register is the one that maximizes the hydrophobicity of the core. I will calculate two scores for each frame:\n    *   **Core Score:** The sum of hydrophobicity of all 'a' and 'd' position residues. A higher score is better.\n    *   **Exposure Penalty:** The sum of hydrophobicity of residues at the solvent-exposed 'e' and 'g' positions. A lower score is better, as placing hydrophobic residues on the surface is energetically unfavorable.\n    The optimal frame will have the highest Core Score. If there's a tie, the one with the lower Exposure Penalty will be chosen.\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** Once the best frame and its core residues are identified, I will apply the established rules based on packing efficiency:\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Often characterized by Leucine (`L`) at 'd' positions and small or varied residues at 'a' positions (e.g., `A...L...`).\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Strongly favors β-branched residues (Isoleucine `I` or Valine `V`) at 'a' positions and non-β-branched residues (Leucine `L` or Alanine `A`) at 'd' positions (e.g., `I...L...`).\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Favors non-β-branched residues (`L`) at 'a' positions and β-branched residues (`I`) at 'd' positions (e.g., `L...I...`).\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will print the step-by-step analysis, including the best frame, the core residue pattern, the rule used for prediction, and the final oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (str): The amino acid sequence of the protein.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Fauchere-Pliska hydrophobicity scale.
