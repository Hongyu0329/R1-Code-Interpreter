    "An A-stable numerical method is one whose region of absolute stability contains the entire left half-plane. For methods that are not A-stable, we can define the concept of A($\\alpha$)-stability. A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability contains the infinite wedge $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The largest such angle $\\alpha$ is called the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle.\n\nFor a linear multistep method, the boundary of the stability region is given by the set of complex numbers $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method. For the BDFk methods, $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^k$ (in the form where the right-hand side is $h\\beta_k f_{n+k}$ and coefficients are on $y_{n+j}$).\n\nThe BDF4 method has the characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\xi)$:\n$$ \\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThis can also be derived from the summation formula $\\rho_k(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{1}{j}\\xi^{k-j}(\\xi-1)^j$.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to the stability boundary. Such a tangency point can be a cusp on the boundary curve. A cusp $z_c$ corresponds to a value $\\xi_c$ on the complex unit circle for which $z'(\\xi_c) = 0$. This condition simplifies to solving the polynomial equation $N(\\xi) = \\xi\\rho'(\\xi) - k\\rho(\\xi) = 0$. For BDFk methods, this polynomial has a remarkably simple form:\n$$ N(\\xi) = \\xi^k - (\\xi-1)^k $$\nFor BDF4 ($k=4$), we need to find the roots of:\n$$ N(\\xi) = \\xi^4 - (\\xi-1)^4 = 4\\xi^3 - 6\\xi^2 + 4\\xi - 1 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this polynomial are $\\xi_1 = \\frac{1+i}{2}$, $\\xi_2 = \\frac{1-i}{2}$, and $\\xi_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe evaluate the corresponding points $z_j = \\rho_4(\\xi_j)/\\xi_j^4$ on the stability boundary. These are the cusps. Let's compute $z(\\xi_2) = z(\\frac{1-i}{2})$.\nThe stability region for BDF4 is the exterior of the curve traced by $z(\\theta)$. The unstable region is the interior, which contains the origin. For A($\\alpha$)-stability, the wedge $W_\\alpha = \\{z: |\\arg(z)-\\pi|\\le\\alpha\\}$, opening into the left half-plane, must be contained in the stability region. This means $W_\\alpha$ cannot overlap with the unstable region. The angle $\\alpha$ is therefore limited by the \"tips\" (cusps) of the unstable region.\n\nLet's find the location of the cusp $z_2$ corresponding to $\\xi_2 = (1-i)/2$.\nWe need to calculate $\\rho_4(\\xi_2)$ and $\\xi_2^4$.\n$\\xi_2^2 = (\\frac{1-i}{2})^2 = \\frac{1-2i-1}{4} = -\\frac{i}{2}$\n$\\xi_2^4 = (-\\frac{i}{2})^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\rho_4(\\xi_2) = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{i}{6}$\nThe cusp location is $z_2 = \\frac{\\rho_4(\\xi_2)}{\\xi_2^4} = \\frac{1/16 + i/6}{-1/4} = -\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{3}i$.\n\nBy symmetry (since $\\rho_4$ has real coefficients), the cusp corresponding to $\\xi_1 = \\bar{\\xi_2}$ is $z_1 = \\bar{z_2} = -\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{3}i$.\nThe cusp corresponding to $\\xi_3 = 1/2$ is $z_3 = -7/12$.\n\nThe unstable region is bounded by these cusps, all of which are in the left half-plane. The cone $W_\\alpha$ is limited by the cusp that makes the largest angle with the negative real axis. This angle is determined by the argument of $z_1$ or $z_2$.\nLet's consider $z_2 = -1/4 - 2i/3$. The angle $\\beta$ this point makes with the negative real axis is given by:\n$\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{\\text{Im}(z_2)}{\\text{Re}(z_2) - c}$ (for some c)? No, it's just the argument of $-z_2$. Let's compute the argument of the vector from the origin to the cusp in the second quadrant, $z_1 = -1/4+2i/3$. The angle of the vector is $\\arg(z_1)$. The angle we need, $\\alpha$, is the angle between the negative real axis and the vector.\n$\\alpha = \\arg(z_1) - \\pi$ (this is negative). We take the absolute value.\nOr, more simply, $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\left|\\frac{\\text{Im}(z_1)}{\\text{Re}(z_1)}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{2/3}{-1/4}\\right| = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact value for the angle is $\\alpha = \\arctan(8/3)$.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# BDF4 characteristic polynomial rho(xi)\ndef rho4(xi):\n    # This is equivalent to the coefficient form:\n    # (25/12)*xi**4 - 4*xi**3 + 3*xi**2 - (4/3)*xi + 1/4\n    # It is derived from the sum formula which is more fundamental\n    s = 0\n    k = 4\n    for j in range(1, k + 1):\n        s += (1 / j) * (xi**(k - j)) * ((xi - 1)**j)\n    return s\n\n# Find the roots of N(xi) = xi^4 - (xi-1)^4 = 0\n# The roots are (1+i)/2, (1-i)/2, 1/2\nxi_cusp = (1 - 1j) / 2\n\n# Value of rho at the cusp-defining xi\nrho_val = rho4(xi_cusp)\n\n# Value of xi^4 at that point\nxi_pow4 = xi_cusp**4\n\n# Location of the cusp on the stability boundary\nz_cusp = rho_val / xi_pow4\n\n# The angle alpha is determined by the tangent of the cusp's components\n# alpha = arctan(|Im(z)| / |Re(z)|)\nreal_part = z_cusp.real\nimag_part = z_cusp.imag\n\n# The result is tan(alpha) = 8/3\nprint(\"The exact value of alpha is arctan(8/3).\")\nprint(\"This can be written as:\")\nprint(\"alpha = arctan({1}/{0})\".format(abs(real_part), abs(imag_part)))\n# We need to present the numbers in the final equation\ny = abs(imag_part)\nx = abs(real_part)\nprint(\"alpha = arctan( {} / {} )\".format(y, x))\n# Note that y/x = (2/3)/(1/4) = 8/3\nnumerator_of_ratio = 8\ndenominator_of_ratio = 3\n\nprint(\"So, the final value is arctan({}/{})\".format(numerator_of_ratio, denominator_of_ratio))\n\n```\n<<<arctan(8/3)>>>"
