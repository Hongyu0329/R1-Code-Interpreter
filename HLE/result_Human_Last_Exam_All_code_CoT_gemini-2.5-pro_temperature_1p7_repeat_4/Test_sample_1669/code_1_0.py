# The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that a bridgeless 3-regular
# graph with 20 vertices admits a valid k-vector.

# Definition of a k-vector:
# 1. It is a vector 'x' where each entry corresponds to an edge of the graph.
# 2. For every vertex 'v', the sum of the vector's values on edges incident to 'v' is zero.
#    If e1, e2, e3 are the edges at any vertex, then their values must satisfy: x(e1) + x(e2) + x(e3) = 0.
# 3. Each entry x(e) is a non-zero integer from the set {+/-1, +/-2, ..., +/-(k-1)}.

# The goal is to find the minimum possible value for k.

print("Step 1: Analyzing the condition for k=2")
# For k=2, the set of allowed integer values for each edge is {-1, 1}.
# At each vertex, we must satisfy the equation: x1 + x2 + x3 = 0
# where x1, x2, x3 must be chosen from {-1, 1}.

# Let's check all possible combinations for the sum:
s1 = 1 + 1 + 1
s2 = 1 + 1 + (-1)
s3 = 1 + (-1) + (-1)
s4 = (-1) + (-1) + (-1)

print("Step 2: Analyzing the condition for k=3")

print("Every vertex must be incident to one edge from E_2 and two edges from E_1.")

print("Since the given graph G is bridgeless and 3-regular, it is guaranteed to have such a perfect matching.")
print("This means we can always partition the edges as required.")

print("\nA consistent assignment can be constructed for the entire graph. For example:")
print("  1. Find a perfect matching M in G.")
print("  2. Assign the value -2 to every edge in M.")
print("  3. The remaining edges form a set of cycles. Assign the value 1 to all these cycle edges.")
