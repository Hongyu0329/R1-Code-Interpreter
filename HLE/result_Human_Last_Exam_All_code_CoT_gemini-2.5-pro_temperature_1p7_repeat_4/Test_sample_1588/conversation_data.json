    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical formula**: The number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion corresponds to the number of new basis elements in the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (X and Y). This number for order `n` is given by Witt's formula:\n    `L(n) = (1/n) * Σ mu(d) * 2^(n/d)`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Define the Möbius function `mu(d)`**:\n    *   `mu(1) = 1`.\n    *   `mu(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n    *   `mu(d) = (-1)^k` if `d` is the product of `k` distinct prime numbers.\n\n3.  **Create a Python script to perform the calculation for `n = 10`**:\n    *   First, find all divisors of 10.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate the Möbius function `mu(d)`.\n    *   Substitute these values into Witt's formula to find the sum.\n    *   Divide the sum by 10 to get the final result.\n    *   The script will print out each step of the calculation, showing the numbers plugged into the formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n and their multiplicities.\n    e.g., prime_factors(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = prime_factors(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # n has a squared prime factor\n            \n    # n is square-free\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in BCH expansion\n    and prints the calculation step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L({n}) = (1/{n}) * Σ [over d|{n}] mu(d) * 2^({n}/d)\\n\")\n    \n    # Build string for the formula with symbols\n    formula_symbolic_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        formula_symbolic_parts.append(f\"μ({d})*2^({n}/{d})\")\n    print(f\"L({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(formula_symbolic_parts) + \" )\")\n    \n    # Build string for the formula with calculated values and perform calculation\n    total_sum = 0\n    formula_values_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (2**power)\n        total_sum += term\n        formula_values_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*2^{power}\")\n        \n    print(f\"L({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(formula_values_parts) + \" )\")\n\n    # Build string for the detailed calculation\n    calculation_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        base_power_val = 2**power\n        calculation_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*{base_power_val}\")\n\n    calc_str = \" + \".join(calculation_parts).replace(\"+ (-\", \"- \")\n    print(f\"L({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {calc_str} )\")\n    \n    # Final steps\n    print(f\"L({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    result = total_sum // n\n    print(f\"L({n}) = {result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_order_10()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
