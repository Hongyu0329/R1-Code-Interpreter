    # - `c >= 2`
    # - `m - n + c = 2`
    # Let's consider the possibilities for the integer c.
    # If c = 2, then m - n + 2 = 2, which implies m = n.
    # If c = 3, then m - n + 3 = 2, which implies m = n - 1.
    # If c = 4, then m - n + 4 = 2, which implies m = n - 2.
    # All these scenarios describe valid graphs.
    
    # But now consider the final piece of information: the largest eigenvalue is 5.6.
    # Large eigenvalues are typically associated with dense subgraphs, high connectivity, or large degrees.
    # Scenarios where c > 2 imply that m < n, suggesting sparser graphs.
    # A graph with m < n often consists of tree-like components, whose largest eigenvalues are typically smaller (e.g., <= 4 for paths and cycles).
    # The case c=2 gives m=n. A graph with two components where m=n has exactly two cycles in total. This structure is more capable of producing a large eigenvalue like 5.6 than the sparser graphs required for c > 2.
    # Thus, the most consistent solution is c = 2.
