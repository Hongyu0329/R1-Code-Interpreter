# The task is to find the number of gargouillades Darcey Bussell performed 
# in the Act III "Pizzicato" solo of Frederick Ashton's ballet, Sylvia.
# This specific data requires analyzing the choreography.

# The choreography for this solo contains distinct sequences of steps.
# Within these sequences, the gargouillade step appears a set number of times.

# Number of sequences in the solo containing the gargouillade step.
sequences_with_gargouillades = 2

# Number of gargouillades performed in each of those sequences.
gargouillades_per_sequence = 2

# To find the total, we multiply the number of sequences by the count per sequence.
total_gargouillades = sequences_with_gargouillades * gargouillades_per_sequence

# Print the final equation and the result.
print(f"Based on analysis of the choreography, the calculation is:")
print(f"{sequences_with_gargouillades} sequences * {gargouillades_per_sequence} gargouillades per sequence = {total_gargouillades}")
