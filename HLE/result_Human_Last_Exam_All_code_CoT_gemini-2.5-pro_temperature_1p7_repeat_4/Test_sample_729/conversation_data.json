    "The user wants to find the number of \"power subgroups\" in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Interpret the User's Request**: The term \"power subgroup\" is not a standard one in group theory. The most reasonable interpretation is that it refers to a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by taking the integer powers of a single element (e.g., $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$). I will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n2.  **Understand the Group Structure**: The group $Q_{128}$ has the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. Its 128 elements can be divided into two sets:\n    *   The 64 elements of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^0, x^1, \\dots, x^{63}\\}$.\n    *   The 64 elements in the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle = \\{yx^0, yx^1, \\dots, yx^{63}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Count the Cyclic Subgroups**: I will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each of these two sets.\n    *   **Part A**: Count the distinct cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Since $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, the number of its subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 64, denoted $\\tau(64)$.\n    *   **Part B**: Count the distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^i$. It can be shown that all 64 of these elements have an order of 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. Therefore, these 64 elements will form $64 / 2 = 32$ unique cyclic subgroups.\n    *   **Part C**: The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from Part A and Part B, as the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to calculate the values from Part A and B and then sum them to find the total. The script will print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of divisors of an integer n (tau function).\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If divisors are equal, count only one\n            if n // i == i:\n                count += 1\n            # Otherwise, count both\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of cyclic subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The group Q_128 contains a cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64.\n    # The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order n is tau(n).\n    order_of_x_subgroup = 64\n    num_subgroups_from_x = count_divisors(order_of_x_subgroup)\n\n    # The other 64 elements are of the form y*x^i.\n    num_other_elements = 64\n    # Each of these elements generates a cyclic group of order 4.\n    # Each such group has phi(4) = 2 generators.\n    # So these 64 elements form 64 / 2 = 32 distinct subgroups.\n    num_subgroups_from_yx = num_other_elements // 2\n\n    # The total number of cyclic (\"power\") subgroups is the sum.\n    total_subgroups = num_subgroups_from_x + num_subgroups_from_yx\n\n    print(\"Interpreting 'power subgroup' as 'cyclic subgroup'.\")\n    print(f\"The number of cyclic subgroups from the <x> part (divisors of 64): {num_subgroups_from_x}\")\n    print(f\"The number of cyclic subgroups from the y<x> part: {num_subgroups_from_yx}\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_subgroups_from_x} + {num_subgroups_from_yx} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<39>>>"
