    Derivation Summary:
    1.  The condition that {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence leads to 2*b_2 = b_1 + b_3.
    2.  Substituting b_n = n(n+1)/a_n and a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d leads to the equation:
        a_1^2 - 3*a_1*d + 2*d^2 = 0, which factors to (a_1 - d)(a_1 - 2d) = 0.
    3.  This gives two possible cases: a_1 = d or a_1 = 2d.
    4.  Each case is tested against the condition S_99 - T_99 = 99.
