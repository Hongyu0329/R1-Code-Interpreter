# Define the numbers from the translated equation
num1 = 10000
num2 = 1000
num3 = 1111

# Perform the calculation following the order of operations
# The result will be a float, so we convert it to an integer for a clean output
result = int(num1 / num2 - num3)

# Print the full equation with the solution
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
