    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Translate the Numerals**: First, I will convert the equation from Kanji numerals to modern Arabic numerals.\n    *   `壱万` is composed of `壱` (1) and `万` (10,000), which means 1 * 10,000 = 10,000.\n    *   `壱千` is composed of `壱` (1) and `千` (1,000), which means 1 * 1,000 = 1,000.\n    *   `壱千壱百壱拾壱` is `壱千` (1000) + `壱百` (100) + `壱拾` (10) + `壱` (1) = 1111.\n    *   Therefore, the equation is: `10000 / 1000 - 1111`.\n\n2.  **Solve the Equation**: I will write a Python script to perform the calculation according to the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\n\n3.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the full equation in modern numbers along with the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the translated equation\nnum1 = 10000\nnum2 = 1000\nnum3 = 1111\n\n# Perform the calculation following the order of operations\n# The result will be a float, so we convert it to an integer for a clean output\nresult = int(num1 / num2 - num3)\n\n# Print the full equation with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-1101>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
