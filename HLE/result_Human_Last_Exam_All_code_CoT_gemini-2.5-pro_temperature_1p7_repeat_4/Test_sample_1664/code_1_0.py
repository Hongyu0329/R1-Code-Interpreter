The poem describes preserved moths in a display case, which have started to decay into "eyes and dust."
The key phrase is "strange tarnished logic of their discipline."

Let's break down this phrase:

1.  'Discipline': This refers to the human activity of collecting and classifying specimens, a scientific discipline. It's the system imposed *on* the moths.
2.  'Logic': This is the rationale behind the disciplineâ€”the idea that killing and pinning a specimen allows for its permanent study.
3.  'Tarnished': This logic is flawed. The attempt to preserve the moths forever is imperfect and has resulted in their decay into dust. The preservation method itself is what leads to this tarnished state.
4.  'Strange': The act of killing something to study its static form is an inherently odd or unnatural concept from the perspective of the living world.

Therefore, the phrase is a critique of scientific preservation. The logic of preserving a specimen is "tarnished" because the process ultimately leads to the specimen's decay and degradation.

Evaluating the choices:
- A is incorrect because the poem is about dead moths, not their behavior.
- B correctly identifies that "scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation," which captures the essence of a "tarnished logic."
- C is too literal and specific.
- D introduces an idea not present in the poem.
- E incorrectly attributes the "logic" to the insects rather than the human collectors.

The best choice is B.
