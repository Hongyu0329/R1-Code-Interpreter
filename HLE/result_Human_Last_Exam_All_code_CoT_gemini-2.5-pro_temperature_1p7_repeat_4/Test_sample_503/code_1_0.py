# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category
# from [23] to [37].
# Let m = 23 and n = 37.
m = 23
n = 37

# The number of adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(m+n, m) or C(m+n, n).
# In this case, C(23+37, 23) = C(60, 23).
total_objects = m + n
k_choices = m

# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(60, 23).
result = math.comb(total_objects, k_choices)

# Print the final equation and the result.
