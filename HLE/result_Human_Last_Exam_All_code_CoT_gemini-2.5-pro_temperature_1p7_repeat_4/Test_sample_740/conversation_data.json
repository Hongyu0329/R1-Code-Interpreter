    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Re-framing the Problem**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be expanded as a finite sum `∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`, which means it is a degenerate kernel. Such equations can be converted into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Linear System**: Let's define a set of auxiliary constants `c_k` as the moments of the unknown function `u(y)`:\n    `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n    Substituting the expanded kernel into the original equation gives:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n\n    This shows that `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Now, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n    `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n    `c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j + n - k)`\n\n    This can be written in matrix form as `c = b + λAc`, or `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `c` is the vector of constants `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]`, `b` is a vector with elements `b_j = 1/(j+1)`, and `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A[j, k] = 1/(j + n - k)`.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative, this system of linear equations fails to have a solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the range (column space) of `(I - λA)`.\n    The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. We will proceed by finding these eigenvalues. The second condition (that `b` is not in the range) is a non-degeneracy condition that is generally satisfied.\n\n4.  **Numerical Solution using Python**: The problem is now reduced to finding the eigenvalues, `μ`, of the matrix `A`. The values of `λ` for which the original equation has no solution will then be the reciprocals of these eigenvalues, i.e., `λ = 1/μ`.\n\n    I will provide a Python script that:\n    *   Takes the integer `n` as input.\n    *   Constructs the `n x n` matrix `A`.\n    *   Computes the eigenvalues of `A` using the NumPy library.\n    *   Calculates and prints the corresponding values of `λ`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solutions.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer parameter 'n' in the integral equation.
