    "This problem requires finding the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. The process involves several steps: checking for irreducibility, calculating the discriminant, analyzing the resolvent cubic polynomial, and finally using these results to identify the group and its order.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** I will use Eisenstein's criterion to determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further narrows down the possible Galois groups. For $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$.\n4.  **Identify the Group:** By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, I can pinpoint the Galois group. In this case, it will come down to distinguishing between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$. A final check based on the properties of the roots of a related quadratic polynomial will resolve this ambiguity.\n5.  **Determine the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is known. For example, the order of $S_4$ is 24, $A_4$ is 12, $D_4$ is 8, and $C_4$ is 4.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is a perfect square.\n    Returns (True, sqrt(n)) if it is, otherwise (False, None).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        return False, None\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n, x\n\ndef get_square_free_part(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the square-free part of an integer.\n    For example, get_square_free_part(20) returns 5 because 20 = 2^2 * 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n < 0:\n      sign = -1\n      n = -n\n    else:\n      sign = 1\n    \n    i = 2\n    sf = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        count = 0\n        while n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n //= i\n        if count % 2 == 1:\n            sf *= i\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        sf *= n\n    return sign * sf\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    print(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p_eisen = 2:\")\n    print(\"  - p_eisen=2 divides the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"  - p_eisen=2 divides the coefficient of x, which is 8.\")\n    print(\"  - p_eisen=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(\"  - (p_eisen)^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: All conditions are met, so the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Compute the discriminant (Delta).\")\n    # For x^4 + px + q, Delta = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3\n    delta = -27 * (p**4) + 256 * (q**3)\n    print(\"The discriminant formula is Delta = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3.\")\n    print(f\"For p={p} and q={q}, we have:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * ({p}^4) + 256 * ({q}^3)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {p**4} + 256 * {q**3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {-27 * p**4} + {256 * q**3} = {delta}\")\n    \n    is_sq, _ = is_perfect_square(delta)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Check if the discriminant ({delta}) is a perfect square in Q.\")\n    if is_sq:\n        print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square.
