# Based on the analysis of the problem, the upper-bound for ||B Q_{0, M}||_inf can be expressed
# as F * sqrt(N), where F is a factor that we need to determine.
#
# Our step-by-step derivation suggests that this factor F is bounded by 1.
# The final equation for the upper bound is: ||B Q_{0, M}||_inf <= 1 * sqrt(N).
#
# The question asks for the factor of sqrt(N) in this upper-bound expression.
# The factor is 1.
# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!". The equation for the factor is F = 1.
# So we print the number 1.
