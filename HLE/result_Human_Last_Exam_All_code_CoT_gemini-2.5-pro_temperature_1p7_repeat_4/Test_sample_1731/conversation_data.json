    "This problem requires us to find the equilibrium properties of a photon gas using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously founded on large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Principles:** The \"Bose case of the light quanta\" refers to a photon gas, which is a system of bosons where the particle number is not conserved. Large deviation theory (like Boltzmann-Sanov) states that the macroscopic equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable configuration, which is the one that maximizes the system's entropy subject to physical constraints.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Distribution:** The task is to maximize the entropy for a Bose gas, `S`, under the constraint of a fixed average energy, `E`. This standard procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (with zero chemical potential) at a temperature `T`:\n    *   Mean occupation number of an energy state `ε`: `<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n    This distribution describes the most probable, and therefore equilibrium, population of energy levels.\n\n3.  **Calculate Mean Energy (E):** To find the total mean energy `E`, we must sum the energy of all photons. In the continuous limit, this becomes an integral over all possible energies, weighted by the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a volume `V`. For photons (which are relativistic and have two polarization states), `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³))ε²`.\n    *   `E = ∫ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε`\n    Evaluating this integral gives the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density.\n\n4.  **Calculate Entropy (S):** Similarly, the total entropy `S` is found by integrating the entropy contribution from each state over the density of states.\n    *   `S = ∫ s(ε) * g(ε) dε`, where `s(ε)` is the entropy of a single state from the Bose gas entropy formula.\n\n5.  **Present the Results:** The final step is to present the results of these integrations, which are the equilibrium formulas for `E` and `S`. The code will explicitly show these formulas, highlighting each numerical constant involved as requested, and also show the direct relationship between them.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_photon_gas_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas, based on Bose-Einstein statistics and principles of large deviations.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Values for a Photon Gas (Bose case) ---\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, found by maximizing entropy.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, which is then used\")\n    print(\"to calculate macroscopic properties like mean energy (E) and entropy (S).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Equilibrium Mean Energy ---\n    # The integral for E evaluates to E = (8 * π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4\n    print(\"1.
