    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:** The molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with three identical, large, and chiral groups. These groups are attached via methylene (-CH2-) bridges. The chiral substituent is a derivative of camphor, often called camphopyrazole.\n2.  **Identify Symmetry:** The 1,3,5-substitution pattern gives the molecule overall C3 rotational symmetry. This is a crucial feature, as it means the three large arms (substituents and their connecting bridges) are chemically equivalent. It also means the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent.\n3.  **Count Unique Proton Environments:** Due to the C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of distinct proton signals originating from:\n    *   The central mesitylene core.\n    *   One of the three identical methylene bridges.\n    *   One of the three identical camphopyrazole arms.\n4.  **Perform the Count:**\n    *   **Central Core:** The three methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge (-CH2-):** The three bridges are equivalent. Within one bridge, the -CH2- group is attached to a chiral center (the camphopyrazole arm). This makes its two protons diastereotopic, meaning they are non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals (typically an AB quartet). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Camphopyrazole Arm:** This is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system.\n        *   **Pyrazole Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring part. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Camphor Skeleton Protons:**\n            *   There is one tertiary proton (CH) at a bridgehead. This gives **1 signal**.\n            *   There are two methylene groups (-CH2-) in the six-membered ring of the camphor skeleton. For each of these, the two protons (endo/exo) are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives 2 * 2 = **4 signals**.\n            *   There are three methyl groups on the skeleton. Due to the molecule's overall asymmetry relative to them, all three are in distinct chemical environments. The two geminal methyls are also diastereotopic. This gives **3 signals**.\n5.  **Sum the Signals:** We will add up the signals from each unique part to get the total number of peaks.\n\nThe following Python code systematically calculates the total number of signals based on this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_signals():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule\n    by analyzing its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis based on molecular structure and symmetry (C3)\n    \n    # 1.
