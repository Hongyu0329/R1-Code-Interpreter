# The problem: Find the minimum number of antibodies required to distinguish five isoforms:
# DNMT3A1, DNMT3A2, DNMT3B1, DNMT3B3, and DNMT3L using Western Blot.

# Step 1: Define the isoforms and their properties.
# A Western Blot distinguishes proteins based on two features:
# 1. Antibody binding specificity.
# 2. Molecular Weight (MW), which determines the band position on the blot.
isoforms = {
    'DNMT3A1': {'mw_kDa': 130},
    'DNMT3A2': {'mw_kDa': 100},

    'DNMT3B3': {'mw_kDa': 82},
    'DNMT3L':  {'mw_kDa': 43},
}

# Step 3: Test if two antibodies (N=2) are sufficient.
# The strategy is to partition the 5 isoforms into two groups, and use one antibody for each group.
