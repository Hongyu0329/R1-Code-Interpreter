    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan to address your question.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Explain the Concept**: I will first explain the physical meaning of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, in the context of the Feynman path integral formalism. It describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle from one state to another.\n2.  **Identify the Functional Form**: The most direct way to see the dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is by looking at its form in the frequency-momentum domain $(\\omega, k)$.\n3.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to display the mathematical formula for the time-ordered bare Green's function. The script will also print a definition for each term in the equation to ensure clarity. This fulfills the requirement to output each component of the final equation.\n\nThis approach will provide you with the exact functional dependence you asked for, presented in a clear, educational format using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef display_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Displays the functional form of the bare Green's function G_0\n    and its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the time-ordered bare (non-interacting) Green's function, G_0(k, omega), has the following functional form:\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"         1\")\n    print(\"G_0 = ----------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"      (omega - (epsilon_k - mu)) + i*eta*sgn(epsilon_k - mu)\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"This shows that G_0 is inversely proportional to the frequency (omega) shifted by the single-particle energy (epsilon_k).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Components of the Equation ---\")\n\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    # Since the general form has no numbers, we will output each symbolic component.\n    print(f\"G_0: The bare Green's function, which is a function of momentum k and frequency omega.\")\n    print(f\"omega: The frequency of the particle/excitation.\")\n    print(f\"epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for momentum k.\")\n    print(f\"mu: The chemical potential, which sets the zero point for energy.\")\n    print(f\"i: The imaginary unit.\")\n    print(f\"eta: A small positive infinitesimal (eta -> 0+) that ensures causality by shifting the poles of the function off the real axis.\")\n    print(f\"sgn(x): The signum function, which is +1 for x > 0 and -1 for x < 0. It determines how the poles are shifted for particles vs. holes.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_greens_function()\n```\n<<<G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - (ε_k - μ) + iη*sgn(ε_k - μ))>>>"
