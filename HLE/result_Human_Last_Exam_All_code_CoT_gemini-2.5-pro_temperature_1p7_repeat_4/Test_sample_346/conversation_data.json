    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: First, we'll parse the complex SKI expression into a more understandable structure. The expression is a function application.\n2.  **Identify Church Numerals**: We will identify the parts of the expression that correspond to Church numerals (like 1, 2, 3) and standard operations like the successor function (`SUCC`).\n3.  **Translate to Arithmetic**: The core of SKI logic and Church numerals is function application. We'll translate the applications between Church numerals into their corresponding arithmetic operations, which are primarily exponentiation.\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation**: We will build the calculation from the innermost parts of the expression outwards, tracking the resulting numbers.\n5.  **Use Logarithms for Simplicity**: Since the numbers involved become very large, we can simplify the calculation by using logarithms. The final number `n` is a power of 2, so `log_2(n)` will be a clean integer.\n6.  **Code the Calculation**: Finally, we will write a Python script that performs this step-by-step calculation and prints the result, showing how the final number `n` is constructed through repeated exponentiation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1.  **Expression Reduction**: The main expression is of the form `S(I)(A)(B)`. The reduction rule for `S` is `Sxyz -> xz(yz)`. With `x=I`, this becomes `S(I)AB -> IB(AB) -> B(AB)`. This is function application: `B` is applied to the result of `A` applied to `B`.\n\n2.  **Identifying `B`**: `B` is the subexpression `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` is a known combinator for Church numeral **2**.\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor combinator, `SUCC`, which adds one to a Church numeral.\n    *   Therefore, `B` is `SUCC(2)`, which is Church numeral **3**.\n\n3.  **Identifying `A`**: `A` is the subexpression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))`.\n    *   The innermost part is `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`, which is `SUCC(I)`. Assuming `I` represents Church **1**, this evaluates to Church **2**.\n    *   `K(2)` creates a constant function that returns `2`.\n    *   The structure of `A` is `L_3(2)`, where `L_k(m) = S(I)(...S(I)(K(m))...)` (with `k` repetitions of `S(I)`).\n\n4.  **Church Numeral Arithmetic**: Applying one Church numeral `m` to another `k` (`m(k)`) corresponds to exponentiation: `k^m`.\n\n5.  **Putting it Together**:\n    *   The final number `n` is represented by `B(A(B))`. Let's use `c=3` for `B`, `m=2` for the value inside `A`.\n    *   `n = c(A(c)) = 3 ( A(3) )`.\n    *   First, we find the number for `A(3)`: `A(3) = L_3(2)(3)`. The operation `L_k(m)(n)` evaluates to `n(n(...n(m)...))` (with `k` applications of `n`), which in arithmetic is `(...((m^n)^n)...)^n`.\n    *   So, `num(A(3)) = num(3(3(3(2)))) = ((2^3)^3)^3 = (8^3)^3 = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^{27}`.\n    *   Now, we calculate `n`. The number for `n` is `num(A(3))^num(3)`.\n    *   `n = (2^{27})^3 = 2^{81}`.\n\n6.  **Final Answer**: The question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n    *   `log_2(2^{81}) = 81`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates log_2(n) for the given SKI combinator expression.\n# The expression reduces to a series of exponentiations between Church numerals.\n\n# 1.
