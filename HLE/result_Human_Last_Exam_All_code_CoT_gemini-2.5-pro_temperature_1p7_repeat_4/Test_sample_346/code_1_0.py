# This script calculates log_2(n) for the given SKI combinator expression.
# The expression reduces to a series of exponentiations between Church numerals.

# 1. Parsing the expression
# The expression S(I)(A)(B) reduces to B(A(B)).
# B corresponds to Church numeral 3.
# A is a more complex function.
# Let c be the number for B, so c = 3.
# Let m be the number inside A, which is SUCC(I) = 2.
# A can be written as L_3(m), where L_k(m) applies a function k times.
# The number n is c(A(c)), which corresponds to num(A(c))^c.
# The number for A(c) is L_3(m)(c) which is c(c(c(m))).
# In arithmetic, this is (((m^c)^c)^c).

c = 3
m = 2

# We use logarithms to handle the large numbers.
# We want to find log2(n).
# n = ((((m^c)^c)^c)^c)
# log2(n) = c * log2((((m^c)^c)^c))
# log2(n) = c * c * log2(((m^c)^c))
# log2(n) = c * c * c * log2((m^c))
# log2(n) = c * c * c * c * log2(m)
# log2(n) = c^4 * log2(m)

# Let's calculate this step-by-step and print the equation.

# num_A_c corresponds to the number for A(c) = L_3(2)(3)
# It's calculated as (((2^3)^3)^3)
step1 = m ** c
print(f"The innermost number is {m}^{c} = {step1}")

step2 = step1 ** c
print(f"The next level is {step1}^{c} = {step2}")

num_A_c = step2 ** c
# Python can handle large integers, so we can display it.
print(f"The number for the term A(c) is {step2}^{c} = {num_A_c}")

# The final number n is (num_A_c)^c
# n = num_A_c ** c

# Using logarithms for the final calculation to get log2(n)
# log2(m)
log2_m = math.log2(m)

# log2(num(c(m))) = c * log2(m)
log2_step1 = c * log2_m

# log2(num(c(c(m)))) = c * log2(num(c(m)))
log2_step2 = c * log2_step1

# log2(num(c(c(c(m))))) = log2(num_A_c)
log2_A_c = c * log2_step2

# log2(n) = log2(num(c(A(c)))) = c * log2(num_A_c)
log2_n = c * log2_A_c
