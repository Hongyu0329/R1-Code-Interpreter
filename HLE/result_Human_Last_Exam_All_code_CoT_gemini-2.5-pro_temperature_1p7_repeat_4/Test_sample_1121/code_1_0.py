# This script calculates the approximate number of non-Clifford gates required for two tasks
# in topological quantum computing, based on a standard interpretation of the problem.
#

# --- Part 1: Gates for Simulation ---
# The first task is to run a simulation of a universal quantum computer on a d=3 surface code.
# A simulation runs on a classical computer and does not consume any quantum gates.
gates_for_simulation = 0

# --- Part 2: Gates for Implementation ---
# The second task is to implement a universal quantum computer on a d=5 surface code.
# This is interpreted as the cost to create one logical non-Clifford T-gate, the building block
# for universality, using a standard magic state distillation protocol.
# We will model the cost of the common 15-to-1 T-state distillation protocol.

# The protocol requires 15 noisy input T-states.
input_states_for_distillation = 15

# The verification circuit for this protocol can be constructed from 8 Toffoli gates.
num_toffoli_gates_in_circuit = 8

# Each Toffoli gate can be decomposed into approximately 7 non-Clifford T-gates.
t_gates_per_toffoli = 7

# Calculate the T-gate cost for the distillation circuit.
gates_for_distillation_circuit = num_toffoli_gates_in_circuit * t_gates_per_toffoli

# The total gate count for implementation is the sum of gates for preparing input states and for the circuit.
gates_for_implementation = input_states_for_distillation + gates_for_distillation_circuit

# --- Final Calculation ---
# The total number of gates is the sum of the gates from both tasks.
total_non_clifford_gates = gates_for_simulation + gates_for_implementation
