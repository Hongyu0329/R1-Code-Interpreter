    "The task is to find the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I need to identify which of the possible crystallographic point groups in two dimensions have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The possible point groups are C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, D1, D2, D3, D4, D6.\n    *   **C2** (two-fold rotation) has two operations (identity, 180Â° rotation), so its order is 2.\n    *   **D1** (reflection, also denoted Cs or C1h) has two operations (identity, one reflection), so its order is 2.\n2.  Next, I will list all 17 wallpaper groups and identify which of them correspond to the point groups C2 and D1.\n3.  I will create a Python script to automate this counting process. The script will use a dictionary to store the data for all 17 wallpaper groups, mapping each group to its point group and the order of that point group.\n4.  The script will then iterate through this data to find all groups where the point group order is 2.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the names of these groups, grouped by their point group type (C2 and D1), and display the final calculation by summing the counts for each type, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data mapping the 17 wallpaper groups to their associated point group and the order of that point group.\n    # The point groups for 2D crystallography are Cn and Dn.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1':   {'point_group': 'C1', 'order': 1},\n        'p2':   {'point_group': 'C2', 'order': 2},\n        'pm':   {'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        'pg':   {'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        'cm':   {'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        'pmm':  {'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        'pmg':  {'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        'pgg':  {'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        'cmm':  {'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        'p4':   {'point_group': 'C4', 'order': 4},\n        'p4m':  {'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        'p4g':  {'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        'p3':   {'point_group': 'C3', 'order': 3},\n        'p3m1': {'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        'p31m': {'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        'p6':   {'point_group': 'C6', 'order': 6},\n        'p6m':  {'point_group': 'D6', 'order': 12}\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n\n    # Find the point groups that have the target order\n    point_groups_with_target_order = {\n        data['point_group'] for data in wallpaper_group_data.values() if data['order'] == target_order\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The point groups of order {target_order} are: {', '.join(sorted(list(point_groups_with_target_order)))}\\n\")\n\n    # Group wallpaper groups by their point group for detailed output\n    groups_by_pg = {}\n    for name, data in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if data['order'] == target_order:\n            pg = data['point_group']\n            if pg not in groups_by_pg:\n                groups_by_pg[pg] = []\n            groups_by_pg[pg].append(name)\n            \n    # Print the breakdown and prepare for the final equation\n    counts = []\n    print(\"Finding the number of groups for each point group type:\")\n    for pg in sorted(groups_by_pg.keys()):\n        count = len(groups_by_pg[pg])\n        counts.append(count)\n        group_list = \", \".join(groups_by_pg[pg])\n        print(f\"- Point group {pg} has {count} wallpaper group(s): {group_list}\")\n\n    # Calculate and print the final equation\n    total_count = sum(counts)\n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in counts]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
