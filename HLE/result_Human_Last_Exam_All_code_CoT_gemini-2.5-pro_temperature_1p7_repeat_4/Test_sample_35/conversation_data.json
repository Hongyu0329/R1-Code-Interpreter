    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poker situation.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Scenario**\n*   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1). This is an early position at a poker table. Actions taken from here must be stronger because there are many players left to act behind you.\n*   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (bb). This is considered a \"shove/fold\" stack. It's generally too small to raise and then fold, so your primary moves are to go all-in or fold.\n*   **Game State:** Near the money bubble. This is the most critical factor. Players with medium and short stacks will play extremely cautiously (tighten up) to avoid being eliminated just before the prize money starts. This \"bubble pressure\" means they will fold many hands they would normally call a shove with. We can exploit this by shoving a wider range of hands than usual, increasing our chances of stealing the blinds and antes without a fight.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Hand Options**\nWe'll analyze each hand in the context of our 16bb stack from UTG+1, considering the bubble's effect. A standard shoving range from this position without bubble pressure is already quite strong (e.g., 77+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+). The bubble allows us to profitably add more hands to this range.\n\n*   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand. It is always a profitable shove with 16bb from any position, regardless of the bubble.\n*   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** This is a strong pair. It is well ahead of the average calling range and is a standard, profitable shove with 16bb from early position.\n*   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** This is a strong ace. It is also a standard shove in this situation. It blocks opponent's aces and has good high-card strength.\n*   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This is the most borderline hand of the group. In a non-bubble scenario, shoving QJs from UTG+1 with 16bb would be considered a marginal or losing play by many. However, the extreme pressure of the money bubble forces opponents to fold so often that shoving QJs becomes profitable. They will not risk their tournament life by calling with hands like ATo, KJo, or small-to-medium pairs.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nHands like AKo, 99, and AJo are standard shoves in this spot even without a bubble. The question, by including the \"money bubble\" detail, is specifically testing your understanding of how that pressure changes your strategy. QJs is the hand that transitions from a likely fold in a normal game to a profitable shove on the bubble. It best demonstrates the knowledge of exploiting bubble dynamics. Therefore, while multiple options are technically correct shoves, QJs is the most nuanced and insightful answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poker_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the correct shoving range.\n    \"\"\"\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    print(f\"Scenario Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"  - Position: {position} (Early position, requires a strong range)\")\n    print(f\"  - Stack: {stack_bb}bb (Shove or fold stack size)\")\n    print(f\"  - Key Factor: {situation} (Opponents will fold more often due to ICM pressure)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    hands = {\n        \"E\": {\"hand\": \"AKo\", \"comment\": \"Premium hand.
