    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number `j` results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   Therefore, the possible values for `j` are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take `2j + 1` values, ranging from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by `j(j+1)` (in units of $\\hbar^2=1$).\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by `m_j` (in units of $\\hbar=1$).\n5.  **Implement in Python**: A script will be created to iterate through each possible `j` value and, for each `j`, iterate through all possible `m_j` values. Inside the loops, it will calculate and print the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the results for each common eigenstate.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible values for j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # j ranges from j_min to j_max in steps of 1\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)\n\n    # Loop through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Step 3: For each j, determine the possible m_j values\n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in steps of 1\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n\n        print(f\"--- For states with total angular momentum j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Step 4: Calculate the J^2 eigenvalue (it's the same for all m_j with the same j)\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Loop through each m_j for the current j\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is just m_j\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            \n            # Print the final eigenvalue equations for the state |j, m_j>\n            print(f\"For the state |j={j}, m_j={mj}>:\")\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J^2 = j(j+1) = {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j2_eigenvalue}\")\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J_z = m_j = {jz_eigenvalue}\\n\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n\n```\n<<<\"The final common eigenvalues are calculated and displayed in the script's output.\" >>>"
