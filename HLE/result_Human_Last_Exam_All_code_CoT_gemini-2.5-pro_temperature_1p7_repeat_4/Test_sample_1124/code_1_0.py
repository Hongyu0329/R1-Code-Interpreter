R = 3.57

# The proposed modified logistic map is: X_n+1 = R * X_n * exp(-X_n)
# This map replaces the (1-X) term of the standard logistic map with an exponential decay term.
# Its equilibrium point X_eq is found by solving X_eq = R * X_eq * exp(-X_eq),
# which yields X_eq = ln(R).
# This point is stable for R=3.57, so the system will settle ("get") there.

# Calculate the equilibrium point
X_eq = math.log(R)
# Calculate the right hand side of the equation for verification
RHS = R * X_eq * math.exp(-X_eq)
