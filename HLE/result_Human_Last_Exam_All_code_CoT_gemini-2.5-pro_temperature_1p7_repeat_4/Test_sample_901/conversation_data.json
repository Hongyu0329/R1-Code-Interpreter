    "This problem involves an E2 elimination reaction. I will analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material and the requirements of the E2 mechanism to determine the structure of the resulting alkene.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base. This indicates an E2 elimination reaction.\n2.  **Recall E2 Stereochemistry:** For an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and the beta-proton (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in a *trans-diaxial* orientation. This means both must be in axial positions.\n3.  **Analyze Chair Conformations:**\n    *   Draw the most stable chair conformation of the starting material. Typically, bulky groups like methyl and bromo prefer equatorial positions. In the case of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the most stable conformer has both the bromo group and the methyl group in equatorial positions.\n    *   In this stable conformation, the bromo group is equatorial, so it cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n4.  **Consider the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the molecule must adopt its less stable conformation through a ring flip. In this new conformation, the bromo group becomes axial, and the methyl group also becomes axial.\n    *   This is the *reactive* conformation because the leaving group is in the required axial position.\n5.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   With the bromine atom axial on Carbon-1 (C1), we examine the beta-protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is axial, which means the proton on C2 is equatorial. An axial Br and an equatorial H cannot be eliminated. Thus, the more substituted (Zaitsev) product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has an axial proton that is perfectly positioned *trans-diaxial* to the axial bromine.\n    *   The strong base will remove the axial proton from C6, and the bromine will leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is the less substituted (Hofmann) product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe python code below will print out the reasoning and the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the final product name based on chemical principles.\n    # The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial orientation.\n    # The starting material must flip to its less stable conformer where Br is axial.\n    # In this conformer, the H at C2 is equatorial, but the H at C6 is axial.\n    # Elimination can only occur between C1 and C6.\n    # The double bond is between C1 and C6, and the methyl group is on C2,\n    # which is at position 3 relative to the double bond.\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    product_number = 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The reaction is identified as an E2 elimination due to the strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide).\")\n    print(\"Step 2: E2 reactions on cyclohexane rings require a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: The reactant molecule must adopt its less stable conformation where the Br group is axial to react.\")\n    print(\"Step 4: In this reactive conformation, the only beta-proton that is trans-diaxial to the bromine is on Carbon-6.\")\n    print(\"Step 5: Therefore, elimination forms a double bond between Carbon-1 and Carbon-6.\")\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"The final product is named based on the position of the methyl group relative to the new double bond.\")\n    print(f\"The number in the product name is: {product_number}\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n\n\nsolve_reaction()\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>\n```"
