    This function determines the partition for Chapter 39 of The Tale of Genji.

    The Genji-mon (incense pattern) for Chapter 39 ("Yugiri") has the
    following connections for the five sticks, numbered 1 to 5 from right to left:
    - Stick 1 is connected to Stick 2.
    - Stick 3 is by itself.
    - Stick 4 is connected to Stick 5.
    
    This corresponds to the partition {{1, 2}, {3}, {4, 5}}.
    The code will format this partition as a string for the final output.
