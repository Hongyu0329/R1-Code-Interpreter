    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number `m` of white and black queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board such that no white queen attacks a black queen.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the non-attacking condition:** For a white queen at `(rw, cw)` and a black queen at `(rb, cb)` to not attack each other, three conditions must be met:\n    *   `rw != rb` (different rows)\n    *   `cw != cb` (different columns)\n    *   `|rw - rb| != |cw - cb|` (different diagonals)\n\n2.  **Devise a strategy:** A powerful strategy to satisfy these conditions is to partition the board and separate the queens by the color of the squares they occupy.\n    *   **Diagonal attacks:** A queen on a white square can only attack other queens on white squares along diagonals. Similarly, a queen on a black square can only attack other queens on black squares along diagonals. Therefore, if we place all white queens on white squares and all black queens on black squares, there can be no diagonal attacks between them.\n    *   **Row/Column attacks:** To prevent row and column attacks, we can partition the board's rows and columns. We can assign a set of rows and columns exclusively for white queens and a disjoint set of rows and columns for black queens. For simplicity and to maximize the available space, we can split the board into two rectangular subgrids.\n\n3.  **Formulate the optimization problem:**\n    *   Let's say we assign the top-left `k x j` subgrid for white queens and the bottom-right `(16-k) x (16-j)` subgrid for black queens.\n    *   The number of white queens (`m`) is limited by the number of white squares in the `k x j` subgrid.\n    *   The number of black queens (`m`) is limited by the number of black squares in the `(16-k) x (16-j)` subgrid.\n    *   We want to find the values of `k` and `j` (from 1 to 15) that maximize `m = min(available_white_squares, available_black_squares)`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to iterate through all possible `k` and `j` partitions, calculate the maximum possible `m` for each, and identify the overall maximum. The script will then print the calculation for the optimal partition.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m of white and black queens that can coexist\n    on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 16\n    max_m = 0\n    best_k = 0\n    best_j = 0\n\n    # Iterate through all possible row (k) and column (j) partitions\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            # White queens are in the top-left k x j subgrid.\n            # The square (0,0) is white.
