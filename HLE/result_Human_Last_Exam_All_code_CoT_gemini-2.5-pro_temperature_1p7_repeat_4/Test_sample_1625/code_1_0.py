    This function identifies the correct spectral series expansion technique.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Toroidal systems have two angular coordinates: poloidal (θ) and toroidal (φ).
    2. A common and powerful method for representing functions on this toroidal surface is to use a Fourier series for the toroidal angle (φ) due to its simple periodic nature.
    3. For the poloidal angle (θ), an expansion in Legendre polynomials is often employed.
    4. This specific combination, which is well-adapted to the physics of toroidal systems, is known as a Fourier-Legendre series.
