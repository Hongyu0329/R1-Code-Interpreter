# Step 1: Define the number of geometric isomers for a [M(AA)2(BB)] octahedral complex.
# For a tris-chelate complex where all ligands are bidentate, there is only one
# possible geometric arrangement of the three ligands around the central atom.
num_geometric_isomers = 1

# Step 2: Determine if the geometric isomer is chiral.
# The complex [Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+ belongs to the C2 point group, which is chiral.
# Chiral molecules exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
# Therefore, for each geometric isomer, there are 2 possible optical isomers (stereoisomers).
num_enantiomers_per_isomer = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of isomers.
# Total isomers = (number of geometric isomers) * (number of enantiomers per isomer)
total_isomers = num_geometric_isomers * num_enantiomers_per_isomer

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer, showing the numbers in the calculation.
