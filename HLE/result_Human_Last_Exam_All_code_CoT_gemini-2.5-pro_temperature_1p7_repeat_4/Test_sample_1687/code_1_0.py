    1. The patient underwent a difficult colonoscopy. This procedure can cause traction on the splenocolic ligament, which connects the spleen to the colon.
    2. The patient's symptoms include Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) pain, which is the anatomical location of the spleen.
    3. The presence of left-shoulder pain is known as Kehr's sign. This is referred pain caused by blood irritating the diaphragm, a classic sign of splenic injury.
    4. The rapid development of hypotension, tachycardia, and a severe drop in hemoglobin (from 11.7 to 6.5 g/dL) points to a massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage, consistent with a rupture of a highly vascular organ like the spleen.
    5. Other options are less likely:
       - Colonic perforation typically causes peritonitis but not usually such a massive, rapid hemorrhage.
       - Lower GI bleeding would present with blood per rectum (hematochezia), not the signs of intra-abdominal bleeding seen here.
       - Postpolypectomy syndrome is ruled out as no polypectomy was performed.
    6. Conclusion: The combination of the mechanism (difficult colonoscopy), location of pain (LUQ), referred pain (Kehr's sign), and profound hemorrhagic shock makes splenic laceration the most likely diagnosis.
