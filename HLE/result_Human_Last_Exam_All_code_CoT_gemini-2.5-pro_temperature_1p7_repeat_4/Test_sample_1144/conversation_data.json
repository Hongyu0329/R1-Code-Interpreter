    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\nFirst, I will establish the necessary physical principles and formulas.\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) has a lower limit: Δp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx). We will use the minimum uncertainty for this calculation, so Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Momentum in the first Bohr orbit**: According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum in the first orbit (n=1) is given by L = p * r₁ = ħ. Therefore, the electron's momentum is p = ħ / r₁, where r₁ is the Bohr radius.\n\nNext, I will derive the formula for the desired ratio.\n*   The ratio is Δp / p.\n*   By substituting the expressions from above: Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁).\n*   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, which simplifies the formula to: Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx).\n\nFinally, the Python code will:\n1.  Define the values for the Bohr radius (r₁) and the given uncertainty in position (Δx = 10 pm).\n2.  Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n3.  Print the formula, the specific values used in the equation, and the final computed result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum\n# to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n# 1.
