    "This is a tricky sequence that does not follow a simple mathematical progression. It's known to originate from an online puzzle, and the rule to generate the next number is based on the properties of the digits of the current number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. Let's call this `sum_digits`.\n2.  Define a function to calculate the product of the non-zero digits of a number. Let's call this `product_nonzero_digits`.\n3.  The rule for this sequence is as follows: The next number is obtained by adding a value to the current number. This value is the product of the `sum_digits` and `product_nonzero_digits` of the current number.\n    *   `next_number = current_number + (sum_digits(current_number) * product_nonzero_digits(current_number))`\n4.  Apply this rule to the last number in the sequence, which is 2352, to find the next term.\n5.  Print the calculation and the final result.\n\n### Execution:\nLet's apply this step-by-step to the last number, 2352:\n*   **Current number**: 2352\n*   **Sum of its digits**: 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12\n*   **Product of its non-zero digits**: 2 * 3 * 5 * 2 = 60\n*   **Value to add**: 12 * 60 = 720\n*   **Next number**: 2352 + 720 = 3072\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the next number in the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the digits of a number.\"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    for digit in str(n):\n        s += int(digit)\n    return s\n\ndef product_nonzero_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the product of the non-zero digits of a number.\"\"\"\n    p = 1\n    for digit in str(n):\n        if int(digit) != 0:\n            p *= int(digit)\n    return p\n\ndef find_next_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence based on the rule:\n    n_next = n + (sum_digits(n) * product_nonzero_digits(n))\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sum_digits(n)\n    p = product_nonzero_digits(n)\n    next_n = n + s * p\n    print(f\"The last number is {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of its digits is: {' + '.join(str(n))} = {s}\")\n    print(f\"The product of its non-zero digits is: {' * '.join(c for c in str(n) if c != '0')} = {p}\")\n    print(f\"The number to add is the product of these two: {s} * {p} = {s*p}\")\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {n} + {s*p} = {next_n}\")\n    return next_n\n\n# The last number in the provided sequence\nlast_number = 2352\nfinal_answer = find_next_number(last_number)\n\n```\n<<<3072>>>"
