    "Based on my knowledge, the premise of your question appears to be incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has not publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different prominent Nigerian figure and the first President of Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, there is no year in which this event occurred. I will provide a Python script to print a clarification.\n\n```python\ndef clarify_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Clarifies the name of the former Nigerian president and the lack of an event.\n  \"\"\"\n  name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  other_person = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n  print(f\"The full name of the former Nigerian president is {name}.\")\n  print(f\"He is a different person from {other_person}, Nigeria's first president.\")\n  print(\"There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as 'Azikiwe'.\")\n  print(\"Therefore, no year can be provided for this event.\")\n\nclarify_name()\n```\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"
