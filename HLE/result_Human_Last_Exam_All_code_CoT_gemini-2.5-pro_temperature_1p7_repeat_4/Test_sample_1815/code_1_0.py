# The problem is a theoretical one from the field of topological algebra.
# My reasoning, as detailed above, leads to the conclusion that the two properties
# "totally bounded" and "no nontrivial convergent sequences" are contradictory
# for a group topology on the infinite group of integers.
#
# Let's break down the logic:
# 1. A topological space has "no nontrivial convergent sequences" if, for any point,
#    it is not a limit point of a sequence of distinct points. In a first-countable space,
#    this means every point must be isolated. Thus, the topology must be discrete.
# 2. A group topology on the integers is first-countable (and metrizable) if its
#    character group is countable, a natural class to consider.
# 3. Assuming the topology must be discrete, let's test the "totally bounded" condition.
# 4. In a discrete topology on the integers Z, U = {0} is an open neighborhood of the identity 0.
# 5. The definition of "totally bounded" states that there must exist a finite set of
#    elements {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n} from Z such that the union of their translates,
#    g_1 + U, g_2 + U, ..., g_n + U, covers all of Z.
# 6. The translates g_i + U are just the singletons {g_i}.
# 7. Their union is the finite set {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}.
# 8. This finite set cannot cover the infinite set of integers Z.
# 9. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such topology exists.
#
# The number of such topologies is 0.
final_answer = 0
# I will print the final answer as an equation to adhere to the requested format.
# Although there's no complex equation, this fulfills the prompt requirement to
# "output each number in the final equation!".
