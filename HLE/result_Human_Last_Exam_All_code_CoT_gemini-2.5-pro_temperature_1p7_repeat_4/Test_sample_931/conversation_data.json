    "This is a biology question that can be answered by codifying known entomological facts. My plan is to:\n1.  Establish the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) based on scientific knowledge. They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids but are also known to supplement their diet with pollen and nectar.\n2.  Represent the user's multiple-choice options in the code.\n3.  Write a Python script to systematically evaluate each option against the known facts.\n4.  The script will analyze single food items first, identifying plausible ones (like Nectar and Aphids) and discarding implausible ones (like leaf tissue or fungus).\n5.  It will then evaluate the combined options (F and G) to find the one that includes all plausible items.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the analysis and the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) to determine the correct answer choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts for adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # They are primarily predators but also supplement with nectar/pollen.\n    primary_diet = \"predatory (e.g., aphids, mites, small insect larvae)\"\n    supplemental_diet = \"nectar and pollen\"\n    not_eaten = [\"fungus\", \"leaf tissue (herbivory)\"]\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices provided.\n    options = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the plausibility of each individual food item.\n    print(\"Analyzing food options for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    # Analysis for A: Nectar\n    analysis_A = \"nectar\" in supplemental_diet.lower()\n    print(\"Analysis for A (Nectar):\")\n    if analysis_A:\n        print(\" -> Plausible.
