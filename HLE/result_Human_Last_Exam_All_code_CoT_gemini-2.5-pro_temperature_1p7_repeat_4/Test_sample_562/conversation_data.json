    "To find the radical for the character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji**: I will analyze the character 謄 to identify its components. The character is composed of a left part and a right part.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: The radical (or *bushu*) is the key component used for dictionary lookups. In 謄, the radical is the left-side component, which is 言.\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name**: Radicals have specific names, which often change depending on their position within a character. The radical 言, when used as the left-side component (*hen*), is called ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Romanize the Name**: I will transcribe ごんべん into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Code Implementation**: To fulfill the request, I will create a Python script that uses a dictionary to store and retrieve the radical's name for the given character, and then prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical_name(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Hepburn-romanized name of the radical for a given Kanji character.\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary to simulate a radical database lookup.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_radical_db = {\n        '謄': 'Gonben', # Radical is 言 (gon) on the left (hen)\n        '媛': 'Onnahen', # Radical is 女 (onna) on the left (hen)\n        '語': 'Gonben', # Radical is 言 (gon) on the left (hen)\n        '海': 'Sanzui', # Radical is 氵 (sanzui)\n        '森': 'Ki'       # Radical is 木 (ki)\n    }\n\n    if character in kanji_radical_db:\n        radical_name = kanji_radical_db[character]\n        print(f\"The radical for the character '{character}' is called '{radical_name}' in Hepburn transcription.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the radical for '{character}' is not in our database.\")\n\n# The character from the user's request\ntarget_kanji = '謄'\n\nfind_kanji_radical_name(target_kanji)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
