    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the official Terraria wiki, which is based on the game's source code, this value is 3,640.\n\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, we need the formula for how boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode. The health increases by 35% for each player in the world after the first one. This can be expressed in a formula:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + (Number of Players - 1) * 0.35)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The formula is a linear function of the number of players (`N`). As `N` approaches infinity, the `Total Health` also approaches infinity.\n    `Health = 3640 * (1 + (N-1) * 0.35) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n    Mathematically, the limit is infinity.\n\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** However, the question specifies \"according to the source code\". In software, numbers are not infinite. They are stored in variables with specific data types that have a maximum value. In Terraria's C# source code, an NPC's health (`lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Value:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`, which is `2,147,483,647`. The game engine cannot assign a health value higher than this. Therefore, this value is the *theoretical maximum health* within the game's technical constraints.\n\nThe following Python code will formalize this logic and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode\n    based on game mechanics and technical limitations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    per_player_health_increase_factor = 0.35\n\n    # Step 2: Define the health calculation formula.\n    # H(N) = base_health * (1 + (N - 1) * per_player_health_increase_factor)\n    # where H is Total Health and N is the number of players.\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the formula to show its linear nature.\n    # H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35)\n    # H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N)\n    constant_part = int(base_health * (1 - per_player_health_increase_factor))\n    per_player_part = int(base_health * per_player_health_increase_factor)\n\n    print(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health (H) in Expert Mode with N players is:\")\n    print(f\"H = {base_health} * (1 + (N - 1) * {per_player_health_increase_factor})\")\n    print(\"\\nThis simplifies to the linear equation:\")\n    print(f\"H = {constant_part} + {per_player_part} * N\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the implication of \"infinite players\".\n    print(\"\\nAs the number of players (N) approaches infinity, the health (H) calculated by this formula also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria, like most software, has technical limits.\")\n\n    # Step 5: State the technical limitation based on the game's source code.\n    print(\"An NPC's health is stored in a 32-bit signed integer, which has a hard-coded maximum value.\")\n\n    max_int_32 = 2_147_483_647\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the absolute theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is limited by this data type.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is that the maximum health is capped at the integer limit.\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Maximum Health = {max_int_32}\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n<<<2147483647>>>"
