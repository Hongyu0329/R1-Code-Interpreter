    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, we need to count all unique paths of length 10 that start at the origin and never visit the same point twice. A direct calculation by hand is very complex, so I will use a computational algorithm.\n\nMy plan is to use a recursive backtracking algorithm, which is a form of Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore all possible paths.\n\nHere is the step-by-step logic of the algorithm:\n1.  The walk begins at a starting point, which we can define as the origin (0, 0) on a 2D grid.\n2.  From the current point, the algorithm attempts to move one step in each of the four possible directions on the lattice (up, down, left, right).\n3.  A move is only valid if the destination point has not already been visited in the current path. This enforces the \"self-avoiding\" rule.\n4.  If a move is valid, the algorithm updates the path with the new point and calls itself recursively to continue building the path from this new position.\n5.  The recursion stops when a path reaches the target length of 10 steps. When this happens, it signifies one complete self-avoiding walk, which is added to a total counter.\n6.  After a recursive call returns, the algorithm \"backtracks\" by removing the last move. This allows it to explore other directions from the previous point, ensuring all possible paths are counted.\n7.  The final count, after all possibilities have been explored, will be the value of a(10).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks\n    on a Manhattan (square) lattice using a recursive approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The target number of steps for the walk.\n    n = 10\n\n    # This recursive function counts all valid walks starting from the given path.\n    # 'path' is the list of (x, y) coordinates making up the current walk.\n    # 'visited' is a set of the same coordinates for fast O(1) lookup to check for self-intersections.\n    def count_walks_recursive(path, visited):\n        # The base case: if the path has n steps (i.e., n+1 points), we have found one valid walk.\n        if len(path) - 1 == n:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Get the last point in the path to start the next step from.\n        x, y = path[-1]\n\n        # Define the four possible moves: up, down, right, left.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_point = (x + dx, y + dy)\n\n            # Check the \"self-avoiding\" constraint.\n            if next_point not in visited:\n                # If the point is new, take the step.\n                path.append(next_point)\n                visited.add(next_point)\n\n                # Recursively count the walks from this new state.\n                count += count_walks_recursive(path, visited)\n\n                # Backtrack: undo the move so we can explore other directions from the previous point.\n                path.pop()\n                visited.remove(next_point)\n\n        return count\n\n    # All walks start at the origin (0, 0).\n    initial_path = [(0, 0)]\n    initial_visited = {(0, 0)}\n\n    # Start the recursive counting process.\n    result = count_walks_recursive(initial_path, initial_visited)\n\n    # Per the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we print the equation `a(n) = result`.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
