    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must handle a number (`10^100`) that is far too large for standard floating-point arithmetic. My plan to solve this involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Leverage Periodicity:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π (pi). This key property means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. Therefore, we don't need to work with the enormous number `10^100` directly, but rather with its remainder after division by π.\n2.  **Use High-Precision Arithmetic:** Calculating `10^100 mod π` accurately requires π to be known to a high degree of precision. The number `10^100` has 101 digits, so our value of π must be precise to more than 101 decimal places. We will use the `mpmath` library in Python, which is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that uses the `mpmath` library to:\n    *   Set the required precision (e.g., 110 decimal places).\n    *   Calculate `r = 10^100 mod π`.\n    *   Compute `tan(r)`.\n    *   Print the full calculation step-by-step as requested.\n    *   Extract and display the first three digits following the decimal point of the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# 1. Set the precision for the calculation.\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits. To accurately find its remainder when\n# divided by pi, our working precision must be greater than 101 digits.\n# We will use 110 decimal places, which provides a safe margin.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# 2. Define the large number for the calculation.\nx = mpmath.mpf(10)**100\n\n# 3. Calculate the remainder and the final tangent value.\n# The tangent function has a period of pi, so tan(x) = tan(x mod pi).\n# We calculate this remainder using mpmath's high-precision operators.\nrem = x % mpmath.pi\nresult = mpmath.tan(rem)\n\n# 4. Print the final equation with the computed numbers.\n# We format the high-precision numbers to a few decimal places for a clean display.\nrem_str = mpmath.nstr(rem, 8)\nresult_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 8)\nprint(\"The calculation follows this equation:\")\nprint(f\"tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod pi) = tan({rem_str}...) = {result_str}...\")\n\n# 5. Extract and print the first 3 digits after the decimal point.\n# To get the digits accurately, we convert the full-precision result to a string.\nfull_result_str = mpmath.nstr(result, mpmath.mp.dps)\n\n# Find the location of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = full_result_str.find('.')\n\n# Extract the three characters immediately after the decimal point.\ndigits_after_comma = full_result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {digits_after_comma}\")\n```\n<<<222>>>"
