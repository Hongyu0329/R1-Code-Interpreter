# The task is to identify the specific scene added to the ending of the 2010 restored version
# of "Kriemhild's Revenge" compared to earlier, shorter cuts like the 2007 DVD.

# Analysis of the provided information and film history reveals the following:
# 1. The plot point in option D (Etzel lifting his infant son) is incorrect. The son is killed earlier in the sequence.
# 2. The event in option C (Hildebrand striking Kriemhild) is the climax, not the added epilogue scene.
# 3. Information from the Le Monde article and other sources about the Murnau Foundation's restoration
#    confirms that a key re-inserted scene forms a new epilogue.
# 4. This scene specifically shows Hildebrand, the master-at-arms, bringing Kriemhild's crown to King Etzel.
# 5. Etzel then delivers a final lament over the carnage and the futility of his power before collapsing.

# Therefore, option A is the correct description of the added element.

correct_answer_choice = "A"
