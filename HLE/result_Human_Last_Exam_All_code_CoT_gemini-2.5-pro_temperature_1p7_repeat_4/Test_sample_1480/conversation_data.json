    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the membership grades of the rule's antecedents. A t-norm is a function that models fuzzy logical conjunction (AND). The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two given membership grades: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these values.\n3.  The result of `min(0.7, 0.9)` will be the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy set using a t-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given membership grades from the problem description\n    phi_k_x_prime = 0.7\n    mu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n    # A common t-norm is the minimum operator. The rule activation level is the\n    # t-norm of the antecedent membership grades.\n    activation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n    # Output the explanation and the equation as requested\n    print(\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm (e.g., minimum) to the antecedent membership grades.\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j})\")\n    print(f\"Result: {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_activation_level()\n<<<0.7>>>\n```"
