    "This is a trivia question about a specific film. The answer cannot be derived through computation, but I can provide a Python script that stores the name of the film in a variable and then prints the answer to the console, fulfilling the request to use code.\n\nThe film you're referring to is \"Sicario\" (2015). The character is the corrupt state trooper, Ted, played by Jon Bernthal. His polite \"Thank you\" to the bus driver is witnessed by Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), confirming Ted's involvement with the cartel and sealing his fate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the movie trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Oscar-nominated film is \"Sicario\".\n    film_title = \"Sicario\"\n\n    # The character is a corrupt police officer named Ted.\n    character_name = \"Ted\"\n\n    # The line that seals his fate.\n    line_spoken = \"Thank you\"\n\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is: {film_title}\")\n    print(f\"In this film, the character {character_name} seals his fate by saying '{line_spoken}' while boarding a bus.\")\n\nsolve_movie_trivia()\n```\n<<<Sicario>>>"
