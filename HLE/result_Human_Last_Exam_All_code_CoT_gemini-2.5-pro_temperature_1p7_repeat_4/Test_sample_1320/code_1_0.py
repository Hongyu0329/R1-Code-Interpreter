# Plan:
# 1. Define the building blocks of the foldamer: alpha-alanine and an epsilon-amino acid.
# 2. Define their respective backbone atom counts.
# 3. Calculate the size of the hydrogen-bonded ring for the most likely helical pattern (i -> i+3).
# 4. Use this calculation and known literature to identify the correct helix nomenclature.

# Step 1 & 2: Define monomer backbone sizes
# An alpha-amino acid (like alanine) has 3 atoms in its peptide backbone: N, C-alpha, and C' (carbonyl carbon).
# An epsilon-amino acid (like epsilon-aminocaproic acid, H2N-(CH2)5-COOH) has 7 atoms in its backbone: N, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C'.
monomer_backbone_atoms = {
    'alpha': 3,
    'epsilon': 7
}

# The foldamer has an alternating sequence, e.g., alpha-epsilon-alpha-epsilon...
sequence_type = ['alpha', 'epsilon']

# Step 3: Calculate ring size for the primary helical H-bond (i -> i+3)
# The helix is formed by hydrogen bonds between the C=O of residue 'i' and the N-H of residue 'i+3'.
# The intervening residues are 'i+1' and 'i+2'.
# In an alternating sequence, these two residues will always be one alpha and one epsilon.
intervening_residues = [monomer_backbone_atoms[sequence_type[0]], monomer_backbone_atoms[sequence_type[1]]]
sum_of_intervening_backbone_atoms = sum(intervening_residues)

# The total number of atoms in the hydrogen-bonded ring is the sum of backbone atoms
# from the intervening residues, plus the four atoms that form the "cap" of the ring:
# C'(i), O(i), H(i+3), and N(i+3).
# Ring Size = (atoms in residue i+1) + (atoms in residue i+2) + 4
atoms_in_cap = 4
primary_ring_size = sum_of_intervening_backbone_atoms + atoms_in_cap

# Step 4: Interpret the results and identify the helix type
