# A minimal surface M is conformally equivalent to C, with Gauss map g(z) = z/(z^3+2).
# We want to find the Morse index of M.

# We use the Jorge-Meeks formula for the Morse index of a complete minimal surface with finite total curvature:
# Index = 2*d - 2*gamma - k + 1

# 1. Determine the genus (gamma) and the number of ends (k).
# The surface is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C, which is the Riemann sphere punctured once.
# The underlying compact surface is the sphere, so its genus is 0.
gamma = 0
# There is one puncture, so the number of ends is 1.
k = 1

# 2. Determine the degree (d) of the Gauss map g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The degree of a rational function is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
deg_numerator = 1  # degree of z
deg_denominator = 3  # degree of z^3 + 2
d = max(deg_numerator, deg_denominator)

# 3. Calculate the Morse index using the formula.
index = 2 * d - 2 * gamma - k + 1

# 4. Print the explanation and the final result.
