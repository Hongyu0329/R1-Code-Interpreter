The patient's symptoms strongly suggest an underlying diagnosis of {underlying_disease}.
The rapid deterioration into end-stage kidney disease was likely caused by a {trigger_event}.
This event resulted in severe {complication}.

The lab parameter that best indicates the cause of this rapid renal decline is:
{lab_parameter}

A sharp increase in these antibody levels is a classic sign of an active lupus nephritis flare, as they are directly involved in the immune attack on the kidneys.
