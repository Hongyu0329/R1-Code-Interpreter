    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the song.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the musical request:** The user is asking for a song that opens with a specific chord progression. The progression is from the \"tonic\" chord to the \"minor fifth\" chord.\n2.  **Define the terms:**\n    *   The **Tonic (I)** is the \"home\" chord of a key. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic chord is G major.\n    *   The **Fifth (V)** is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In G major, the fifth note is D, and the V chord is normally D major.\n    *   A **Minor Fifth (vm)** is a non-standard chord where the fifth chord is made minor instead of major. In the key of G, this would be a D minor chord instead of D major. This creates a very distinct, often melancholic sound.\n3.  **Search for the pattern:** I will scan my knowledge base of The Beatles' music, specifically looking at the opening chords of their songs to find one that matches the `I -> vm` (Tonic Major to minor fifth) pattern.\n4.  **Identify the song:** The song \"Michelle\" is the most famous example of this. The song's introduction and first line (\"Michelle, ma belle\") are harmonized with an F major chord followed by a C minor chord.\n    *   **Tonic (I):** F major\n    *   **Minor Fifth (vm):** C is the fifth of F, and the C minor chord provides the requested progression.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a simple Python script that prints the name of the song and a brief explanation of the chord progression as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Beatles song based on a music theory question.\n\n    The question asks for a song starting with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n    - Tonic chord is the first chord of the key (Roman numeral: I).\n    - Minor fifth chord is the fifth chord of the key, but played as a minor (Roman numeral: vm).\n\n    The song \"Michelle\" opens with this exact progression.\n    The first line \"Michelle, ma belle\" is sung over these two chords:\n    1. F Major (The tonic, I)\n    2. C minor (The minor fifth, vm)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The specific progression in the opening is from {tonic_chord} (the tonic, or chord 1) to {minor_fifth_chord} (the minor fifth, or chord 5m).\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
