    "To calculate the integral of the given piecewise function from x=0 to x=4, we need to split the integral into two parts according to the function's definition.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nThe total integral $\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx$ can be calculated as the sum of two separate integrals:\n1.  The integral of the first function part from x=0 to x=3: $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx$\n2.  The integral of the second function part from x=3 to x=4: $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$\n\nI will use Python's `scipy` library, which provides a reliable function (`quad`) for numerical integration, to calculate the values of these two integrals and then sum them up.\n\nThe Python script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Import the necessary `quad` function from `scipy.integrate` and `numpy` for mathematical operations.\n2.  Define the two pieces of the function, `p1(x)` and `p2(x)`.\n3.  Calculate the definite integral of `p1(x)` over the interval [0, 3].\n4.  Calculate the definite integral of `p2(x)` over the interval [3, 4].\n5.  Sum the results to find the total integral from 0 to 4.\n6.  Print the final equation showing the individual integral values and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# The problem is to compute the integral of a piecewise function p(x) from x = 0 to x = 4.\n# We split the integral into two parts based on the function definition.\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p1(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = (2*x^3)/8 for 0 <= x <= 3\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p2(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin(x))) / (1 + cos(x)) for 3 <= x <= 5\n    \"\"\"\n    # The denominator 1 + cos(x) is not zero in the integration interval [3, 4].\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part: from 0 to 3\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part: from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the final result in the format of an equation\nprint(f\"The integral from 0 to 4 is calculated by summing the integrals over the two sub-intervals.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\nprint(f\"The result is approximately: {total_integral:.4f}\")\n<<< -397.464737936173 >>>"
