    "Of course. Here is the plan to compute the determinant of the given adjacency matrix:\n\n1.  First, I will represent the provided 3x3 matrix `A` using the Python library NumPy, which is ideal for numerical and matrix operations.\n2.  The determinant for a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a & b & c \\\\\n    d & e & f \\\\\n    g & h & i\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    is calculated using the formula: `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  I will write a Python script that substitutes the values from matrix `A` into this formula and prints the full equation.\n4.  Finally, the script will calculate and print the final value of the determinant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the adjacency matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\nprint(\"The given matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the cofactor expansion formula:\")\nprint(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n# Extract the elements of the matrix\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Print the formula with the numbers from the matrix A\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers from matrix A:\")\n# First term\npart1 = f\"({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h}))\"\n# Second term (note the minus in the formula)\npart2 = f\"({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g}))\"\n# Third term\npart3 = f\"({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\n\nprint(f\"det(A) = {part1} - {part2} + {part3}\")\n\n# Calculate the intermediate values\nval1 = (e * i) - (f * h)\nval2 = (d * i) - (f * g)\nval3 = (d * h) - (e * g)\n\nprint(f\"       = ({a})*({val1}) - ({b})*({val2}) + ({c})*({val3})\")\n\n# Calculate the final result\ndeterminant = a * val1 - b * val2 + c * val3\n\nprint(f\"       = {a * val1} - {b * val2} + {c * val3}\")\nprint(f\"       = {determinant}\")\n\n# You can also use numpy's built-in function to verify\n# determinant_numpy = np.linalg.det(A)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final computed determinant is: {determinant}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
