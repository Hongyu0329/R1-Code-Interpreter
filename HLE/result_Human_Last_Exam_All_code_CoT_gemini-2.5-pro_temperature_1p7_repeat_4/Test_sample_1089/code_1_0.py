    print("Evaluating the answer choices:")
    print("A, E (Cracking): Welding repairs cracks, but the primary mechanism isn't just 'building up layers' but filling a void after crack removal.")
    print("D (Creep): This is material deformation (stretching), not material loss. Welding doesn't reverse creep.")
    print("B (FOD): Foreign object damage causes nicks and dents, which are indeed filled by welding. This is a valid application.")
    print("F (Oxidation/Corrosion): This causes surface thinning. Weld build-up is a possible repair, but restoring coatings is also common.")
    print("C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is the progressive loss of material at the blade's tip due to rubbing against the engine casing. Restoring the tip's height and clearance is critical for engine efficiency and is a classic example of a 'build-up of layers'. It's a routine and primary repair task for which this method is used.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("While TIG welding can be used for FOD, the description of building up layers to restore geometry perfectly matches the common and critical MRO task of repairing blade tip wear.")
