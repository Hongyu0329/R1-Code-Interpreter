    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will use a computational chemistry approach with Python libraries. The SMILES string represents a complex, planar, triangular-shaped \"nanographene\" molecule with three ethynyl groups at the corners. Directly analyzing such a structure by hand is tedious and error-prone.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Use the `rdkit` library:** This library is a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics. I will use it to parse the SMILES string and generate a 3D conformation (the molecule's shape in space).\n2.  **Use the `pyscf` library:** This is a quantum chemistry package that has excellent built-in tools for molecular symmetry detection.\n3.  **Bridge the two libraries:** I will extract the atom types and their 3D coordinates from the `rdkit` object.\n4.  **Determine the point group:** I will then feed this structural information into `pyscf`. Its `build()` function can automatically analyze the geometry and determine the appropriate symmetry point group.\n5.  **Print the result:** The final code will print the name of the symmetry group. To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will also print a breakdown of the characters in the point group name (e.g., for D3h, I'll explain 'D', '3', and 'h').\n\nThis automated approach ensures an accurate determination of the symmetry for this complex molecule. You will need to install the `rdkit` and `pyscf` libraries to run the code. You can install them using pip: `pip install rdkit pyscf`.\n\n```python\n# Note: To run this code, you need to install the rdkit and pyscf libraries.\n# You can install them using the command: pip install rdkit pyscf\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nfrom pyscf import gto\n\ndef find_molecule_symmetry(smiles_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a SMILES string, generates a 3D structure,\n    and determines its molecular point group using rdkit and pyscf.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Create a molecule object from the SMILES string using rdkit\n        mol_rdkit = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n        if mol_rdkit is None:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid SMILES string provided.\")\n            return\n\n        # Add hydrogens to complete the valence\n        mol_rdkit = Chem.AddHs(mol_rdkit)\n\n        # Step 2: Generate a 3D conformation of the molecule\n        # We use a random seed for reproducibility\n        AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol_rdkit, randomSeed=1)\n        # Optimize the geometry using the Universal Force Field (UFF)\n        # A try-except block handles potential optimization failures for complex molecules\n        try:\n            AllChem.UFFOptimizeMolecule(mol_rdkit)\n        except Exception as e:\n            # For complex rigid molecules, optimization might not be necessary or might fail.\n            # The embedded structure is often sufficient for symmetry analysis.\n            print(f\"Warning: RDKit geometry optimization failed, proceeding with initial 3D structure.
