The laboratory's mistake was in misinterpreting their Quality Control (QC) results. Their QC test used a specific chloramphenicol-sensitive strain (Bacillus subtilis), which was successfully inhibited even by the heavily degraded antibiotic in Batch 3. They incorrectly concluded that since this one specific bacterium couldn't grow, the batch's antibiotic was fully effective and would inhibit all potential bacterial contaminants. This flawed evidence gave them a false sense of security.
