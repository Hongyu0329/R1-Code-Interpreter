    The antibiotic added to the PDA, Chloramphenicol, is sensitive to high heat.
    For Batch 3, the antibiotic was added BEFORE autoclaving (heating to 121Â°C).
    This process destroyed or severely degraded the chloramphenicol, rendering it ineffective against most bacteria.
    Batches 1 and 2 were likely prepared using the correct procedure, where the antibiotic is added after the media is autoclaved and has cooled down.

    The laboratory's mistake was in their interpretation of the QC evidence.
    They saw that their one specific test bacterium failed to grow and incorrectly extrapolated that Batch 3's antibiotic was fully effective against ALL bacteria.
    This flawed QC result gave them a false sense of security, leading them to believe Batch 3 was safe to use, even though its primary defense against bacteria had been compromised.
    When exposed to more resistant airborne bacteria, those contaminants grew successfully in Batch 3 but were inhibited in Batches 1 and 2.

Their QC test used a specific chloramphenicol-sensitive strain (Bacillus subtilis), which was successfully inhibited even by the heavily degraded antibiotic in Batch 3. They incorrectly concluded that since this one specific bacterium couldn't grow, the batch's antibiotic was fully effective and would inhibit all potential bacterial contaminants. This flawed evidence gave them a false sense of security."
