    "To solve this, I will use my knowledge of inorganic chemistry to determine the standard synthesis conditions for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the most common and efficient method for producing XeF₄. This is the direct combination of xenon and fluorine gas by heating.\n2.  State the chemical equation for this reaction: `Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄`.\n3.  Based on established chemical literature, determine the optimal temperature for this synthesis that balances reaction rate and product purity. The standard temperature is 400 °C.\n4.  Write a Python script that encapsulates this information. The script will compare the known efficient temperature against the provided multiple-choice options.\n5.  The script will also fulfill the requirement to output the numbers from the chemical equation (`1`, `2`, `4`) before printing the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the coldest efficient synthesis temperature for Xenon\n    tetrafluoride (XeF₄) from the given options based on established chemical knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The primary synthesis for Xenon tetrafluoride involves heating Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gases.\n    # The chemical equation for this reaction is: Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n    synthesis_reaction = \"Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄\"\n\n    # The reaction is typically conducted at 400°C.
