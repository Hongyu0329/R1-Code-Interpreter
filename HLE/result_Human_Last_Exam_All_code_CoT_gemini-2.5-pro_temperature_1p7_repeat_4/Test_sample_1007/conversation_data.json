    "To determine which classical ballet step has the same ending leg position as the starting position, we need to analyze the definition of each movement.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the criteria:** The core question is whether the leg position (e.g., fifth position with the right foot in front) is identical at the beginning and the end of the step.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option A: Entrechat six**\n    *   An `entrechat` is a jump where the feet beat against each other in the air.\n    *   The number refers to the number of \"actions\" or crossings. Even-numbered entrechats (`deux`, `quatre`, `six`) start from a closed position (like fifth) and land in the *same* closed position.\n    *   An `entrechat six` starts in fifth, jumps, the legs open and close three times in the air, and it lands in the original fifth position. The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option B: Échappé battu changé**\n    *   `Échappé` means \"to escape,\" where legs move from a closed to an open position and back.\n    *   `Battu` means \"beaten,\" referring to a beat of the calves as the legs close.\n    *   `Changé` means \"changed.\" This word explicitly indicates that the foot that started in front will end in the back. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option C: Assemblé**\n    *   `Assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" It is a jump where the feet are brought together in the air and land together.\n    *   However, `assemblé` can be `dessus` (over) or `dessous` (under), which means the working foot can land in front of or behind the supporting foot, thus changing the starting fifth position. For example, an `assemblé derrière` from fifth position with the front foot will result in that foot landing in the back. The position typically changes.\n\n5.  **Analyze Option D: Glissade derrière**\n    *   `Glissade` is a gliding step.\n    *   `Derrière` means \"to the back.\" A `glissade derrière` starting from fifth position involves the back foot gliding to the side and the front foot closing behind it. This reverses the feet. The starting position (e.g., right foot front) becomes the opposite (left foot front). The position changes.\n\n6.  **Analyze Option E: Gargouillade**\n    *   A `gargouillade` is a complex jump involving a double `rond de jambe` action while in the air. It almost always finishes by changing the feet, similar to a `pas de chat`. If you start with the right foot in front, you will typically land and close with the left foot in front. The position changes.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the definitions, `Entrechat six` is the only step among the choices that is designed to start and end in the exact same foot position.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that codifies this analysis to programmatically arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_step_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    position it starts from.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = [\n        {\n            \"option\": \"A\",\n            \"name\": \"Entrechat six\",\n            \"changes_position\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"An even-numbered entrechat, like six, starts in a position (e.g., fifth) and lands in the very same position.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"B\",\n            \"name\": \"Échappé battu changé\",\n            \"changes_position\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"The word 'changé' explicitly means 'changed,' indicating the starting and ending positions are different.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"C\",\n            \"name\": \"Assemblé\",\n            \"changes_position\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"This step typically changes the position of the feet, as the working foot assembles 'over' or 'under' the supporting foot.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"D\",\n            \"name\": \"Glissade derrière\",\n            \"changes_position\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"A glide where the front foot closes in the back, thus changing the starting position.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"E\",\n            \"name\": \"Gargouillade\",\n            \"changes_position\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"A complex jump that almost always results in the feet changing their starting arrangement.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    correct_answer = None\n    print(\"Analyzing the ballet steps:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for step in steps:\n        if not step[\"changes_position\"]:\n            status = \"SAME position.\"\n            correct_answer = step\n        else:\n            status = \"DIFFERENT position.\"\n        \n        print(f\"Option {step['option']}: {step['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Analysis: {step['reason']}\")\n        print(f\"Result: Ends in a {status}\\n\")\n\n    if correct_answer:\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        print(f\"Conclusion: The correct step is '{correct_answer['name']}'.\")\n        print(f\"Final Answer Option: {correct_answer['option']}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No answer found based on the analysis.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_step_question()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
