    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand**: The core of the problem is the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard calculus form. The integral of a function of the form `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. Therefore, the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we will apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n    `∫ [from a to b] f'(x)/f(x) dx = [ln|f(x)|]` from `a` to `b` = `ln|f(b)| - ln|f(a)|`.\n    In our case, `a=0` and `b=1`, so the integral `V` is `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n3.  **Define and Evaluate F₃(x)**: We need to find the values of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration. The function is defined as:\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃ at the Limits**:\n    *   At `x = 1`: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n    *   At `x = 0`: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   For the domain `x` in `[0, 1]`, the value `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1, so `F₃(x)` is always positive. This means `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**:\n    *   The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   We will use Python's `math` library for a precise calculation of `V`.\n    *   Then, we will compute `10000 * V`.\n    *   Finally, we will round this result to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1\n    and calculates the closest integer to 10000*V, where V is the value of the integral.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n    # By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n    # Define F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    def F3(x):\n        return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n    # Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\n    F3_at_1 = F3(1)\n    F3_at_0 = F3(0) # This is equivalent to math.log(2)\n\n    # Calculate the value of the integral, V\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n    # Calculate the final value required by the user\n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n    # Print the equation with the calculated numbers\n    print(\"The integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is evaluated using the formula: ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Intermediate Calculations ---\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {F3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) ≈ {F3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) ≈ ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0}) ≈ {V}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"The value of the integral V is approximately {V}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplying by 10000: 10000 * V ≈ {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
