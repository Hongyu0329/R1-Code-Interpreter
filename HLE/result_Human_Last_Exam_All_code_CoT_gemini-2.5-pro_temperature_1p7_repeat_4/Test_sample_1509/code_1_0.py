# --- Demonstration for Question (b) ---
# We will construct a counterexample to the claim that a shifted (t+1)-intersecting 
# family F must satisfy |F^(n)| >= 3.

# Define parameters for the counterexample.
# Let t=1, k=4. The condition on n is n >= k + t + 3.

n = k + t + 3  # n=8, satisfies the condition.

# The condition on F is that it must be (t+1)-intersecting.

# Construct the family F = {{1, 2, 3, 4}}
F = { (1, 2, 3, 4) }
