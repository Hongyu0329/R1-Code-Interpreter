    # Analysis of Option A
    analysis_A = "This is a common simplifying assumption in basic models, but not a fundamental limitation of the experiment itself. Advanced analysis of calorimetric data can be used to determine the heat capacity change (ΔCp). Therefore, this is an issue with a simplified model, not the experimental technique's ultimate capability."
    print("Option A: Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero.")
    print(textwrap.fill(f"Analysis: {analysis_A}", width=80, initial_indent="  ", subsequent_indent="  "))
    print("Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # Analysis of Option B
    analysis_B = "Similar to option A, this is an approximation. The nearest-neighbor parameters (ΔH°, ΔS°) are indeed temperature-dependent (related to ΔCp), but treating them as constant is a simplification of the model, not an inherent flaw in the bulk measurement technique. The experiment measures effects across a range of temperatures."
    print("Option B: The NNPB parameters are T-independent.")
    print(textwrap.fill(f"Analysis: {analysis_B}", width=80, initial_indent="  ", subsequent_indent="  "))
    print("Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # Analysis of Option C
    analysis_C = "This is a core, fundamental limitation of any 'bulk' or 'ensemble' measurement. The experiment measures the average behavior of billions or trillions of molecules. If the sample is heterogeneous (e.g., contains a mix of perfectly formed duplexes, hairpins, or molecules with frayed ends), the resulting melting curve is a population average. It is impossible to distinguish between a single homogeneous species undergoing a transition and multiple different species melting at slightly different temperatures. This averaging masks the underlying molecular complexity."
    print("Option C: Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments.")
    print(textwrap.fill(f"Analysis: {analysis_C}", width=80, initial_indent="  ", subsequent_indent="  "))
    print("Verdict: Correct.\n")

    # Analysis of Option D
    analysis_D = "This is factually incorrect. Modern calorimeters offer very precise temperature control and scanning capabilities. Capturing temperature dependence is the primary goal and strength of these experiments."
    print("Option D: Temperature oscillations in bulk calorimetry are too large to capture T-dependence.")
    print(textwrap.fill(f"Analysis: {analysis_D}", width=80, initial_indent="  ", subsequent_indent="  "))
    print("Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # Analysis of Option E
    analysis_E = "This is also factually incorrect. Controlling and systematically varying the temperature is the fundamental principle of a calorimetric melting experiment."
    print("Option E: Temperature cannot be controlled in calorimetric experiments.")
    print(textwrap.fill(f"Analysis: {analysis_E}", width=80, initial_indent="  ", subsequent_indent="  "))
    print("Verdict: Incorrect.\n")
    
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The most fundamental limitation of bulk experiments is their inability to resolve molecular heterogeneity, as they only measure the average properties of the entire population.")
