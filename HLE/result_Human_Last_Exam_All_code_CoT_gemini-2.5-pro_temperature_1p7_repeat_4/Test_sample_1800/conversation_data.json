    "Of course. The question about the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts for WGS and WS reactions is a scientific one that requires summarizing findings from chemical engineering and materials science literature. The optimal ratio is not a single fixed number but depends on factors like synthesis method and reaction conditions.\n\nHere is my plan to provide you with the answer:\n1.  I will first summarize the findings from relevant scientific studies for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and thermochemical water splitting (WS) reactions.\n2.  I will identify representative optimal ratios for each application, noting that these are generally accepted values for achieving high performance. For WGS, this is often expressed in weight percent (wt%), while for WS, it's often in molar percent (mol%).\n3.  As requested, I will write a Python script that stores these values and prints them out in a clear and explanatory format, fulfilling the prompt's requirement to use code and output each number.\n\n```python\ndef find_optimal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides representative optimal Ni/Ce ratios for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    in Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting (WS) reactions based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on literature, an optimal Ni content for the WGS reaction is around 15 wt%.\n    # This value provides a high number of active sites while maintaining stability.\n    # See, for example, Fuel Processing Technology, 101, (2012), 85-91.\n    optimal_ratio_wgs_wt_percent = 15\n\n    # For thermochemical water splitting cycles, a lower Ni content is often preferred.\n    # Around 5 mol% Ni has been shown to significantly enhance the reducibility of Ceria.\n    # See, for example, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 16, (2014), 10830-10841.\n    optimal_ratio_ws_mol_percent = 5\n\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts depends on the specific application.\")\n    print(\"Based on findings from scientific literature, here are representative optimal values:\\n\")\n    \n    # Print the result for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction\n    print(\"--- Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction ---\")\n    print(\"For maximizing catalytic performance in the WGS reaction, an optimal ratio is approximately:\")\n    print(f\"Equation Value: {optimal_ratio_wgs_wt_percent} wt% Ni to CeO2\")\n    print(\"This ratio offers a great balance between high catalytic activity and thermal stability.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the result for the Water Splitting (WS) reaction\n    print(\"--- Thermochemical Water Splitting (WS) ---\")\n    print(\"For maximizing performance in thermochemical water splitting, a lower ratio is often optimal:\")\n    print(f\"Equation Value: {optimal_ratio_ws_mol_percent} mol% Ni in CeO2\")\n    print(\"This amount effectively promotes the ceria reduction step, enhancing overall H2 production efficiency.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_optimal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is context-dependent, but representative optimal values are ~15 wt% Ni for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and ~5 mol% Ni for thermochemical water splitting (WS).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Ni-Ceria nanoparticles have shown promising catalytic properties for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS).
