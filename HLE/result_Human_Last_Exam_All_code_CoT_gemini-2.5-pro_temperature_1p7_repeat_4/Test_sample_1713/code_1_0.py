# This script calculates a firm's profit or loss based on defined areas
# in a perfectly competitive market scenario.

# Step 1: Define the economic scenario with example numerical values.
# The problem states the market condition is P = MC < AVC < ATC.
# Let's choose some values that satisfy this inequality.
q1 = 50   # Output level
P = 30    # Market Price (P), which equals Marginal Cost (MC)
AVC = 35  # Average Variable Cost (AVC)
ATC = 40  # Average Total Cost (ATC)

# Verify the condition: 30 < 35 < 40 is True, so P < AVC < ATC holds.

# Step 2: Relate the defined areas S and H to economic concepts.
# The profit of a firm is calculated as Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC).
# Let's find the areas that represent TR and TC.

# Area S represents Total Revenue (TR).
# TR = Price * Quantity
# According to the problem, S is the area of the rectangle bounded by the price line (P)
# and the quantity (q1).
# S = P * q1
TR = S = P * q1

# Area H represents Total Cost (TC).
# TC = Average Total Cost * Quantity
# According to the problem, H is the area of the rectangle bounded by the ATC line
# and the quantity (q1).
# TC = ATC * q1
TC = H = ATC * q1

# Step 3: Calculate the firm's profit or loss using the areas.
# Profit = TR - TC
# Substituting the areas S and H, we get:
# Profit = S - H
profit_or_loss = S - H

# Step 4: Display the results and the final formula.
