    This function solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down

    # The riddle is: "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center."

    # Part 1: "A wooden stick" refers to the bottom part of the character.
    # This is the radical for 'wood' or 'tree'.
    part1 = "木"

    # Part 2: "a square box, a ladder placed in the center" refers to the top part.
    # This is the character for 'field', which visually matches the description.

    # Combining these components forms the final character.
