# Let's solve the riddle step-by-step.

# Step 1: Analyze the description of the horizontal strokes.
# The phrase "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another"
# describes three stacked horizontal strokes. This is the component '三'.
print("Riddle Analysis Step 1:")
print("The description 'One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another' points to the component '三' (three horizontal strokes).")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Analyze the description of the vertical strokes.
# The phrase "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" is the key.
# It describes a symmetrical character with two main vertical strokes forming its structure.
print("Riddle Analysis Step 2:")
print("The description 'one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right' indicates a symmetrical frame made of two vertical strokes.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Combine the components to form the final character.
# The character is symmetrical, so the three horizontal strokes apply to both
# the left vertical stroke and the right vertical stroke.
print("Conclusion:")
print("Combining these components creates a character with a left vertical stroke crossed by three horizontal strokes, and a right vertical stroke also crossed by three horizontal strokes.")

# The resulting character is "非" (fēi).
final_character = "非"
print(f"The Chinese character described by the riddle is: {final_character}")
