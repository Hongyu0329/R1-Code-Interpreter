# The analysis of the Makefile execution shows which commands will be run.
# 1. Initial files are: ['Makefile', 'OPPS', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
# 2. `make all` triggers a chain of dependency checks.
# 3. The rule for target 'Opps' is run because the file 'Opps' does not exist. This executes `touch T`, creating file 'T'.
# 4. The rule for target 'X' is run because it is older than its dependency 'Y'. This executes `touch B`, creating file 'B'.
# 5. The rule for target 'T' is NOT run because the file 'T' was already created and is considered up-to-date.
# 6. The rule for target 'Z' is NOT run because it is already up-to-date.
# 7. The final list of files is the initial set plus the two newly created files.
