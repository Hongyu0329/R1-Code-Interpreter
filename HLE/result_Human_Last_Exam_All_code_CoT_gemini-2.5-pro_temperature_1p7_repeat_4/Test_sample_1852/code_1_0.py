    Step 1: Understanding the problem
    A tower of length delta is a sequence of uncountable subsets of {omega_1}, <x_alpha : alpha < delta>,
    such that for alpha < beta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable, and there's no uncountable y
    such that |y \\ x_alpha| is countable for all alpha.
    This structure is a strictly decreasing chain of length delta in the poset P({omega_1})/count
    that has no lower bound. The relation [A] <= [B] in this poset holds if |A \\ B| is countable.
    The given assumption is {two_power_omega_1} = {omega_2}.
    X is the set of regular cardinals lambda for which a tower of length lambda exists.
    We need to find delta_1 + delta_2, where delta_1 = sup(X) and delta_2 = inf(X).

    Step 2: Determining delta_2 = inf(X)
    The poset P({omega_1})/count is a Boolean algebra. A standard theorem in set theory states that for any
    regular cardinal kappa, the algebra P(kappa)/I_<kappa> (where I_<kappa> is the ideal of sets of
    cardinality less than kappa) is kappa^+-complete.
    For kappa = {omega_1}, the algebra is {omega_1}^+-complete.
    Given {two_power_omega_1} = {omega_2}, we have {omega_1}^+ = {omega_2}. Thus, the algebra P({omega_1})/count is {omega_2}-complete.
    {omega_2}-completeness implies that any strictly decreasing sequence of length less than {omega_2} must have a
    lower bound (an infimum). A tower, by definition, has no lower bound.
    Therefore, the length of any tower, delta, must be at least {omega_2}.
    This means any regular cardinal lambda in X must be >= {omega_2}. So, delta_2 = inf(X) >= {omega_2}.

    To show that delta_2 <= {omega_2}, we need to show that a tower of length {omega_2} exists.
    A theorem by Shelah states that {two_power_omega_1} = {omega_2} implies that the dominating number d({omega_1})
    is equal to {omega_2}. The existence of a dominating family of this size allows the construction
    of an {omega_2}-scale, which is a well-ordered cofinal family <f_alpha : alpha < {omega_2}> in the
    set of functions from {omega_1} to {omega_1}, ordered by eventual dominance.
    Such a scale can be used to construct a tower of length {omega_2}. Since {omega_2} is a regular cardinal,
    it follows that {omega_2} is in X.
    Therefore, delta_2 = inf(X) <= {omega_2}.
    Combining the two inequalities, we conclude delta_2 = {omega_2}.

    Step 3: Determining delta_1 = sup(X)
    Let lambda be a regular cardinal in X. This means there exists a tower of length lambda.
    This tower corresponds to a strictly decreasing chain of length lambda in the poset P({omega_1})/count.
    The length of any chain in a poset cannot exceed the cardinality of the poset itself.
    The cardinality of P({omega_1})/count is at most the cardinality of P({omega_1}), which is {two_power_omega_1}.
    Given our assumption, |P({omega_1})/count| <= {two_power_omega_1} = {omega_2}.
    So, any lambda in X must satisfy lambda <= {omega_2}.
    This implies that delta_1 = sup(X) <= {omega_2}.
    From Step 2, we know that {omega_2} is in X. This means delta_1 = sup(X) >= {omega_2}.
    Combining these, we conclude delta_1 = {omega_2}.

    Step 4: Calculating the final sum
    We have found that delta_1 = {omega_2} and delta_2 = {omega_2}.
    The sum is a cardinal addition. For any infinite cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.
    So, delta_1 + delta_2 = {omega_2} + {omega_2} = {omega_2}.
