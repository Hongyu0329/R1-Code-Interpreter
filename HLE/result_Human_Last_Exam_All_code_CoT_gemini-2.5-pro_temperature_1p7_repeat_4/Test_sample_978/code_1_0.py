# The problem asks to identify the correct statement regarding legal liability based on a scenario.
# My analysis concluded that the employer is vicariously liable for the separate negligent acts of each of its employees.

# Incident 1 (Mark):
# - Mark is negligent.
# - Evergreen (employer) is vicariously liable.
# - Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.

# Incident 2 (Lincoln):
# - Lincoln is negligent.
# - Evergreen (employer) is vicariously liable.
# - Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the car damage.

# Let's review the options:
# A. Incorrect (Neighbors not liable, Evergreen liable for Lincoln).
# B. Incorrect (Mark and Lincoln are not liable for each other's actions).
# C. Incorrect (Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions).
# D. Incorrect (Minimal damage still results in liability).
# E. Correct (Accurately reflects vicarious liability for both separate incidents).
