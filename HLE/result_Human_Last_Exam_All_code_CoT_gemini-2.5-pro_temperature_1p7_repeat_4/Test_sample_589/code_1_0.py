    This function identifies and prints the title of the film that most closely
    matches the user's description.

    The scene described is from the 2004 film "Napoleon Dynamite". In the movie,
    the character Deb, a teenager, is riding her light blue-green bicycle when she
    is knocked over by a steak thrown from Uncle Rico's oncoming van. The unique
    nature of the scene and the bike's color often lead to it being misremembered
    as pink.
