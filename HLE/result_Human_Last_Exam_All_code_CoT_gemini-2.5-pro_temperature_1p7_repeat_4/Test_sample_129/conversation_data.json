    "Answering this question requires finding all the syntactically correct boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to `True`. The allowed symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n\nA manual, combinatorial approach of listing all possible valid structures (`V op V op V`, `(V op V)`, `!(!V)`, etc.) is complex and highly prone to errors, as it's easy to miss a valid structure or miscalculate the logic, precedence, or associativity.\n\nA more reliable method is to use a brute-force script. We can generate all possible strings of length 5 from the 7 given symbols and then check each one for validity and truthfulness. The total number of combinations is 7^5 = 16,807, which is a very manageable number for a modern computer.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  **Generate Candidates**: Create every possible sequence of 5 symbols using `itertools.product`.\n2.  **Transform for Evaluation**: Convert each sequence into a Python-evaluable string.\n    *   `T` becomes `True`\n    *   `F` becomes `False`\n    *   `&` becomes `and`\n    *   `|` becomes `or`\n    *   `!` becomes `not`\n    The operator precedence specified in the problem (`!` > `&` > `|`) matches Python's (`not` > `and` > `or`), so a direct substitution is sufficient. Adding spaces around all symbols ensures they are treated as distinct tokens.\n3.  **Validate and Evaluate**: Use a `try...except` block to attempt to `eval()` the transformed string.\n    *   If `eval()` raises an error (like `SyntaxError` or `NameError`), the expression is not syntactically valid.\n    *   If `eval()` succeeds, check if the result is `True`.\n4.  **Count and Output**: Count every expression that evaluates to `True`. The final count is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will print the final count of all such true expressions.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of true boolean expressions that can be\n    written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n    It works by generating all 7^5 = 16,807 possible strings and evaluating each one.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n    # as printing the final result of the count. In this brute-force approach,\n    # the count is a single accumulated number.\n    final_equation_number = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible expressions of length 5.\n    for p in itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5):\n        expr_str = \"\".join(p)\n\n        # Convert the expression into a format Python's eval() can understand.\n        # We add spaces around each token to ensure proper parsing.\n        # For example, 'T&F' becomes ' True  and  False ', not 'TrueandFalse'.\n        py_expr = expr_str.replace('T', ' True ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', ' False ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('(', ' ( ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace(')', ' ) ')\n\n        # Use a try-except block to filter out syntactically invalid expressions.\n        # For example, \"T!F&(\" would cause a SyntaxError.\n        try:\n            # An expression must contain a boolean value to be valid.\n            # This is a simple check to quickly discard junk like \"&&&&&\".\n            if 'True' not in py_expr and 'False' not in py_expr:\n                continue\n\n            # Evaluate the expression. If it's valid and returns True, increment count.\n            if eval(py_expr) is True:\n                count += 1\n        except Exception:\n            # If any error occurs during parsing or evaluation, it's not a valid\n            # expression we are looking for.\n            continue\n\n    final_equation_number = count\n    print(final_equation_number)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_true_expressions()\n```\n<<<78>>>"
