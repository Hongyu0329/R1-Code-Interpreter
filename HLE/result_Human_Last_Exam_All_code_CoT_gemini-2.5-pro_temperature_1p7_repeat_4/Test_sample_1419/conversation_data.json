    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the expression, followed by a Python script that uses symbolic math to find and display the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Theory and Method:** The problem concerns `φ^4` theory near four spatial dimensions (`D = 4 - ϵ`). The appropriate theoretical tool is the Renormalization Group (RG). The central object we need is the RG beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` \"runs\" with the energy scale.\n\n2.  **The Beta Function:** For `φ^4` theory, the one-loop beta function in `D = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is given by:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u² / (16π²)) + O(u³)`\n    The first term, `-ϵu`, comes from the engineering dimension of the coupling `u`. The second term, proportional to `u²`, is the crucial one-loop quantum correction.\n\n3.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point `u^*` is a specific value of the coupling where the flow with energy scale stops, meaning `β(u^*) = 0`. By solving this equation, we can find the value of the fixed point coupling.\n\n4.  **Solve the Equation:** We need to solve the equation:\n    `-ϵu* + (3(u*)^2 / (16π²)) = 0`\n    This equation has two solutions. One is `u* = 0` (the \"Gaussian\" or trivial fixed point). The other, non-zero solution is the \"Wilson-Fisher\" fixed point, which governs the critical behavior of the theory.\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to define the beta function, solve the fixed point equation, and print the resulting expression for `u^*` in a clear format. The script will also explicitly show the different numerical and symbolic parts of the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\n    coupling (u*) in phi^4 theory near D=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
