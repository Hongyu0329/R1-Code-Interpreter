# The total number of individuals in the group.
num_individuals = 9

# --- Calculating N (Simultaneous Guess) ---
# The best strategy is for the individuals to form as many pairs as possible.
# For 9 people, we can form floor(9 / 2) = 4 pairs, with 1 person left over.
# Within each pair, one person guesses they are the same as their partner, and the
# other guesses they are different. This guarantees exactly one correct guess per pair.
# This results in 4 guaranteed correct guesses. The leftover person has no guarantee.
# So, N = 4.
N = num_individuals // 2

# --- Calculating M (Leader Guesses First) ---
# One person acts as a "leader" to convey information, sacrificing their own guess.
# The leader looks at the other 8 individuals (the "followers") and announces
# the parity (whether the sum is even or odd) of their hats.
# Each of the 8 followers hears this information. They can also see the other 7 followers'
# hats. By combining the announced group parity with the hats they see, they can
# deduce their own hat color with 100% certainty.
# This guarantees that all 8 followers guess correctly.
# So, M = 8.
M = num_individuals - 1

# --- Final Calculation ---
# The problem asks for M - N, which represents how many more people will
# definitely guess correctly in the second scenario compared to the first.
difference = M - N
