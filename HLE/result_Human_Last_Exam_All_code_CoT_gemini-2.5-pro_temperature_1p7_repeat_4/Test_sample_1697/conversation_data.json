    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is my step-by-step plan to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It has a benzene ring substituted with two functional groups: an N,N-diethylamide group (`-C(=O)N(Et)₂`) and a dimethylamino group (`-NMe₂`) at the meta position (position 3) relative to the amide.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step**: The reagents are sec-butyllithium (`sec-BuLi`) and TMEDA in THF. This combination is a very strong base used for deprotonating C-H bonds, specifically in a reaction called Directed ortho-Metalation. Both the amide and the amino groups are \"directing groups,\" meaning they coordinate to the lithium ion and direct the deprotonation to an adjacent (ortho) carbon.\n    *   The amide group at position 1 directs lithiation to positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The amino group at position 3 directs lithiation to positions 2 and 4.\n    *   Position 2 is ortho to *both* directing groups. This creates a powerful synergistic effect, making deprotonation at this position extremely fast and selective. The `sec-BuLi` will remove the proton from position 2, forming a lithiated intermediate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step**: The second reagent is methyl iodide (`CH₃I`), a common electrophile. The lithiated carbon at position 2 is now a strong nucleophile (a carbanion). It will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product**: This two-step sequence results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at position 2 with a methyl group. Therefore, the final compound is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the product of a two-step organic reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the reaction components\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagents_step_1 = \"1) sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF\"\n    reagents_step_2 = \"2) Methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n\n    # Explain the reaction mechanism\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(\"The reaction is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: The strong base, sec-BuLi, selectively removes a proton from the benzene ring.\")\n    print(\"The deprotonation occurs at position 2, which is 'ortho' to both the N,N-diethylamide and the 3-dimethylamino directing groups.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: The resulting nucleophilic intermediate attacks the electrophile, methyl iodide.\")\n    \n    # Define the final product based on the mechanism\n    # The result is the addition of a methyl group at position 2.\n    final_product = \"N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"Starting Material: {}\".format(starting_material))\n    print(\"Final Product: {}\".format(final_product))\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
