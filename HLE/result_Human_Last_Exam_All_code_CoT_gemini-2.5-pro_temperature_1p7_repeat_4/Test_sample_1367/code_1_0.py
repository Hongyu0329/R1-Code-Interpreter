    # (a) Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # For any positive integer p, the level k = -2 + 1/p is a rational number for which
    # the corresponding vertex algebra V(p) is known to contain singular vectors.
    # These singular vectors generate non-trivial ideals, meaning V(p) is not simple.
    # This is a cornerstone result in the study of logarithmic conformal field theories.
    answer_a = "No"

    # (b) If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # In the representation theory of vertex algebras, a non-trivial ideal is a proper submodule.
    # The existence of any such submodule in a highest-weight representation (like V(p))
    # is equivalent to the presence of a "singular vector" (or null vector).
    # This vector generates the submodule that constitutes the ideal.
    answer_b = "must contain a singular vector"

    # (c) Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Yes. For the V(p) algebra, the ideal structure is intimately tied to the module structure
    # of its affine subalgebra L_k(sl_2). A non-trivial L_k(sl_2)-submodule of V(p)
    # would be generated by a singular vector, and this submodule is in fact an ideal of the full V(p) algebra.
    # Therefore, if V(p) has no non-trivial ideals (is simple), it cannot have any
    # non-trivial L_k(sl_2)-submodules (must be irreducible).
