    explanation = """
    This experimental apparatus functions as a Brownian ratchet. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

    1.  The Mechanism: The system relies on gas molecules moving randomly and passing through a one-way door. All the gas is trapped on one side when, over time, all molecules have happened to move from the initial side to the target side.

    2.  The Driving Force: This movement of gas molecules is not spontaneous; it is the result of their inherent kinetic energy. This random, thermally-driven motion is known as Brownian motion.

    3.  The Required Parameter: The macroscopic quantity that measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a system is Temperature.
        - If Temperature is above absolute zero (> 0 K), molecules possess kinetic energy and are in constant, random motion. This allows them to eventually pass through the one-way door.
        - If Temperature were at absolute zero (0 K), molecules would have no kinetic energy and would be stationary. No motion means no molecules would ever cross through the door.

    4.  Conclusion: Therefore, having a non-zero Temperature is the absolute requirement for the molecular motion needed to drive the entire process. The other parameters (pressure, size, gas type) influence the rate or efficiency of the process, but temperature enables it fundamentally.
