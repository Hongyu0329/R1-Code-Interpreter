# The Kunoichi no Jutsu section of the scroll is represented by a sequence
# of present (⬤) and missing (○) kanji. Let's quantify this.

missing_kanji_count = 3

# We can form a simple equation to represent the total number of symbols in this sequence.
total_symbols = present_kanji_count + missing_kanji_count

# The final code must output the numbers from the equation.
