    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to evaluate the given integral.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral we need to evaluate is $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$. The bra-ket notation $\\langle A | \\hat{O} | B \\rangle$ represents the integral $\\int A^* \\hat{O} B \\, d\\tau$ over all space. Here, the operator $\\hat{O}$ is the potential energy operator $\\frac{1}{r}$. The wavefunctions $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are specified as $1s$ Slater-type orbitals (STOs). I will assume this is a one-center integral, meaning both orbitals are centered on the same nucleus, and also that $\\phi_i = \\phi_j$, which is the standard expectation value calculation for the potential energy of an electron in a $1s$ orbital.\n\n2.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital:** A normalized $1s$ Slater orbital is given by the function:\n    \\[ \\phi_{1s}(r) = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\n    where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, which is related to the effective nuclear charge felt by the electron.\n\n3.  **Set up and Solve the Integral:** The integral becomes:\n    \\[ \\left\\langle \\phi_{1s} \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right| \\phi_{1s} \\right\\rangle = \\int_{\\text{all space}} \\phi_{1s}^*(r) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(r) \\, dV \\]\n    Since the orbital is real, $\\phi_{1s}^* = \\phi_{1s}$. In spherical coordinates, the volume element is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\varphi$.\n    Substituting the expression for $\\phi_{1s}(r)$:\n    \\[ I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r} \\, r^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\varphi \\]\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    \\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} \\,dr \\right) \\]\n    *   The angular integral evaluates to $4\\pi$.\n    *   The radial integral, $\\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr$, evaluates to $\\frac{1}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}$.\n\n4.  **Final Result:** Combining all the parts gives the final result:\n    \\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\times 4\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} = \\zeta \\]\n    The value of the integral is simply the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$.\n\n5.  **Python Code Implementation:** I will now write a Python script that calculates this for a specific value of $\\zeta$ and prints out the components of the final equation as requested. I'll use `zeta = 1.0`, which is the value for a hydrogen atom in its ground state.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef evaluate_electron_nucleus_attraction(zeta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the electron-nucleus attraction integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>\n    for a 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) with a given exponent zeta.\n\n    The final result of this integral is simply zeta. This function\n    demonstrates the calculation by evaluating each part of the integral's\n    analytical solution: (zeta^3/pi) * (4*pi) * (1/(4*zeta^2)).\n    \"\"\"\n    if zeta <= 0:\n        print(\"Zeta must be a positive number.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Evaluating the integral for zeta = {zeta:.4f}\")\n\n    # Part 1: The square of the normalization constant from phi_1s^2\n    norm_squared = zeta**3 / math.pi\n\n    # Part 2: The result from integrating over the angular coordinates (theta, phi)\n    angular_integral = 4 * math.pi\n\n    # Part 3: The result from integrating over the radial coordinate (r)\n    radial_integral = 1 / (2 * zeta)**2\n\n    # The final result is the product of these three parts\n    final_value = norm_squared * angular_integral * radial_integral\n\n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation\n    print(\"\\nThe integral is calculated as the product of three terms:\")\n    print(\"Term 1 (from normalization): zeta^3 / pi\")\n    print(\"Term 2 (from angular integration): 4 * pi\")\n    print(\"Term 3 (from radial integration): 1 / (2 * zeta)^2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with numerical values is:\")\n    print(f\"({norm_squared:.4f}) * ({angular_integral:.4f}) * ({radial_integral:.4f}) = {final_value:.4f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nVerifying the simplified formula: Result = zeta\")\n    print(f\"The calculated value is indeed {final_value:.4f}, which matches the expected value of zeta = {zeta:.4f}.\")\n\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# Set the value for the orbital exponent zeta.\n# For a hydrogen atom, zeta = 1.0.\n# For a helium atom, a common approximation is zeta = 1.6875.\n# Let's use zeta for hydrogen as an example.\nzeta_value = 1.0\nevaluate_electron_nucleus_attraction(zeta_value)\n\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
