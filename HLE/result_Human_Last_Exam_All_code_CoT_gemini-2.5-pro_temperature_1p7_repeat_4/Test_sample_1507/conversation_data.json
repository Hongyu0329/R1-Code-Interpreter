    "To determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we first need to identify what its outer-hull (or convex hull) is. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with the following properties:\n*   **Vertices (V):** 12\n*   **Edges (E):** 30\n\nThe faces of a regular icosahedron are all equilateral triangles. We are looking for the number of these faces. We can find this using Euler's polyhedron formula, which states that for any convex polyhedron:\n`V - E + F = 2`\nwhere `F` is the number of faces.\n\nBy rearranging the formula to solve for F, we get:\n`F = 2 - V + E`\n\nSince the faces are already triangles, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the surface is simply the number of faces of the icosahedron.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this number.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron's outer hull is a regular icosahedron.\n# We can use Euler's polyhedron formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\n# For a regular icosahedron:\n# V (Vertices) = 12\n# E (Edges) = 30\n\nV = 12\nE = 30\n\n# The formula to find the number of faces is F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles is equal to the number of faces (F) of the regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"Using Euler's formula F = 2 - V + E:\")\nprint(f\"F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"The number of triangles needed is: {F}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
