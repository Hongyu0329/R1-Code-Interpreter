# Based on the reasoning that the problem contains a typo and the integrand simplifies to 1/2,
# the value of the integral is the golden ratio, phi.

# The equation for the integral result: Integral = phi
# The golden ratio phi is defined as (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
# The numbers in this equation are 1, 5, and 2.

num1 = 1
num2_in_sqrt = 5
den = 2

# Calculate the value of the golden ratio
phi = (num1 + math.sqrt(num2_in_sqrt)) / den

# Print the final equation and the answer
print(f"The integral evaluates to the golden ratio, phi.")
print(f"The final equation is: phi = ({num1} + sqrt({num2_in_sqrt})) / {den}")
print(f"The numerical value of the integral is: {phi}")
