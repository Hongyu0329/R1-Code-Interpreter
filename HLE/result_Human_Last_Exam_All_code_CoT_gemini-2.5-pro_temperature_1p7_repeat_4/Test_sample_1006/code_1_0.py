    Solves the topology problem by identifying the space X and using its uniqueness property.

    # Step 1: The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties
    # related to the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    #
    # Property (1): X contains a dense copy of R.
    # This means X is a compactification of R.
    #
    # Property (2): Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique
    # continuous function on X.
    # This is a universal mapping property.

    # Step 2: These two properties are the defining characteristics of the
    # Stone-Čech compactification of a space. The Stone-Čech compactification
    # of a Tychonoff space Y, denoted as βY, is the unique (up to homeomorphism)
    # compact Hausdorff space that contains Y as a dense subspace and satisfies
    # the universal mapping property for bounded continuous functions to the real numbers.

    # Step 3: The long ray R is a Tychonoff space, so its Stone-Čech compactification,
    # βR, exists and is unique.

    # Step 4: The problem statement essentially defines X to be the Stone-Čech
    # compactification of the long ray R.
    # Any space X that satisfies these conditions must be homeomorphic to βR.

    # Step 5: Since all such spaces X are homeomorphic to the single, unique space βR,
    # they all belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    # Step 6: Therefore, there is only one distinct homeomorphism class for such X.
