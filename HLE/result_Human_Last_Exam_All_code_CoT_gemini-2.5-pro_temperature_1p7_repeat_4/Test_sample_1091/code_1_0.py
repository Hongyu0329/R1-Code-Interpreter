# The problem asks for the limit of n * P(n) as n goes to infinity.
# Based on the analysis using the Local Central Limit Theorem, this limit is a constant value.
# The final expression for the limit is (2 * sqrt(3)) / pi.

# The numbers in the final equation are 2, sqrt(3), and pi.
num_2 = 2
num_sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)
num_pi = math.pi

# The numerator of the expression is 2 * sqrt(3).
numerator = num_2 * num_sqrt_3

# The denominator is pi.
denominator = num_pi

# Calculate the final result.
result = numerator / denominator
