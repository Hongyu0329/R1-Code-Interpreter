    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}$, we need to use a key result from geometric topology established by Gromov.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects:** We are given two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ (genus $g_1 = 31$) and $\\Sigma_{17}$ (genus $g_2 = 17$). We need to compute the simplicial volume, denoted as $\\|\\cdot\\|$, of their Cartesian product, $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** A fundamental theorem regarding the simplicial volume of product manifolds states that for any two closed, connected, orientable surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$ with genera $g_1 \\ge 1$ and $g_2 \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume of their product is zero.\n    \n    That is, $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = 0$ if $g_1 \\ge 1$ and $g_2 \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the theorem to the specific case:**\n    *   Our surfaces are $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n    *   The genera are $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$.\n    *   We check if the conditions of the theorem are met:\n        *   Is $g_1 \\ge 1$? Yes, $31 \\ge 1$.\n        *   Is $g_2 \\ge 1$? Yes, $17 \\ge 1$.\n    *   Since both conditions are satisfied, the theorem applies directly.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 0.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that takes the two genera as input, checks if they meet the conditions of the theorem, and prints the resulting simplicial volume. This demonstrates the application of the theorem to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_of_product_surface(g1, g2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces.\n\n    The simplicial volume of a product of two closed, connected, orientable surfaces\n    Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2 is 0 if both genera g1 and g2 are non-zero.\n    It is also 0 if at least one of the surfaces is a sphere (genus 0), because\n    the simplicial volume of a sphere is 0, and the simplicial volume of a product\n    with a factor of volume 0 is 0.\n    Thus, for any g1, g2 >= 0, the simplicial volume is 0.\n\n    This function implements this established mathematical result.\n    \n    Args:\n        g1 (int): The genus of the first surface.\n        g2 (int): The genus of the second surface.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The simplicial volume of Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define the genera of the two surfaces.\")\n    print(f\"Genus of the first surface, g1 = {g1}\")\n    print(f\"Genus of the second surface, g2 = {g2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the theorem for the simplicial volume of a product of surfaces.\")\n    print(\"Theorem: The simplicial volume ||Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2|| is 0 for all g1, g2 >= 0.\")\n    print(\"We check the conditions for our specific case.\")\n\n    # The result is 0 for all non-negative genera g1 and g2.\n    # The check is included for pedagogical purposes.\n    if g1 >= 0 and g2 >= 0:\n        result = 0\n        print(f\"Since g1={g1} >= 0 and g2={g2} >= 0, the theorem applies.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is not physically meaningful for closed surfaces but included for completeness.\n        result = \"Invalid genera\"\n        print(\"Genera must be non-negative integers.\")\n        \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Step 3: State the final result.\")\n    \n    if isinstance(result, int):\n        print(f\"The simplicial volume of \\u03A3_{g1} x \\u03A3_{g2} is calculated as:\")\n        # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n        # The \"equation\" here is the direct result from the theorem.\n        print(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} x \\u03A3_{g2}|| = {result}\")\n\n# Define the genera from the problem\ngenus_1 = 31\ngenus_2 = 17\n\n# Compute and print the result\ncompute_simplicial_volume_of_product_surface(genus_1, genus_2)\n```\n<<<0>>>"
