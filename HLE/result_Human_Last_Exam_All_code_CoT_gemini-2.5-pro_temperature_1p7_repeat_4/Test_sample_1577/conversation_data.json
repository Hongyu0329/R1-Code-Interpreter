    "The problem asks for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for GSD:** The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n2.  **Relate logical qubits to topology:** The number of logical qubits `k` is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. For a surface of genus `g` with `b` boundaries (holes), the number of logical qubits is given by the well-established formula `k = 2g + b - 1`, provided `b > 0`.\n3.  **Interpret the problem's surface:** The problem does not specify the overall topology of the surface (e.g., a sphere or a torus).\n    *   **Assumption 1: A closed sphere.** If we assume the holes are punched into a sphere (genus `g=0`), then the number of boundaries is `b = n + m`. The number of logical qubits would be `k = 2(0) + (n+m) - 1 = n+m-1`. The GSD would be `2^(n+m-1)`. This result is not among the answer choices.\n    *   **Assumption 2: An infinite plane.** A very common setup for 2D lattice models like the toric code is an infinite plane. Topologically, an infinite plane is equivalent to a sphere with one hole (a disk). This initial surface thus has genus `g=0` and `b=1`. When we introduce `n` smooth and `m` rough holes, we are adding `n+m` boundaries. The total number of boundaries becomes `b = 1 + n + m`.\n4.  **Calculate `k` and GSD for the plane:** Using the formula from step 2 with `g=0` and `b = 1 + n + m`:\n    `k = 2(0) + (1 + n + m) - 1 = n + m`.\n5.  **Final GSD Formula:** The ground state degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`. This matches answer choice A.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script that takes `n` and `m` as input and calculates the GSD using the derived formula `2^(n+m)`, printing out each part of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a plane\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The degeneracy is given by 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n    For a toric code on an infinite plane (topologically a disk, g=0, 1 boundary)\n    with n smooth and m rough holes punched in it, the total number of boundaries\n    is b = 1 + n + m.\n\n    The number of logical qubits is k = 2g + b - 1 = 2*0 + (1 + n + m) - 1 = n + m.\n    Therefore, GSD = 2^(n+m).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the exponent, which is the number of logical qubits k\n    exponent_k = n + m\n\n    # Calculate the ground space degeneracy\n    degeneracy = 2**exponent_k\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(f\"Given n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes on a plane.\")\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits k = n + m.\")\n    print(f\"So, k = {n} + {m} = {exponent_k}.\")\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting equation: 2^({exponent_k}) = {degeneracy}\")\n\n# Example usage with some values for n and m.\n# You can change these values to test other cases.\nnum_smooth_holes = 3\nnum_rough_holes = 2\n\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(num_smooth_holes, num_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
