    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the mathematical properties of the group in question. The \"semidihedral group of size 512\" is a group of order $2^n$. I'll determine the value of 'n' by solving the equation $2^n = 512$.\n2.  Next, I'll use the definition of a \"power subgroup\". A subgroup H is a power subgroup of G if $H = G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for some integer k.\n3.  I will rely on the established classification of power subgroups for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$. The number of such subgroups depends directly on the parameter 'n'. According to group theory:\n    *   For any odd integer k, the set of k-th powers, $G^k$, is the group $G$ itself. This accounts for one power subgroup.\n    *   For even integers k, the power subgroups are all of the form $\\langle r^{2^i} \\rangle$ where 'r' is a generator of the maximal cyclic subgroup of $SD_{2^n}$ and $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n-1$. This gives $n-1$ distinct cyclic subgroups.\n4.  The total number of power subgroups is therefore $1 + (n-1)$, which simplifies to just 'n'.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that takes the group size (512), calculates 'n', and then prints the total count along with the simple equation that produces it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group has size 2^n. We find n.\n    # n = log2(group_size)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For the semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (with n>=3), the number of power\n    # subgroups is known to be exactly n.\n    # This is because the power subgroups are the group itself, and the (n-1)\n    # cyclic subgroups <r^(2^i)> for i in {1, ..., n-1}.\n    # The total is 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n    num_subgroups = n\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_(2^n), where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups consists of:\")\n    print(\"1.
