    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for several types of controls that are crucial for setting up the instrument correctly and ensuring accurate data analysis and sorting.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one sample of just the streptavidin beads without any fluorophores to measure their natural autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap where the signal from one fluorophore bleeds into another's detector, you need a control for each fluorophore you are using. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-color controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for a sorting experiment where purity is paramount. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel except for one. This helps you see the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the \"empty\" channel. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorophore in your panel, so that's another five controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls(channels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n\n    Args:\n        channels (list): A list of channel names being used in the experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_channels = len(channels)\n\n    # 1.
