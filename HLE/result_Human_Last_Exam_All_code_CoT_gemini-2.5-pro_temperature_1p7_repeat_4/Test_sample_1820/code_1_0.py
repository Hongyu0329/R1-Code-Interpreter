# Define the parameters for ontology O1 based on the problem description.
b = 3  # Branching factor
d = 4  # Depth

# Statement D proposes that the theoretical completeness is bounded by ln(b)/d.
# This formula is derived from an information-theoretic perspective, where ln(b)
# represents the information content at each level of the hierarchy, and d is
# the depth over which this information must be consistently preserved.
# The "mergeable siblings" property introduces ambiguity that limits how much
# of this information can be retained in the mapping to a strict ontology.

# Calculate the value of the completeness bound.
completeness_bound = math.log(b) / d

# Print the calculation steps and the final result.
