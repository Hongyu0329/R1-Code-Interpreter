def solve_cake_cutting_bound():
    """
    Calculates the upper bound for connected envy-free cake cutting for 4 agents.

    This bound is based on the landmark 2016 paper by Haris Aziz and Simon Mackenzie,
    which presented the first discrete and bounded protocol. The total number of
    queries is a result of a complex analysis of the worst-case path in their protocol.

    The total bound can be conceptually broken down into phases:
    1. Initial Division Phase: Establishing an initial allocation and determining agent roles.
    2. Core Envy Reduction Protocol: A series of steps to systematically reduce and eliminate envy.
    3. Final Allocation Phase: Adjustments to ensure the final pieces are connected and envy-free.
