    "This problem asks for a mathematical relationship between the \"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$) and the covolume ($V$) in the context of quadratic number fields defined by squarefree numbers ($N$). Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will clarify the mathematical terms based on the context of algebraic number theory.\n1.  The **squarefree natural number $N$** defines a real quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n2.  The **covolume $V$** refers to the volume of the fundamental parallelotope of the lattice formed by the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$. This covolume is equal to the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, so $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$.\n3.  The term **\"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$)** is not standard. A very common and fundamental result in this area is the Minkowski bound, which provides an upper limit on the norm of an ideal that is guaranteed to exist in every ideal class. I will interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as this Minkowski bound, typically denoted $M_K$.\n\nNext, I will state the relevant theorem and derive the relationship.\n1.  **Minkowski's Theorem** for ideal norms states that every ideal class of a number field $K$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ whose norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ satisfies:\n    $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^s \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$\n    where $n$ is the degree of the field and $2s$ is the number of complex embeddings.\n2.  For a real quadratic field ($K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$), the degree is $n=2$ and there are no complex embeddings, so $s=0$.\n3.  Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n    $M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^0 \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$\n4.  By substituting our interpretations ($k_{k,\\infty} = M_K$ and $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$), we arrive at the direct relationship: $k_{k,\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}V$.\n\nThe Python code below will print this final equation.\n\n```python\n# The problem seeks the relationship between the \"maximum norm\" (k_k,∞) and\n# the covolume (V) for a quadratic field K = Q(sqrt(N)).\n#\n# We interpret k_k,∞ as the Minkowski bound, M_K, which is a fundamental\n# quantity in algebraic number theory. The covolume V is the square root\n# of the field's discriminant, V = sqrt(|d_K|).\n#\n# The formula for the Minkowski bound is:\n# M_K = (4/π)^s * (n! / n^n) * sqrt(|d_K|)\n#\n# For a real quadratic field, the degree n=2 and the number of complex\n# embeddings s=0. Plugging these values in:\n# M_K = (4/π)^0 * (2! / 2^2) * sqrt(|d_K|)\n# M_K = 1 * (2 / 4) * sqrt(|d_K|)\n# M_K = (1/2) * sqrt(|d_K|)\n#\n# Since we defined k_k,∞ = M_K and V = sqrt(|d_K|), the relationship is:\n# k_k,∞ = (1/2) * V\n#\n# The following code prints this final relationship.\n\n# Define the components of the equation as strings and numbers\nvar_k = \"k_{k,∞}\"\nequality_symbol = \"=\"\nfraction_numerator = 1\nfraction_denominator = 2\nvar_V = \"V\"\n\n# Print the final equation as requested, showing each number\nprint(f\"The upper bound relationship is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{var_k} {equality_symbol} ({fraction_numerator}/{fraction_denominator}) * {var_V}\")\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
