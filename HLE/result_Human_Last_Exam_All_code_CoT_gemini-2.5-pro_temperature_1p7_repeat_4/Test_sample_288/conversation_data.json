    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the most recent and complete connectome dataset from Witvliet et al. (2021).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Fetch the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite synapse data from a public repository (`wormwiring.org`).\n2.  Identify the source neurons as the pair ASJL and ASJR.\n3.  Filter the dataset to include only chemical synapses originating from these two neurons, as \"axonal projections\" typically refer to chemical synaptic output.\n4.  Group the results by the target (postsynaptic) cell and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n5.  Identify the target cell that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ pair.\n6.  Finally, print the name of this main target cell and show the breakdown of synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR that contribute to the total.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this analysis:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_main_synaptic_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons in the\n    adult C. elegans hermaphrodite connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL points to the synapse list from the Witvliet et al. 2021 dataset\n    # for the N2U adult hermaphrodite.\n    url = 'http://wormwiring.org/si/N2U_hermaphrodite_synapses.csv'\n\n    try:\n        # Fetch the data from the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an error for a bad response (404, 500, etc.)\n\n        # Read the CSV data from the response text into a pandas DataFrame\n        # The columns are: cell_pre, cell_post, N, type\n        synapse_data = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text))\n\n        # Define the source neurons of interest (ASJ left and right)\n        source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n        # Filter the data for chemical synapses originating from ASJ neurons\n        asj_outputs = synapse_data[\n            (synapse_data['cell_pre'].isin(source_neurons)) &\n            (synapse_data['type'] == 'chemical')\n        ]\n\n        # Group the filtered data by the postsynaptic cell ('cell_post') and\n        # sum the number of synapses ('N') for each target cell.\n        target_synapse_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('cell_post')['N'].sum()\n\n        if target_synapse_counts.empty:\n            print(\"No chemical synapse targets found for ASJ neurons.\")\n            return\n\n        # Find the target cell with the maximum total number of synapses\n        main_target_cell = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n        max_synapses = target_synapse_counts.max()\n\n        # To show the equation, we calculate the contribution from each ASJ neuron\n        synapses_from_asjl = asj_outputs[\n            (asj_outputs['cell_pre'] == 'ASJL') & (asj_outputs['cell_post'] == main_target_cell)\n        ]['N'].sum()\n\n        synapses_from_asjr = asj_outputs[\n            (asj_outputs['cell_pre'] == 'ASJR') & (asj_outputs['cell_post'] == main_target_cell)\n        ]['N'].sum()\n\n\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is {main_target_cell}, which receives a total of {int(max_synapses)} synapses.\")\n        print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n        # Print the final equation with each number\n        print(f\"{int(synapses_from_asjl)} (from ASJL) + {int(synapses_from_asjr)} (from ASJR) = {int(max_synapses)}\")\n\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to fetch data from URL.
