# The task is to find the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors
# from the fifth position in Kitri's Act I variation, as performed by Natalia Osipova.
# This specific choreographic feat is a known part of the variation.

# The sequence is choreographically and musically phrased in two sets.
number_of_sets = 2

# Each set consists of 8 pirouettes.
turns_per_set = 8

# Calculate the total number of pirouettes.
total_pirouettes = number_of_sets * turns_per_set
