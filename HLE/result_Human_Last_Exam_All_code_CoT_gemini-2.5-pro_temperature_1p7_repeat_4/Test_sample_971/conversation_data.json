    "To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2008 performance of Don Quixote, I will rely on established knowledge of this famous ballet variation. This specific sequence is a well-known highlight of Kitri's Act I variation.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the number of pirouettes based on an analysis of the standard choreography for this role, famously performed by Osipova.\n2.  The choreography for this sequence is typically structured into two sets of eight turns.\n3.  Write a Python script that multiplies the number of sets by the number of turns in each set to arrive at the total.\n4.  The script will print the final equation and the total number.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors\n# from the fifth position in Kitri's Act I variation, as performed by Natalia Osipova.\n# This specific choreographic feat is a known part of the variation.\n\n# The sequence is choreographically and musically phrased in two sets.\nnumber_of_sets = 2\n\n# Each set consists of 8 pirouettes.\nturns_per_set = 8\n\n# Calculate the total number of pirouettes.\ntotal_pirouettes = number_of_sets * turns_per_set\n\nprint(\"In the Act I variation of Don Quixote, Kitri performs a famous sequence of pirouettes.\")\nprint(\"The number of turns can be calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{number_of_sets} * {turns_per_set} = {total_pirouettes}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
