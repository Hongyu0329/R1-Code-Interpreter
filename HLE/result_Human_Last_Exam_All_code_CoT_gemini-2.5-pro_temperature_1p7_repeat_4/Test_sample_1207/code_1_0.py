Lesions in the central fibers of the corpus callosum have a characteristic appearance often described as 'snowball' lesions. While leptomeningeal enhancement is more classic for neurosarcoidosis (another differential), it can also be seen in Susac's Syndrome. The presence of 'snowball' hyperintensities makes this a very strong and specific choice.")
