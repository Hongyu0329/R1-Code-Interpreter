    print("- A 'tame functor' is a representation belonging to a category of tame representation type.")
    print("- We interpret 'n-resolvable' to mean that the functor has a finite projective dimension less than or equal to n.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Connecting Tameness and Homology")

    print("\nStep 3: The Key Theorem")
    print("A major result in representation theory states that the incidence algebra of a finite poset is of tame representation type if and only if its 'finitistic dimension' is at most 1.")
    print("The finitistic dimension is the maximum possible projective dimension for any module that has a finite one.")
    print("A finite upper semilattice is a type of finite poset to which this theorem applies.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("This theorem implies that if a functor f over a tame upper semilattice has a finite projective dimension, that dimension must be 0 or 1.")
    print("Therefore, such a functor is 1-resolvable.")
