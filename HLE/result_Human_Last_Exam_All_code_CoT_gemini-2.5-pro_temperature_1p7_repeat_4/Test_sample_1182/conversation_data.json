    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Reduction:** I'll start with the given curve equation, $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$, and the prime $p=2$. I will reduce the coefficients of the polynomial modulo 2 to get the equation of the curve in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n2.  **Find a Stable Model:** The initial reduction will prove to be what's known as a \"bad\" reduction (highly singular). To find the stable reduction, I need to find a better \"model\" for the curve. This is done by a coordinate transformation of the form $(x, y) \\to (p^k x', p^k y')$, which is like zooming into the singularity at the origin. I will determine the correct integer value for `k`. My analysis shows that `k=3` is the right choice.\n3.  **Calculate the Stable Reduction:** I will apply the transformation $(x, y) \\to (8x', 8y')$ to the original equation and simplify it to get the equation for the new model. Then, I will reduce this new equation modulo 2. The resulting curve is the stable reduction.\n4.  **Count the Double Points:** A \"double point\" is a type of singularity. I will check the stable reduction for singularities. For a curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, singularities correspond to the multiple roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. A polynomial has multiple roots if it shares roots with its derivative. I will calculate the derivative of the reduced polynomial and find any common roots. The number of such distinct roots is the number of double points.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The code will perform these calculations and print the final count of double points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 2\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    \n    # Original curve: y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n    original_coeffs = {1: 8, 2: 1, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 8}\n    \n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze and find a transformation ---\n    print(\"The original curve is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\")\n    print(f\"We are looking for the stable reduction above the prime p = {p}.\")\n\n    initial_reduced_terms = []\n    for i, c in original_coeffs.items():\n        if c % p != 0:\n            initial_reduced_terms.append(f\"{c % p}*x**{i}\")\n    \n    print(f\"Initial reduction mod {p}: y^2 = {' + '.join(initial_reduced_terms)} which simplifies to y^2 = x**2.\")\n    print(\"This reduction is highly singular.
