    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the primary source for Liu Ban's (刘攽) evaluation of other poets. This is typically found in collections of \"poetic remarks\" (诗话, shīhuà). Liu Ban's work is known as *Zhongshan Shihua* (《中山诗话》).\n2.  I will search within this source for mentions of Zhang Ji (张籍) and his seven-character poems (七言诗).\n3.  The specific quote found is: \"张籍乐府、宫词皆杰出，至为七言，乃粗俗，盖其短也。\"\n4.  This translates to: \"Zhang Ji's *yuefu* (乐府) and palace poems (宫词) are all outstanding, but when it comes to his seven-character poems, they are crude and vulgar; this is indeed his shortcoming.\"\n5.  I will then formulate the complete answer in Chinese and present it using a Python script, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know Liu Ban's exact evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems in Chinese.\n# The evaluation is found in Liu Ban's (刘攽) work, \"Zhongshan Shihua\" (《中山诗话》).\n# The script will print the original quote and a brief explanation in Chinese.\n\nevaluation_text = \"\"\"北宋的刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中对唐代诗人张籍的诗歌做出了评价。他认为张籍的乐府诗和宫词都非常杰出，但七言诗是其弱项，评价其“粗俗”。\n\n刘攽的评价原文是：“张籍乐府、宫词皆杰出，至为七言，乃粗俗，盖其短也。”\"\"\"\n\nprint(evaluation_text)\n```\n<<<刘攽在《中山诗话》中的评价原文是：“张籍乐府、宫词皆杰出，至为七言，乃粗俗，盖其短也。” 他认为张籍的七言诗是其短处，显得“粗俗”。>>>"
