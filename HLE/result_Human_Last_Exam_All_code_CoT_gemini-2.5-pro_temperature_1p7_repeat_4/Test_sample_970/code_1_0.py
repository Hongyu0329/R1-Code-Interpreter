    This function determines the necessary assumption for the expected information gain
    of a Bayesian agent to approach zero and formats the answer in CNF.

    The key insight is that the sum of all expected information gains over time is
    bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution over models.
    For this sum of non-negative terms to be finite, which implies its terms must
    go to zero, the prior entropy must be finite.

    Therefore, option 'a' is the only necessary assumption from the list.
