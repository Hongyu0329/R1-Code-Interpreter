# The problem is to evaluate the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15
#
# Following the mathematical derivation outlined in the plan:
# 1. By the Riesz Representation Theorem, z(y) = (y, alpha).
# 2. From the problem conditions, (y_i, alpha) = 1 / (i + 1).
# 3. We define an orthonormal basis e_i = y_i / sqrt(2).
# 4. The Fourier coefficients of alpha are (alpha, e_i) = (alpha, y_i / sqrt(2)) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (y_i, alpha) = 1 / (sqrt(2) * (i + 1)).
# 5. By Parseval's identity, ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} |(alpha, e_i)|^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} 1 / (2 * (i + 1)^2).
# 6. This sum evaluates to ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ).
#
# Substituting this back into the original expression:
# Numerator = 2 * ||alpha||^2 = 2 * (1/2) * ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) = (pi^2 / 6) - 1.
# Denominator = (pi^2 / 6) - 1.
#
# The expression simplifies to:
# ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) / ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15 = 1 + 10^15.
#
