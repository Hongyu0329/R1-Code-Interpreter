    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points of the system.\n2.  I will search for a separatrix that can be expressed as a polynomial function of `u`, i.e., `d = f(u)`. If such a curve is an invariant manifold (a trajectory of the system), it must satisfy the differential equations.\n3.  By substituting the polynomial form `d = a*u**2 + b*u + c` into the system's equations, I can derive a set of algebraic equations for the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n4.  I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to perform this substitution and solve for the coefficients.\n5.  The code will find two polynomial invariant manifolds. To identify which one is the separatrix, I will analyze the system's fixed points. The manifold connected to a saddle point is the primary separatrix. My analysis shows that the system has a saddle point at `(u, d) = (1, -1)`.\n6.  The code will then identify which of the found curves passes through this saddle point and print its equation, ensuring that each numerical coefficient is explicitly shown.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the separatrix for the given system of differential equations by searching\n    for an invariant manifold of the form d = a*u**2 + b*u + c.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    t = sp.Symbol('t')\n    u = sp.Function('u')(t)\n    d = sp.Function('d')(t)\n    a, b, c = sp.symbols('a b c')\n\n    # The given system of differential equations\n    u_prime = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    # The original equation for d'(t)\n    d_prime_orig = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3 * (1 - u)\n\n    # Postulate the form of the separatrix: d(t) = a*u(t)^2 + b*u(t) + c\n    d_guess = a*u**2 + b*u + c\n\n    # Calculate the derivative of the guess with respect to t using the chain rule:\n    # d/dt [d_guess] = (d/du [d_guess]) * (du/dt)\n    d_guess_prime = sp.diff(d_guess, u) * u_prime\n    \n    # Substitute the postulated form of d into the original equation for d'(t)\n    d_prime_from_eq = d_prime_orig.subs(d, d_guess)\n\n    # For d_guess to be an invariant manifold, the two expressions for d' must be equal\n    # for all values of u.
