def solve_log_blowup_dimension():
    """
    Calculates the dimension of the log blowup of a log point.

    The problem states:
    P is a point with log structure N^3.
    I is the log ideal generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).

    Our reasoning is as follows:
    1. The log point P with log structure N^3 corresponds to the affine toric variety
       Spec(C[N^3]), which is the 3-dimensional affine space A^3.
    2. The dimension of this initial space, dim(P), is therefore 3.
    3. The log blowup is a birational transformation. A birational transformation
       preserves the dimension of an irreducible variety. Since A^3 is irreducible,
       the dimension of the resulting space will be the same as the original.
    4. Therefore, the dimension of the log blowup of P is 3.

    # The dimension of the space corresponding to the log point P.
    dim_P = 3

    # The dimension of the log blowup is the same as the dimension of the original space.
    dim_blowup = dim_P
    
    print("The dimension of the log point P with log structure N^3 is equal to the dimension of 3-dimensional affine space.")
    print(f"Dimension of P = {dim_P}")
    print("\nA log blowup is a birational map which preserves the dimension of the space.")
    print("Final Equation:")
    print(f"Dimension of the log blowup = Dimension of P = {dim_blowup}")
