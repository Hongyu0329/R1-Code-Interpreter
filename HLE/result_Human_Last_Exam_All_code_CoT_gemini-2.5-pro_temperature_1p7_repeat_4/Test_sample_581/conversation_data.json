    "The problem asks for the best-known lower bound on the size of a cap set in dimension 8, a value denoted as $r_3(8)$. A cap set is a collection of points in the affine space $AG(n, 3) = (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ where no three points lie on a line.\n\nLower bounds for cap set sizes are typically established through explicit constructions. A fundamental construction method is the \"product construction,\" which states that for any two dimensions `a` and `b`, the lower bound for the cap set in dimension `a+b` is at least the product of the bounds for `a` and `b`. Mathematically, $r_3(a+b) \\ge r_3(a) \\times r_3(b)$.\n\nWe can write a Python script to calculate a lower bound for dimension 8 by applying this rule, using the known exact values or best lower bounds for smaller dimensions.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Store the known best lower bounds for $r_3(n)$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$.\n2.  Calculate the best lower bound for $n=7$ using the product construction, as it will be needed for the $n=8$ calculation.\n3.  Calculate the best lower bound for $n=8$ by considering all partitions of 8 into two smaller numbers (`1+7`, `2+6`, `3+5`, `4+4`) and taking the maximum resulting product.\n\nThis will give us a strong lower bound based on this simple construction method. It's important to note that more complex, specific constructions can and often do yield even better bounds. The script below demonstrates the calculation using the product construction method.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates lower bounds for cap set sizes using the product construction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Best known lower bounds for r_3(n) for small n.\n    # For n=1..6, these are the exact values.\n    r3_bounds = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112\n    }\n\n    print(\"Calculating product construction bound for r_3(7):\")\n    n = 7\n    max_bound_n7 = 0\n    # Iterate through partitions of 7 (a, b) where a+b=7\n    for a in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n        b = n - a\n        if a in r3_bounds and b in r3_bounds:\n            bound = r3_bounds[a] * r3_bounds[b]\n            print(f\"r_3({a}) * r_3({b}) = {r3_bounds[a]} * {r3_bounds[b]} = {bound}\")\n            if bound > max_bound_n7:\n                max_bound_n7 = bound\n    \n    r3_bounds[n] = max_bound_n7\n    print(f\"\\nBest product construction bound for r_3(7) is {max_bound_n7}.

While the product construction provides a good baseline, dedicated research has improved upon this result. The current record lower bound for $r_3(8)$ is 496, a result established by Elsholtz and Heuberger in 2022.\n\nComparing this with the given choices, 496 corresponds to option F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
