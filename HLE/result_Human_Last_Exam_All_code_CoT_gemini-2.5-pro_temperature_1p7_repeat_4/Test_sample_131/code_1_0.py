    print("  - Reasoning: This suggests a limitless increase. However, as a learner approaches complete mastery of a finite topic, the number of new, significant gaps would likely decrease. The effect should therefore peak at some point, not increase forever. Choice A is an oversimplification and likely incorrect.")

This advanced framework is what allows them to see many new, subtle, and complex gaps that were previously invisible. This discovery of a multitude of new gaps leads to a peak in interest (the self-stabilizing effect). This statement aligns perfectly with the provided definitions.")
