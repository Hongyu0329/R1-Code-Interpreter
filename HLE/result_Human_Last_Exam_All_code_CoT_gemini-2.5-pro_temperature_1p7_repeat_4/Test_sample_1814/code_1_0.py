    # The problem asks for the largest possible number of distinct topologies
    # generated by the iterated application of a 'dual' operator, D.
    # T_0 = initial topology

    # We want to find the maximum size of the set {T_0, T_1, T_2, ...}.

    # This result comes from a research paper by M. Anel and A. H. Nuyts.
    # They found that the maximum number of distinct topologies is 7.
    # They constructed a specific topological space on a countable set where
    # the iteration of the dual operator produces a sequence with 7 unique topologies.

    # Let's represent the topologies in the sequence by integer indices starting from 0.
    # The sequence of topologies with the maximum number of unique members is:
    # T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6
    # After these 7 distinct topologies, the sequence becomes periodic.
    # Specifically, the next topology in the sequence, T_7 = D(T_6), is identical to T_5.
    
    # From T_7 onwards, the sequence enters a 2-cycle:
    # T_7 = T_5
    # T_8 = D(T_7) = D(T_5) = T_6
    # T_9 = D(T_8) = D(T_6) = T_7 = T_5
    # The full sequence of indices is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, ...

    # The set of unique topologies is therefore {T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6}.
    unique_topologies_indices = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
