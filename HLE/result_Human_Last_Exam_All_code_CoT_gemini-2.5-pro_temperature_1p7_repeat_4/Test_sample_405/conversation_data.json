    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n\nFirst, I will identify the primary, well-established allotropes of phosphorus. These are White, Red, Violet, and Black phosphorus.\nSecond, I will research more recently discovered allotropes, such as Blue phosphorus, which is a 2D material that has been synthesized.\nThird, I will compile a list of the distinct colors associated with each of these pure allotropes.\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores these colors, displays them, and calculates the total count. The script will present this calculation as a simple addition equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary colors of well-established phosphorus allotropes\n    # - White Phosphorus is a white/colorless waxy solid when pure.\n    # - Red Phosphorus is an amorphous polymer with a red color.\n    # - Violet (or Hittorf's) Phosphorus has a deep violet crystalline structure.\n    # - Black Phosphorus is the most stable form and is black with a metallic sheen.\n    # - Blue Phosphorus is a more recently synthesized 2D allotrope.\n    colors = [\n        \"White\",\n        \"Red\",\n        \"Violet\",\n        \"Black\",\n        \"Blue\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    total_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    # Constructing the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for color in colors]\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of colors:\")\n    print(f\"1 (White) + 1 (Red) + 1 (Violet) + 1 (Black) + 1 (Blue) = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n<<<5>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
