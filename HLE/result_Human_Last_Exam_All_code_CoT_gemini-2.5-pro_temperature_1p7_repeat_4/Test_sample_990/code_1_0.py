# Define the numerical factor from the given height H = 350g.
H_factor = 350

# From the physical derivation, the constant acceleration of the raindrop is a = g/7.
# We only need the numerical denominator.
a_denominator = 7

# The equation for the time of fall 't' is derived from kinematics: H = (1/2) * a * t^2
# t = sqrt(2 * H / a)
# Substituting H = 350g and a = g/7:
# t = sqrt(2 * (350 * g) / (g / 7))
# The 'g' terms cancel out:
# t = sqrt(2 * 350 * 7)

# Calculate the value under the square root
t_squared = 2 * H_factor * a_denominator

# Calculate the final time
time = math.sqrt(t_squared)

# As requested, here is the final equation with all the numbers.
# Although the densities œÅ and Rho are part of the initial problem, they cancel
# out when deriving the acceleration, so they do not appear in the final calculation.
# The term 'g' also cancels out.
