    "No, structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides. They are two distinct classes of biological macromolecules with fundamentally different structures.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key structural differences:\n\n1.  **Monomers (Building Blocks):**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers made from **monosaccharide** monomers. A monosaccharide is a simple sugar, like glucose. Its structure is primarily a ring of carbon and oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers made from **nucleotide** monomers. A nucleotide is a more complex molecule composed of three distinct parts: a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n\n2.  **Backbone and Linkages:**\n    *   In **polysaccharides**, the monosaccharide units are linked together by **glycosidic bonds**. This forms a backbone that consists of a repeating chain of sugar molecules (sugar-sugar-sugar).\n    *   In **polynucleotides**, the nucleotide units are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**. This bond connects the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of the next, creating a characteristic **sugar-phosphate backbone**.\n\n3.  **Elemental Composition:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are typically composed of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C, H, O).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** always contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, **nitrogen** (in the bases), and **phosphorus** (in the phosphate backbone).\n\nBecause of these fundamental differences in their building blocks, the way those blocks are connected, and their overall elemental composition, polynucleotides and polysaccharides have vastly different chemical properties and biological functions.\n\n<<<No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ in their monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds linking them (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds), and their elemental composition.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides? or, to be more clear: Are homopolynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
