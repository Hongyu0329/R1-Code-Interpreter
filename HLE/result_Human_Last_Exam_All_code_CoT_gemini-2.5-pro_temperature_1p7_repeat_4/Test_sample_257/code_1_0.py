    print("A GTO player's strategy is perfectly balanced. Their actions (call, fold, raise) correspond to a balanced range of hands, not a specific hand strength. The 'information' you receive from a GTO opponent is not exploitable because you cannot determine if their call represents a medium-strength hand or a strong draw, or if their raise is for value or a bluff. Betting simply to 'gain info' is futile against an unexploitable opponent.")

    print("A GTO player is indifferent to revealing their hand. In fact, a balanced strategy requires that bluffs are shown down at a certain frequency when called to prevent the opponent from over-folding. The decision to bet is based purely on maximizing Expected Value (EV), not on an emotional desire to hide one's cards or strategy.")
