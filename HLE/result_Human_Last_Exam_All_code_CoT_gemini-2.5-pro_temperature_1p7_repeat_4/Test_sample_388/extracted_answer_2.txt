I see you are picking up your prescription for Fluoxetine 20mg. It is important to know that taking this medication with an NSAID like Aspirin (which is found in the Excedrin you took) significantly increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product that only contains Acetaminophen (like Tylenol) instead of Excedrin or other NSAIDs like Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin). Please speak with your doctor or the pharmacist if you have any more questions about managing your pain safely.
