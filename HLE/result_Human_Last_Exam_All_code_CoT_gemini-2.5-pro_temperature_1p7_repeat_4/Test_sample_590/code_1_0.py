    This function calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Decompose the operator L by modes `k` of the spherical harmonics.
    2. Analyze the potential V_k for each mode.
    3. Count the number of positive eigenvalues for each mode `k`.
    4. Sum the counts to get the total number.
