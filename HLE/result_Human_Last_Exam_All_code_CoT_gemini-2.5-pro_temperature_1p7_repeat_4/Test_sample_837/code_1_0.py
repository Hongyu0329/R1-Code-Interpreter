        # Algorithm A
        print("yes")
        ```
    *   **Case 2: The true answer is "no."** In this reality, the following algorithm would be a valid decider for the problem. It also takes no input, halts, and gives the correct answer.
        ```python
        # Algorithm B
        print("no")
        ```
    *   **Conclusion:** In any possible state of reality, one of these two trivial algorithms (`Algorithm A` or `Algorithm B`) is the correct one. The definition of decidability requires only that such a correct, halting algorithm *exists*, not that we *know* which one it is. Since we can prove that one of two simple, halting algorithms is guaranteed to be the correct one, the problem is, by formal definition, decidable.

5.  **Plan for the Python Code:** The code will not attempt to answer the question itself. Instead, it will implement the logical explanation above, demonstrating why the problem is considered decidable from a computer science standpoint. It will print the step-by-step reasoning for the user.
