    "To develop an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we will use an asymptotic approximation method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral is given by $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. We are interested in its behavior for very small, positive values of $\\epsilon$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Dominant Region:** Let the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + f(x)$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For $x \\ge 0$, the function $f(x)$ is non-negative and is zero only at $x=0$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the denominator becomes very small near $x=0$, causing the integrand to become very large. This means the primary contribution to the integral's value comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Denominator:** For small values of $x$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. In this case, $f(x) \\approx 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n\n4.  **Approximate the Integral:** We can now approximate the integral by replacing $f(x)$ with its small-$x$ approximation. We also extend the upper integration limit from 15.00 to infinity. This is a valid simplification because for small $\\epsilon$, the integrand becomes negligible long before $x$ reaches 15.00, so the contribution from large $x$ values is insignificant.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n5.  **Solve the Approximated Integral:** This integral has a standard analytical solution. For a general integral of the form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + cx^p} dx$, the solution is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{p c^{1/p} \\sin(\\pi/p)} \\epsilon^{\\frac{1}{p}-1}$. This results in a formula of the type $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^a$.\n\n6.  **Calculate Constants:** We will use a Python script to compute the specific values of the coefficient $C$ and the exponent $a$ for our case where $c=9.0$ and $p=5.0$. The script will then print the final analytical formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the resulting formula:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon)\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the dominant term in the denominator, 9.0 * x^5.0\n    c = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n    \n    # The analytical approximation has the form I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^a.\n    # We calculate the exponent 'a' and the coefficient 'C' based on the general formula.\n    # a = (1/p) - 1\n    # C = (pi / (p * sin(pi/p))) * c^(-1/p)\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent 'a'\n    a = (1.0 / p) - 1.0\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient 'C'\n    # The calculation is split into parts for clarity.\n    c_inv_p = c**(-1.0/p)\n    sine_term = math.sin(math.pi / p)\n    \n    C = (math.pi / (p * sine_term)) * c_inv_p\n    \n    print(\"The analytical formula for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^a\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the integral, the parameters of the dominant term (c * x^p) are:\")\n    print(f\"c = {c}\")\n    print(f\"p = {p}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated values for the constants in the formula are:\")\n    print(f\"Exponent a = {a}\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient C = {C}\")\n    print(\"\\nThus, the final approximate analytical formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = {C} * epsilon^({a})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0.6888283802951733>>>"
