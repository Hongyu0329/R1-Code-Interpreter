    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (or basis functions) for each atom in toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set, and then sum them all up.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions for a Carbon (C) atom with the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** The '6' indicates that the core orbitals are described by a single contracted function. For carbon, this is the 1s orbital, so it gets **1** basis function.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The '31' indicates a split-valence shell. This means each valence orbital is described by two basis functions (an inner one and an outer one).\n        *   For the 2s orbital: **2** basis functions.\n        *   For the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz): Each of the three p-orbitals gets 2 basis functions, so 3 * 2 = **6** basis functions.\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9** basis functions.\n3.  **Determine the number of basis functions for a Hydrogen (H) atom with the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is its valence orbital.\n    *   The '31' split applies directly to the 1s orbital, giving it **2** basis functions.\n4.  **Calculate the total for the molecule:**\n    *   Sum the functions from all atoms: (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom).\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 (core 1s) + 2 (valence 2s) + 2*3 (valence 2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_C = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 2 (split-valence 1s)\nfuncs_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_C = num_C * funcs_per_C\ntotal_H = num_H * funcs_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the entire molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_C + total_H\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_C}H{num_H})\")\nprint(f\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon (C) atom: {funcs_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen (H) atom: {funcs_per_H}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Total = (Atoms of C * Functions per C) + (Atoms of H * Functions per H)\")\n# The final equation with each number and the final result\nprint(f\"({num_C} * {funcs_per_C}) + ({num_H} * {funcs_per_H}) = {total_C} + {total_H} = {total_funcs}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
