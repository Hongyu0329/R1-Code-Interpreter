# The Lojban word "rusybavlamdei" is a compound word (lujvo).
# Let's break it down into its component root words (gismu) from their short forms (rafsi):
# - "rusy" is from "grusi" (x1 is gray).
# - "bav" is from "bapli" (x1 is in the future of x2 by standard x3).
# - "lam" is from "mlana" (x1 is adjacent to x2).
# - "dei" is from "detri" (x1 is the date of event x2 by calendar standard x3).

# In a lujvo, the last component is the head word, defining the core concept.
# The preceding components are modifiers.
# Head word: "detri" (a day/date).
# Modifiers: "grusi", "bapli", "mlana".
# So, "rusybavlamdei" is a type of "detri" (day) that is gray, in the future, and adjacent to something.

# The question asks for the interpretation of the second (x2) and third (x3) arguments.
# A Lojban lujvo's arguments (place structure) are typically inherited from its head word.
# The modifiers describe the x1 place, but don't usually add their own arguments to the list by default.
# Therefore, we look at the place structure of "detri":
# detri: x1 is the date [of event/process] x2, according to [calendar standard] x3.

# Let's map this to the question:
# The first argument (x1) is the "rusybavlamdei" itself.
# The second argument (x2) is the event/process of which x1 is the date.
# The third argument (x3) is the calendar or day standard.

# Now let's evaluate the answer choices based on this understanding.
# We are looking for an option where x2 is an event and x3 is a day standard.

# A. x2 is adjacent/beside/next to/in contact with x3 -> Incorrect. This uses the arguments of the modifier 'mlana'.
# B. x2 and x3 both refer to something that is gray in color -> Incorrect. The grayness applies to x1.
# C. x2 and x3 both refer to a day that is metaphorically 'gray' -> Incorrect.
# D. x2 is adjacent/beside/next to/in contact with property/sequence x3 -> Incorrect. Uses 'mlana' arguments.
# E. x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard' -> This is the best fit.
#    - 'x3 is the "day standard"' is a perfect match for the x3 of "detri".
#    - 'x2 is the number of full days...' is a slightly awkward but plausible description for the x2 of "detri" (the event/period of which x1 is the date).
# F. x2 refers to something that is gray in color; x3 refers to something that is in the future of x4 -> Incorrect.
# G. x2 is the day preceding x1; x3 is the 'day standard' -> x3 is correct, but the description of x2 is wrong.
# H. x2 refers to something that is in the future of x3 -> Incorrect. This uses the arguments of the modifier 'bapli'.
# I. x2 refers to something that is in the future (of now); x3 refers to something that is adjacent/beside/next to/in contact with x4 -> Incorrect. Uses modifier arguments.

# Conclusion: Choice E is the most likely interpretation, as it correctly assigns the arguments based on the head word "detri".

print(f"The word 'rusybavlamdei' is a 'lujvo' (compound word) in Lojban.")
print(f"Its components are 'rusy' (gray), 'bav' (future), 'lam' (adjacent), and 'dei' (day/date).")
