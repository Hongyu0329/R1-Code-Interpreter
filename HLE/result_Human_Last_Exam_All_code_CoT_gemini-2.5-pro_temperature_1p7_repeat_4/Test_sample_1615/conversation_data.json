    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We are given a graph $G$ with $n = 12345$ vertices. We know two things about this graph: it is not a complete graph, and we are interested in the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. The question is asking for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** For any graph on $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, with $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$). Since we are told that $G$ is *not* a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Because they are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. This simple fact guarantees that we can always color a non-complete graph with $n-1$ or fewer colors. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is at most $n-1$.\n\n3.  **Show the Bound is Achievable:** To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to show that there exists at least one non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Consider the graph formed by taking the complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge. Let's call this graph $G' = K_n - e$.\n    *   This graph $G'$ is not complete by definition.\n    *   In $G'$, there is a subgraph of $n-1$ vertices that are all mutually connected (a clique of size $n-1$). A clique of size $k$ always requires $k$ distinct colors. Therefore, $G'$ requires at least $n-1$ colors.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** We've shown that any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors, and that there exists such a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** For the given graph with $n=12345$ vertices, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G\nn = 12345\n\n# For any graph G with n vertices that is not a complete graph, the chromatic number chi(G)\n# is at most n-1. This is because a non-complete graph must have at least one pair of\n# non-adjacent vertices, which can be assigned the same color.\n#\n# To show that this maximum is achievable, consider a graph G' which is a complete graph K_n\n# with one edge removed. This graph is not complete, but it contains a clique of size n-1.\n# A clique of size n-1 requires n-1 colors.\n#\n# Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of a non-complete\n# graph with n vertices is n-1.\n\n# Calculate the result\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The maximum number of colors required for a non-complete graph with n vertices is n - 1.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
