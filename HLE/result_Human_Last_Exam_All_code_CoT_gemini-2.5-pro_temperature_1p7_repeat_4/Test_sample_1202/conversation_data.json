    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core of the question, which is about the mechanisms that allow two copies of a duplicated gene to be kept in the genome (`retention`) and to evolve different sequences (`divergence`).\n\nSecond, I will evaluate each of the five options provided:\n*   **Gene conversion:** I'll assess if this process leads to divergence or its opposite, homogenization.\n*   **Pseudogenization:** I'll determine if this qualifies as a mechanism for *retention* of two functional genes.\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** I'll check if this model explains both the retention and divergence of the gene pair.\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** I'll also check if this model accounts for both retention and divergence.\n*   **Adaptive radiation:** I'll consider if this process operates at the correct biological level (molecular vs. species).\n\nThird, I will compare the valid mechanisms. Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are recognized models for the preservation of duplicate genes. I will reason which of these is considered \"most likely,\" which often relates to the probability of the underlying mutational events. Subfunctionalization relies on the loss of specific sub-functions, a degenerative process which is generally more common than the evolution of a completely new beneficial function (Neofunctionalization).\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that codifies this analysis. The script will define each term, evaluate it against the criteria from the question, and print a step-by-step logical breakdown that leads to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A process that homogenizes gene copies, making them more similar.
