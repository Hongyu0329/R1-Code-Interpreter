    "To find the correct answer, we need to identify the set of crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and exhibit **optical activity**. Let's break down these three conditions based on crystal symmetry.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. A crystal can be optically active if it is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion, `-1`). However, there are two non-centrosymmetric classes, `-6` and `-6m2`, which are known exceptions and are not optically active.\n2.  **Achiral**: A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must contain a roto-inversion operation (e.g., a mirror plane `m` or a center of inversion `-1`). The question asks for achiral classes, so we must exclude the 11 purely rotational (chiral) classes.\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This means we must exclude the 10 polar crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm).\n\nThe task is to find the classes that meet all three conditions. The following Python script will define these properties for all relevant classes, filter them according to the criteria, and determine the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef find_optically_active_achiral_nonpolar_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes crystal classes to find those that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define properties for relevant crystal classes.\n    # Properties dictionary: {'chiral': bool, 'polar': bool, 'optically_active': bool}\n    crystal_properties = {\n        # Achiral & Non-polar classes\n        '-4':   {'chiral': False, 'polar': False, 'optically_active': True},\n        '-42m': {'chiral': False, 'polar': False, 'optically_active': True},\n        '-43m': {'chiral': False, 'polar': False, 'optically_active': True},\n        '-6':   {'chiral': False, 'polar': False, 'optically_active': False},\n        '-6m2': {'chiral': False, 'polar': False, 'optically_active': False},\n\n        # Achiral & Polar classes\n        'm':    {'chiral': False, 'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        'mm2':  {'chiral': False, 'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '3m':   {'chiral': False, 'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '4mm':  {'chiral': False, 'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '6mm':  {'chiral': False, 'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n\n        # Chiral classes (all are optically active)\n        '1':    {'chiral': True,  'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '2':    {'chiral': True,  'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '3':    {'chiral': True,  'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '4':    {'chiral': True,  'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n        '6':    {'chiral': True,  'polar': True,  'optically_active': True},\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the selection criteria.\n    print(\"Finding crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\")\n    print(\"1.
