# The problem asks for the constant b in the asymptotic formula C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2),
# where C(n) is the expected cover-and-return time for a random walk on a random tree.
# Based on established results in probability theory, the constant b is given by
# the expression 3 * sqrt(pi / 8). This script calculates the numerical value of b.

# Define the numbers in the final equation
numerator_multiplier = 3
denominator_inside_sqrt = 8
pi_value = math.pi

# Calculate the value of b
b = numerator_multiplier * math.sqrt(pi_value / denominator_inside_sqrt)

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation, the equation itself, and the result.
