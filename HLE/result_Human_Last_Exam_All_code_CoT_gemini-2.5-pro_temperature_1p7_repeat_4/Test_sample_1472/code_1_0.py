    print("  - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)")

    print("  - The ligand is bidentate, coordinating through its two sulfur atoms.\n")
    
    print("Step 2: Determine the coordination number and geometry.")
    print("  - With two bidentate ligands, the coordination number of Copper is 4.")
    print("  - The two common geometries for CN=4 are tetrahedral and square planar.")
    print("  - Sulfur is a soft donor. Copper(I) is a soft metal ion, while Copper(II) is harder.")
    print("  - HSAB theory predicts the more stable complex will be with soft Cu(I).")
    print("  - Cu(I) is a d10 ion, which strongly prefers a tetrahedral geometry.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Identify symmetry elements for the tetrahedral [Cu(ligand)2]+ complex.")
    print("  - The molecule consists of two identical chelate ligands arranged around the central Cu atom.")
    print("  - E: The identity element is always present.")
    print("  - Cn: There is a C2 rotation axis that passes through the copper atom and interchanges the two ligands.")
    print("  - Higher symmetry (like in Td or D2) is broken by the low symmetry of the puckered chelate rings and methyl groups.")
    print("  - Ïƒ (Mirror Planes) / i (Inversion Center): The molecule is chiral, meaning it lacks an inversion center and any mirror planes.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: Conclude the point group.")
    print("  - The molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single C2 axis.")
