# The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his work
# on the kinetic theory of heat, specifically relating to the 1905 Brownian motion paper.

# While the 1905 paper itself is famously sparse on citations, Einstein's
# earlier foundational papers on statistical mechanics (1902-1904) did cite a key
# text whose title translates to "Lectures on Gas Theory".

cited_author_name = "Ludwig Boltzmann"

# The specific work was Boltzmann's "Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie"
# ("Lectures on Gas Theory"), which was foundational to the kinetic theory
# of heat that underpins the Brownian motion paper.
