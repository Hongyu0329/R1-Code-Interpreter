    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question**: The user is asking a specific historical question: \"Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\"\n2.  **Initial Research**: I'll access my knowledge base regarding Einstein's 1905 \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. The paper on Brownian motion (\"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\") is known for its originality and, importantly, its lack of citations to other contemporary physicists working on similar problems, like Gibbs or even Boltzmann's most relevant work.\n3.  **Address the \"Lectures\" Specificity**: The word \"lectures\" is very specific. I will look for citations to works with \"Lectures\" (or \"Vorlesungen\" in German) in the title.\n4.  **Synthesize Findings**: While the 1905 Brownian motion paper itself famously lacks direct citations, Einstein's immediately preceding papers on the foundations of statistical mechanics (from 1902-1904), which laid the groundwork for his 1905 paper, *do* cite a major work. This work is Ludwig Boltzmann's seminal book, \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\").\n5.  **Formulate the Answer**: Given the context and the specific mention of \"lectures,\" the most accurate and relevant answer is Ludwig Boltzmann. The intellectual debt is clear, and the citation exists in the work immediately leading up to the 1905 paper.\n6.  **Construct the Code Block**: The prompt requires the answer to be presented within a Python code block. I will create a simple script that assigns the answer to a variable and prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his work\n# on the kinetic theory of heat, specifically relating to the 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n\n# While the 1905 paper itself is famously sparse on citations, Einstein's\n# earlier foundational papers on statistical mechanics (1902-1904) did cite a key\n# text whose title translates to \"Lectures on Gas Theory\".\n\ncited_author_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n# The specific work was Boltzmann's \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"\n# (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"), which was foundational to the kinetic theory\n# of heat that underpins the Brownian motion paper.\n\nprint(\"Albert Einstein cited the published lectures of the following physicist in his early papers on statistical mechanics, which were foundational to his 1905 paper on Brownian motion:\")\nprint(cited_author_name)\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
