# Plan:
# 1. Define the 7 intervals for the ascending Maqam Zanjaran.
# 2. Define the 4 intervals for the descending modified scale.
# 3. Combine the intervals and format the output.

# --- Step 1: Ascending Intervals (Maqam Zanjaran) ---
# Maqam Zanjaran is built with Jins Hijaz on the tonic (C) and Jins Hijaz on the 4th degree (F).
# Jins Hijaz has intervals: 0.5 (semitone), 1.5 (augmented second), 0.5 (semitone).
# The scale notes and intervals are derived as follows:
# C -> Db (0.5), Db -> E (1.5), E -> F (0.5)  (This is Jins Hijaz on C)
# F -> Gb (0.5), Gb -> A (1.5), A -> Bb (0.5)  (This is Jins Hijaz on F)
# The final interval links to the octave: Bb -> C' (1.0, whole tone).
# This gives us 7 ascending intervals.
ascending_intervals = [0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 1.0]

# --- Step 2: Descending Intervals (Modified Scale) ---
# The musician descends from note 8 to note 4.
# The scale is modified with Jins Nahawand on the 4th degree (F).
# Jins Nahawand has intervals: 1.0 (whole tone), 0.5 (semitone), 1.0 (whole tone).
# The modified scale notes for the upper register are built from F:
# F -> G (1.0), G -> Ab (0.5), Ab -> Bb (1.0). The octave C' is a whole tone (1.0) above Bb.
# The descent path is: C'(8) -> Bb(7) -> Ab(6) -> G(5) -> F(4).
# We calculate the size of these 4 descending intervals:
# Interval 8: C' -> Bb (size 1.0)
# Interval 9: Bb -> Ab (size 1.0)
# Interval 10: Ab -> G (size 0.5)
# Interval 11: G -> F (size 1.0)
descending_intervals = [1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0]

# --- Step 3: Combine and Format ---
# The full performance consists of the ascending intervals followed by the descending ones.
all_intervals = ascending_intervals + descending_intervals

# Convert each interval number to a string to format the final output.
# The requested format is {n1,n2,n3,...}
interval_strings = [str(interval) for interval in all_intervals]
formatted_output = "{" + ",".join(interval_strings) + "}"

# Print the final formatted string.
print("The sequence of 11 intervals is:")
print(formatted_output)

# Return the answer in the specified format for validation.
final_answer = formatted_output
# The user wants the raw answer in the <<<>>> format at the end.
# I will create a new variable for this to avoid printing it twice.
answer_for_validation = "<<<" + formatted_output + ">>>"
