    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of the target space for the specified supersymmetric sigma-model. Here is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Space:** For symmetry class D, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the supermanifold quotient `M = G/H`, where the supergroup `G = OSp(4N|4N)` and the subgroup `H = OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N)`. `N` is the number of replicas, given as `N=2`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Dimension Calculation:** The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this target space, `dim_bos(M)`. This dimension is calculated as `dim_bos(M) = dim_bos(G) - dim_bos(H)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Bosonic Dimension of the Supergroups:** The bosonic part of the Lie supergroup `OSp(2p|2q)` is the Lie group `SO(2p) x Sp(2q)`. The dimension is the sum of the dimensions of its factors:\n    *   `dim(SO(k)) = k(k-1)/2`\n    *   `dim(Sp(2k)) = k(2k+1)`\n    *   Therefore, `dim_bos(OSp(2p|2q)) = dim(SO(2p)) + dim(Sp(2q)) = p(2p-1) + q(2q+1)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dimensions for N=2:**\n    *   For the numerator group `G = OSp(4N|4N) = OSp(8|8)`, we have `p=4` and `q=4`.\n    *   For the denominator subgroup `H`, we first find the dimension of one factor `OSp(2N|2N) = OSp(4|4)`, where `p=2` and `q=2`. The total dimension for `H` is twice this value.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:** Subtract the bosonic dimension of `H` from the bosonic dimension of `G`. The Python code below will implement these steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model of symmetry class D with two replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    N = 2\n    print(f\"The number of replicas is N = {N}.\")\n\n    # The target space is M = G/H = OSp(4N|4N) / (OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N))\n    # The number of bosonic variables is dim_bos(G) - dim_bos(H)\n\n    # Formula for bosonic dimension of OSp(2p|2q) is p*(2*p - 1) + q*(2*q + 1)\n    \n    # 1.
