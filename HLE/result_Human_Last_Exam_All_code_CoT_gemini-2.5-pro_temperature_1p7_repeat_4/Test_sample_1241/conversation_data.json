    "To find the stationary probabilities $P_{i}(+\\infty)$, we analyze the system in the steady state, where the probabilities are constant, and their time derivatives are zero ($P_{i}'(t) = 0$). This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nA small correction is assumed for the equation of $P_{1}'(t)$. In the standard Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, the term for inflow from state 0 to state 1, $\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, should have a positive sign. We will proceed with the corrected equation: $P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Set the time derivatives in all equations to zero to get the steady-state equations.\n2.  Use these equations to express $P_{0}$, $P_{2}$, and $P_{3}$ in terms of $P_{1}$.\n3.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization condition $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$.\n4.  Solve for the value of $P_{1}$.\n5.  Calculate the value of $P_{0}$.\n6.  Compute the required sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to solve for the probabilities and find their sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# In the steady state (t -> +inf), P_i'(t) = 0. Let P_i = P_i(+inf).\n# The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear equations:\n# 1) 0 = -lambda_01 * P0 + lambda_10 * P1\n# 2) 0 = lambda_01 * P0 - (lambda_10 + lambda_12) * P1 + lambda_21 * P2 + lambda_31 * P3\n# 3) 0 = lambda_12 * P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23) * P2\n# 4) 0 = lambda_23 * P2 - lambda_31 * P3\n# 5) P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1 (Normalization condition)\n\n# From equation (1), we can express P0 in terms of P1:\n# P0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * P1\nc0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# From equation (3), we can express P2 in terms of P1:\n# P2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * P1\nc2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n# From equation (4), we can express P3 in terms of P2:\n# P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * P2\n# Substituting the expression for P2:\n# P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * c2 * P1\nc3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * c2\n\n# Now substitute these into the normalization equation (5):\n# c0*P1 + P1 + c2*P1 + c3*P1 = 1\n# P1 * (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3) = 1\nP1 = 1 / (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3)\n\n# Now calculate P0 using the derived relation\nP0 = c0 * P1\n\n# The problem asks for the sum P0 + P1\nsum_P0_P1 = P0 + P1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"The stationary probabilities are calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"P0(inf) = {P0}\")\nprint(f\"P1(inf) = {P1}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final sum is P0(inf) + P1(inf):\")\nprint(f\"{P0} + {P1} = {sum_P0_P1}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
