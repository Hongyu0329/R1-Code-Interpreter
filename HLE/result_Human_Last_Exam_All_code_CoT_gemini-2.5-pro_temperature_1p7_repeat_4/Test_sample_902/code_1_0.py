    print("The answer is definitively No. The function as described is uncomputable.")
    print("Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n")

    print("--- 1. Defining the Task ---")
    print(f"The function `def_superfast({n})` is defined by the following steps:")
    print(f"  a. Consider all possible Python programs with a source code length of less than {n} characters.")
    print(  "  b. Identify which of these programs halt (do not run forever) and return an integer.")
    print(  "  c. Find the single largest integer among all their return values. This is 'Huge_int'.")
    print(  "  d. The function should return a value of Huge_int + 1.\n")

    print("--- 2. The Halting Problem Roadblock ---")
    print("Step (b) requires our hypothetical program `P` to solve the Halting Problem.")
    print("The Halting Problem is the challenge of determining, for an arbitrary program and its input, whether it will finish running or continue to run forever.")
    print("Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the Halting Problem for all possible programs is impossible.")
    print("Since `P` would need to do this for every program shorter than 10000 characters, and this is impossible, `P` cannot exist.\n")
    
    print("--- 3. The Self-Referential Paradox ---")
    print("Even if we could somehow solve the Halting Problem, the function's definition creates a logical paradox.")
    print("Let's assume for the sake of argument that a program `P` that computes `def_superfast(10000)` does exist.")
    print("\n  - Let's call the number that `P` outputs 'K'.")
    print("  - By the function's definition, K = Huge_int + 1.\n")

    print("Now, consider the program `P` itself:")
    print("  - `P` is a Python program that returns an integer (K).")
    print(f"  - It is entirely plausible that the source code for `P` can be written in fewer than {n} characters. 10000 characters is a significant amount of code.")
    
    print("\nIf `P`'s source code is less than 10000 characters long:")
    print("  - Then `P` itself is one of the programs in the set used to define `Huge_int`.")
    print("  - This means the number `K` that `P` outputs cannot be larger than the maximum of all outputs.")
    print("  - Therefore, it must be true that K <= Huge_int.\n")

    print("--- 4. The Final Contradiction ---")
    print("Our assumption that `P` exists has led us to two contradictory conclusions:")
    print("  1. From the function's definition: K = Huge_int + 1")
    print("  2. From analyzing `P` itself:    K <= Huge_int")
    
    print("\nThis implies the following impossible mathematical statement:")
    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation.
    # Huge_int is symbolic, but '1' is a concrete number.
    huge_int_plus_one_str = "Huge_int + 1"
    huge_int_str = "Huge_int"
    print(f"Final Equation: {huge_int_plus_one_str} <= {huge_int_str}")

    print("\nAn integer plus 1 can never be less than or equal to itself. This is a logical contradiction.")
    print("Because the initial assumption (that program `P` exists) leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false.")
    print("Therefore, no program can compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")
