    "I will answer your question by providing a Python script that stores the information and prints it. The information itself is based on paleontological research, specifically the detailed 2002 description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull by Sues et al. The lacrimal recess is an excavation on the lacrimal bone, and the number of depressions (or foramina) within it is a specific anatomical detail noted in this research.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1. Create a variable in Python to hold the number of depressions.\n2. Use a `print` function to output a sentence that clearly states this number.\n\n```python\ndef get_irritator_lacrimal_depressions():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n\n  This information is based on the scientific paper:\n  Sues, H. D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002).\n  Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the\n  Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 22(3), 535-547.\n\n  The paper notes two prominent foramina (depressions) within the lacrimal recess.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # The number of prominent depressions found in the lacrimal recess.\n  number_of_depressions = 2\n\n  print(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} prominent depressions.\")\n\nget_irritator_lacrimal_depressions()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
