    "Here is my plan to solve this question:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle:** I'll first break down the user's question. The question asks for a musical note corresponding to a specific range on Newton's color circle. This range is defined by two points: the color made by mixing yellow and blue, and the color blue itself.\n2.  **Color Mixing:** The combination of yellow and blue light or pigment produces the color green. So, the range is between green and blue.\n3.  **Newton's Mapping:** I need to recall or look up Sir Isaac Newton's specific mapping of the color spectrum to the musical scale. Newton, in his book \"Opticks,\" associated the seven colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) with the seven notes of a musical scale. The most historically cited mapping corresponds to the Dorian mode, starting on the note D.\n    *   Red -> D\n    *   Orange -> E\n    *   Yellow -> F\n    *   Green -> G\n    *   Blue -> A\n    *   Indigo -> B\n    *   Violet -> C\n4.  **Identify the Notes:**\n    *   The first color, green, corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n    *   The second color, blue, corresponds to the musical note **A**.\n5.  **Interpret the \"Range\":** The question asks for the note corresponding to \"the range between\" green and blue. In Newton's system, each color represents a segment of the circle, and each note is assigned to a segment. The segment for the color green is represented by the note G. Therefore, the note that represents the start of the specified range (the \"green\" part) is G.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that uses `print` statements to walk through this logical deduction step-by-step and then state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by logically mapping Newton's color circle to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstructing the question.\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the musical note for the range between two colors.\")\n    print(\"   - Color A is the combination of yellow and blue.\")\n    print(\"   - Color B is blue itself.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the colors.\")\n    color_a = \"Green\"\n    color_b = \"Blue\"\n    print(f\"Combining yellow and blue produces the color '{color_a}'.\")\n    print(f\"The range is therefore between '{color_a}' and '{color_b}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Recalling Newton's color and music mapping.\")\n    print(\"Isaac Newton, in 'Opticks', associated the 7 spectrum colors with notes from a Dorian musical scale starting on D.\")\n    newton_mapping = {\n        'Red': 'D',\n        'Orange': 'E',\n        'Yellow': 'F',\n        'Green': 'G',\n        'Blue': 'A',\n        'Indigo': 'B',\n        'Violet': 'C'\n    }\n    print(\"The mapping is as follows:\")\n    for color, note in newton_mapping.items():\n        print(f\"   - {color} -> Note {note}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Finding the note for the specified range.\")\n    note_for_green = newton_mapping[color_a]\n    note_for_blue = newton_mapping[color_b]\n\n    # In Newton's system, each color/note represents a segment or division of the circle.\n    # The question asks for the note for the range \"between\" Green and Blue.\n    # This range starts with the segment for Green.\n    final_note = note_for_green\n    \n    print(f\"The color '{color_a}' corresponds to the note '{note_for_green}'.\")\n    print(f\"The color '{color_b}' corresponds to the note '{note_for_blue}'.\")\n    print(\"The 'range between Green and Blue' on Newton's circle begins with the segment assigned to Green.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the musical note for this range is the note corresponding to Green.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    # The \"equation\" is the logical deduction.
