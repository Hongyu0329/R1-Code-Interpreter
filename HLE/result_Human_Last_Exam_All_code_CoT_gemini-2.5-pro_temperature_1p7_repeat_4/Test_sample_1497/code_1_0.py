def solve_violin_parameters():
    """
    This function determines the parameter group changes for different violin playing variations.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Variation (1) 'sul ponticello' changes the string's harmonic content, which is controlled by Î½ (group ii).
    2.  Variation (2) 'bridge mute' dampens high-frequency resonances, which corresponds to the secondary resonance parameters in group iv. Adding mass lowers the resonance frequency, f2, so the direction is 'down'.
    3.  Variation (3) 'helium' changes the speed of sound, altering the primary air resonance f1, which is in group iii.
    4.  Variation (4) 'on the E string' changes the fundamental open string frequency F, which is group i.
