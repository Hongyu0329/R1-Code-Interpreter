    "In this problem, we need to determine the probability of selecting the single \"bottleneck\" edge from a 10-node barbell graph during a uniform randomized gossiping process.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph Structure:** A standard barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, which is the bottleneck. Since there are 10 nodes in total, each clique must have 5 nodes (K5).\n2.  **Calculate Edges in a Clique:** I will use the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the clique. For our K5 cliques, this will be `5 * (5 - 1) / 2`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Edges:** The total number of edges in the barbell graph is the sum of the edges in both cliques plus the one bottleneck edge connecting them.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** In uniform randomized gossiping, every edge has an equal chance of being selected. Therefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is simply `1 / (Total Number of Edges)`.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step of the reasoning along with the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two equal-sized cliques\n    # connected by a single edge (the bottleneck).\n    nodes_per_clique = total_nodes // 2\n\n    # The number of edges in a single complete graph (clique) with 'n' nodes\n    # is given by the formula n * (n - 1) / 2.\n    edges_in_one_clique = nodes_per_clique * (nodes_per_clique - 1) // 2\n\n    # The total number of edges is the sum of edges in both cliques plus the\n    # one bottleneck edge.\n    num_bottleneck_edges = 1\n    total_edges = (2 * edges_in_one_clique) + num_bottleneck_edges\n\n    # In uniform randomized gossiping, each edge is chosen with equal probability.\n    # The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1 / (total number of edges).\n    probability = 1 / total_edges\n\n    print(f\"A barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes is composed of two K{nodes_per_clique} cliques.\")\n    print(f\"Number of edges in one K{nodes_per_clique} clique = ({nodes_per_clique} * ({nodes_per_clique} - 1)) / 2 = {edges_in_one_clique}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of edges in the two cliques = 2 * {edges_in_one_clique} = {2 * edges_in_one_clique}\")\n    print(f\"Number of bottleneck edges connecting the cliques = {num_bottleneck_edges}\")\n    print(f\"Total edges in the graph = {2 * edges_in_one_clique} + {num_bottleneck_edges} = {total_edges}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, the probability of sampling a specific edge is 1 / (Total Edges).\")\n    print(f\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is: 1 / {total_edges}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated probability: {probability:.4f}\")\n\nsolve_barbell_probability()\n```\n<<<0.0476>>>"
