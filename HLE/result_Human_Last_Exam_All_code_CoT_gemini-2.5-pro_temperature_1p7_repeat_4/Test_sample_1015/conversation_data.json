    "My plan is to analyze the technical specifics of a *cambré derrière* (a bend to the back) in two major ballet methodologies: Vaganova (Russian) and Balanchine (American Neoclassical).\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** I will first recall the principles of the Vaganova method. It is known for its emphasis on strength, clean lines, and precise body placement. For a *cambré derrière*, this translates to maintaining the hips and shoulders square to the direction the dancer is facing. The bend comes from the upper and middle back, maintaining a solid, aligned foundation in the hips.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** Next, I will recall the stylistic hallmarks of the Balanchine method. It is characterized by speed, musicality, and pushing classical forms to their extremes. In a *cambré derrière*, a key feature of the Balanchine style is to release the hip, allowing it to push forward. This \"off-balance\" technique breaks the square alignment of the torso but allows for a deeper, more dynamic backbend.\n\n3.  **Compare and Select:** I will then compare this core difference—the treatment of the hips—against the provided answer choices.\n    *   A. Arm placement: Varies in both styles. Not the primary difference.\n    *   B. Placement of hip: This directly matches my analysis. Vaganova is square, Balanchine is released.\n    *   C. Speed: Balanchine is generally faster, but this is a performance quality, not a fundamental technical difference in the pose itself.\n    *   D. Degree of backbend: The Balanchine backbend is often deeper, but this is a *result* of releasing the hip. The hip placement is the cause, making it the more fundamental answer.\n    *   E. Placement of head: Head placement follows the line of the spine and epaulement, which is affected by the hip and back. It is a secondary difference.\n\n4.  **Construct Code:** Based on this reasoning, the placement of the hip is the most defining difference. I will write a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and answers a multiple-choice question about ballet technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n    \n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The most significant and defining technical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hip.\n\n    - **Vaganova Method:** Emphasizes a strict, classical form where the hips and shoulders are kept square to the front. The backbend is initiated from the upper back, maintaining a stable and aligned torso. The integrity of this 'box' alignment is paramount.\n\n    - **Balanchine Method:** Often encourages a more dynamic and extreme aesthetic. To achieve a deeper and more sweeping cambré derrière, the Balanchine technique involves releasing the hip of the working leg, allowing it to press forward. This breaks the square alignment of the torso but creates a visually dramatic line.\n\n    While other factors like the degree of the backbend (D) and the placement of the head (E) also differ, they are direct consequences of this fundamental difference in hip placement. Releasing the hip (B) is what allows for the deeper backbend. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the root distinction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(question)\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Explanation ---\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct answer is B: {options[correct_answer_key]}.\")\n\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
