# Let 'm' be the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.
# The number of independent real entries of the Riemann tensor is a function of m.

# The formula is derived from the symmetries of the tensor on a Kähler manifold.
# These symmetries allow the tensor to be described by an N x N Hermitian matrix,
# where N is the number of components of a symmetric m x m tensor.

# N = (m * (m + 1)) / 2
# The number of independent real components is N^2.
# So, the final formula is ((m * (m + 1)) / 2)^2.

# The following code prints the final formula and the numbers it contains.

m = sympy.Symbol('m')

# Define the numbers present in the formula
num_in_sum = 1
divisor = 2
exponent = 2

# Construct the formula using the symbolic variable 'm'
# Base of the power (N)
base_numerator = m * (m + num_in_sum)
base = base_numerator / divisor

# Final formula
formula = base**exponent
