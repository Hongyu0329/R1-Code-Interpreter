    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, followed by the Python code to present the resulting formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the General Case:** First, I'll recall the number of independent components for a Riemann tensor on a general Riemannian manifold of real dimension $n$. This number is given by the formula $\\frac{n^2(n^2 - 1)}{12}$.\n2.  **Introduce Kähler Manifolds:** A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric. If its complex dimension is $m$, its real dimension is $n = 2m$.\n3.  **Identify Additional Symmetries:** The Kähler condition ($\\nabla J = 0$, where $J$ is the complex structure) imposes strong additional symmetries on the Riemann tensor. These symmetries cause many components to become zero and introduce new relationships between the remaining non-zero components.\n4.  **Count the Kähler Components:** The non-zero components are of the form $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, where indices run from $1$ to the complex dimension $m$. These components can be organized into an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix where $N = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. The number of independent *real* components in an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix is $N^2$.\n5.  **State the Final Formula:** By substituting the expression for $N$, we find the total number of independent components is $(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2})^2$.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this final formula, explicitly showing each constant number involved in the equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Let 'm' be the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n# The number of independent real entries of the Riemann tensor is a function of m.\n\n# The formula is derived from the symmetries of the tensor on a Kähler manifold.\n# These symmetries allow the tensor to be described by an N x N Hermitian matrix,\n# where N is the number of components of a symmetric m x m tensor.\n\n# N = (m * (m + 1)) / 2\n# The number of independent real components is N^2.\n# So, the final formula is ((m * (m + 1)) / 2)^2.\n\n# The following code prints the final formula and the numbers it contains.\n\nm = sympy.Symbol('m')\n\n# Define the numbers present in the formula\nnum_in_sum = 1\ndivisor = 2\nexponent = 2\n\n# Construct the formula using the symbolic variable 'm'\n# Base of the power (N)\nbase_numerator = m * (m + num_in_sum)\nbase = base_numerator / divisor\n\n# Final formula\nformula = base**exponent\n\n# Print the explanation and the formula\nprint(\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 'm', the number of independent real entries in the Riemann tensor is given by the formula:\")\n\n# To satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" rule, we print the expression part by part.\n# Let's print the formula in a human-readable way.\nprint(f\"( (m * (m + {num_in_sum})) / {divisor} )^{exponent}\")\n\n# We can also show the expanded form.\nprint(\"\\nThis formula can be expanded to:\")\nexpanded_formula = sympy.expand(formula)\nprint(expanded_formula)\n```\n<<<((m * (m + 1)) / 2)^2>>>"
