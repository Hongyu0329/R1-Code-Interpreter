# Plan:
# 1. Identify the person who fits the description of being a famous poet
#    with a name where both the first and last words start with the same letter.
# 2. William Wordsworth is a famous Romantic poet, and his name fits the "W.W." pattern.
#    His wild, unkempt hair in portraits could be described as "porcupine-like",
#    making him a plausible answer to the riddle.
# 3. The code will store the first and last names in variables and then print them.

first_name = "William"
last_name = "Wordsworth"

# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# This is a text-based answer, not a numerical one, so there is no equation.
# The following print statement provides the name as the solution.
print(f"{first_name} {last_name}")
