    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will explain the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a polynomial in a weighted projective space. The formula is $c(X) = \\frac{d - \\sum w_i}{d}$.\n\nTo use this formula, we need to determine two values:\n1.  **The degree `d` of the polynomial:** A polynomial defining a hypersurface in a weighted projective space must be \"quasihomogeneous,\" meaning every term (monomial) must have the same weighted degree. I will calculate the weighted degree of each term in the given polynomial. As you will see, one term appears to have a different degree, likely due to a typo in the problem statement. I will proceed by taking the degree that the vast majority of terms share.\n2.  **The sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$:** This is a simple summation of the given weights of the ambient space.\n\nAn important property of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces is that their degree `d` is equal to the sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$. This means the numerator of the invariant's formula, $d - \\sum w_i$, should be zero.\n\nFinally, I will substitute these calculated values into the formula to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant. The python code below will perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # The polynomial is 0 = z1^8*z3 + z1^4*z2^3*z3 + z1*z2^7 + z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z2*z3^4 + z4^3*z5 + z5^3\n    # We represent each term by a tuple of its exponents for (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5).\n    terms_exponents = [\n        (8, 0, 1, 0, 0),  # z1^8*z3\n        (4, 3, 1, 0, 0),  # z1^4*z2^3*z3\n        (1, 7, 0, 0, 0),  # z1*z2^7\n        (1, 1, 1, 1, 1),  # z1*z2*z3*z4*z5\n        (0, 1, 4, 0, 0),  # z2*z3^4\n        (0, 0, 0, 3, 1),  # z4^3*z5\n        (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)   # z5^3\n    ]\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Determine the degree 'd' of the polynomial ---\n    # The polynomial should be quasihomogeneous, so we calculate the degree of each term.\n    term_degrees = []\n    for exponents in terms_exponents:\n        degree = sum(e * w for e, w in zip(exponents, weights))\n        term_degrees.append(degree)\n    \n    # One term has degree 224, while all others have degree 225.
