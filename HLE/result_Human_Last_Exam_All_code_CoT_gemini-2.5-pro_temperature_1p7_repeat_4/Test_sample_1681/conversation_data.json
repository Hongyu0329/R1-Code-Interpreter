    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy for both players is to Defect, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) with a payoff of (1, 1). This is a suboptimal outcome, as both players would be better off if they had cooperated to achieve a (5, 5) payoff.\n\nWhen the game is played in a quantum setting using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, the players' strategy space is expanded. A neutral arbiter prepares a maximally entangled initial state. Players then apply their chosen strategies, which are represented by quantum gate operations on their respective qubits.\n\nThis quantum framework introduces a new type of strategy, often called the \"Quantum\" strategy, let's denote it as `Q`. This strategy is distinct from the classical strategies of Cooperate (`C`) and Defect (`D`). The remarkable feature of the quantum game is the outcome when both players choose to play `Q`. In this specific scenario, the entanglement and quantum interference conspire to produce the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome with a probability of 1.\n\nThis creates a new equilibrium point where the paradox of the Prisoner's Dilemma is resolved. By both adopting the quantum strategy `Q`, the players can achieve the optimal cooperative payoff of (5, 5), an outcome that is unstable in the classical version of the game.\n\nThe calculation for the payoff at this (Q, Q) equilibrium is straightforward, as the outcome is certain.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium payoff for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff values from the matrix for (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D) outcomes\n    payoff_CC = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\n    payoff_CD_A = 0  # Sucker's payoff for player A\n    payoff_DC_A = 7  # Temptation payoff for player A\n    payoff_DD = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n\n    # In the quantum game's (Q, Q) equilibrium, the probability of the\n    # (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome is 1, and all others are 0.\n    prob_CC = 1.0\n    prob_CD = 0.0\n    prob_DC = 0.0\n    prob_DD = 0.0\n\n    # Calculate the expected payoff for a player\n    equilibrium_payoff = (prob_CC * payoff_CC) + (prob_CD * payoff_CD_A) + (prob_DC * payoff_DC_A) + (prob_DD * payoff_DD)\n\n    print(\"The quantum equilibrium is achieved when both players adopt the quantum strategy 'Q'.\")\n    print(\"This strategy results in the 'Cooperate, Cooperate' outcome with certainty.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe payoff for each player at this equilibrium point is calculated based on the probabilities of each outcome:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"Payoff = P(CC) * Payoff(CC) + P(CD) * Payoff(CD) + P(DC) * Payoff(DC) + P(DD) * Payoff(DD)\")\n    print(f\"Payoff = {prob_CC} * {payoff_CC} + {prob_CD} * {payoff_CD_A} + {prob_DC} * {payoff_DC_A} + {prob_DD} * {payoff_DD} = {int(equilibrium_payoff)}\")\n\n\nsolve_quantum_dilemma()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
