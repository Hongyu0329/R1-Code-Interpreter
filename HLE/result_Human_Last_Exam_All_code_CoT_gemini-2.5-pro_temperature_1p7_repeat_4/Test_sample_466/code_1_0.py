# The number of internal adjunctions is the number of invertible linear maps
# from the vector space F_11^3 to itself. This corresponds to the order of
# the general linear group GL(n, q), where n=3 and q=11.
# The formula for the order of GL(n, q) is:
# |GL(n, q)| = (q^n - 1)(q^n - q)...(q^n - q^(n-1))

n = 3
q = 11

# Calculate the terms of the product
term1 = q**n - q**0
term2 = q**n - q**1
term3 = q**n - q**2

# Calculate the final result
num_adjunctions = term1 * term2 * term3

# Print the step-by-step calculation
