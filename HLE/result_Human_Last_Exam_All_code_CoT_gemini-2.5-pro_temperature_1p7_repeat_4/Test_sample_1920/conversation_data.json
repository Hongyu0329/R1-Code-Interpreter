    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Problem**: The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d$ is related to the structure of the group of units modulo $d$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. A key insight is that when the conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, the group of characters modulo $d$ decomposes into a direct product of the character groups for each prime factor:\n    $(\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z}}) \\cong (\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/p_1\\mathbb{Z}}) \\times \\dots \\times (\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/p_k\\mathbb{Z}})$.\n    A character $\\chi \\pmod{d}$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-principal (i.e., has an order greater than 1).\n\n2.  **Factor the Conductor**: First, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n\n3.  **Order Condition**: The order of a composite character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_k}))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n4.  **Component Character Properties**:\n    *   For the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$, must be a divisor of 6. So, the possible orders are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n    *   For the overall character $\\chi$ to be primitive, each component $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be non-principal, meaning its order must be greater than 1. So, the possible orders for each component are {2, 3, 6}.\n    *   For a character of order $k$ to exist modulo $p_i$, $k$ must divide the order of the character group, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. We must check this condition for all prime factors $p_i$ and all required orders $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   The number of characters of a specific order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (like the character group modulo a prime) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided $k|n$.\n\n5.  **Combinatorial Counting**: We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid combinations of component characters.\n    *   Calculate the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. This means each component has an order in {2, 3, 6}.\n    *   Subtract the number of primitive characters whose order is not 6 but still divides 6. These are characters where the lcm of component orders is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3).\n        *   If the lcm is 2, all component orders must be 2.\n        *   If the lcm is 3, all component orders must be 3.\n    *   The final result is the total minus these subtractions.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the conductor\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(factors.keys())\n    factor_str = \" * \".join(map(str, primes))\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {factor_str}.\")\n\n    # Check if square-free\n    is_square_free = all(v == 1 for v in factors.values())\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(\"Conductor d is not square-free.
