        'A': "Correct. Augustine's late works on predestination and grace have led many, including Calvin, to see his views as a precursor to their own. This is a common interpretation.",
        'B': "Incorrect. The claim that a major scholar like R. A. Markus would 'ignore' Augustine's thoughts on predestination and grace is a mischaracterization of academic work. These concepts are central to Augustine's doctrine of the will, and any serious analysis must engage with them, not ignore them. While Markus offered a nuanced interpretation of Augustine's views on freedom, he certainly did not ignore these critical related concepts.",
        'C': "Correct. In works like 'On Free Choice of the Will,' Augustine identifies the 'voluntas' (will) as a core faculty of the human soul or psyche, a concept developed in dialogue with classical philosophy, including Stoic thought.",
        'D': "Correct. This is a hallmark of Augustine's thought. He seamlessly blended philosophical inquiry with theological doctrine, making it difficult to separate the two. The problem of free will vs. divine grace is a prime example.",
        'E': "Correct. Etienne Gilson, a prominent medievalist, is known for making the important distinction between Augustine's concept of efficacious or 'irresistible' grace and the more rigid, controversial version later proposed by the Jansenists.",
        'F': "Correct. This accurately summarizes the argument from Augustine's dialogue with Evodius, where he establishes that human beings are responsible for their sinful acts because sin originates in the misuse of the free will that God gave them."
