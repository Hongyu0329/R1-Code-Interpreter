    # --- Analysis of Option A ---
    print("Analysis of A: A distribution of bonds by Bank of China (Canada).")
    print("This option states the issuer is a Schedule III bank. Under the Bank Act, a Schedule III bank is a branch of a foreign bank.")
    print("A branch is not a separate legal entity from its parent and cannot issue its own securities (like bonds).")
    print("Any securities would be issued by the foreign parent bank. A distribution of a foreign bank's securities to retail investors would generally require a prospectus.")
    print("Result: This distribution is non-compliant as described.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Analysis of Option B ---
    print("Analysis of B: A distribution of bonds by JPMorgan Chase to a large number of investors.")
    print("JPMorgan Chase is a foreign issuer. A broad distribution of securities to a 'large number of investors' in Canada, implying retail investors, would require a prospectus.")
    print("No applicable exemption (like 'accredited investor' or 'permitted client' for the entire group) is specified.")
    print("Result: This distribution is non-compliant.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Analysis of Option C ---
    print("Analysis of C: A distribution of shares by a private issuer to a non-connected individual.")
    print("This scenario tests the 'Accredited Investor' exemption. The investor's details are:")
    print(f"* Salary: $35,000")
    print(f"* Net assets: $10,000")
    print("To qualify as an accredited investor based on income, an individual needs a net income over $200,000 annually. To qualify on assets, they need over $1,000,000 in financial assets or $5,000,000 in net assets.")
    print(f"With a salary of 35000 and net assets of 10000, the investor does not meet these thresholds.")
    print("Since the investor has no other connection to the company, this prospectus-exempt distribution is not permitted.")
    print("Result: This distribution is non-compliant.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Analysis of Option D ---
    print("Analysis of D: A distribution of shares by Fairstone Bank of Canada.")
    print("Fairstone Bank of Canada is a Schedule I bank. NI 45-106 provides a specific prospectus exemption for the distribution of a security of a Schedule I bank.")
    print("These banks are heavily regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), which provides a substitute for prospectus disclosure.")
    print("This exemption applies to distributions to all types of investors, including retail investors. Therefore, the financial status of any single investor (such as one with zero dollars of net assets) is irrelevant.")
    print("Result: This distribution is COMPLIANT.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Analysis of Option E ---
    print("Analysis of E: A distribution of shares by Caisse populaire acadienne lt√©e.")
    print("A caisse populaire is a type of credit union. The prospectus exemption for credit unions in NI 45-106 is conditional: the distribution must be made to the credit union's MEMBERS.")
    print("The option states the distribution is to a 'large number of retail investors,' which is a broader group than 'members.' Since it does not specify that all investors are members, we cannot conclude it is compliant.")
    print("Result: This distribution is non-compliant as described.")
