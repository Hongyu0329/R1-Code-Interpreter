    "There is a fundamental contradiction in your question. For a crystal class to exhibit optical activity (the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light), it must be **chiral**. A chiral structure is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The term **achiral** means \"not chiral.\"\n\nTherefore, by definition, a crystal class cannot be both **achiral** and **optically active**. It's like asking for a number that is both even and odd.\n\nThe following Python script first demonstrates why no crystal class can satisfy your request and then provides the correct lists for the distinct categories you mentioned (optically active classes and achiral non-polar classes) for your reference.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find which are achiral, non-polar,\n    and optically active, explaining the relationships between these properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral crystal classes.
