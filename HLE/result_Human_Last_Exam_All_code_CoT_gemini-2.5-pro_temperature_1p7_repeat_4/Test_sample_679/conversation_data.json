    "To determine the IUPAC name of the compound with molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$ from its $^{13}C$ NMR data, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) from the formula $C_7H_{14}$. A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Chemical Shifts**: I'll check the chemical shifts to identify the types of carbons present. Shifts between 100-150 ppm indicate alkene carbons ($C=C$), confirming the presence of a double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicities**: The multiplicities (s, d, t, q) reveal the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon (s = C, d = CH, t = CH2, q = CH3), allowing me to identify the fragments of the molecule.\n\n3.  **Reconcile Atom Counts**: The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but the NMR spectrum shows only 6 signals. This means two carbons are chemically equivalent and share the same signal. I will use the hydrogen count from the fragments to determine which signal represents two carbons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: Based on the identified fragments, I will piece them together to form a single, valid chemical structure.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Finally, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the assembled structure to find its official name.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan to derive the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of a C7H14 hydrocarbon from its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    C_atoms = 7\n    H_atoms = 14\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: {'mult': 's', 'type': 'C', 'H_count': 0},\n        112: {'mult': 't', 'type': 'CH2', 'H_count': 2},\n        48: {'mult': 't', 'type': 'CH2', 'H_count': 2},\n        27: {'mult': 'd', 'type': 'CH', 'H_count': 1},\n        22: {'mult': 'q', 'type': 'CH3', 'H_count': 3},\n        21: {'mult': 'q', 'type': 'CH3', 'H_count': 3}\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    dbe = C_atoms - H_atoms / 2 + 1\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is {int(dbe)}, indicating one double bond or one ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region, confirming a C=C double bond.\")\n    print(\"The fragments derived from the multiplicities are:\")\n    \n    num_c_from_signals = 0\n    num_h_from_signals = 0\n    for shift, data in nmr_signals.items():\n        print(f\"- {data['type']:<4} (from {shift} ppm, multiplicity: {data['mult']})\")\n        num_c_from_signals += 1\n        num_h_from_signals += data['H_count']\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Reconcile Atom Counts\n    print(\"Step 3: Reconcile Atom Counts\")\n    print(f\"The spectrum shows {num_c_from_signals} signals, but the formula has {C_atoms} carbons.\")\n    print(\"This means one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons.\")\n    print(f\"Counting hydrogens from the 6 signals gives {num_h_from_signals} H, but the formula requires {H_atoms} H.\")\n    H_missing = H_atoms - num_h_from_signals\n    print(f\"We are missing {H_missing} hydrogens.\")\n    print(\"To account for the 7th carbon and the 3 missing hydrogens, one of the CH3 signals must represent two equivalent carbons.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Assemble the Fragments\n    print(\"Step 4: Assemble the Structure\")\n    print(\"The fragments are:\")\n    print(\" - A C=CH2 group (from signals at 145(s) and 112(t))\")\n    print(\" - An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) (from signals at 48(t) and one of the q)\")\n    print(\" - An isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2) (from 27(d) and the other q for two equivalent CH3)\")\n    print(\"\\nAssembling these pieces: The ethyl and isopropyl groups must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the C=CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"\\n  (CH3)2CH - C(=CH2) - CH2CH3\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Determine IUPAC Name\n    print(\"Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a butene chain.\")\n    print(\"Numbering from the end with the double bond gives:\")\n    print(\"     CH3\")\n    print(\"      |\")\n    print(\"CH3 - CH(3) - C(2)(=CH2(1)) - CH2(ethyl) - CH3(ethyl)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe correct longest chain including the double bond is a 4-carbon chain with an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 3.\")\n    final_name = \"2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe final IUPAC name is: {final_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nEach number in the final name is: 2, 3, 1\")\n\nsolve_structure()\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
