# Plan:
# 1. State the total number of knot types with 7 crossings.
# 2. State the number of non-hyperbolic (torus) knots among them.
# 3. Calculate the number of hyperbolic knots by subtraction.
# 4. Calculate the proportion and print the result.

# Total number of distinct knot types with 7 crossings.
total_knots = 7

# The non-hyperbolic knots with 7 crossings are the torus knots.
# Only one such knot exists: the T(2,7) knot, which is 7_1.
non_hyperbolic_knots = 1

# The number of hyperbolic knots is the total minus the non-hyperbolic ones.
hyperbolic_knots = total_knots - non_hyperbolic_knots

# Calculate the proportion.
proportion = hyperbolic_knots / total_knots
