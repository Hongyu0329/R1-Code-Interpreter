    "The problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a well-known result in the field of mathematical physics and the study of differential equations.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will first note that the full Lie group of symmetries is technically infinite-dimensional due to a \"gauge-like\" symmetry associated with the pressure term.\n2.  However, the question is conventionally understood to ask for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional Lie subgroup* of symmetries.\n3.  I will list the types of continuous transformations (symmetries) that leave the Navier-Stokes equations invariant. These transformations form the components of the group.\n4.  For each type of transformation, I will determine its dimension, which corresponds to the number of independent parameters it has.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines the dimension for each symmetry type and calculates their sum to find the total dimension. The script will print the breakdown of this sum.\n\nThe symmetries are:\n*   **Time translation:** The laws of physics do not change over time. This gives 1 dimension.\n*   **Space translations:** The laws are the same everywhere in space. Since space is 3D, this gives 3 dimensions.\n*   **Space rotations:** The laws are isotropic; they don't depend on direction. The group of rotations in 3D has 3 dimensions.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** These transformations relate the system to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity. In 3D space, this gives 3 dimensions.\n*   **Scaling (or Dilation):** The Navier-Stokes equations have a specific self-similar scaling property. This is a single-parameter transformation, contributing 1 dimension.\n*   **Pressure shift:** The pressure term only appears as a gradient in the equations, so shifting the pressure by a constant value does not change the equations. This adds 1 more dimension.\n\nSumming these dimensions gives the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The full Lie group of symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional.\")\n    print(\"This is due to a gauge symmetry allowing the pressure to be shifted by an arbitrary function of time.\")\n    print(\"However, the standard question refers to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry subgroup.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis finite-dimensional group is composed of the following physical symmetries:\")\n\n    # Dimension from time translation: t -> t + a\n    dim_time_translation = 1\n    print(f\"- Time translation: {dim_time_translation} dimension\")\n\n    # Dimension from space translations: x -> x + a (vector in R^3)\n    dim_space_translation = 3\n    print(f\"- Space translations: {dim_space_translation} dimensions\")\n\n    # Dimension from space rotations: x -> Rx (R in SO(3))\n    dim_space_rotation = 3\n    print(f\"- Space rotations: {dim_space_rotation} dimensions\")\n\n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts: x -> x + vt, u -> u + v\n    dim_galilean_boosts = 3\n    print(f\"- Galilean boosts: {dim_galilean_boosts} dimensions\")\n\n    # Dimension from scaling transformation (dilation)\n    dim_scaling = 1\n    print(f\"- Scaling transformation: {dim_scaling} dimension\")\n    \n    # Dimension from constant pressure shift: p -> p + c\n    dim_pressure_shift = 1\n    print(f\"- Constant pressure shift: {dim_pressure_shift} dimension\")\n\n    # Calculate the total dimension\n    total_dimension = (\n        dim_time_translation +\n        dim_space_translation +\n        dim_space_rotation +\n        dim_galilean_boosts +\n        dim_scaling +\n        dim_pressure_shift\n    )\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    equation = (\n        f\"{dim_time_translation} + {dim_space_translation} + \"\n        f\"{dim_space_rotation} + {dim_galilean_boosts} + \"\n        f\"{dim_scaling} + {dim_pressure_shift}\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe total dimension is the sum of these individual dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"Total dimension = {equation} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
