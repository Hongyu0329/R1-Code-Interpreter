# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian map before and after the Soviet dissolution.
# The Four Color Theorem guarantees that any planar graph, such as a map of countries, can be colored with at most four colors.
# The map of Asia, both before and after 1991, is complex enough to require four colors.
chi_before_dissolution = 4
chi_after_dissolution = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the dissolution was {chi_before_dissolution}.")
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the dissolution is {chi_after_dissolution}.")

# Step 2: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chi_after_dissolution - chi_before_dissolution
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is the difference: {chi_after_dissolution} - {chi_before_dissolution} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 3: Determine if the planarity changed and find the value of beta.
# A map of countries is a planar graph. The dissolution of the Soviet Union created new borders on the map,
# but it did not change the fundamental planarity of the graph.
# The problem states if the planarity did not change, beta should be 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, hence beta = {beta}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
