    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a historical question, so I cannot compute the answer directly. My plan is to first find the historical information regarding the Piazza della Rotonda and then present this information to you using a Python script, as you requested.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know about a specific architectural feature in Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in 1950.\n2.  **Research:** I will access my knowledge base about the history of Roman architecture and urban planning, specifically focusing on changes made to the Piazza della Rotonda in the mid-20th century.\n3.  **Formulate the answer:** The research indicates that the feature was a circular tram line that looped around the central fountain in the square. This was a distinctive, if somewhat jarring, feature in the ancient piazza. It was removed as part of post-war efforts to manage traffic and preserve the historic center.\n4.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script that uses `print()` statements to clearly state what the feature was and provide a brief description, fulfilling the request to use code.\n\n```python\ndef find_piazza_feature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about a historical feature\n    in Rome's Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"A circular tram line\"\n    removal_year = 1950\n    description = (\n        \"Until the year {}, the Piazza della Rotonda was encircled by a distinctive {}.\"\n        .format(removal_year, feature.lower())\n    )\n    details = (\n        \"These tram tracks looped around the central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) \"\n        \"and were a prominent part of the square's landscape before being \"\n        \"dismantled to reduce traffic and preserve the historic area.\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"The unique architectural feature removed from Piazza della Rotonda was:\")\n    print(f\"- Feature: {feature}\")\n    print(f\"- Year of Removal: Approximately {removal_year}\")\n    print(f\"- Description: {description}\")\n    print(f\"- Details: {details}\")\n\nfind_piazza_feature()\n```\n<<<A circular tram line>>>"
