    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `Î³` with an automorphism group of size 3, we need to construct a graph that exhibits a 3-fold rotational symmetry but lacks any reflectional (mirror) symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  An automorphism group of order 3 is the cyclic group `Z_3`. This means the graph must be preserved by a permutation of its vertices of order 3 (a 3-fold rotation), but by no other non-identity permutations.\n2.  We can start with a structure that has 3-fold rotational symmetry, like a triangle (`K_3`). However, `K_3` on its own has `|Aut(K_3)| = 6` because it also has reflectional symmetries.\n3.  To break these reflectional symmetries, we can attach \"chiral\" (handed) arms to each vertex of the triangle. The arms must be constructed in a way that they are preserved by the rotation but not by a reflection.\n4.  A known minimal construction for this property is a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges. Let's define this graph and count its edges.\n\n### Graph Construction:\nThe graph has 9 vertices, which we can partition into three sets, `V = {v1, v2, v3}`, `U = {u1, u2, u3}`, and `W = {w1, w2, w3}`. The desired 3-fold rotational automorphism `p` will map `v1->v2->v3->v1`, `u1->u2->u3->u1`, and `w1->w2->w3->w1`.\n\nThe edges are defined in four groups:\n1.  **Triangle on V**: The vertices in `V` form a `K_3` (a triangle). This gives 3 edges.\n2.  **V to U connections**: Each `v_i` is connected to the corresponding `u_i`. This gives 3 edges.\n3.  **U to W connections**: Each `u_i` is connected to the corresponding `w_i`, like paths. This gives 3 edges.\n4.  **Chiral Twist**: To break reflection symmetry, we add \"twisted\" connections from `U` to `W`. We connect each `u_i` to `w_{i+1}` (with indices taken modulo 3, i.e., `u1-w2, u2-w3, u3-w1`). This gives another 3 edges.\n\nThe total number of edges is the sum of edges from these four groups. The following Python code defines these edges and calculates the total.\n\n```python\n# Define the sets of vertices conceptually.\n# V = {v1, v2, v3}, U = {u1, u2, u3}, W = {w1, w2, w3}\n# For simplicity in code, we can map them to integers 0-8:\n# v1,v2,v3 -> 0,1,2\n# u1,u2,u3 -> 3,4,5\n# w1,w2,w3 -> 6,7,8\n\n# Group 1: K_3 on V\nedges_v_triangle = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]\ncount1 = len(edges_v_triangle)\n\n# Group 2: Connections from V to U (v_i -> u_i)\nedges_v_u = [(0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]\ncount2 = len(edges_v_u)\n\n# Group 3: Connections from U to W (u_i -> w_i)\nedges_u_w = [(3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8)]\ncount3 = len(edges_u_w)\n\n# Group 4: \"Twisted\" connections from U to W (u_i -> w_{i+1})\n# u1->w2 (3,7), u2->w3 (4,8), u3->w1 (5,6)\nedges_twist = [(3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6)]\ncount4 = len(edges_twist)\n\n# Calculate the total number of edges\ntotal_edges = count1 + count2 + count3 + count4\n\n# The final equation is the sum of edges from each group.\nprint(f\"The number of edges is calculated by summing the edges from four structural groups:\")\nprint(f\"{count1} (triangle) + {count2} (v-u links) + {count3} (u-w links) + {count4} (twist links) = {total_edges}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe smallest number of edges 'e' is: {total_edges}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
