def construct_inscribed_square():

  This function prints the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square
  inscribed in a circle.

  C represents drawing a circle with a center and a point on its circumference.

  # The sequence LCCL represents the following steps:
  # 1. L: Draw a line through the center and the given point on the circumference to define the first diameter.
  # 2. C: Draw a circle from one end of the diameter with the other end as radius.
  # 3. C: Draw a circle from the other end of the diameter with the first end as radius.
  # 4. L: Draw a line through the intersections of the last two circles to define the second, perpendicular diameter.
  # The four points where the two diameters intersect the original circle are the vertices of the square.
