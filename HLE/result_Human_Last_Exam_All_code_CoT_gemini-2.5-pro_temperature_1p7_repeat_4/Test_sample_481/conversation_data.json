    "Based on publicly available drug identification data, I will provide the distinct numerical imprints for Teva brand fluoxetine at 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I have identified the numerical code for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule as \"3107\".\n2.  I have identified the numerical code for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule as \"3105\".\n3.  I will write a Python script to display these findings clearly. The script will print out which number corresponds to which dosage, presenting it in an equation-like format as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numerical imprints on\n    Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Numerical imprints for each capsule dosage\n    imprint_10mg = 3107\n    imprint_20mg = 3105\n    \n    # Print the findings in an equation-like format\n    print(f\"The number on the Teva 10mg capsule is: {imprint_10mg}\")\n    print(f\"The number on the Teva 20mg capsule is: {imprint_20mg}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<3107, 3105>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
