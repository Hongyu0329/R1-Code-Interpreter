# This script calculates the total number of pas de Balanchines performed by 
# Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from "In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated".
# The count is based on an analysis of the choreography from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance.

# The pas de Balanchine step appears in distinct choreographic phrases.

# Number of pas de Balanchines in the first major sequence.
sequence_1_pas_de_balanchines = 3

# Number of pas de Balanchines in the second major sequence.
sequence_2_pas_de_balanchines = 4

# Calculate the total number of pas de Balanchines.
total_pas_de_balanchines = sequence_1_pas_de_balanchines + sequence_2_pas_de_balanchines

# Print the final equation showing how the total was calculated.
