    This script analyzes the potential factors influencing the 13C ratio in tree rings.
    
    Scientific Rationale:
    The 13C/12C ratio (often expressed as δ13C) in tree rings is influenced by both global
    atmospheric changes and local environmental conditions.

    1.  The Suess Effect: The primary global driver of declining 13C from 1886-1990 is the
        burning of fossil fuels, which releases 13C-depleted CO2 into the atmosphere. This
        is the most scientifically accepted reason for the long-term trend. However, it is
        not listed as an answer choice.

    2.  Evaluating the Options: We must choose the most plausible factor from the list.
        -   Drought (B) causes stomatal closure, which *increases* the 13C ratio. This is the opposite of the observed trend.
        -   Physiological factors (A, C, D) are generally less significant than major environmental drivers over a century-long period.
        -   Changes in the SE Asia Monsoon (E) directly impact water availability. A stronger monsoon (wetter climate) allows trees to keep their stomata open, increasing discrimination against 13C and thus *decreasing* the 13C ratio in the wood. A long-term strengthening of the monsoon could therefore be a predominant factor for a declining trend.

    This script models the effect of a strengthening monsoon on the 13C ratio to demonstrate this principle.
