    "The question asks for the common name of the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function. This function is fundamental in analyzing fluctuations and correlations in systems of particles, including neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the generalized pair correlation function, typically denoted as $G(\\mathbf{r}, t)$. It measures the probability of finding a particle at position $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$, given that there was a particle at the origin at time $t=0$.\n2.  Define the double Fourier transform in both space ($\\mathbf{r} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{k}$) and time ($t \\rightarrow \\omega$). This transform maps the function from the space-time domain to the wavevector-frequency domain.\n3.  The resulting function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectrum of fluctuations in the system. Its name is well-established in condensed matter physics and neutron scattering, and this name is also used in the context of nuclear criticality analysis (e.g., neutron noise analysis).\n4.  I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to symbolically represent the equation for this transform. The script will define the variables and functions and print the complete equation. This fulfills the request to use code and show the final equation.\n\nThe code below uses `sympy` to symbolically represent the definition of the Dynamic Structure Factor, which is the double Fourier transform of the Van Hove pair correlation function. For simplicity, it shows the one-dimensional spatial case.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef define_dynamic_structure_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically defines and prints the equation for the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n    The Dynamic Structure Factor S(k, omega) is the space-time, double Fourier\n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function G(r, t).
