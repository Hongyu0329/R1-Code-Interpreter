    # Statement 2: A diagonal scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a diagonal potential V(r).

    # that result in a diagonal S-matrix (S=I).

    # Statement 3: A nontrivially coupled potential V(r) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E).
    # Analysis: True. This is equivalent to its contrapositive: if the Jost matrix F(E) is diagonal for all energies,
    # the potential V(r) must be trivially coupled (in fact, diagonal). A non-trivial coupling in V(r)
    # necessarily leads to a non-diagonal F(E) to account for the mixing between channels from r=0 to infinity.

    # S(E) is diagonal (S=I), but F(E) must be non-diagonal (as V(r) is nontrivially coupled).

    # implies a trivially coupled potential.
