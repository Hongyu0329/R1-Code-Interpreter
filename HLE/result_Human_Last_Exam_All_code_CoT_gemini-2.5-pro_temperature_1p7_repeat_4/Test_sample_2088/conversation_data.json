    "Here is a plan to solve the mathematical expression:\n1.  Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$. First, we will combine the two integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, into a single integral, which we will call $I$.\n2.  The integrand of $I$ is complex. We will simplify it by applying the substitution $u = 1-x$.\n3.  The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. This type of integral, often found in mathematics competitions, can usually be solved by finding an antiderivative of a specific form. We will look for an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^k (ax^8+bx^4+c)^{1/4}$.\n4.  Once the antiderivative is found, we will apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral $I = F(1) - F(0)$.\n5.  Finally, we will substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression $E$ to compute the final answer. The code will print out each step of this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given mathematical expression and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the expression and combine the integrals.\n    print(\"The expression to compute is (12)^4 * (I1 - I2)^4, where:\")\n    print(\"I1 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"I2 = integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nLet I = I1 - I2.
