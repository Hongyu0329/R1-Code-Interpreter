    "Of course, I can help with that. Determining the oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins from their sequence is a classic problem in bioinformatics and protein design. The prediction relies on analyzing the pattern of amino acids, particularly at the core positions of the heptad repeat.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, denoted `abcdefg`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. The identity of these core residues is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n2.  **Establish Prediction Rules:** I will use a set of well-established rules from protein design literature to make the predictions:\n    *   A classic dimer has hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L) and Alanine (A) at its `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   An Asparagine (N) at an `a` position strongly specifies a parallel dimer.\n    *   Polar residues like Glutamine (Q) or Threonine (T) at the `d` position can form hydrogen bonds within the core and strongly favor trimers.\n    *   Large, bulky hydrophobic residues like Isoleucine (I) at both `a` and `d` positions, or `I` at `a` and `L` at `d` with other bulky groups like Tryptophan (W), create packing that favors trimers or tetramers.\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes each sequence, identifies its core `a` and `d` residues (assuming a standard registration), applies these rules to predict the oligomeric state, and prints the result with a justification. Based on my analysis, the oligomeric states correspond to one of the provided answer choices.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on the\n    amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' core positions of the heptad repeat.\n\n    Args:\n        sequences (list): A list of protein sequence strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of predicted oligomeric states.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # These rules are derived from established principles in protein design.\n    # The order of rules is important for correct prediction.\n    def get_prediction(a_pos, d_pos, seq):\n        # Rule 1: An Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position is a strong determinant for a Dimer (2).\n        if 'N' in a_pos:\n            return 2, \"Contains Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position, which specifies a dimer.\"\n            \n        # Rule 2: Threonine (T) at a 'd' position favors a Trimer (3) by forming polar interactions in the core.\n        if 'T' in d_pos:\n            return 3, \"Contains Threonine (T) at a 'd' position, which favors a trimer.\"\n\n        # Rule 3: A core rich in Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and 'd', especially with a bulky Tryptophan (W), favors a Tetramer (4).\n        if d_pos.count('I') >= 2 and 'W' in d_pos:\n            return 4, \"Core with Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and 'd' and a bulky Tryptophan (W) favors a tetramer.\"\n        \n        # Rule 4: A core with polar Glutamine (Q) at 'd' is analyzed.
