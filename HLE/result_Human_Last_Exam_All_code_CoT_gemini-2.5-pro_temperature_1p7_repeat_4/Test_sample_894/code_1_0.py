    This function identifies and lists the San Francisco propositions from the

    receives more votes.

    The competing pairs are:
    - Proposition E and Proposition F

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes
    is nullified. Therefore, all four are candidates for nullification.
