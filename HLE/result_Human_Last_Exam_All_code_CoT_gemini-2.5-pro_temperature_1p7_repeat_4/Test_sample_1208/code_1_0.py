        'III': "Rejected. A rapid opioid taper is generally unsafe, can cause severe withdrawal, and increases the risk of relapse. It is not recommended for patients on high-dose, long-term opioids.",
        'IV': "Selected. A multidisciplinary consultation is the gold standard for complex cases. It ensures that the physical (pain), psychological (dependence, craving, mood), and social aspects of the patient's condition are addressed by a team of experts.",
