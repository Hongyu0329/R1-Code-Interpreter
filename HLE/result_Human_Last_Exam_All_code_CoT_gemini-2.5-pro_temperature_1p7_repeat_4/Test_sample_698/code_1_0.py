# Description: This script will analyze the options for the Word Avalanche puzzle
# to find the best fit for the description: "My software tells the birds when
# and where to relieve themselves," using the word "computer".

# A True Avalanche requires a repeating syllable pattern and must fit the description.
# The core syllable pattern comes from "computer": com-pu-ter.

# --- Analysis of Choices ---

# Choice A: Computers comp few urns
# Syllable analysis: No clear repetition of 'com-pu-ter'.
# Description analysis: The meaning is obscure and does not match the prompt.

# Choice B: Computer: "Come poo, tern!"
# Syllable analysis: Excellent phonetic repetition. 'com-pu-ter' sounds like 'come-poo-tern'.
# Description analysis: The meaning is a perfect fit. The 'Computer' (software) tells a 'tern' (a bird) to 'come poo' (relieve itself).

# Choice C: Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!"
# Syllable analysis: The syllable pattern is broken after the first word.
# Description analysis: While the theme is related, it fails the syllable test.

# Choice D: Comb pewter computer
# Syllable analysis: Good phonetic repetition. 'comb-pew-ter' sounds like 'com-pu-ter'.
# Description analysis: The meaning "to search through pewter items" has no connection to the prompt.

# Choice E: Computer needs bird relieves
# Syllable analysis: No syllable repetition at all.
# Description analysis: Does not form a pun or a proper avalanche.

# Conclusion: Choice B is the only one that is a True Avalanche and matches the description.

print(f"which is repeated phonetically in 'Come poo, tern!', a phrase that perfectly matches the description of software telling a bird where to relieve itself.")
