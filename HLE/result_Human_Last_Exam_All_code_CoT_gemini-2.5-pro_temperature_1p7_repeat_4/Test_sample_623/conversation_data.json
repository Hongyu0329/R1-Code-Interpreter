    "To determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released, we need to trace the labeled carbons from glucose through glycolysis and into the subsequent reaction where CO₂ is first produced.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Molecule:** We start with glucose labeled with the ¹³C isotope at carbons 1 and 4.\n2.  **Trace Carbons through Glycolysis:** We'll use the established mapping of how glucose's six carbons are distributed into the two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis.\n    *   Glucose C1 & C6 become Pyruvate C3 (the methyl carbon).\n    *   Glucose C2 & C5 become Pyruvate C2 (the keto carbon).\n    *   Glucose C3 & C4 become Pyruvate C1 (the carboxyl carbon).\n3.  **Identify CO₂ Production Step:** Glycolysis itself does not release CO₂. The first release of CO₂ occurs immediately after, when the pyruvate molecules are converted to acetyl-CoA by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC). This reaction specifically removes the C1 (carboxyl) carbon from pyruvate.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** By comparing the position of the ¹³C labels in the pyruvate molecules with the carbon position that is released as CO₂, we can determine how many of the resulting CO₂ molecules are labeled.\n\nThis Python code will execute the plan step-by-step to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_co2_from_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate \n    decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"This analysis determines how many 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are released from one molecule of 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"The process involves tracking the labeled carbons through glycolysis to pyruvate, and then through the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction where CO2 is first produced.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define Labeled Glucose and Glycolysis Mapping ---\n    # Glucose is labeled at carbons 1 and 4.\n    labeled_glucose_carbons = {'C1': '13C', 'C4': '13C'}\n    print(\"Step 1: Tracing labels from glucose to the two pyruvate products.\")\n    print(\"The starting molecule, 1,4-13C glucose, is labeled at Carbon 1 and Carbon 4.\")\n    print(\"Glycolysis splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules.
