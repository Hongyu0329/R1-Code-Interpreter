Step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Deconstruct the Premise:**
    *   The CA biotype is from watermelon and thrives on a diet rich in raffinose (a Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide, or RFO). This implies that watermelon phloem is likely rich in raffinose and that CA biotypes are adapted to metabolize it.
    *   The MA biotype is from cotton and thrives on a sucrose-only diet. This implies that cotton phloem is rich in sucrose but poor in raffinose, and MA biotypes are adapted to a sucrose diet.
    *   The enzyme galactosidase is required to break down complex sugars like raffinose. Therefore, CA biotypes likely have higher baseline galactosidase activity than MA biotypes.

2.  **Evaluate each answer choice:**

    *   **A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.**
        *   This is a direct conclusion from the observation that CA biotypes do well on a raffinose-rich diet while MA biotypes do well on a sucrose-only diet. This statement is **True**.

    *   **B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.**
        *   In this biological context, "doing well on" a diet is a strong indicator of adaptation and preference. This statement is a reasonable interpretation of the given information. This statement is **True**.

    *   **C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.**
        *   The CA biotype moves from a high-raffinose environment (watermelon) to a low-raffinose environment (cotton).
        *   Enzyme activity is often regulated by substrate availability. A decrease in the substrate (raffinose) would lead to a decrease in the activity or synthesis of the enzyme that metabolizes it (galactosidase).
        *   The reasoning is sound and direct. This statement is **True**.

    *   **D. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.**
        *   The effect described (decreased galactosidase activity) is correct, as explained for choice C.
        *   However, the *cause* provided is different. It suggests "higher glucose levels in cotton" are the reason. While a mechanism called catabolite repression (where a simple sugar like glucose represses enzymes for other sugars) exists, it's a less direct explanation. The most direct cause is the lack of the enzyme's specific substrate, raffinose. The text indicates cotton is rich in *sucrose*, not necessarily free glucose. Therefore, this causal link is speculative and less accurate than the one in C. This makes the entire statement questionable.

    *   **E. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.**
        *   The MA biotype moves from a low-raffinose environment (cotton) to a high-raffinose environment (watermelon).
        *   The sudden availability of the substrate (raffinose) would induce the production and activity of the galactosidase enzyme.
        *   The reasoning is sound and direct. This statement is **True**.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Statements A, B, C, and E are all logically consistent with the provided information.
    *   Statement D provides a correct outcome (decreased activity) but attributes it to a less direct and unsubstantiated cause ("higher glucose levels") instead of the primary cause identified in C ("lower raffinose levels"). This makes statement D the one that is not true because its explanation for the phenomenon is flawed.
