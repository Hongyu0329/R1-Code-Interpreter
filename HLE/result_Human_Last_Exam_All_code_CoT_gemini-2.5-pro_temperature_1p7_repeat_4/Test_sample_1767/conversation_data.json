    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For non-interacting or weakly interacting systems, these invariants are additive. When two Chern insulators are brought into contact with a negligible barrier, they effectively form a single larger system.\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** The Chern number of the combined system (the junction), let's call it `C_total`, is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems (`C1` and `C2`).\n    *   `C_total = C1 + C2`\n3.  **Assign values:** According to the problem statement, both insulators have a Chern number of 1.\n    *   `C1 = 1`\n    *   `C2 = 1`\n4.  **Calculate the result:**\n    *   `C_total = 1 + 1 = 2`\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a simple Python script to define the individual Chern numbers, calculate their sum, and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is a topological invariant.
