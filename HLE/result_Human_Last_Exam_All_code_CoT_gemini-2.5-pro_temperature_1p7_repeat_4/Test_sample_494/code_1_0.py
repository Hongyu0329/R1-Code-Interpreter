    print("Step 1: Understand the core principles.")
    print("The key principle is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which dictates the symmetry of the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.")
    print(" - For identical fermions (like ordinary protons, spin 1/2), the wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - For identical bosons (like the exotic protons, spin 0), the wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.")

    print("Step 2: Define the system: Exotic Ammonia (NH3).")
    print("This molecule has three identical 'exotic hydrogen' nuclei. Since they have spin 0, they are bosons.")
    print("Therefore, the total wavefunction (Psi_total) must be SYMMETRIC under the exchange of any two of these exotic hydrogens.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 3: Decompose the total wavefunction and analyze symmetries.")
    print("Psi_total = Psi_electronic * Psi_vibrational * Psi_rotational * Psi_nuclear_spin")
    print("\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each part with respect to exchanging two exotic hydrogens:")
    print(" - Psi_nuclear_spin: For three spin-0 particles, there is only one possible combination. This wavefunction is always SYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - Psi_electronic: The ground state electronic wavefunction is SYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - Psi_vibrational: The tunneling motion itself creates a pair of states: one is SYMMETRIC (+ state) and one is ANTISYMMETRIC (- state).")
    print(" - Psi_rotational: The symmetry can be either SYMMETRIC or ANTISYMMETRIC, depending on the rotational quantum state of the molecule.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 4: Apply the Pauli Principle to find allowed states.")
    print("The overall symmetry must be SYMMETRIC (S).")
    print("S(total) = S(electronic) * S(vibrational) * S(rotational) * S(nuclear_spin)")
    print("Symmetric = Symmetric * S(vibrational) * S(rotational) * Symmetric")
    print("This simplifies to: S(vibrational) * S(rotational) must be Symmetric.")
    print("\nThis condition allows for two possibilities for the allowed energy levels:")
    print(" 1. Symmetric (vibrational) * Symmetric (rotational) = Symmetric (Allowed)")
    print(" 2. Antisymmetric (vibrational) * Antisymmetric (rotational) = Symmetric (Allowed)")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The potential barrier that causes tunneling is an electronic property and is unchanged.")
    print("The tunneling phenomenon manifests as an energy splitting between the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states.")
    print("As shown in Step 4, both the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states are allowed because they can pair with appropriate rotational states to satisfy the Pauli Principle for bosons.")
    print("Since both energy levels of the tunneling doublet exist, the energy splitting is real, and the molecule will exhibit tunneling.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would exhibit tunneling.")
