    "To find the missing number in the sequence, I will analyze the relationships between the numbers.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  I will first test for a simple arithmetic or geometric relationship between consecutive numbers. Finding none, I will explore a more complex recursive relationship.\n2.  I'll test the hypothesis `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c_n`, where `a_n` is the term at position `n` and `c_n` is some value.\n3.  I'll calculate the sequence of `c_n` for the given numbers:\n    *   For `23`: `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`. So, the subtracted value is `10`.\n    *   For `51`: `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`. So, the subtracted value is `18`.\n    *   For `119`: `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`. So, the subtracted value is `34`.\n4.  This reveals a new sequence of subtracted values: `[10, 18, 34]`. I will then find the pattern in this new sequence.\n5.  I'll calculate the differences between consecutive terms in this new sequence: `18 - 10 = 8` and `34 - 18 = 16`. The difference doubles each time (`8, 16, ...`).\n6.  The next difference will be `16 * 2 = 32`. Therefore, the next subtracted value will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n7.  Finally, I will apply the rule to find the missing term in the original sequence: `3 * 119 - 66`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle.\n    The pattern is a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c_{n-1}, where c follows its own pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {', '.join(map(str, sequence))}, ()\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Let's find the pattern.\n    # We observe that a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c\n    # Let's find the sequence of 'c'\n    c_values = []\n    print(\"Step 1: Discover the underlying pattern.\")\n    # The pattern starts from the 3rd term in the sequence\n    # For a_3 = 23\n    c1 = 3 * sequence[1] - sequence[2]\n    c_values.append(c1)\n    print(f\"{sequence[2]} = 3 * {sequence[1]} - {c1}\")\n\n    # For a_4 = 51\n    c2 = 3 * sequence[2] - sequence[3]\n    c_values.append(c2)\n    print(f\"{sequence[3]} = 3 * {sequence[2]} - {c2}\")\n\n    # For a_5 = 119\n    c3 = 3 * sequence[3] - sequence[4]\n    c_values.append(c3)\n    print(f\"{sequence[4]} = 3 * {sequence[3]} - {c3}\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of subtracted numbers is: {c_values}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Now let's find the pattern in the c_values sequence\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the sequence of subtracted numbers.\")\n    diff1 = c_values[1] - c_values[0]\n    print(f\"The difference between the first two subtracted numbers is: {c_values[1]} - {c_values[0]} = {diff1}\")\n    diff2 = c_values[2] - c_values[1]\n    print(f\"The difference between the next two is: {c_values[2]} - {c_values[1]} = {diff2}\")\n    print(\"The difference doubles each time (8, 16, ...).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Calculate the next difference and the next c value\n    print(\"Step 3: Predict the next terms.\")\n    next_diff = diff2 * 2\n    print(f\"The next difference will be: {diff2} * 2 = {next_diff}\")\n    next_c = c_values[-1] + next_diff\n    print(f\"The next subtracted number will be: {c_values[-1]} + {next_diff} = {next_c}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the next number in the original sequence\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the final missing number in the sequence.\")\n    next_term = 3 * sequence[-1] - next_c\n    print(f\"Next term = 3 * {sequence[-1]} - {next_c} = {3 * sequence[-1]} - {next_c} = {next_term}\")\n    \n    # Print the final completed sequence\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    final_sequence = sequence + [next_term]\n    print(f\"The final sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, sequence))}, ({next_term})\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
