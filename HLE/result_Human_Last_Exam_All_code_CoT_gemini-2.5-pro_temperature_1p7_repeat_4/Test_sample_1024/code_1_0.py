# The final answer is determined by solving each part of the puzzle
# and using the mathematical constraint to confirm the solution.

# (A) The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School",
# where misleading tracks were made to look like those of a "cow".
# This corresponds to option 6.
a = 6

# (C) The Nabokov work that most involved "intricate back-referencing"
# was his monumental translation of and commentary on "Eugene Onegin".
# This corresponds to option 7.
c = 7

# The constraint states the sum of the answers (a + b + c) must be a multiple of 8.
# a + c = 6 + 7 = 13.
# The next multiple of 8 is 16. Therefore, b must be 16 - 13 = 3.
b = 3

# (B) We verify that b=3, "education vs mis-education", is a core theme.
# The novel, set in an academic world, features a commentator (Kinbote)
# providing a massive and fraudulent scholarly interpretation (mis-education)
# of a colleague's (Shade's) poem. This fits perfectly.

# The final answer is the sequence of the three numbers.
