    "This is a specialized question from the field of neurobiology. While I cannot dynamically query a live neuroanatomical database with a simple script, I can codify the established scientific knowledge into a Python script and print the answer for you.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the brain lobe of interest, which is the \"palliovisceral lobe\".\n2.  Create a list containing the names of the brain regions known to be situated posteriorly to this lobe in cuttlefish.\n3.  Write a Python script that will print this information in a clear and readable format.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    This information is based on established neuroanatomical knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a large, unpaired lobe in the posterior\n    # subesophageal mass of the cuttlefish brain. It controls the viscera,\n    # chromatophores, and the funnel/mantle for jet propulsion.\n    \n    # The lobes located directly posterior to it are primarily involved\n    # in controlling the fins for locomotion and stabilization.\n    \n    posterior_adjacent_lobes = [\n        \"Posterior pedal lobe (often called the fin lobes)\",\n        \"Magnocellular lobe\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Print the result in a formatted way.\n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for region in posterior_adjacent_lobes:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the Posterior pedal lobe (fin lobes) and the Magnocellular lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
