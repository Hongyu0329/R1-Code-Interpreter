    Yes, it follows that f = 0. Here is a step-by-step argument using the properties of the Fourier transform.

    Step 1: The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives
    Let f(x) be a function in the Schwartz space, S(R). Its Fourier transform, denoted by F(f) or f_hat(xi), is defined as:
        f_hat(xi) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx
    A key property of the Fourier transform is that it maps the Schwartz space to itself. So, f_hat(xi) is also a Schwartz function.
    Because f(x) is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign. The k-th derivative of f_hat(xi) is:
        f_hat^(k)(xi) = d^k/dxi^k [f_hat(xi)] = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx

    Step 2: Connecting Derivatives to Moments
    Let's evaluate the k-th derivative at xi = 0:
        f_hat^(k)(0) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k dx
    We can pull the constant term out of the integral:
        f_hat^(k)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^k * integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx
    The integral on the right is the k-th moment of f(x).

    Step 3: Using the Given Condition
    The problem states that for all k in N (natural numbers, let's assume k >= 1), the k-th moment is zero:
        integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx = 0
    Plugging this into our equation from Step 2:
        f_hat^(k)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^k * 0
    Therefore, we have:
        f_hat^(k)(0) = 0  for all k >= 1.

    (Note: If the condition also holds for k=0, then f_hat(0) = 0 as well. As we will see, this is not required.)

    Step 4: The Analytic Property of f_hat
    A crucial theorem states that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function f(x) can be analytically continued to an entire function g(z) on the complex plane C. This means f_hat(xi) is the restriction of an entire function g(z) to the real line.
        g(z) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*z) dx
    
    Step 5: The Taylor Series of an Entire Function
    An entire function is equal to its Taylor series expansion about any point. Let's expand g(z) around z = 0:
        g(z) = sum for k=0 to inf of [g^(k)(0) / k!] * z^k
    The coefficients are the derivatives at the origin. We know:
        g^(k)(0) = f_hat^(k)(0) = 0 for k >= 1.
    So, the Taylor series becomes:
        g(z) = g(0) + sum for k=1 to inf of [0 / k!] * z^k = g(0)
    This means that g(z) is a constant function for all z in C.
    Its restriction to the real line, f_hat(xi), must also be a constant:
        f_hat(xi) = C

    Step 6: The Contradiction and Conclusion
    We know from Step 1 that f_hat(xi) is a Schwartz function. A defining property of Schwartz functions is that they must decay rapidly at infinity, i.e., lim |xi|->inf f_hat(xi) = 0.
    The only constant function C that satisfies this condition is C = 0.
    Therefore, it must be that:
        f_hat(xi) = 0 for all xi.
    
    Finally, the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on S(R), which means it is a one-to-one mapping. If F(f) = 0, then the original function f must also be the zero function.
    
    Conclusion: f(x) = 0 for all x.
