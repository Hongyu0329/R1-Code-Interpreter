        "(e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)'. This is a flawed premise. ECDSA is designed to be "
        "'existentially UNforgeable under chosen-message attacks' (EUF-CMA), which is the standard "
        "security goal. An 'existentially forgeable' scheme is, by definition, insecure. However, "
        "we will proceed by evaluating the truth of each statement as written."

        "Analysis: This statement is FALSE. Standard ECDSA signatures are malleable. A signature is a "
        "pair of numbers (r, s). If (r, s) is a valid signature, then (r, -s mod n) where n is the order "
        "of the curve, is also a valid signature for the same message. An adversary can easily compute "
        "-s mod n from a given signature. Therefore, an adversary can create a new, different, valid "
        "signature for the *same* message with a probability of 1, which is not negligible."

        "Analysis: This statement is TRUE. The security of the secret key in ECDSA relies on the "
        "hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). It is computationally "
        "infeasible to derive the secret key 'sk' from the public key 'pk' or from a valid "

        "small, known set (e.g., 'yes'/'no'), an adversary could simply call the public Verify function "
