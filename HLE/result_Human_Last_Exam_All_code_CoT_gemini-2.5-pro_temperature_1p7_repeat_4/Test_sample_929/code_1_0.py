    print("Analyzing Behavioral Patterns for Plant Fitness (Pollination)")
    print("==========================================================")
    print("Goal: Identify the behavior with the greatest positive effect on plant fitness.")
    print("Key Assumption: Plant fitness is primarily driven by successful cross-pollination, which requires an insect to visit many different flowers.")
    print("\nEthogram Codes:")
    print("1, 2: Investigation (non-contact, e.g., flying near flower)")
    print("3, 4: Interaction (contact, e.g., landing on flower)")
    print("5, 6: Feeding (a specific type of interaction, consumes nectar)")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------")
    print("\nEvaluating Answer Choices:\n")

    # Choice A: 4-3 >> 6-5 (Interaction duration >> Feeding duration)
    print("A. Interaction duration (4-3) is much greater than Feeding duration (6-5)")
    print("   Meaning: The insect spends a lot of time touching the flower but very little time feeding.")
    print("   Impact: This could indicate a 'nectar robber' or an insect that is not efficiently finding nectar. Since feeding is the primary behavior rewarded by the plant to ensure pollination, this pattern is not optimal.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: Low.\n")

    # Choice B: 6-5 >> 4-3 (Feeding duration >> Interaction duration)
    print("B. Feeding duration (6-5) is much greater than Interaction duration (4-3)")
    print("   Meaning: The duration of feeding is much greater than the total duration of interaction.")
    print("   Impact: This is logically impossible. Feeding (events 5-6) is a type of interaction (events 3-4), so its duration cannot be greater than the total interaction time.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: Invalid Pattern.\n")

    # Choice C: 4-3 >> 2-1 (Interaction duration >> Investigation duration)
    print("C. Interaction duration (4-3) is much greater than Investigation duration (2-1)")
    print("   Meaning: The insect makes very long visits to each flower relative to the time spent finding them.")
    print("   Impact: While long visits might be good for picking up a lot of pollen from a single flower, they reduce the total number of different flowers visited per hour, which is crucial for cross-pollination.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: Moderate.\n")

    # Choice D: n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour (Frequency of feeding starts >> Frequency of interaction starts)
    print("D. Frequency of feeding starts n(5)/hr is much greater than frequency of interaction starts n(3)/hr")
    print("   Meaning: The insect starts feeding more times than it makes contact with flowers.")
    print("   Impact: This is logically impossible. A feeding event cannot begin without an interaction (contact) having started first.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: Invalid Pattern.\n")

    # Choice E: n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour (Frequency of investigations >> Frequency of interactions)
    print("E. Frequency of investigations n(1)/hr is much greater than frequency of interactions n(3)/hr")
    print("   Meaning: The insect investigates (approaches) far more flowers than it actually lands on.")
    print("   Impact: This describes an inefficient visitor that rarely makes contact. This behavior would result in very little pollination.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: Very Low.\n")

    # Choice F: n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour (Frequency of interactions >> Frequency of investigations)
    print("F. Frequency of interactions n(3)/hr is much greater than frequency of investigations n(1)/hr")
    print("   Meaning: Interpreted as a high frequency of interactions (n(3)/hour). This implies the insect efficiently moves from flower to flower, initiating many interactions.")
    print("   Impact: Visiting a large number of flowers per hour (high interaction frequency) is the most effective strategy for an insect to facilitate cross-pollination. This is the hallmark of an ideal pollinator.")
    print("   Fitness Effect: High.\n")

    print("----------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: Pattern 'F' describes an insect that visits a high number of flowers per hour. This high frequency of interaction is the most critical factor for maximizing cross-pollination and therefore has the greatest positive effect on plant fitness.")
