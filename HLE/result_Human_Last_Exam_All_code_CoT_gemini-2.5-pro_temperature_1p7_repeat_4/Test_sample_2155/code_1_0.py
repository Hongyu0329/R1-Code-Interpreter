# This script identifies and prints the two place names mentioned by Father Brown.
# The story is "The Wrong Shape" by G.K. Chesterton.
# In it, Father Brown reflects on a twisted form of devotion, saying:
# "It's a long road from Coventry to Cromer..."
# Both place names begin with the paired consonants "Cr".

place_one = "Coventry"
place_two = "Cromer"
