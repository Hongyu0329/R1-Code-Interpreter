    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{p/q}\\)**: The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) associated with a rational number \\(p/q\\) is an integer that satisfies the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\) with two other Markov numbers. These numbers can be generated via a recursive relationship on the Farey tree of rationals.\n\n2.  **The Farey Tree Recursion**: The Farey tree starts with the fractions \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\). New fractions are generated by taking the mediant of two existing \"parent\" fractions: if \\(p_1/q_1\\) and \\(p_2/q_2\\) are Farey neighbors (meaning \\(p_2q_1 - p_1q_2 = 1\\)), their mediant is \\((p_1+p_2)/(q_1+q_2)\\). The Markov numbers corresponding to these three fractions form a Markov triple. The recursion rule is:\n    \\(m_{(p_1+p_2)/(q_1+q_2)} = 3 \\cdot m_{p_1/q_1} \\cdot m_{p_2/q_2} - m_{|p_1-p_2|/|q_1-q_2|}\\)\n    The third term is the Markov number of the \"grandparent\" fraction.\n\n3.  **Find the Parents of \\(4/7\\)**: To compute \\(m_{4/7}\\), we first need to find its \"parents\" in the Farey tree, i.e., two fractions \\(p_1/q_1\\) and \\(p_2/q_2\\) whose mediant is \\(4/7\\). This involves solving the Diophantine equation \\(4q - 7p = \\pm 1\\). The solution yields parents \\(3/5\\) and \\(1/2\\).\n\n4.  **Recursive Calculation**: We will apply the recursion, which requires us to compute \\(m_{3/5}\\), \\(m_{1/2}\\), and the grandparent's Markov number, \\(m_{2/3}\\). This process continues until we reach the base cases of the recursion.\n    *   Base cases: \\(m_{0/1} = 1\\), \\(m_{1/1} = 1\\), and by applying the rule for the first mediant \\(1/2\\), we find \\(m_{1/2} = 2\\).\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to automate this recursive calculation using memoization (a dictionary to store already computed values) to avoid recomputing the same values. The code will also find the parents of a given fraction.\n\n6.  **Final Output**: The script will compute \\(m_{4/7}\\) and print the final calculation step as an equation, showing the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmemo = {\n    (0, 1): 1,\n    (1, 1): 1,\n    (1, 2): 2\n}\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns (gcd, x, y) such that a*x + b*y = gcd.\"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        return (b, 0, 1)\n    d, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1\n    y = x1\n    return d, x, y\n\ndef find_parents(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds parent fractions (p1/q1, p2/q2) for p/q in the Farey tree.\n    Solves the Diophantine equation q*x - p*y = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if p == 1 and q == 2:\n        return (0, 1), (1, 1)\n\n    # We need to solve q*x - p*y = 1 for p1=x, q1=y\n    # This is equivalent to p*y - q*x = -1\n    gcd, y, x_neg, = extended_gcd(p, q) # ax+by=gcd -> py-qx=-1 requires different variables\n    \n    # We want to solve p*s - q*r = 1 (or -1)\n    # Using EEA on (q,p): qx - py = 1\n    # Note: p, q must be coprime, so gcd is 1.\n    g, x, y_neg = extended_gcd(q, -p)\n    \n    # We have q*x + (-p)*y_neg = 1 => q*x - p*y_neg = 1\n    # One solution is (r, s) = (x, y_neg)\n    # We need 0 < r < p and 0 < s < q\n    # General solution: r_k = x - k*p, s_k = y_neg + k*q\n    # We need to find k. x - k*p > 0 => k < x/p.\n    k = math.floor((x-1)/p)\n    \n    r1 = x - k * p\n    s1 = y_neg + k * q\n    \n    # Check for validity\n    if not (0 < r1 < p and 0 < s1 < q):\n        # if qr-ps=-1, parents are (r,s) and (p-r, q-s)\n        # if ps-qr=-1, parents are (p-r,q-s) and (r,s)\n        # let's find a solution to ps-qr=1 -> p*s - q*r = 1\n        g, s, r_neg = extended_gcd(p, -q)\n        r = -r_neg\n        k = math.floor((s-1)/q)\n        s1 = s - k*q\n        r1 = r + k*p\n        \n    p1, q1 = r1, s1\n    p2, q2 = p - p1, q - q1\n\n    return (p1, q1), (p2, q2)\n\n\ndef get_m(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively computes the generalized Markov number m_{p/q} using a Farey tree recurrence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if (p, q) in memo:\n        return memo[(p, q)]\n\n    # Ensure fraction is in simplest form and p < q\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(p, q)\n    p, q = p // common_divisor, q // common_divisor\n    if p > q:\n        p, q = q, p\n    if p/q > 0.5:\n        p,q = q-p, q # Use symmetry m_{p/q} = m_{1-p/q}\n\n    if (p, q) in memo:\n        return memo[(p, q)]\n    \n    # Find parent fractions\n    (p1, q1), (p2, q2) = find_parents(p, q)\n\n    # Find grandparent fraction\n    gp, gq = abs(p1 - p2), abs(q1 - q2)\n\n    # Recursive calls\n    m1 = get_m(p1, q1)\n    m2 = get_m(p2, q2)\n    m0 = get_m(gp, gq)\n\n    # The recurrence relation\n    result = 3 * m1 * m2 - m0\n    memo[(p, q)] = result\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    p_target, q_target = 4, 7\n    \n    # Get values needed for the final equation\n    parents = find_parents(p_target, q_target)\n    (p1, q1), (p2, q2) = parents\n    \n    grand_p, grand_q = abs(p1 - p2), abs(q1 - q2)\n\n    m_target = get_m(p_target, q_target)\n    m1 = get_m(p1, q1)\n    m2 = get_m(p2, q2)\n    m0 = get_m(grand_p, grand_q)\n    \n    print(f\"The generalized Markov number for the rational {p_target}/{q_target} is m_{{{p_target}/{q_target}}}.\")\n    print(\"This number is found using a recursive formula on the Farey tree.\")\n    print(f\"The parents of {p_target}/{q_target} are {p1}/{q1} and {p2}/{q2}.\")\n    print(f\"The 'grandparent' is {grand_p}/{grand_q}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe corresponding Markov numbers are:\")\n    print(f\"m_{{{p1}/{q1}}} = {m1}\")\n    print(f\"m_{{{p2}/{q2}}} = {m2}\")\n    print(f\"m_{{{grand_p}/{grand_q}}} = {m0}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final computation is:\")\n    print(f\"m_{{{p_target}/{q_target}}} = 3 * m_{{{p1}/{q1}}} * m_{{{p2}/{q2}}} - m_{{{grand_p}/{grand_q}}}\")\n    print(f\"m_{{{p_target}/{q_target}}} = 3 * {m1} * {m2} - {m0} = {m_target}\")\n    \n    final_markov_number = m_target\n    # This checks if the result is a valid Markov number triple with its parents.\n    is_valid_triple = m1**2 + m2**2 + m_target**2 == 3 * m1 * m2 * m_target\n    #print(f\"\\nVerification: ({m1}, {m2}, {m_target}) is a Markov triple: {is_valid_triple}\")\n    \n\n```\n<<<169>>>"
