    reasoning_points = [
        "1. Promotion of a Memory Phenotype: IL-15 is a critical cytokine for the survival, proliferation, and maintenance of memory T cells. Culturing CAR T cells in IL-15 enriches for a less differentiated, more persistent population (e.g., central memory or stem cell memory T cells).",
        "2. Increased 'Fitness' and Proliferative Capacity: These memory-like CAR T cells are considered more 'fit.' They have a greater capacity to expand into a large population of effector cells when they encounter their target antigen in the body.",
        "3. Heightened Effector Function: A primary function of activated CAR T cells is to release effector cytokines like Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-2 to orchestrate an anti-tumor immune response. Because the IL-15-conditioned cells are more robust and can mount a more potent response, they are predicted to release these cytokines at higher levels."
    ]

    conclusion = "\nConclusion: The inclusion of IL-15 in the manufacturing process creates a more potent CAR T cell product. This increased potency would be directly measurable as a greater release of key effector cytokines when the cells are activated."
