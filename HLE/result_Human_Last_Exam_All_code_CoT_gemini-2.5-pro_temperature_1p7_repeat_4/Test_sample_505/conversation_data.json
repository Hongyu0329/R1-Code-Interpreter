    "To solve this, we need to understand how the number of logical qubits in a surface code relates to its topology, specifically its boundaries (or \"holes\").\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze a Single Patch:** First, we'll determine the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with two holes.\n2.  **Use the Topological Formula:** The number of logical qubits `k` in a planar code (which has a topological genus `g=0`) with `b` boundaries is given by the formula `k = b - 1`.\n3.  **Count the Boundaries:** A standard, simple patch of surface code (with no added holes) is topologically equivalent to a surface with 2 boundaries. Each hole added to the patch creates one additional boundary.\n4.  **Calculate for a Single Patch:** We will calculate the total number of boundaries `b` for one patch with its two holes, and then use the formula to find the number of logical qubits `k` for that patch.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** Since the two patches are separate and independent, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits in two patches of surface code,\n    each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
