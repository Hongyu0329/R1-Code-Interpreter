# A plan to calculate the total number of equivalence classes.

# Step 1: Determine the number of equivalence classes for each component space.
# A space where any point can be mapped to any other point by an auto-homeomorphism
# has exactly one equivalence class. Such a space is called homogeneous.

# The torus is a homogeneous space.
num_classes_torus = 1

# The sphere is a homogeneous space.
num_classes_sphere = 1

# The real line is a homogeneous space.
num_classes_real_line = 1

# A three-point discrete space is homogeneous under the action of its permutation group.
num_classes_3_point_discrete = 1

# A five-point discrete space is also homogeneous under its permutation group.
num_classes_5_point_discrete = 1

# Step 2: The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of classes
# from each topologically distinct component.
total_classes = (
    num_classes_torus
    + num_classes_sphere
    + num_classes_real_line
    + num_classes_3_point_discrete
    + num_classes_5_point_discrete
)

# Step 3: Print the breakdown and the final result.
