    print("\nChoice C: A spider spinning her web amongst plants")
    print("   - Evaluation: This is a strong candidate, as a spider 'knits' a 'lace'-like web. However, the description of 'cold' and 'glass' is more specific to frost. Most importantly, the final image of melting ('slip into a star-mirrored bewitchment') is a much better fit for frost than for a broken spider web.")
    print("\nChoices B, D, and E:")
