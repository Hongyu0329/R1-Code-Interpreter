    print("Principle 3: The key feature of a CM is that its waveform inverts (becomes a mirror image) when the sound stimulus polarity is changed from 'rarefaction' to 'condensation'.")
    print("Principle 4: Due to the nerve issue, the actual ABR neural waves (like Peaks I, III, V) are absent or severely distorted.")
