    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. Then, we calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus. The total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Functions**: We will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The equilibrium point (Qe, Pe) is where supply equals demand. Since the resulting equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` is difficult to solve analytically, we will use a numerical method (`root_scalar` from the SciPy library) to find the equilibrium quantity (Qe). The equilibrium price (Pe) is then found by substituting Qe into either the supply or demand function. Note that the supply function is only defined for `Q > (2)^(1/3)`.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus**:\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the integral: `CS = ∫[from 0 to Qe] (Demand(Q)) dQ - Qe * Pe`.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the integral: `PS = Qe * Pe - ∫[from Q_min to Qe] (Supply(Q)) dQ`, where `Q_min` is the minimum quantity for which supply is defined (`(2)^(1/3)`).\n    *   We will use numerical integration (`quad` from the SciPy library) to compute these areas.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total Welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus: `Total Welfare = CS + PS`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
