    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard means the edges wrap around. A queen's attack on a row, column, or diagonal can cross the board's edges and reappear on the opposite side.\n2.  **Brute-force Approach:** Since the board (25 cells) and the number of queens (4) are small, we can check every possible placement of the 4 queens.\n3.  **Generate Placements:** The most efficient way to get all unique placements is to use Python's `itertools.combinations` function. This will give us every possible group of 4 cells out of the 25 available cells.\n4.  **Check for Attacks:** For each group of 4 cells (a potential solution), we will check if any two queens attack each other. The conditions for two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` to attack on a `N x N` toroidal board are:\n    *   **Row attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal attack:** `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n5.  **Count Solutions:** I will use a counter that starts at zero. If a placement has no attacking queens, the counter is incremented.\n6.  **Print the Result:** The final script will print the total count of valid placements. The output will explicitly state the board size, the number of queens, and the final calculated number of ways, which satisfies the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place a given number of non-attacking\n    queens on a toroidal chessboard of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    BOARD_SIZE = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n\n    # Create a list of all possible cell coordinates, e.g., (0, 0), (0, 1), ...\n    cells = [(r, c) for r in range(BOARD_SIZE) for c in range(BOARD_SIZE)]\n\n    # Generate all unique combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS on the board cells\n    potential_placements = itertools.combinations(cells, NUM_QUEENS)\n\n    solution_count = 0\n    # Iterate through each combination of queen placements\n    for placement in potential_placements:\n        is_valid = True\n        # Check all pairs of queens within the current placement for attacks\n        for queen1, queen2 in itertools.combinations(placement, 2):\n            r1, c1 = queen1\n            r2, c2 = queen2\n\n            # Check for attacks on the toroidal board\n            # 1.
