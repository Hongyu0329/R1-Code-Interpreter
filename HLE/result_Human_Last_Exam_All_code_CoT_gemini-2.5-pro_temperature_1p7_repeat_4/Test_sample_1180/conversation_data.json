    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Curve:** $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n    *   **Valuation:** We're working above the prime `p=2`, with the valuation `v` normalized such that `v(2)=1`. This is the standard 2-adic valuation.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the \"thickness of the double point of the stable reduction\".\n    *   **Output:** A Python script that performs the calculation and prints the equation and the final answer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Thickness of a Double Point\":**\n    *   The term \"thickness\" in the context of stable reduction of curves is a technical concept from arithmetic geometry. It measures how \"bad\" a singularity is. For a node (a simple double point where two components cross) formed during the reduction process, the thickness is an integer that quantifies how \"close\" the components are. A larger thickness means the singularity is worse.\n    *   Directly computing this by building the stable model (a sequence of blow-ups and normalizations) is extremely complex. It requires advanced theory and algorithms usually implemented in specialized computer algebra systems.\n    *   Given the format of the request, there is likely a more direct, algorithmic method to find this integer without building the full geometric model.\n\n3.  **Search for a Simpler Method:**\n    *   A key tool for studying polynomials over `p-adic` fields is the **Newton Polygon**. The Newton polygon of a polynomial reveals the valuations of its roots. This is directly related to how the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve cluster, which in turn determines the structure of the stable reduction.\n    *   Let's analyze the polynomial on the right-hand side, $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n    *   The Newton polygon method is a good candidate because it's a fundamental, computable tool that uses exactly the information provided (the coefficients and the prime `p=2`).\n\n4.  **Execute the Newton Polygon Method:**\n    *   **Step 4.1: Identify the points.** The Newton polygon is constructed in a 2D plane. For a polynomial $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i$, we plot the points $(i, v_p(a_i))$ for all terms where $a_i \\neq 0$.\n    *   Our polynomial is $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The prime is $p=2$.\n    *   The terms are:\n        *   $a_5 x^5$: The coefficient is $a_5 = 2$. The valuation is $v_2(2) = 1$. The point is $(5, 1)$.\n        *   $a_3 x^3$: The coefficient is $a_3 = 2$. The valuation is $v_2(2) = 1$. The point is $(3, 1)$.\n        *   $a_0 x^0$: The coefficient is $a_0 = 1$. The valuation is $v_2(1) = 0$. The point is $(0, 0)$.\n    *   So, we have the points: `(0, 0)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(5, 1)`.\n\n    *   **Step 4.2: Find the lower convex hull.** Imagine a rubber band stretched around these points from below. We need to find the sequence of line segments that form this lower boundary.\n        *   Let's consider the line segment connecting the two endpoints, `(0, 0)` and `(5, 1)`. The equation of this line is $y = \\frac{1}{5}x$.\n        *   Now, we check if the intermediate point, `(3, 1)`, lies above or below this line.\n        *   At $x=3$, the line's y-value is $\\frac{1}{5} \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n        *   The point `(3, 1)` has a y-value of `1`.\n        *   Since $1 > \\frac{3}{5}$, the point `(3, 1)` lies *above* the segment connecting the endpoints.\n        *   Therefore, the lower convex hull consists of just one single segment: from `(0, 0)` to `(5, 1)`.\n\n    *   **Step 4.3: Calculate the slope.** The slope of this segment is $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1 - 0}{5 - 0} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The slopes of the Newton polygon tell us about the valuations of the roots of the polynomial. A slope of `m` corresponds to roots with valuation `-m`. Here, all 5 roots of $f(x)$ have 2-adic valuation $-(-1/5) = 1/5$. (Note: We are working in an extension field where $v(root)=1/5$ makes sense).\n    *   The fact that the valuations are fractional (denominator 5) indicates that a ramified field extension of degree 5 is required to \"see\" the structure of the roots properly. The degree of this ramification, 5, is a measure of the complexity of the reduction.\n    *   In many contexts of arithmetic geometry, this ramification index necessary to achieve a simpler reduction model is directly related to the \"thickness\" of the singularity in the original model. It is the most natural integer that arises from this analysis.\n    *   The problem implies a single \"double point\", and our analysis yields a single defining characteristic (the unique slope of the Newton polygon), which strengthens the connection. The denominator of this slope is the answer.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Python Code:**\n    *   The code should implement the Newton Polygon calculation.\n    *   It needs a function for the `v_2` valuation.\n    *   It needs to handle the polynomial's coefficients and exponents. A dictionary or a list of tuples is suitable.\n    *   The core logic will be to find the lower convex hull and its slope. For this specific case with 3 points, a direct check is simple. For a general case, an algorithm like the Graham scan or Monotone Chain would be needed, but that's overkill here.\n    *   Since we already determined the hull has one segment, the code can simply calculate the slope between the first and last points.\n    *   To get the denominator, we can use `fractions.Fraction` in Python to get the slope in its simplest form and then extract the denominator.\n    *   Finally, the code must print the original equation and the calculated thickness.\n\nThis detailed plan leads directly to the provided Python code, which is a concrete implementation of this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef get_valuation_at_2(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the valuation of an integer n at prime 2, v_2(n).\n    This is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n.\n    Returns infinity for v_2(0).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    count = 0\n    # On some systems, abs(n) can be faster before the loop\n    n = abs(n)\n    while n > 0 and n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve_thickness():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the thickness of the double point using the Newton Polygon method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is defined by z^2 = f(x)\n    # where f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1\n    poly_coeffs = {5: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1}\n\n    print(\"The curve is defined by the equation: z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1\")\n    print(\"We analyze the polynomial f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1 with respect to the prime p=2.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Get points for the Newton Polygon\n    # The points are (i, v_2(a_i)) for each term a_i*x^i\n    points = []\n    for power, coeff in poly_coeffs.items():\n        valuation = get_valuation_at_2(coeff)\n        points.append((power, valuation))\n    \n    # Sort points by power (x-coordinate) to make finding the hull easier\n    points.sort()\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe points (i, v_2(a_i)) for the Newton polygon are: {points}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the lower convex hull.\n    # For this specific set of points [(0, 0), (3, 1), (5, 1)], we can\n    # check if the intermediate point (3, 1) is above the line\n    # connecting the endpoints (0, 0) and (5, 1).\n    start_point = points[0]\n    end_point = points[-1]\n    \n    # The line connecting endpoints has slope (1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5.\n    # At x=3, the line's y is 3/5.
