    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Account for Identity Morphisms:** A category with two objects, let's call them A and B, must have at least two identity morphisms, `id_A` for object A and `id_B` for object B. These are part of the total of 4 morphisms.\n2.  **Distribute Non-Identity Morphisms:** This leaves `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(B,B)`, `Hom(A,B)`, and `Hom(B,A)`.\n3.  **Enumerate Distributions:** We will list all possible ways to distribute these 2 non-identity morphisms. Each distribution pattern corresponds to a potential category structure.\n4.  **Analyze Each Distribution:** For each pattern, we determine the number of valid, non-isomorphic categories that can be formed by defining the composition operation in a way that satisfies the category axioms (associativity and identity laws).\n5.  **Handle Isomorphisms:** We must group and count distributions that are isomorphic simply by relabeling the objects (swapping A and B).\n6.  **Sum the Results:** The total count is the sum of the counts from all distinct structural patterns.\n\nThis analysis breaks the problem down into two main types of categories: those where the objects are not connected (disconnected) and those where there are morphisms between the objects (connected).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that codifies this case-by-case analysis and calculates the total number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism.\n\n    The logic is based on classifying categories by how the 2 non-identity morphisms are distributed.\n    This gives rise to disconnected and connected cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms:\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # --- Disconnected Categories ---\n    # These are categories where Hom(A,B) and Hom(B,A) are empty.\n    # The category is a disjoint union of two one-object categories (monoids).\n\n    # Case 1: The 2 non-identity morphisms are in Hom(A,A).\n    # This creates a category that is a disjoint union of a 3-morphism monoid (at object A)\n    # and a 1-morphism monoid (at object B).\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is a known result from algebra.\n    num_monoids_order_3 = 7\n    print(f\"Number of categories from one 3-morphism monoid and one 1-morphism monoid: {num_monoids_order_3}\")\n\n    # Case 2: One non-identity morphism is in Hom(A,A) and the other in Hom(B,B).\n    # This creates a disjoint union of two 2-morphism monoids.\n    # There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the cyclic group C_2 and the trivial monoid M_2.\n    # We can form pairs: (C_2, C_2), (M_2, M_2), (C_2, M_2).\n    num_monoid_pairings = 3\n    print(f\"Number of categories from two 2-morphism monoids: {num_monoid_pairings}\")\n\n    total_disconnected = num_monoids_order_3 + num_monoid_pairings\n    print(f\"Total disconnected categories = {num_monoids_order_3} + {num_monoid_pairings} = {total_disconnected}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Connected Categories ---\n    # These are categories where there is at least one morphism between A and B.\n\n    # Case 3: Two parallel morphisms from A to B.
