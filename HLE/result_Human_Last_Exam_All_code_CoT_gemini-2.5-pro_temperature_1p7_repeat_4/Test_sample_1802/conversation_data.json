    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Channel and its Complement:** A $d$-dimensional Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ has $d^2$ Kraus operators, which we can write as $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$, where $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators and $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution. The complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, maps an input operator $X$ (from the qudit's operator space) to an operator on the $d^2$-dimensional environment space. The matrix elements of the output operator are given by $\\text{Tr}(E_{ab} X E_{cd}^\\dagger)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Channel Rank:** The rank of a channel is the dimension of the linear space spanned by all possible output operators. A standard way to calculate this is to choose a basis for the input space, compute the output for each basis element, and then find how many of those output operators are linearly independent.\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   The space of operators on a $d$-dimensional system has dimension $d^2$. We can use the Pauli operators $\\{U_{mn}\\}$ themselves as a basis for this input space.\n    *   For each input basis operator $U_{mn}$, we will compute the corresponding output matrix from the complementary channel, let's call it $K^{(mn)}$. The entries of this $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix are given by $(K^{(mn)})_{(ab),(cd)} = \\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{cd}} \\text{Tr}(U_{ab} U_{mn} U_{cd}^\\dagger)$.\n    *   To find the maximal rank, we assume all probabilities $p_{ab}$ are non-zero. The factors $\\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{cd}}$ do not affect the linear independence of the output matrices, only their magnitudes.\n    *   We then have a set of $d^2$ output matrices, $\\{K^{(mn)}\\}$. The rank of the channel is the number of linearly independent matrices in this set. This can be found by \"vectorizing\" each matrix and calculating the rank of the matrix formed by these vectors.\n\nTheoretical analysis shows that these $d^2$ output matrices are linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nThe following Python code provides a numerical verification of this result. It builds the operators for a given dimension `d`, calculates the output matrices for each basis input, and then computes the rank of the set.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a d-dimensional\n    Pauli channel by constructing the relevant operators and finding the rank\n    of the space of output matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the dimension of the qudit.
