    "Of course. Let's calculate the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics:** The system is a particle in a one-dimensional box. The probability of finding the particle in a given interval is determined by its wavefunction, ψ(x).\n2.  **State the Formula:** The probability `P` of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n3.  **Use the Correct Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n4.  **Set up the Integral:** We are given:\n    *   Quantum state `n = 2`\n    *   Lower limit `x1 = 0.495a`\n    *   Upper limit `x2 = 0.505a`\n    Substituting these values, the integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n5.  **Solve using Python:** We can solve this integral numerically. Notice that if we make a substitution `u = x/a`, then `dx = a du`. The limits of integration become `0.495` and `0.505`, and the `a` terms cancel out. The integral simplifies to:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πu) du`\n    We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to calculate this definite integral for high precision. The code will also print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a specific interval for a given quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constants for the problem\n    n = 2\n    x1 = 0.495  # Lower bound of the interval (relative to box length a)\n    x2 = 0.505  # Upper bound of the interval (relative to box length a)\n\n    # The probability density function, |ψ_n(x)|², after setting a=1.\n    # The 'a' term cancels out during integration.\n    # integrand = 2 * sin²(nπx)\n    def probability_density(x, n_val):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration\n    # quad returns the result and an estimate of the absolute error\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n,))\n\n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation we are solving is the simplified integral.\n    print(f\"The equation for the probability is the integral of the probability density:\")\n    print(f\"P = Integral from {x1} to {x2} of 2 * sin^2({n}*pi*x) dx\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n    \n    # This result makes physical sense: for n=2, there is a node\n    # (zero probability) at the center of the box (x=0.5a).\n    # Since the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is very small and centered\n    # on this node, the probability is expected to be very small, but not exactly zero.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<6.579669485799988e-06>>>"
