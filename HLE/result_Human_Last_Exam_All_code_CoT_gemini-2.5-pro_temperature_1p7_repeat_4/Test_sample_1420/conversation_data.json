    "In the context of the renormalization group and the epsilon expansion, we calculate the critical exponent for specific heat, α, for a system near its upper critical dimension.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Model and Dimensions:** We are considering a system in spatial dimension `d = 3`. The standard theoretical model for this (like the Ising model universality class) is the φ⁴ theory, for which the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The one-loop (first-order in ϵ) formula for the specific heat exponent α is `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`, where `n` is the number of components of the order parameter. For the most common case, the Ising model, we use `n = 1`.\n4.  **Calculate the Value:** We will substitute `d=3`, `d_c=4`, and `n=1` into the formula to find the value of α.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** A Python script will be written to perform this calculation and print the steps and the final result clearly.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha (α) using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for a system in d=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define parameters ---\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    # Upper critical dimension for the phi^4 model\n    d_c = 4\n    # Number of order parameter components (n=1 for the Ising model)\n    n = 1\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate epsilon ---\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α for a system with spatial dimension d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The Ising model universality class (n={n}) is assumed.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The expansion parameter is ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Apply the formula ---\n    print(\"The first-order formula for α is: (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values into the equation:\")\n\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator_part1 = n + 8\n    denominator = 2 * denominator_part1\n    \n    # Calculate the final value of alpha\n    alpha = numerator / denominator * epsilon\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the calculation steps and result ---\n    print(f\"α = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / (2 * {denominator_part1})\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_specific_heat_exponent()\n\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
