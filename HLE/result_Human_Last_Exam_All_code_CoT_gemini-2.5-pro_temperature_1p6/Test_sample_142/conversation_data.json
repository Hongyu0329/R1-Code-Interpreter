    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script that performs the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Count the Total Number of Electrons (N):**\n    First, we need to sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each (3 atoms total)\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    The total number of electrons, $N$, is the sum of these values.\n\n2.  **Count the Total Number of Basis Functions/Orbitals (M):**\n    Next, we determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set.\n    *   The `**` notation means polarization functions are added to all atoms: d-functions for heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-functions for hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **C, F (heavy atoms):** The 6-31G\\* basis provides 15 basis functions.\n    *   **H:** The 6-31G\\*\\* basis provides 5 basis functions.\n    *   **Si (heavy atom):** The 6-31G\\* basis provides 19 basis functions.\n    The total number of orbitals, $M$, is the sum of basis functions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of CSFs:**\n    The molecule has an even number of electrons, so its ground state is a singlet ($S=0$). The number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of a singlet state is given by the formula:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\binom{M}{N_\\alpha}^2 - \\binom{M}{N_\\alpha+1} \\times \\binom{M}{N_\\alpha-1}$\n    where:\n    *   $M$ is the number of orbitals.\n    *   $N_\\alpha$ is the number of alpha-spin electrons, which is $N/2$ for a singlet state.\n    *   $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient (\"n choose k\").\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_csfs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI\n    calculation of CH2SiHF with the 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the number of electrons (N)\n    electrons = {\n        'C': 6,\n        'H': 1,\n        'Si': 14,\n        'F': 9\n    }\n    # Molecule is CH2SiHF, so 1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F\n    num_C = 1\n    num_H = 3\n    num_Si = 1\n    num_F = 1\n    \n    N = (num_C * electrons['C'] +\n         num_H * electrons['H'] +\n         num_Si * electrons['Si'] +\n         num_F * electrons['F'])\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculating the total number of electrons (N)\")\n    print(f\"Electrons: C={electrons['C']}, H={electrons['H']}, Si={electrons['Si']}, F={electrons['F']}\")\n    print(f\"N = {num_C}*C + {num_H}*H + {num_Si}*Si + {num_F}*F = {N}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of basis functions (M) for 6-31G**\n    basis_functions = {\n        'C': 15,  # 6-31G*\n        'H': 5,   # 6-31G**\n        'Si': 19, # 6-31G*\n        'F': 15   # 6-31G*\n    }\n    \n    M = (num_C * basis_functions['C'] +\n         num_H * basis_functions['H'] +\n         num_Si * basis_functions['Si'] +\n         num_F * basis_functions['F'])\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculating the total number of basis functions (M)\")\n    print(f\"Basis functions (6-31G**): C={basis_functions['C']}, H={basis_functions['H']}, Si={basis_functions['Si']}, F={basis_functions['F']}\")\n    print(f\"M = {num_C}*C + {num_H}*H + {num_Si}*Si + {num_F}*F = {M}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of CSFs for a singlet state\n    # For a singlet state, N_alpha = N_beta = N / 2\n    N_alpha = N // 2\n    \n    print(f\"Step 3: Calculating the number of CSFs for a singlet state\")\n    print(f\"The molecule has a closed-shell singlet ground state (S=0).\")\n    print(f\"Number of alpha electrons (N_alpha) = N / 2 = {N_alpha}\")\n\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficients C(n, k)\n    try:\n        c1 = math.comb(M, N_alpha)\n        c2 = math.comb(M, N_alpha + 1)\n        c3 = math.comb(M, N_alpha - 1)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error in calculation: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the total number of CSFs\n    num_csfs = (c1**2) - (c2 * c3)\n\n    # For pretty printing\n    c1_str = f\"{c1:,}\"\n    c2_str = f\"{c2:,}\"\n    c3_str = f\"{c3:,}\"\n    c1_sq_str = f\"{c1**2:,}\"\n    c2c3_str = f\"{c2*c3:,}\"\n    num_csfs_str = f\"{num_csfs:,}\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe formula for the number of singlet CSFs is:\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = (C(M, N_alpha))^2 - C(M, N_alpha + 1) * C(M, N_alpha - 1)\")\n    print(f\"Where M = {M} and N_alpha = {N_alpha}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The required binomial coefficients are:\")\n    print(f\"C({M}, {N_alpha})     = {c1_str}\")\n    print(f\"C({M}, {N_alpha + 1})   = {c2_str}\")\n    print(f\"C({M}, {N_alpha - 1})   = {c3_str}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Plugging the numbers into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = ({c1_str})^2 - ({c2_str}) * ({c3_str})\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = {c1_sq_str} - {c2c3_str}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of CSFs is: {num_csfs_str}\")\n    \n    return num_csfs\n\n# Run the calculation\nfinal_answer = calculate_csfs()\n# The final answer is wrapped separately below as requested.\n```\n<<<14606502749924391936999944>>>"
