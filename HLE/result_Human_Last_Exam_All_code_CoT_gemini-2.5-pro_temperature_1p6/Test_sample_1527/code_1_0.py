    Solves for r^2 based on the geometric properties of the two tangent circles.
    
    1. The problem involves two lines y = x + 1 and y = -x + 5.
       These lines are perpendicular and intersect at P(2, 3).
    2. For a circle with radius R tangent to these two lines, the distance
       from its center to the intersection point P is R * sqrt(2).
    3. We have two circles: Circle C (radius r, center C) and Circle D (radius 2, center D).
       Both are assumed to be tangent to the two lines.
       So, dist(C, P) = r * sqrt(2) and dist(D, P) = 2 * sqrt(2).
    4. We consider the configuration where the centers C and D lie on different
       angle bisectors. This forms a right triangle CPD with the right angle at P.
       This configuration leads to a unique solution for r.
    5. The Pythagorean theorem gives: dist(C, D)^2 = dist(C, P)^2 + dist(D, P)^2
    6. Since the circles are tangent, dist(C, D) = r + 2.
    7. The equation is: (r + 2)^2 = (r*sqrt(2))^2 + (2*sqrt(2))^2
       r^2 + 4r + 4 = 2r^2 + 8
       r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0
       (r - 2)^2 = 0
       This gives a unique solution r = 2.
    8. The problem asks for r^2.
    """
    # From the derivation, we have the equation (r - 2)^2 = 0
    # The coefficients of the quadratic r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0 are a=1, b=-4, c=4.
    # The solution is r = 2.
    r = 2
    
    # Calculate r^2
    r_squared = r**2
