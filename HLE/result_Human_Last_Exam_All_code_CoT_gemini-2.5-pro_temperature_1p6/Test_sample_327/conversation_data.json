    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we can construct its canonical representation. This involves building a vertical stack of red and blue pieces. The value of such a stack is determined by summing the contribution of each piece from top to bottom. The $i$-th piece from the top contributes $\\frac{+1}{2^i}$ if it's red and $\\frac{-1}{2^i}$ if it's blue.\n\nWe can find the sequence of red and blue pieces using the following algorithm:\n1.  Let the target value be $x$. Initially, $x = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  Repeat the following steps until $x$ becomes 0:\n    *   If the current value of $x$ is positive, the next piece in the stack is **Red**. The new target value becomes $x' = 2x - 1$.\n    *   If the current value of $x$ is negative, the next piece in the stack is **Blue**. The new target value becomes $x' = 2x + 1$.\n3.  The total number of pieces is the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's apply this to $x_0 = \\frac{13}{16}$:\n*   **Step 1:** $x_0 = \\frac{13}{16}$ is positive. The first piece is **Red**.\n    $x_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{13}{16} - 1 = \\frac{26}{16} - \\frac{16}{16} = \\frac{10}{16} = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n*   **Step 2:** $x_1 = \\frac{5}{8}$ is positive. The second piece is **Red**.\n    $x_2 = 2 \\times \\frac{5}{8} - 1 = \\frac{10}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **Step 3:** $x_2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ is positive. The third piece is **Red**.\n    $x_3 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = \\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{4}{4} = -\\frac{2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   **Step 4:** $x_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}$ is negative. The fourth piece is **Blue**.\n    $x_4 = 2 \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0$.\n\nSince the value is now 0, the process stops. It took 4 steps, so 4 pieces are needed. The sequence of pieces is Red, Red, Red, Blue. The value is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8+4+2-1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe following Python code automates this process.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_number(n, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces and the equation for a dyadic rational\n    in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The numerator of the fraction.\n        d (int): The denominator of the fraction (must be a power of 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    if d & (d - 1) != 0 and d != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The denominator must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    target_fraction = Fraction(n, d)\n    current_value = target_fraction\n\n    # s_values will store +1 for Red pieces and -1 for Blue pieces.\n    s_values = []\n    \n    while current_value != 0:\n        if current_value > 0:\n            s_values.append(1)\n            current_value = 2 * current_value - 1\n        else: # current_value < 0\n            s_values.append(-1)\n            current_value = 2 * current_value + 1\n\n    num_pieces = len(s_values)\n\n    print(f\"The number {target_fraction} can be represented by {num_pieces} pieces in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\")\n    print(\"The corresponding equation is:\")\n    \n    # Construct the list of elements to be printed for the equation\n    equation_elements = []\n    for i, s in enumerate(s_values):\n        term_denom = 2**(i + 1)\n        if i == 0:\n            # Handle the first term, which doesn't have a preceding operator unless negative\n            if s < 0:\n                equation_elements.append(\"-\")\n            equation_elements.append(f\"1/{term_denom}\")\n        else:\n            # Handle subsequent terms with their operators\n            if s > 0:\n                equation_elements.append(\"+\")\n            else:\n                equation_elements.append(\"-\")\n            equation_elements.append(f\"1/{term_denom}\")\n            \n    equation_elements.append(\"=\")\n    equation_elements.append(str(target_fraction))\n    \n    # Print the equation with spaces between each element\n    print(*equation_elements)\n\n# Solve for the given number 13/16\nsolve_hackenbush_number(13, 16)\n```\n<<<4>>>"
