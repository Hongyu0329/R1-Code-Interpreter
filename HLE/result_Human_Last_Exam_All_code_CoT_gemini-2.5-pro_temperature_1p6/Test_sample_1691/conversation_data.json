    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$, because the term `f(x)` in the denominator vanishes at `x=0`, causing a potential singularity.\n2.  The leading behavior of `f(x)` for small `x` is determined by the lowest power of `x`, which is $9.0x^{5.0}$.\n3.  We perform a change of variables (rescaling) $x = \\epsilon^{1/5} y$. This scaling is chosen to balance the $\\epsilon$ term with the dominant $9.0x^{5.0}$ term in the denominator. This focuses the analysis on the \"inner region\" near $x=0$.\n4.  After the change of variables, the integral becomes:\n    $I(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{15/\\epsilon^{1/5}} \\frac{dy}{1 + 9y^5 + 5\\epsilon^{1/5}y^6 + 9\\epsilon^{3/5}y^8}$.\n5.  For small $\\epsilon$, the upper limit of integration $15/\\epsilon^{1/5}$ goes to infinity. We can expand the integrand as a Taylor series in powers of $\\epsilon^{1/5}$.\n6.  Integrating this series term by term from $y=0$ to $\\infty$ yields an asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$ in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$.\n7.  The leading term will be of the order $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$. Subsequent terms will be of the order $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, $\\epsilon^{-1/5}$, and then a constant term $O(1)$.\n8.  The integrals that arise can be evaluated using the Beta function, $B(a,b) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{a-1}}{(1+t)^{a+b}} dt$.\n9.  The constant term in the expansion is determined by carefully evaluating the contribution from the finite upper limit of integration, $L=15.0$.\n\nThe resulting formula will be of the form:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5} + C_3 \\epsilon^{-1/5} + C_0$\n\nThe Python code below calculates the coefficients $C_1, C_2, C_3$, and $C_0$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import beta\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic expansion of the integral I(epsilon).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Problem parameters from the denominator:\n    # f(x) = c*x^n + d*x^m + e*x^p\n    # c=9.0, n=5.0\n    # d=5.0, m=6.0\n    # e=9.0, p=8.0\n    # Integration limit\n    # L=15.0\n\n    c, n = 9.0, 5.0\n    d, m = 5.0, 6.0\n    e, p_power = 9.0, 8.0\n    L = 15.0\n\n    # --- Coefficient C1 for the epsilon^(-4/5) term ---\n    # The integral is of the form integral(dy / (1 + c*y^n))\n    # After substitution u^n = c*y^n, this becomes c^(-1/n) * integral(du / (1+u^n))\n    # integral(du / (1+u^n)) from 0 to inf is pi / (n * sin(pi/n))\n    integral_part_C1 = np.pi / (n * np.sin(np.pi / n))\n    C1 = (c**(-1/n)) * integral_part_C1\n\n    # --- Coefficient C2 for the epsilon^(-3/5) term ---\n    # This term comes from the -d*x^m term in the expansion\n    # The integral is -d * integral(y^m / (1+c*y^n)^2) dy\n    # This can be evaluated using the Beta function B(x, y)\n    # The integral is (1/n)*c^-(m+1)/n * B((m+1)/n, 2-(m+1)/n)\n    x_beta2 = (m + 1) / n\n    y_beta2 = 2 - x_beta2\n    integral_part_C2 = (1 / n) * (c**(-(m + 1) / n)) * beta(x_beta2, y_beta2)\n    C2 = -d * integral_part_C2\n\n    # --- Coefficient C3 for the epsilon^(-1/5) term ---\n    # This term comes from the -e*x^p term in the expansion\n    x_beta3 = (p_power + 1) / n\n    y_beta3 = 2 - x_beta3\n    integral_part_C3 = (1 / n) * (c**(-(p_power + 1) / n)) * beta(x_beta3, y_beta3)\n    C3 = -e * integral_part_C3\n\n    # --- Constant term C0 ---\n    # This arises from correcting the integrals for the finite limit L\n    C0_term1 = -1 / (c * (n - 1) * (L**(n - 1)))\n    C0_term2 = d / (c**2 * (2 * n - m - 1) * L**(2 * n - m - 1))\n    C0_term3 = e / (c**2 * (2 * n - p_power - 1) * L**(2 * n - p_power - 1))\n    C0 = C0_term1 + C0_term2 + C0_term3\n\n    print(\"The analytical formula for the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon is an asymptotic expansion:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) = C1 * epsilon^(-4/5) + C2 * epsilon^(-3/5) + C3 * epsilon^(-1/5) + C0 + O(epsilon^(1/5))\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated coefficients:\")\n    print(f\"C1 (for epsilon^-0.8) = {C1:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"C2 (for epsilon^-0.6) = {C2:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"C3 (for epsilon^-0.2) = {C3:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"C0 (constant term)  = {C0:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal formula:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx = {C1:.4f} * epsilon^(-4/5) + ({C2:.4f}) * epsilon^(-3/5) + ({C3:.4f}) * epsilon^(-1/5) + {C0:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBreakdown of the constant term C0:\")\n    print(f\"Contribution from the leading term = {C0_term1:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Contribution from the x^6 term    = {C0_term2:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Contribution from the x^8 term    = {C0_term3:.6f}\")\n\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n<<<I(epsilon) approx = 0.6888 * epsilon^(-4/5) - 0.0754 * epsilon^(-3/5) - 0.1488 * epsilon^(-1/5) + 0.0074>>>\n```"
