    "This is a question from a branch of mathematics called fixed-point theory. A \"tripled fixed point\" is a generalization of the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Clarify Definitions**: The function definitions provided (`G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`) appear to have typos. I will assume the standard definitions from tripled fixed point theory which use a cyclic permutation of variables:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n\n2.  **State the Conditions**: The main conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` such that `F(x,y,z) = x`, `G(y,z,x) = y`, and `H(z,x,y) = z` are:\n    *   **(Complete Metric Space)**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. This means any sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other will converge to a point within the space. The set of real numbers is a common example.\n    *   **(Contraction Mapping)**: The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively be a \"contraction\". This means that when you apply the functions to two different sets of points, the resulting points are closer together than the original points, scaled by a factor less than 1. This property ensures that an iterative process will converge to a single, unique fixed point.\n\n3.  **Code Demonstration**: I will provide a Python script that demonstrates these conditions.\n    *   The script will define three linear functions `F`, `G`, `H` over the real numbers that satisfy the contraction condition.\n    *   It will start with an initial guess `(x_0, y_0, z_0)` and iteratively apply the functions:\n        `x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)`\n        `y_{n+1} = G(y_n, z_n, x_n)`\n        `z_{n+1} = H(z_n, x_n, y_n)`\n    *   According to the theory, this sequence is guaranteed to converge to the unique tripled fixed point. The code will perform a number of iterations and then print the final equations to verify the fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define three functions F, G, H that satisfy the contraction conditions.\n# For linear functions F(x,y,z) = c1*x + c2*y + c3*z + k, the condition is\n# that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is less than 1.\n# e.g., for F: |0.2| + |0.1| + |0.1| = 0.4 < 1.\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Function F: X x Y x Z -> X\"\"\"\n    # Contraction coefficients: 0.2, 0.1, 0.1.
