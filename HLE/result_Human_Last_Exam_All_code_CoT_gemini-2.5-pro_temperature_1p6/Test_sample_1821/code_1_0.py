# The problem is to determine the number of distinct cardinalities in the interval
# [min_branches, max_branches], for a specific type of tree.
# The trees are pruned, have height omega_2, and every level has cardinality omega.

# Step 1: Find the minimal number of branches.
# Let's denote the cardinal omega_n as Aleph_n.
# A tree T has |Lev_1(T)| = Aleph_0. Each node at level 1 must start a distinct branch
# because the branches differ at that level. Thus, the tree must have at least Aleph_0 branches.
# A tree with exactly Aleph_0 branches can be constructed.
# Therefore, the minimal possible number of branches is Aleph_0.
min_card_index = 0

# Step 2: Find the maximal number of branches.
# The maximal number of branches for such trees is a topic in advanced set theory,
# and the answer can depend on which axioms are used (e.g., it can be changed by forcing).
# The prompt implies a single answer, which means we should consider what is provable
# in standard ZFC set theory.
# In ZFC, one can prove the existence of such a tree with Aleph_2 branches.
# The existence of a tree with more than Aleph_2 branches is not provable in ZFC.
# Thus, the maximal cardinality whose existence is provable in ZFC is Aleph_2.
max_card_index = 2

# Step 3: Count the cardinalities in the interval [Aleph_0, Aleph_2].
# The cardinal numbers are ordered: Aleph_0, Aleph_1, Aleph_2, ...
# The cardinalities in the specified interval are Aleph_0, Aleph_1, and Aleph_2.
# We can count them by their indices.
num_cardinalities = max_card_index - min_card_index + 1

# Final output describing the logic and the result.
print(f"The minimal cardinality for the set of branches is Aleph_{min_card_index}.")
print(f"The maximal cardinality for the set of branches provably in ZFC is Aleph_{max_card_index}.")
print("The cardinalities in the interval [Aleph_0, Aleph_2] are Aleph_0, Aleph_1, and Aleph_2.")
print(f"The number of these cardinalities is found by the equation: {max_card_index} - {min_card_index} + 1 = {num_cardinalities}.")
