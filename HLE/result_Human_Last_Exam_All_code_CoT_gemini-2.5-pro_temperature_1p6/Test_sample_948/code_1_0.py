def solve_fermi_hubbard_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the properties of a 1D Fermi-Hubbard system with on-site losses.

    The analysis leads to the following conclusions for the state at time t -> infinity:
    1.  Zero tunneling (TRUE): Inferred from the problem structure and physical arguments
        like the quantum Zeno effect or the formation of a Mott insulating state for
        the remaining particles. The continuous loss of doublons freezes the tunneling
        dynamics that create them.
    2.  Zero particles (FALSE): For spin entanglement and correlations to exist,
        which are listed as options, particles must remain in the final state.
        This implies the system does not universally decay to a vacuum.
    3.  Zero losses (TRUE): In the infinite time limit, the system reaches a steady
        state where the particle number is constant. This is only possible if the
        rate of particle loss becomes zero, which means there are no more doubly
        occupied sites.
    4.  Spin entanglement (TRUE): The final state is the ground state of an effectively
        interacting system (the t-J model). Such ground states are generically entangled.
    5.  Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations (TRUE): The effective infinite
        repulsion (U -> infinity) from the loss mechanism leads to an anti-ferromagnetic
        exchange interaction between spins, resulting in AF-like correlations.
    6.  Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations (FALSE): This would require an attractive
        interaction, which is contrary to the effect of the loss mechanism.

    The resulting combination of true properties is {1, 3, 4, 5}.
