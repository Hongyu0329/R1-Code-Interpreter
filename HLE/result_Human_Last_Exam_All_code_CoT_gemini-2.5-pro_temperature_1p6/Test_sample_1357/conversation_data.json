    "Of course, I can help with that. This question requires concepts from algebraic geometry, specifically the theory of stable reduction of curves and Jacobians.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the Condition**: The core of the problem lies in understanding the condition \"the Jacobian has good reduction.\" A fundamental theorem in this area (due to Raynaud, refined by others like Saito) states that the Jacobian of a curve `C` (of genus `g`) has good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of `C` consists of a tree of smooth components.\n2.  **Apply to Genus 4**: For a curve of genus `g=4`, its stable reduction, let's call it `C_s`, must satisfy these conditions:\n    *   The total arithmetic genus of `C_s` is 4.\n    *   The components `C_i` of `C_s` are connected in a tree structure (the dual graph `Γ` is a tree, i.e., has no cycles).\n    *   Each component `C_i` is a smooth curve of some genus `g_i`.\n3.  **Use Genus Formula**: The genus of such a stable curve is given by the sum of the genera of its components: `g = Σ g_i`. Therefore, we must have `Σ g_i = 4`.\n4.  **Stability Constraint**: A crucial part of the stability condition is that any component that is a smooth rational curve (i.e., a component `C_i` with `g_i = 0`) must be connected to the rest of the curve at 3 or more points. In the dual graph, this means any vertex corresponding to a `g=0` component must have a degree of at least 3.\n5.  **Enumerate and Count**: The problem reduces to a combinatorial task: find the number of distinct \"types\" of such decorated trees. A \"type\" is defined by the partition of the number 4 into the genera of the components and the topological arrangement (the tree structure) of these components, respecting the stability constraint for `g=0` components.\n6.  **Code the Enumeration**: The Python script will systematically list and count these configurations. The final calculation will be the sum of the counts from two cases:\n    *   Case A: Reductions with no `g=0` components.\n    *   Case B: Reductions that include `g=0` components.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve\n    whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem based on a theorem by Raynaud/Saito.\n    The theorem implies the stable reduction must be a tree of smooth components\n    where the sum of the genera of the components equals the total genus.\n    Furthermore, any component of genus 0 must be attached to at least\n    3 other components to ensure stability.\n\n    We enumerate the valid configurations (types) based on the partition of the\n    genus 4 and the structure of the dual graph (which must be a tree).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Case A: Types with no genus 0 components.\n    # The sum of the genera of the components must be 4.\n    # We count the number of non-isomorphic decorated trees for each partition of 4.\n    \n    # Partition {4}: A single smooth component of genus 4.
