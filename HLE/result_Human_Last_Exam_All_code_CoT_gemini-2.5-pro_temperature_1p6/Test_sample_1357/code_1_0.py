def solve_stable_reductions():
    """
    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve
    whose Jacobian has good reduction.

    This is a combinatorial problem based on a theorem by Raynaud/Saito.
    The theorem implies the stable reduction must be a tree of smooth components
    where the sum of the genera of the components equals the total genus.
    Furthermore, any component of genus 0 must be attached to at least
    3 other components to ensure stability.

    We enumerate the valid configurations (types) based on the partition of the
    genus 4 and the structure of the dual graph (which must be a tree).
