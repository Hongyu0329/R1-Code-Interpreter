    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Understand the Automaton:** Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation depends on its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. The rule is defined by the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string gives the output for each of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods, in descending order from `111` to `000`.\n\n2.  **Set up the Simulation:**\n    *   I will use a Python list to represent the row of cells.\n    *   The simulation will run for 20 steps (generations).\n    *   The grid needs to be wide enough to contain the pattern as it expands. A safe width is `1 (initial cell) + 2 * generations`, so `1 + 2 * 20 = 41`. I'll use a slightly larger width to be safe.\n    *   The initial state will be a list of zeros with a single `1` in the center.\n\n3.  **Implement the Logic:**\n    *   I'll create a `for` loop that runs 20 times.\n    *   In each iteration, I will calculate the next generation's state. I'll create a new, empty list for this.\n    *   I'll iterate through each cell of the current grid. For each cell, I'll look at its neighborhood (left, center, right), determine the new state using the Rule 110 logic, and store it in the new list.\n    *   The cells at the edges of the grid are assumed to have neighbors with a state of 0.\n    *   After calculating all cells for the next generation, I'll replace the old grid with the new one.\n\n4.  **Final Output:**\n    *   After 20 generations, the simulation is complete.\n    *   The final list of cells will contain the resulting binary pattern.\n    *   I will convert this list into a single string of 0s and 1s and trim any leading or trailing zeros to present the active pattern clearly.\n    *   The final code will print this resulting binary string.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_rule110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations\n    starting from a single cell and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the number of generations to simulate.\n    generations = 20\n\n    # The width of the grid must be large enough to contain the evolving pattern.\n    # The pattern can expand by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    # A width of 1 (initial) + 2 * generations is the minimum required.\n    # We add a little extra padding for simplicity and safety.\n    width = 2 * generations + 5 \n\n    # Initialize the starting state: a list of 0s with a single 1 in the center.\n    cells = [0] * width\n    cells[width // 2] = 1\n\n    # Define the logic for Rule 110.
