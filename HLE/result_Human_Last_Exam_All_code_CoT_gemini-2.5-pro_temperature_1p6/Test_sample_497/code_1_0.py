# The problem asks for the value of a terminating capacitor 'x' such that the
# equivalent capacitance of a ladder circuit is independent of the number of cells (N).
# This condition is met when 'x' is equal to the characteristic capacitance of the
# infinite ladder.

# Let C_char be the characteristic capacitance.
# We model one cell of the ladder as a Pi-network: a series capacitor 'c' on top,
# a series capacitor 'c' on the bottom, and a shunt capacitor 'c' in the middle.

# If this cell is loaded with a capacitance 'y', the shunt capacitor 'c' is in parallel
# with 'y', giving a combined capacitance of (c + y).
# The total equivalent capacitance of this loaded cell, C_eq, can be found using
# nodal analysis. Let's say we apply a voltage V across the input terminals.
# This setup forms a bridge-like circuit.

# The relationship for the equivalent capacitance C_eq in terms of the load y is:
# C_eq = c * (c + y) / (3*c + 2*y)

# For the characteristic capacitance, we set C_eq = y = C_char:
# C_char = c * (c + C_char) / (3*c + 2*C_char)

# This simplifies to the following quadratic equation for C_char:
# C_char * (3*c + 2*C_char) = c * (c + C_char)
# 3*c*C_char + 2*C_char**2 = c**2 + c*C_char
# 2*C_char**2 + 2*c*C_char - c**2 = 0

# We solve this quadratic equation for C_char using the formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a.
# Here, a=2, b=2c, c_coeff=-c^2.
# C_char = [-2*c ± sqrt((2*c)**2 - 4*2*(-c**2))] / (2*2)
# C_char = [-2*c ± sqrt(4*c**2 + 8*c**2)] / 4
# C_char = [-2*c ± sqrt(12*c**2)] / 4
# C_char = [-2*c ± 2*c*sqrt(3)] / 4

# Since capacitance must be positive, we take the positive root:
# C_char = (-2*c + 2*c*sqrt(3)) / 4
# C_char = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2

# So, the required value for the capacitor x is x = C_char.

# The numbers in the final equation are 3, 1, and 2.
num_in_sqrt = 3
num_subtracted = 1
