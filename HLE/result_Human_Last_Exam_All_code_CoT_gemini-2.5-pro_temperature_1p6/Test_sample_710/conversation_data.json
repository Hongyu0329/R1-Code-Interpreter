    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number `N` such that any integer `x >= N` can be represented as a sum of distinct numbers from the set S generated by the formula $f(n) = 2n^2+3n+1$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Generate the Set S**: First, I will generate the numbers in the set S by calculating $f(n) = 2n^2+3n+1$ for increasing values of $n$. The first few numbers are $f(1)=6, f(2)=15, f(3)=28, \\ldots$.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Completeness\" Condition**: This is a problem about a complete sequence. A key property is that if we can form a consecutive sequence of $a_1$ integers, where $a_1$ is the smallest number in our set S (which is 6), then we can form any integer from that point onwards. For example, if we can make the sums $\\{K, K+1, K+2, K+3, K+4, K+5\\}$, we can also make $\\{K+6, K+7, K+8, K+9, K+10, K+11\\}$ by adding the term 6 to each of the previous sums. By induction, all integers $\\geq K$ can be formed. Therefore, our goal is to find the smallest number `N` that begins such a sequence of 6 consecutive representable numbers.\n\n3.  **Use Dynamic Programming**: I will use a dynamic programming approach to find all possible numbers that can be formed as a sum of distinct elements from S. I'll create a boolean array called `reachable`, where `reachable[i]` is `True` if the number `i` can be formed, and `False` otherwise.\n\n4.  **Find N**: After populating the `reachable` array up to a sufficiently large limit, I will search for the first number `N` for which `reachable[N]`, `reachable[N+1]`, ..., `reachable[N+5]` are all `True`. This `N` will be the answer.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Equation**: As requested, the script will also find and print one possible combination of numbers from S that sum up to the determined value of `N`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any integer >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2 + 3n + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a limit for the numbers to check.
