    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its structure and identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 3, 5 and 2, 4, 6. This `1,3,5` and `2,4,6` substitution pattern creates a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This means the three large substituents and the three methyl groups on the ring are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals in the central core and within a single one of the three identical arms.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** Identify the unique proton signals from the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene part.\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linker:** The arm consists of a `-CH2-` linker group. We need to determine if the two protons on this group are equivalent.\n4.  **Count Signals from the Substituent:** The arm also has a complex, chiral substituent: `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. We need to count the unique protons within this rigid, asymmetric structure.\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** Add the number of signals from the core, the linker, and the substituent to get the total number of peaks.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# A simple function to redirect print to stderr for explanations,\n# while the final answer is printed to stdout.\ndef explain(text):\n    \"\"\"Prints explanatory text.\"\"\"\n    print(text, file=sys.stdout)\n\n\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule by analyzing its structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    explain(\"### Step-by-Step Analysis of 1H NMR Signals ###\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n    # Due to the C3 symmetry of the molecule, the three methyl groups on the\n    # benzene ring are chemically equivalent.\n    peaks_core_methyls = 1\n    explain(f\"\\n1.
