    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two equations with two variables, `x` and `y`.\n\nEquation 1: `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\nEquation 2: `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nSolving this system algebraically by hand can be very complex and prone to errors. A more reliable and efficient approach is to use a computer algebra system. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to find all solutions to the system and then count the number of solutions where both `x` and `y` are real numbers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define `x` and `y` as symbolic variables.\n2.  Create the two equations from the problem statement.\n3.  Use `sympy.solve()` to find all intersection points (solutions). This will find both real and complex solutions.\n4.  Iterate through the list of solutions and count how many have both `x` and `y` coordinates as real numbers.\n5.  Print the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef count_real_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of real intersection points\n    for the two given quadric equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define x and y as symbolic variables\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the first quadric equation\n    # 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    eq1 = sympy.Eq(164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31, 0)\n\n    # Define the second quadric equation\n    # 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    eq2 = sympy.Eq(864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149, 0)\n\n    # Solve the system of equations for x and y\n    solutions = sympy.solve([eq1, eq2], [x, y])\n\n    # Count the number of solutions where both x and y are real numbers\n    real_solution_count = 0\n    for sol in solutions:\n        # A solution is a tuple (x_val, y_val).\n        # We check if both values are real using the .is_real property.\n        if sol[0].is_real and sol[1].is_real:\n            real_solution_count += 1\n    \n    # Per the instructions, we output the single number representing the final count.\n    # The 'final equation' is conceptually 'count = N', so we output 'N'.\n    print(real_solution_count)\n\ncount_real_intersections()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
