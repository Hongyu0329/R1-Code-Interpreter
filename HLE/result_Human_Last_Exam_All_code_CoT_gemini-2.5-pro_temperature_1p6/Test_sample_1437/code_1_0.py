# In the context of many-body physics, the Lindhard polarization function
# at zero frequency (ω=0) and in the limit of zero momentum transfer (q→0)
# is equal to the negative of the density of states at the Fermi energy, D(ε_F).
# Π(q→0, ω=0) = -D(ε_F)

# To find a universal numerical value, we consider the polarization function
# normalized by the density of states itself. This creates a dimensionless quantity.
# Normalized_Π = Π(q→0, ω=0) / D(ε_F)

# Let's assign a representative value to D(ε_F) to perform the calculation.
# We can represent it with the number 1, in its own units [e.g., states/(Energy*Volume)].
d_ef = 1.0

# According to the theory, the value of the Lindhard function is then the negative of this.
pi_00 = -1.0 * d_ef

# Now, we compute the normalized value by taking the ratio.
normalized_pi_value = pi_00 / d_ef

# Print the final equation with the numbers used in our representative calculation.
