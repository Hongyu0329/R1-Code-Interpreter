    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information**: The problem states we have two Chern insulators, and each has a Chern number of 1.\n2.  **Recall the Physical Principle**: The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a system composed of multiple, non-interacting or weakly interacting subsystems, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems. Joining two insulators laterally without a significant barrier means their topological properties combine additively.\n3.  **Formulate the Equation**: Let C1 be the Chern number of the first insulator and C2 be the Chern number of the second. The total Chern number of the junction, C_total, will be C1 + C2.\n4.  **Write the Code**: I will write a Python script that defines the variables for C1 and C2, calculates their sum, and then prints the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two topological systems are joined, the Chern number of the\n# combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation.\nprint(f\"The total Chern number C_total is C1 + C2.\")\nprint(f\"{c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
