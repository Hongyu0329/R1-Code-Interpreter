# The user wants to find the other critical exponent for a reverse square function estimate on the cone in R^3.
# One critical exponent is given as p = 4, which is the well-known Tomas-Stein exponent.

# The other critical exponent in this theory arises from the threshold of validity for the bilinear restriction estimate,
# a key tool developed by Bennett, Carbery, and Tao.
# The bilinear estimate for the cone in R^3 holds for p values satisfying the condition:
# p / 2 > 5 / 3

# The critical exponent is the boundary case of this inequality. We can find it by solving the equation:
# p / 2 = 5 / 3

# Solving for p:
# p = 2 * (5 / 3)
p_numerator = 2 * 5
p_denominator = 3

print("One of the critical exponents for the reverse square function estimate on the cone in R^3 is p = 4.")
print("The other critical exponent is determined by the sharp range of the bilinear restriction estimate.")
print("The condition for this estimate to hold is p/2 > 5/3.")
print("The boundary case gives the critical exponent:")
print(f"p / 2 = 5 / 3  =>  p = (2 * 5) / 3 = {p_numerator}/{p_denominator}")

# The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation represents the value of the exponent.
print("\n--- Final Answer ---")
print(f"The value of the other critical exponent is a fraction.")
print(f"Numerator: {p_numerator}")
print(f"Denominator: {p_denominator}")
print(f"So the exponent is {p_numerator}/{p_denominator}.")
