    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: I will break down the given complex combinator expression into smaller, more manageable parts. I'll identify known combinators and patterns, such as the successor function (`succ`) and Church numerals.\n2.  **Evaluate Components**: I will determine the value of the key components of the expression.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` is the Church numeral for 2.\n    *   The combinator `P = S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function (`succ`), which adds one to a Church numeral.\n    *   `Term2 = P(S(I)(I))` is `succ(2)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral 3.\n    *   `Term1_inner = P(I)` is `succ(I)`. This evaluates to the Church numeral 2.\n    *   `Term1 = K(Term1_inner)` evaluates to `K(2)`.\n3.  **Evaluate the Core Expression**: I will evaluate the central part of the expression, which is `S(I)(Term1)(Term2)`, substituting the values found above. This becomes `S(I)(K(2))(3)`. Applying the reduction rules for SKI combinators shows that this evaluates to the Church numeral 8 (`2^3`).\n4.  **Evaluate the Full Expression**: The full expression is structured as `S(I)(S(I)(...core...))`. Each `S(I)` application effectively adds one to the Church numeral that results from the inner expression (since `S(I)(n) f x = f (n f x)` which corresponds to `n+1`). Since there are two outer `S(I)` applications wrapping the core result of 8, the final value will be `8 + 1 + 1 = 10`.\n5.  **Calculate the Logarithm**: Once the Church integer `n=10` is determined, I will calculate its base-2 logarithm, `log_2(10)`.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to programmatically perform this evaluation. The script will:\n    *   Define classes to represent SKI combinators (`S`, `K`, `I`) and applications.\n    *   Implement a reduction engine that applies the SKI rules to an expression until it reaches its normal form.\n    *   Build the given expression tree.\n    *   Apply the final expression to symbolic variables `f` and `x` to see how many times `f` is applied to `x`. This count gives the value of the Church numeral `n`.\n    *   Print the determined value of `n` and the final equation for `log_2(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# Increase recursion limit for potentially deep expression trees\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\nclass Combinator:\n    \"\"\"Represents a named combinator like S, K, I, or a symbolic variable.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.name\n\nclass App:\n    \"\"\"Represents the application of one expression to another, e.g., (f x).\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, func, arg):\n        self.func = func\n        self.arg = arg\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"({self.func} {self.arg})\"\n\n# Singleton combinator instances\nS = Combinator(\"S\")\nK = Combinator(\"K\")\nI = Combinator(\"I\")\n\ndef reduce_step(expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a single, leftmost-outermost reduction step on a combinator expression.\n    Returns a tuple (new_expression, was_reduced_flag).\n    \"\"\"\n    # If not an application, it cannot be a redex (reducible expression).\n    if not isinstance(expr, App):\n        return expr, False\n\n    # Try to reduce the function part of the application first (leftmost).\n    new_func, reduced = reduce_step(expr.func)\n    if reduced:\n        return App(new_func, expr.arg), True\n\n    # If the function part can't be reduced, try the argument part.\n    new_arg, reduced = reduce_step(expr.arg)\n    if reduced:\n        return App(expr.func, new_arg), True\n\n    # If no inner parts were reduced, check the current application for a redex.\n    f = expr.func\n    # I combinator rule: I x -> x\n    if f == I:\n        return expr.arg, True\n    \n    if isinstance(f, App):\n        f_func = f.func\n        # K combinator rule: K x y -> x\n        if f_func == K:\n            # f is (K x), expr is ((K x) y)\n            x = f.arg\n            return x, True\n        \n        if isinstance(f_func, App):\n            f_func_func = f_func.func\n            # S combinator rule: S x y z -> (x z) (y z)\n            if f_func_func == S:\n                # f_func is (S x), f is ((S x) y), expr is (((S x) y) z)\n                x = f_func.arg\n                y = f.arg\n                z = expr.arg\n                return App(App(x, z), App(y, z)), True\n\n    # No reduction was possible at this level or below.\n    return expr, False\n\ndef reduce_full(expr, max_steps=10000):\n    \"\"\"Fully reduces an expression by repeatedly applying reduce_step.\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(max_steps):\n        expr, reduced = reduce_step(expr)\n        if not reduced:\n            break\n    else:\n        # This would be reached if the loop finishes without breaking.\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Reduction exceeded maximum steps, may be a non-terminating expression.\")\n    return expr\n\ndef count_applications(expr, func_name):\n    \"\"\"Counts how many times a function `func_name` is applied in a nested expression.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    current = expr\n    while isinstance(current, App) and repr(current.func) == func_name:\n        count += 1\n        current = current.arg\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to build, evaluate the expression and find log2(n).\"\"\"\n    # Build the expression: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n    # Standard notation `xyz` is parsed as `((x y) z)`\n\n    # Sub-expression: P = succ = S(S(K S) K)\n    P = App(S, App(App(S, App(K, S)), K))\n\n    # Sub-expression: church_two = S(I)(I)\n    church_two = App(App(S, I), I)\n\n    # Term 2: P(church_two) = succ(2) -> should be 3\n    term2 = App(P, church_two)\n\n    # Term 1: K(P(I)) = K(succ(I)) -> K(2)\n    succ_I = App(P, I)\n    term1 = App(K, succ_I)\n\n    # Let's combine them according to the full structure:\n    # A(B)(C) is ((A B) C)\n    # The structure is S(I) (S(I) (S(I)(Term1))(Term2))\n    \n    # Innermost application: S(I)(Term1)\n    inner_app = App(App(S, I), term1)\n    \n    # Next level: (S(I)(Term1))(Term2)\n    core_expr = App(inner_app, term2)\n    \n    # Wrapping with S(I)\n    mid_expr = App(App(S, I), core_expr)\n    \n    # Final wrapping with S(I)\n    final_expr_n = App(App(S, I), mid_expr)\n\n    # To find the value of the Church numeral n, we evaluate n(f)(x)\n    # and see how many times 'f' is applied to 'x'.\n    f = Combinator(\"f\")\n    x = Combinator(\"x\")\n    \n    expr_to_evaluate = App(App(final_expr_n, f), x)\n\n    # Fully reduce the expression\n    normal_form = reduce_full(expr_to_evaluate)\n    \n    # Count the applications of 'f'\n    n = count_applications(normal_form, \"f\")\n\n    # Calculate log base 2\n    log2_n = math.log2(n)\n\n    # Print the results as requested\n    print(f\"The Church integer n is: {n}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: log_2({n}) = {log2_n}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<3.3219280948873626>>>"
