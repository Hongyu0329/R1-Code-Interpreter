To be functionally accurate, the picnic table should change its shape. At sunrise, it should bend from a straight configuration (the *trans* isomer) into a V-shape (the *cis* isomer) upon exposure to the sun's UV light. At sunset, as the UV light fades, it should slowly straighten back out to its original shape as it thermally relaxes back to the more stable *trans* isomer.
