    "In a standard 100BB rake-free cash game, the player on the button has the strongest position and should be opening a wide range of hands, typically around 45-50% of all possible starting hands. This range is based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles and includes all suited Jack combinations because of their playability and potential to make strong hands like flushes.\n\nTo determine the \"worst\" suited Jack in this opening range, we simply need to find the one with the lowest expected value. Hand strength for suited Jacks decreases as the rank of the second card (the \"kicker\") gets lower. A lower kicker means weaker high-card value and poorer straight-making potential.\n\nTherefore, the hands can be ranked from best to worst like this: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and finally J2s. Since all of them are considered profitable opens from the button, the one at the very bottom of this list, J2s, is the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python script will define this list and print the worst hand from it.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a standard 100BB cash game.\n    \n    In Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play from the button, all suited Jacks are considered\n    profitable opens due to the significant positional advantage. The \"worst\" hand in\n    this category is the one with the lowest kicker, as it has the least equity\n    and is most easily dominated.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of suited Jack hands, ranked from strongest to weakest\n    suited_jacks = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    # The last hand in the ranked list is the weakest one that is still a standard open\n    worst_suited_jack = suited_jacks[-1]\n    \n    print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
