    "In this problem, we need to find the symmetry factors for all unique, connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory and then sum them. A symmetry factor, S, is a combinatorial number associated with a Feynman diagram that corrects for overcounting due to the diagram's symmetries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant diagrams:** We are considering diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory, which means each interaction vertex has four lines. The diagrams are \"second-order,\" so they contain exactly two such vertices. They are \"vacuum bubbles,\" which means they have no external lines—all lines are internal propagators. We will focus on connected diagrams, as disconnected diagrams are typically handled by the linked-cluster theorem and are products of lower-order connected diagrams. There are two distinct connected diagrams that fit these criteria.\n\n2.  **Analyze Diagram 1 (the \"Figure-8\" diagram):**\n    *   **Topology:** The two vertices are connected to each other by four propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Calculation:** The symmetry factor is the number of operations (permutations of vertices and lines) that leave the diagram's structure unchanged.\n        *   We can swap the two identical vertices, which gives a factor of 2.\n        *   We can permute the four identical propagators that connect the vertices, which gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n    *   **Result:** The total symmetry factor for this diagram is $S_1 = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Diagram 2 (the \"Double-Scoop\" diagram):**\n    *   **Topology:** Each of the two vertices has one self-loop (a propagator that starts and ends on the same vertex). The two vertices are also connected to each other by two propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Calculation:**\n        *   We can swap the two identical vertices (factor of 2).\n        *   We can swap the two identical propagators connecting the vertices (factor of 2).\n        *   For the loop at the first vertex, the two lines forming it can be swapped (factor of 2).\n        *   Similarly, the two lines forming the loop at the second vertex can be swapped (factor of 2).\n    *   **Result:** These symmetries are not all independent. For instance, swapping the vertices also swaps the loops. A careful analysis of the full automorphism group of the diagram shows that the total symmetry factor is $S_2 = 16$.\n\n4.  **Sum the results:** Finally, we will sum the symmetry factors of the two unique connected diagrams.\n\nThe following Python code implements these calculations and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the properties of the diagrams we are interested in.\n#    - Theory: phi^4\n#    - Order: 2nd order in coupling constant (2 vertices)\n#    - Type: Vacuum bubbles (no external lines)\n#    - We will sum the symmetry factors for all unique *connected* diagrams.\n\n# 2. Calculate the symmetry factor for the first connected diagram (Figure-8).\n#    This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n#    The symmetry factor S is the product of:\n#    - The number of ways to permute the two identical vertices: 2! = 2\n#    - The number of ways to permute the four identical propagators: 4! = 24\ns1_vertex_perms = math.factorial(2)\ns1_line_perms = math.factorial(4)\ns1 = s1_vertex_perms * s1_line_perms\n\nprint(\"Diagram 1: The 'Figure-8' Diagram\")\nprint(f\"Symmetry from permuting vertices = {s1_vertex_perms}\")\nprint(f\"Symmetry from permuting lines = {s1_line_perms}\")\nprint(f\"Symmetry factor S1 = {s1_vertex_perms} * {s1_line_perms} = {s1}\\n\")\n\n\n# 3. Calculate the symmetry factor for the second connected diagram (Double-Scoop).\n#    This diagram has two vertices, each with one loop, connected by two propagators.\n#    The symmetries are:\n#    - Swapping the two identical vertices (factor of 2).\n#    - Swapping the two propagators connecting the vertices (factor of 2).\n#    - Swapping the two lines that form the loop at the first vertex (factor of 2).\n#    - Swapping the two lines that form the loop at the second vertex (factor of 2).\n#    The total symmetry group size (the symmetry factor) for this diagram is 16.\ns2 = 16\nprint(\"Diagram 2: The 'Double-Scoop' Diagram\")\nprint(\"This diagram consists of two vertices, each with a self-loop,\")\nprint(\"and two propagators connecting the vertices.\")\nprint(f\"The symmetry factor S2 for this diagram is {s2}\\n\")\n\n# 4. Sum the symmetry factors of all connected second-order diagrams.\ntotal_symmetry_factor = s1 + s2\nprint(\"The sum of the symmetry factors for all connected second-order vacuum bubbles is:\")\nprint(f\"Sum = S1 + S2 = {s1} + {s2} = {total_symmetry_factor}\")\n\n```\n<<<64>>>"
