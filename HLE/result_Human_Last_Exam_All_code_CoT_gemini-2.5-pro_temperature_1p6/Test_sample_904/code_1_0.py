# The problem is a derivation of the coefficients of a differential equation.
# The solution involves identifying the terms from the linearized Young-Laplace equation.
# We will define the variables symbolically to represent the result clearly.

# gamma represents the surface tension between the two fluids.
gamma = sympy.Symbol('gamma')

# r represents the radial position.
r = sympy.Symbol('r')

# From the derivation based on the physics of surface tension on a cylindrical interface,
# the coefficients A(r) and B(r) of the linearized governing equation are determined.

# A(r) is the coefficient of the second derivative term, d^2(xi)/dr^2.
A_r = gamma

# B(r) is the coefficient of the first derivative term, d(xi)/dr.
B_r = gamma / r

# The code will now print these derived expressions.
print(f"The derived coefficient A(r) is:")
print(f"A(r) = {A_r}")
print(f"\nThe derived coefficient B(r) is:")
print(f"B(r) = {B_r}")

# The final equation would be:
# gamma * (d^2(xi)/dr^2) + (gamma/r) * (d(xi)/dr) - P_e(r) = 0
# where P_e(r) is the electrostatic pressure, corresponding to the -C(r, xi) term.
# The problem only asks for A(r) and B(r).
