    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number, of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve. I will write a Python script that explains the mathematical reasoning step-by-step and calculates the final values.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will establish the relationship between the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power $X = C^{(d)}$ and the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the curve, $J(C)$. This relies on a result by Macdonald for the cohomology of symmetric products, valid when the degree $d$ is sufficiently large.\n2.  Next, I will find the minimum possible rank. This corresponds to the case of a \"generic\" curve $C$, whose Jacobian has the smallest possible Néron-Severi rank.\n3.  Then, I will find the maximum possible rank. This corresponds to a special curve $C$ with complex multiplication (CM), whose Jacobian has the largest possible Néron-Severi rank, up to the Hodge-theoretic bound.\n4.  Finally, the Python script will perform the calculations for each step and print the explanation along with the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem from the user's request.\ng = 3  # The genus of the curve C\nd = 15 # The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(d),\")\nprint(f\"where C is a curve of genus g = {g} and X is its d = {d}-th symmetric power.\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of NS(J(C)).\n# The rank of the Néron-Severi group is denoted by rho.\nprint(\"Step 1: Relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of the Jacobian J(C).\")\nprint(\"Let rho(V) denote the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a variety V.\")\nprint(f\"For d >= 2g - 1, there is a known decomposition of the second cohomology group of X:\")\nprint(\"H^2(X, Q) is isomorphic to H^2(J(C), Q) (direct sum) H^2(C, Q),\")\nprint(\"where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\")\ncondition = 2*g - 1\nprint(f\"We must check if this condition holds for d = {d} and g = {g}:\")\nprint(f\"Is d >= 2*g - 1?  -->  {d} >= 2*{g} - 1  -->  {d} >= {condition}?
