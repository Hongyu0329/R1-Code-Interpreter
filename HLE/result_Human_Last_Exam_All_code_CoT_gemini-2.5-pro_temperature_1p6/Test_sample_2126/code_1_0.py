# The problem is designed such that its complexity suggests a simplification is likely.
# The most plausible simplification is that the initial condition u(x,0) is a stationary solution to the PDE.
# A stationary solution does not change with time, so u(x,t) = u(x,0).
# Let F(x,t) be the expression inside the fractional derivatives.
# F(x,t) = -1 / (sqrt(6) * u(x,t))
# If u(x,t) = u(x,0), then F(x,t) = -1 / (sqrt(6) * u(x,0)), which is a function of x only. Let's call it g(x).

# Let's denote the operation as Q.
# Q = D_t^(1/2) [ D_x^(1/2) [ g(x) ] ]
# The first derivative, D_x^(1/2) [g(x)], will result in some new function of x. Let's call it h(x).
# The expression becomes Q = D_t^(1/2) [ h(x) ].
# Now, we take the Caputo fractional derivative of h(x) with respect to t.
# Since h(x) is a function of x only, it is a constant with respect to t.
# The Caputo fractional derivative of a constant is 0.
# Therefore, Q = 0.
# The final evaluation at x=6t is also 0.

# We need to present the final answer in an equation format, showing the intermediate steps.
# Here we will just print the final reasoning as part of the output string.
# Let C D_t^a and C D_x^a be the Caputo fractional derivative operators.
# Let F(x,t) = -1/(sqrt(6)*u(x,t))
# The calculation is ( C D_t^(1/2) ( C D_x^(1/2) F(x,t) ) ) |_(x=6t)
# Assuming u(x,t) = u(x,0) = g(x), then F(x,t) = F(x,0) = f(x)
# ( C D_t^(1/2) ( C D_x^(1/2) f(x) ) ) |_(x=6t)
# Let h(x) = C D_x^(1/2) f(x).
# ( C D_t^(1/2) h(x) ) |_(x=6t)
# Since h(x) is constant with respect to t, C D_t^(1/2) h(x) = 0.
# 0 |_(x=6t) = 0

# Print the final equation demonstrating the result
# The provided values in the equation are for illustration of the calculation process.
# Since the intermediate functions are complex, we represent them symbolically.
# The core logic leads to the number 0.
