    print("The key requirements for the correct answer are:")
    print("1. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH): A cell that was heterozygous (e.g., genotype 'Aa') becomes homozygous (e.g., 'AA' or 'aa').")
    print("2. Copy-Neutral: The total number of chromosomes remains the same (e.g., the cell still has two copies of the affected chromosome).\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Evaluating options based on the 'Copy-Neutral' requirement ---\n")

    print("Choice B: A deletion of a chromosomal region.")
    print("Result: This causes a net loss of genetic material. The copy number changes. This is NOT copy-neutral.\n")

    print("Choice C: Trisomy.")
    print("Result: This is the gain of an entire chromosome (e.g., going from two copies to three). The copy number changes. This is NOT copy-neutral.\n")

    print("Choice E: Duplication of a chromosomal region.")
    print("Result: This causes a net gain of genetic material. The copy number changes. This is NOT copy-neutral.\n")

    print("Conclusion from Step 1: Options B, C, and E are eliminated because they are not copy-neutral events.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Comparing the remaining options, A and D ---\n")

    print("We are left with two plausible mechanisms for copy-neutral LOH:\n")

    print("Choice A: Mitotic recombination.")
    print("Description: This is a crossover event between homologous chromosomes during mitosis. If followed by a specific segregation pattern, it can produce a daughter cell that is homozygous for a part of the chromosome arm. This event is copy-neutral and causes LOH.\n")

    print("Choice D: Uniparental disomy (UPD).")
    print("Description: This is a state where both copies of a chromosome come from a single parent. In cancer, this commonly arises when a cell first loses a chromosome and then duplicates the remaining one. The result is two identical chromosomes. This is copy-neutral and causes LOH for the entire chromosome.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Selecting the best fit based on specific phrasing ---\n")

    print("The question specifies 'maintaining the gene dosage despite allele deletion'.")
    print("This wording strongly implies a mechanism where a chromosome copy (containing one allele) is first lost (the 'deletion'), and then the cell compensates to restore the normal chromosome number ('maintaining the gene dosage').")
    print("This perfectly describes the process of chromosome loss and subsequent reduplication, which leads to Uniparental Disomy (D).")
    print("While Mitotic Recombination (A) also results in copy-neutral LOH, it doesn't involve a discrete 'deletion' step in the same way.\n")
    
    final_answer = 'D'
    print(f"Final Answer: Uniparental disomy is the genetic alteration that best fits the description.\n")
