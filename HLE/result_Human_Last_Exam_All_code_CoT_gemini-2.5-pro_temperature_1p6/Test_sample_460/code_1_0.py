    """
    This function calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem parameters.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for all choices of agents
    and their preferences over m items, there exists some subset of items O
    that is "suitable".

    A subset O is suitable if:
    1. For every item j in O, the number of agents who prefer j over all other
       items in O is strictly greater than t.
    2. For every item k not in O, the number of agents who prefer k over all
       items in O is less than or equal to u.

    The problem can be solved by a proof that provides a constructive algorithm
    to find a suitable set O. This proof establishes that the minimum value for u
    that guarantees the existence of such a set is given by the formula:
    u = (m - 1) * t
