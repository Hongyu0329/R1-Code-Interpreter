# Step 1: State the standard formula for the Purcell rate (W)
# This uses the coupling frequency 'g_f', not the coupling energy 'g'.
# W = 2 * g_f**2 / gamma_c

# Step 2: Relate the coupling energy 'g' from the problem's Hamiltonian
# to the coupling frequency 'g_f'.
# g = hbar * g_f  =>  g_f = g / hbar
g_f = g / hbar

# Step 3: Substitute this into the rate formula to get W in terms of 'g'.
W = 2 * g_f**2 / gamma_c
# W_expr = 2 * (g/hbar)**2 / gamma_c

# Step 4: The problem's answer choices have units of energy, not rate.
# This implies we should calculate the energy width Gamma, where Gamma = hbar * W.
Gamma = hbar * W
# Gamma_expr = hbar * (2 * g**2 / (hbar**2 * gamma_c))

# Simplify the expression for the energy width Gamma
Gamma_simplified = sympy.simplify(Gamma)

# Step 5: The answer choices are given in terms of 'h', not 'hbar'.
# Substitute hbar = h / (2*pi) to match the format of the answers.
Gamma_in_terms_of_h = Gamma_simplified.subs(hbar, h / (2*pi))
