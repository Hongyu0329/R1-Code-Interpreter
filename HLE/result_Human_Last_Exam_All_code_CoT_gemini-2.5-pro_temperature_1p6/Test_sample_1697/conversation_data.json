    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. I'll break down its structure. It's a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   At position 1: A diethylcarboxamido group, `-C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n    *   At position 3: A dimethylamino group, `-N(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   Implicitly, there are hydrogen atoms at positions 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:** The first set of reagents is `sec-BuLi` and `TMEDA` in THF.\n    *   `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) is a very strong base.\n    *   `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) is a ligand that coordinates to the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the butyl anion.\n    *   This combination is classic for a reaction called **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In this reaction, the base is directed to remove a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a specific functional group on the benzene ring, known as a Directed Metalation Group (DMG).\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Metalation:** Our starting material has two DMGs:\n    *   The diethylcarboxamido group (`-C(=O)NEt₂`) at C1. This is one of the most powerful DMGs.\n    *   The dimethylamino group (`-NMe₂`) at C3. This is also a strong DMG.\n    *   The base `sec-BuLi` will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is typically located ortho to the strongest DMG.\n    *   The diethylcarboxamido group is a more powerful director than the dimethylamino group. It has two potential ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   However, the proton at C2 is ortho to *both* the powerful C1 director and the strong C3 director. This \"synergistic\" activation makes the C2 proton by far the most acidic on the ring.\n    *   Therefore, the `sec-BuLi` will selectively remove the hydrogen from C2, forming a lithiated intermediate (an aryllithium).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:** The second reagent is `methyl iodide` (CH₃I).\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in step 1 has a nucleophilic carbon at position 2.\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the methyl group of methyl iodide, and iodide will act as a leaving group. This is an electrophilic quench step.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product:** A methyl group (`-CH₃`) will be added to the C2 position of the original benzene ring.\n    *   The final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will print out this chemical reasoning and state the final product. As requested, it will also highlight the numbers in the final chemical name to satisfy the prompt \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the chemical reaction and identifies the final product.\n    Reaction: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA, then with methyl iodide.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
