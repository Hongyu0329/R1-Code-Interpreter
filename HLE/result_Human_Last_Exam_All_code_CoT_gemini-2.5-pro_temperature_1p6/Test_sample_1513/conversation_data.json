    "My plan is to solve this geography riddle by methodically checking the world's most remote islands against the user's specific set of criteria.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the request into four distinct conditions:\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Isolation:** More than 500 kilometers from the next nearest inhabited island.\n    *   **Geography:** Situated on a bay that was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   **Nomenclature:** The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:** I'll start with the most famous remote islands (like Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena, Pitcairn Island) and see if they fit all four clues. The combination of extreme isolation and the specific caldera-bay-town naming convention is the key.\n\n3.  **Process of Elimination:** Most candidates will fail on one or more conditions. For example, Tristan da Cunha is extremely remote, but its settlement (Edinburgh of the Seven Seas) isn't on a bay of the same name. Akutan, Alaska fits the caldera bay and naming criteria perfectly, but it is too close to another inhabited island (Unalaska).\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Answer:** Through this process, I will pinpoint the location that satisfies all conditions. The answer is Hanga Roa, the main town on Easter Island (Rapa Nui). It is extremely isolated (over 2,000 km from Pitcairn), the town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay, and this bay is considered to be formed by the island's volcanic landscape.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** I will provide a simple Python script to print the name of the town as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the island riddle.\n  The island town that meets all the criteria is Hanga Roa.\n\n  - Island Town: Yes, it is the capital of Easter Island.\n  - More than 500km from another inhabited island: Yes, Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 km away.\n  - Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera: Yes, the town is situated on the coast of Hanga Roa Bay, which lies in a natural indentation between the slopes of the island's extinct volcanoes, Terevaka and Rano Kau.\n  - Shares the town's name: Yes, the town is Hanga Roa and the bay is Hanga Roa Bay.\n  \"\"\"\n  answer = \"Hanga Roa\"\n  print(answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
