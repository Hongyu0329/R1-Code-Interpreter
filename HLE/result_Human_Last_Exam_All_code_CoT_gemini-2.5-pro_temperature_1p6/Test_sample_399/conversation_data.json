    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the initial value problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation.\n2.  I will separate the variables, moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n3.  Then, I will integrate both sides of the equation to find the general solution.\n4.  I will use the initial condition, $x(0) = -8$, to determine the value of the integration constant, $C$.\n5.  With the particular solution found, I will substitute $t=1$ to find the value of $x(1)$.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that carries out the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n1.  **Separate the variables**:\n    Starting from $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$, we can write:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n    $$\n\n2.  **Integrate both sides**:\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    The integrals evaluate to:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the initial condition**:\n    We are given $x(0) = -8$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n\n4.  **Find the particular solution**:\n    Now, substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**:\n    To find $x(1)$, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n    $$\n    Solving for $x(1)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} \\implies x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n\nThe following Python code performs this final calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# We are solving for x(1) using the equation:\n# -1/x(1) = (1^2)/2 - 1 + 1/8\n\n# Define the terms of the equation using the Fraction class for precision\nterm1 = Fraction(1**2, 2)\nterm2 = Fraction(1, 1)\nterm3 = Fraction(1, 8)\n\n# The right hand side (RHS) of the equation\nrhs = term1 - term2 + term3\n\n# Solve for x(1)\n# -1/x(1) = rhs  => x(1) = -1/rhs\nx1 = -1 / rhs\n\nprint(\"To find x(1), we solve the equation: -1/x(1) = (1^2)/2 - 1 + 1/8\")\nprint(f\"The equation with its numerical values is: -1/x(1) = {term1} - {term2} + {term3}\")\nprint(f\"The right hand side evaluates to: {rhs}\")\nprint(f\"So, -1/x(1) = {rhs}\")\nprint(f\"This gives x(1) = -1 / ({rhs})\")\nprint(f\"The final value is x(1) = {x1}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
