    "To find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$, we can use a method based on generating functions and recurrence relations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. The desired sum is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n2.  This sum is equal to the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n3.  Let's define a sequence of polynomials $P_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n} (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}+x^{3 \\cdot 3^i})$. The polynomial in the question is $P_{19}(x)$.\n4.  Let $S_n = \\sum_k a_{n,k}^2$ be the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $P_n(x)$. We need to find $S_{19}$.\n5.  We can derive a recurrence relation for the sequence $S_n$. Let $A_n(x) = P_n(x)P_n(x^{-1})$. Then $S_n$ is the constant term of $A_n(x)$.\n6.  We have $A_n(x) = A_{n-1}(x) \\cdot \\left( (1+x^{3^n}+x^{2 \\cdot 3^n}+x^{3 \\cdot 3^n})(1+x^{-3^n}+x^{-2 \\cdot 3^n}+x^{-3 \\cdot 3^n}) \\right)$.\n7.  By analyzing the coefficients, we can establish a system of recurrence relations:\n    *   $S_n = 4S_{n-1} + 6E_n$\n    *   $E_n = S_{n-2} + 2E_{n-1}$\n    where $E_n$ is an auxiliary sequence representing a specific coefficient in $A_{n-1}(x)$. These relations are valid for $n \\ge 2$.\n8.  Combining these two, we get a single third-order linear recurrence relation for $S_n$:\n    $S_n = 10S_{n-1} - 26S_{n-2} + 8S_{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n9.  We need the first three values, $S_0, S_1, S_2$, to start the recurrence.\n    *   $P_0(x) = 1+x+x^2+x^3$. The coefficients are $(1,1,1,1)$. So, $S_0 = 1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$.\n    *   $P_1(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^3+x^6+x^9)$. By expanding and summing the squares of the coefficients, we find $S_1 = 22$.\n    *   Using the recurrence relations for $n=2$, we can calculate $E_1=1$ and $E_2 = S_0 + 2E_1 = 4 + 2(1) = 6$. Then, $S_2 = 4S_1 + 6E_2 = 4(22) + 6(6) = 88+36 = 124$.\n10. Finally, we'll use a Python script to compute $S_3, S_4, \\dots, S_{19}$ using the recurrence relation and the initial values $S_0, S_1, S_2$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find $S_{19}$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of squares of coefficients for the given polynomial expansion.\n    Let S(n) be the sum of the squares of the coefficients of P_n(x) = prod_{i=0 to n} (1+x^(3^i)+x^(2*3^i)+x^(3*3^i)).\n    The sequence S(n) follows the recurrence relation:\n    S(n) = 10*S(n-1) - 26*S(n-2) + 8*S(n-3) for n >= 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial values for the recurrence S(0), S(1), S(2).\n    s = [4, 22, 124]\n\n    print(\"The recurrence relation is S(n) = 10*S(n-1) - 26*S(n-2) + 8*S(n-3)\")\n    print(\"Initial values:\")\n    print(f\"S(0) = {s[0]}\")\n    print(f\"S(1) = {s[1]}\")\n    print(f\"S(2) = {s[2]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Calculating S(n) up to n=19:\")\n\n    # We need to find S(19).\n    # The loop calculates S(n) for n from 3 to 19.\n    for n in range(3, 20):\n        s_prev_1 = s[n-1]\n        s_prev_2 = s[n-2]\n        s_prev_3 = s[n-3]\n        \n        s_n = 10 * s_prev_1 - 26 * s_prev_2 + 8 * s_prev_3\n        s.append(s_n)\n        \n        # Outputting each number in the equation for each step\n        print(f\"S({n}) = 10 * {s_prev_1} - 26 * {s_prev_2} + 8 * {s_prev_3} = {s_n}\")\n\n    final_answer = s[19]\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The final result for the sum of squares of the coefficients, S(19), is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<783773567539456>>>"
