def solve_rational_subsets_problem():
    """
    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the user's question
    about classifying subsets of the rational numbers.
    """
    print("Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:")

    # Step 1: Formalize the problem
    print("\n--- Step 1: Understanding the Problem ---")
    print("The problem asks us to consider an equivalence relation on the set of all subsets of the rational numbers, Q.")
    print("The relation is defined as: A ~ B if and only if A is homeomorphic to a subset of B, and B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.")
    print("This means there must be an embedding (a homeomorphism onto its image) from A into B, and from B into A.")
    print("The final goal is to determine the total number of equivalence classes this relation creates.")

    # Step 2: Answering the first part - providing an example
    print("\n--- Step 2: An Example of Two Equivalent, Non-Homeomorphic Subsets ---")
    print("Let's identify two subsets A and B of Q that are equivalent but not homeomorphic.")
    print("  - Let B = Q (the set of all rational numbers).")
    print("  - Let A be the union of the set of rationals in the interval (0, 1) and the set {2, 3}. So, A = (Q intersect (0, 1)) U {2, 3}.")
    print("\nA and B are not homeomorphic because B has no isolated points, while A has two isolated points (2 and 3).")
    print("However, they are equivalent under our relation:")
    print("1. A embeds into B: A is a countable metric space. A theorem by Sierpinski states that any countable metric space can be embedded into Q. Therefore, an embedding from A into B = Q exists.")
    print("2. B embeds into A: B=Q is homeomorphic to the subset (Q intersect (0, 1)) of A. Therefore, an embedding from B into A exists.")
    print("\nSince both conditions hold, A and B are equivalent. This demonstrates the relation.")

    # Step 3: Classifying subsets of Q
    print("\n--- Step 3: The General Classification ---")
    print("All subsets of Q can be divided into two exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories:")
    print("1. Discrete spaces: Every point in the subset is an isolated point.")
    print("2. Non-discrete spaces: The subset has at least one point that is also a limit point of the set.")

    # Step 4: Counting classes for discrete subsets
    print("\n--- Step 4: Counting Classes of Discrete Subsets ---")
    print("For two discrete sets A and B, an embedding exists from A to B if and only if the cardinality of A is less than or equal to the cardinality of B (|A| <= |B|).")
    print("Therefore, A ~ B if and only if |A| <= |B| and |B| <= |A|, which implies |A| = |B|.")
    print("So, for discrete subsets of Q, each distinct cardinality corresponds to a unique equivalence class.")
    print("The possible cardinalities for a subset of Q are:")
    print("  - Finite: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... (one for each non-negative integer)")
    print("  - Countably Infinite (the cardinality of the set of integers Z)")
    print("This gives us one class for each finite size, plus one class for the countably infinite size.")
    print("The number of classes for discrete subsets is therefore countably infinite.")

    # Step 5: Counting classes for non-discrete subsets
    print("\n--- Step 5: Counting Classes of Non-Discrete Subsets ---")
    print("Let A and B be any two non-discrete subsets of Q.")
    print("The argument from Step 2 can be generalized to show that they are always equivalent:")
    print(" - A embeds into B: Any non-discrete subset B must contain a part that is homeomorphic to Q. Since A is a countable metric space, A embeds into Q, which in turn embeds into this part of B. Thus, A embeds into B.")
    print(" - B embeds into A: Symmetrically, B is a countable metric space and A contains a part homeomorphic to Q, so B embeds into A.")
    print("\nTherefore, any two non-discrete subsets of Q are equivalent to each other.")
    print("This means all non-discrete subsets form a single, giant equivalence class.")
    print("The number of classes for non-discrete subsets = 1.")

    # Step 6: The Final Calculation
    print("\n--- Step 6: The Final Tally ---")
    print("To find the total number of equivalence classes, we sum the counts from each category.")
    print("The total number of classes is the sum of:")
    print("  - The number of classes for finite discrete sets (countably many, one for each size 0, 1, 2, ...)")
    print("  - The number of classes for infinite discrete sets.")
    print("  - The number of classes for non-discrete sets.")
    print("\nLet's write down the final equation of the counts:")
    print("Total Classes = (Countably Many Finite Classes) + (1 Infinite Discrete Class) + (1 Non-Discrete Class)")
    print("In this calculation, the numbers for the last two categories are:")
    print("Number of classes for countably infinite discrete sets = 1")
    print("Number of classes for non-discrete sets = 1")
    print("Adding a countably infinite number of classes to these two classes still results in a countably infinite total.")
