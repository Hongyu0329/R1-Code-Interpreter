    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube, which has two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (λ), from a single 2D image.\n2.  **Analyze the Role of a Grating:** A diffraction grating disperses light according to its wavelength. A single one-dimensional (1D) grating will spread the spectral information (λ) along one spatial axis on the 2D detector. This creates an overlap where a change in spatial position along the dispersion axis is indistinguishable from a change in wavelength. This is insufficient information to uniquely reconstruct the 3D data cube.\n3.  **Apply Tomographic Principles:** To reconstruct a volume, computed tomography requires views (projections) from multiple different angles. In this context, \"angles\" correspond to different directions of spectral dispersion. To resolve the ambiguity created by a single grating, we need to disperse the light in at least a second, non-collinear direction.\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Number:** The simplest way to achieve dispersion in two independent directions is by using two 1D gratings, typically crossed at 90 degrees. This creates a 2D array of diffracted orders on the sensor, providing the necessary projections for the tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the (x, y, λ) data cube. While these two gratings are often combined into a single physical component called a \"2D grating,\" it functionally consists of two distinct gratings. Therefore, the minimum number required is 2.\n\nThe Python code below will use variables to represent these principles and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for computed tomography imaging spectrometry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, lambda).\n    # This requires encoding the 3D information onto a 2D detector.\n    # To do this without ambiguity, we need to disperse light along two independent axes.\n    # A single diffraction grating provides dispersion along only one axis.\n\n    required_dispersion_axes = 2\n    gratings_per_axis = 1\n\n    # The minimum number of gratings is the number of axes needed multiplied by\n    # the number of gratings required to create dispersion on each axis.\n    minimum_gratings = required_dispersion_axes * gratings_per_axis\n\n    print(\"To reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube from a 2D image, we need to disperse light along multiple axes to avoid ambiguity.\")\n    print(\"A single grating provides only one axis of dispersion.\")\n    print(f\"The tomographic reconstruction requires a minimum of {required_dispersion_axes} independent axes of spectral dispersion.\")\n    print(f\"Each axis requires at least {gratings_per_axis} functional grating.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{required_dispersion_axes} (axes) * {gratings_per_axis} (grating/axis) = {minimum_gratings} (gratings)\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is {minimum_gratings}.\")\n\nsolve_grating_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
