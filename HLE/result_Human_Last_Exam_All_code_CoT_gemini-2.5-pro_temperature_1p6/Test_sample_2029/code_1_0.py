# Team A has 8 members.
num_a_players = 8

# Each member of team A plays 6 games (one against each member of team B).
# The number of games won by a player from team A can be any integer from 0 to 6.
# This means there are 6 + 1 = 7 possible scores for each player.
num_possible_scores_per_a_player = 6 + 1

# Since the scores for each of the 8 players in team A are independent,
# the total number of different score sequences (a_1, ..., a_8) is 7^8.
# Any such sequence is achievable, as we can construct a tournament realization for it.
# This sequence for team A is part of a full sequence (a_1,...,a_8, b_1,...,b_6).

# The number of different sequences is therefore the number of ways to choose the 8 scores for team A.
result = num_possible_scores_per_a_player ** num_a_players

# We will now print the equation and the result.
# The number of sequences is 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7
