    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which can be implemented via row reduction on a compound matrix.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form a compound matrix:** We will stack the two matrices, P1 and P2, to form a single 4x2 matrix `M = [P1; P2]`.\n2.  **Row reduction:** We will perform elementary row operations on this matrix `M` to transform it into its row-echelon form (specifically, the Hermite Normal Form). This process is equivalent to finding a unimodular matrix `U` such that `U * M` is in a simplified upper triangular form.\n3.  **Extract the GCRD:** The non-zero rows of the resulting row-echelon matrix will form a GCRD of the original matrices P1 and P2.\n4.  **Implementation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to handle the symbolic polynomial operations and matrix manipulations. The `hermite_form()` function in `sympy` is perfectly suited for this task.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps and find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of\n    two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Form the compound matrix by stacking P1 on top of P2\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # Compute the Hermite normal form of M.\n    # The hermite_form() method returns H (the row-echelon form) and U (a unimodular matrix)\n    # such that H = U * M. The non-zero rows of H constitute the GCRD.\n    H, _ = M.hermite_form()\n\n    # The GCRD is the non-zero part of H. For 2x2 input matrices,\n    # the GCRD will be a 2x2 matrix, which corresponds to the first two rows of H.\n    gcrd = H[:2, :]\n\n    # Print the resulting GCRD matrix\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor matrix is:\")\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will format the matrix output clearly.\n    sympy.pprint(gcrd)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_gcrd()\n\n```\n<<<[[1, -1], [0, 1]]>>>"
