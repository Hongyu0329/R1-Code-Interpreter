    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  Identify the start year of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore. This is the year 2504.\n2.  Identify the end year of the war. This is the year 2508, which marks the end of the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue.\n3.  Calculate the difference between the end year and the start year to find the duration.\n4.  Round the result up to the nearest whole number as requested.\n5.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War begins in the year 2504 with the start of the Wings of Liberty campaign.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war concludes in the year 2508 with the end of the Legacy of the Void epilogue.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The request asks to round up the result.\n# We will use math.ceil to perform the rounding.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation.\nprint(\"The Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2508.\")\nprint(f\"The total duration is calculated as: {end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration}\")\nprint(f\"So, the war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
