    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Formulate the problem mathematically.** A fixed point of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We need to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n2.  **Determine the nature of the equation.** The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given as polynomials of degree 3. The composition of two polynomials, $f(g(x))$, results in a new polynomial whose degree is the product of their individual degrees.\n    *   Degree of $f(x)$ is 3.\n    *   Degree of $g(x)$ is 3.\n    *   Degree of $f(g(x))$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    Therefore, the equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Find the theoretical maximum number of solutions.** According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. This means a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Thus, the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n4.  **Verify if this maximum is achievable.** We need to check if it's possible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions ($f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$) and for which the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n    *   For a degree 9 polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots (by Rolle's Theorem).\n    *   The derivative is $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$. The critical points of $P(x)$ are the roots of the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a positive quadratic (degree 2) polynomial, and $g'(x)$ is also a positive quadratic (degree 2) polynomial.\n    *   The expression $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $(2 \\times 3) + 2 = 8$.\n    *   So, we need the 8th-degree polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ to be equal to 1 for 8 different real values of $x$. It is known that such polynomials can be constructed, although finding a specific example is complex.\n    *   Since it is possible for the derivative $P'(x)$ to have 8 roots, it is possible for the degree 9 polynomial $P(x)$ to have 9 roots.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** The algebraic maximum is 9, and this maximum is achievable under the given conditions.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this reasoning and calculates the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning and calculates the maximum number of fixed points\n    for the composition of two cubic polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the degrees of the polynomials from the problem statement.\n    # Let f and g be polynomials such that f'(x) and g'(x) are positive for all x.\n    # The degree of f(x) is 3.\n    degree_f = 3\n    # The degree of g(x) is 3.\n    degree_g = 3\n\n    # 1.
