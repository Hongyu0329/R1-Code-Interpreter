    This function identifies the starting material for the given reaction.

    The reaction described is a Robinson annulation.
    1.  Product: ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate.
    2.  Reactants: A starting compound + methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
    3.  Reagents: KOMe/THF, then K2CO3/MeOH.

    Retrosynthetic Analysis:
    - The Robinson annulation builds a new six-membered ring onto a Michael donor.
    - The new ring contains the ketone from MVK (the 7-oxo group).
    - The starting material must therefore be the other six-membered ring, containing the
      substituents mentioned: a methyl group (at C4) and an ethyl carboxylate group (at C4a).
    - The starting material must be a cyclohexanone derivative that can be enolized.
      A Î²-keto ester is an ideal candidate.
    - Tracing the atoms back from the product, a starting material of
      'ethyl 3-methyl-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate' correctly places the methyl
      group at the final C4 position and the ethyl carboxylate at the final C4a bridgehead position
      after the annulation sequence.
