    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to count the number of combinatorial types of stable nodal curves of arithmetic genus 2. This is a classic result from the theory of the moduli space of curves.\n\nThe approach is to classify the stable curves based on the geometric genera of their irreducible components and the structure of their dual graph. The total arithmetic genus of a stable curve `C` is given by the formula: `g = h¹(Γ) + Σ gᵢ`, where `gᵢ` is the geometric genus of the i-th component and `h¹(Γ)` is the first Betti number (number of independent loops) of the dual graph `Γ`. For a genus 2 curve, we need `g=2`.\n\nThe different types can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **The non-degenerate curve:** This is a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 2. There is only one combinatorial type in this class.\n\n2.  **Degenerate curves with elliptic components:** These are stable curves that have at least one irreducible component of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve). There are three such types:\n    *   An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n    *   Two elliptic curves meeting at a single point.\n    *   An elliptic curve attached to a rational curve (genus 0) that has one node.\n\n3.  **Degenerate curves with only rational components:** These are stable curves where every irreducible component has geometric genus 0 (is a rational curve, i.e., a `P¹`). For the total genus to be 2, the dual graph for these curves must have `h¹(Γ) = 2`. It is a known result that there are six such combinatorial types of graphs that satisfy the stability conditions.\n\nThe total number of types is the sum of the counts from each category. The following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A curve of genus 2 can be stable without being singular.
