    "This is a complex endgame position. I need to find the best move for White by evaluating the key candidate moves.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n*   **White:** King on g1, Queen on f2, and a strong pawn on d6 which is blocked by a black pawn on d7. The pawn on a4 controls b5.\n*   **Black:** King on c6, an active Queen on c5, and pawns on a5, b6, and d7.\n*   **The tactical situation:** Black's king and queen both attack White's d6-pawn. White's queen is the sole defender. This suggests that the position is unstable and requires a decisive, forcing move from White.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **`d7`:** This move is illegal. The FEN string `8/3p4/...` indicates a black pawn is on d7, blocking White's pawn on d6.\n\n2.  **A quiet Queen move (e.g., `1. Qe2`):** A move like `1. Qe2` defends against checks on the c-file and prepares to trade queens if Black plays `...Qxd6`. The line would be `1. Qe2 Qxd6 2. Qxd6 Kxd6`. This simplifies into a King and Pawn endgame. However, Black's king is on d6 while White's is far away on g1. Black has a winning advantage in this pawn endgame due to the more active king and better pawn structure. Therefore, quiet moves are not sufficient.\n\n3.  **`Qxc5+`:** This is the most forcing move on the board. It initiates a queen trade and drastically simplifies the position into a King and Pawn endgame. Black has two ways to recapture:\n\n    *   **Case 1: Black plays `1... Kxc5`**\n        The position becomes: `8/3p4/3P4/p1k5/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 2`.\n        White's d6-pawn is now a major threat. White plays `2. Kf2`. The plan is to bring the king towards the center (`g1-f2-e3-d4...`) to support the d-pawn and attack Black's queenside pawns. Black's best response is to capture the pawn with `2... Kxd6`. After a sequence like `3. Ke3 Kc5 4. Kd3`, White's king has become active enough to contest the endgame. While complex, this endgame is winning for White because the White king gets active in time.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Black plays `1... bxc5`**\n        The position becomes: `8/3p4/2kP4/p1p5/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 2`.\n        White's d-pawn is now passed. White's winning plan is similar: `2. d7` (forcing the king to capture) `Kxd7 3. Kf2`. White's king marches to the center to fight for the key squares. Again, though Black's pawn structure looks intimidating, White's king is active enough to win the resulting pawn race.\n\nSince both of Black's possible recaptures lead to a winning endgame for White, `Qxc5+` is the best move.\n\n```python\nimport chess\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and finds the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The FEN of the position.\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    board = chess.Board(fen)\n\n    # The best move is Qxc5.\n    best_move_san = \"Qxc5+\"\n    move = board.parse_san(best_move_san)\n\n    # Deconstruct the move for a clear explanation.\n    from_square = chess.square_name(move.from_square)\n    to_square = chess.square_name(move.to_square)\n    piece = board.piece_at(move.from_square)\n    piece_symbol = piece.symbol()\n\n    print(\"The current board state is represented by the FEN: {}\".format(fen))\n    print(\"White is to move.\")\n    print(\"Black's Queen and King are both attacking White's strong d6 pawn.\")\n    print(\"White's best move is a forcing capture to simplify into a winning endgame.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe move involves capturing the Black Queen on c5 with the White Queen from f2.\")\n    \n    # We will analyze the consequences of the move.\n    # Case 1: King recaptures\n    board_case1 = board.copy()\n    board_case1.push(move) # Qxc5+\n    # Find the king recapture move\n    king_recapture_move = board_case1.find_move(chess.C6, chess.C5)\n    board_case1.push(king_recapture_move) # Kxc5\n    \n    # Case 2: Pawn recaptures\n    board_case2 = board.copy()\n    board_case2.push(move) # Qxc5+\n    # Find the pawn recapture move\n    pawn_recapture_move = board_case2.find_move(chess.B6, chess.C5)\n    board_case2.push(pawn_recapture_move) # bxc5\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Move Calculation:\")\n    print(\"White Queen from {} captures the Black Queen on {}\".format(from_square, to_square))\n    print(\"The move in Standard Algebraic Notation is: {}\".format(best_move_san))\n    print(\"\\nThis creates two scenarios for Black's recapture:\")\n    print(\"1.
