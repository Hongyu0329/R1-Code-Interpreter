    print("The problem asks for the minimal ordinal δ for a tower ⟨x_α : α ∈ δ⟩ with specific properties.")
    print("Let's analyze the properties to find δ.\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Preliminary analysis of δ ---")
    print("The tower is defined by:")
    print("1. Each x_α is an uncountable subset of ω₁.")
    print("2. For α < β < δ, |x_β \\ x_α| < ω₁, which means x_β is 'almost' a subset of x_α (x_β ⊆* x_α).")
    print("3. The tower is maximal: there's no uncountable y ⊆ ω₁ such that y ⊆* x_α for all α ∈ δ.")
    print("\nThe minimal δ must be a regular cardinal. If it were a successor or a limit cardinal with smaller cofinality, we could construct a smaller maximal tower, which would contradict the minimality of δ.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Proving δ must be greater than ω₁ ---")
    print("We'll show that any tower of length ω₁ cannot be maximal. This implies δ > ω₁.")
    print("Let ⟨x_α : α < ω₁⟩ be such a tower. We construct an uncountable set Y that contradicts maximality.")
    
    print("\nConstruction of a pseudo-intersection Y:")
    print("1. For each ξ < ω₁, define a helper set A_ξ = ∩_{α ≤ ξ} x_α.")
    print("2. A_ξ is uncountable. To see this, consider its complement within x_ξ: x_ξ \\ A_ξ = ∪_{α < ξ} (x_ξ \\ x_α).")
    print("3. From the tower property, for any α < ξ, |x_ξ \\ x_α| is a countable set.")
    print("4. Since ξ < ω₁, the set of indices {α | α < ξ} is countable. Thus, x_ξ \\ A_ξ is a countable union of countable sets, making it countable.")
    print("5. Since x_ξ is uncountable, A_ξ = x_ξ \\ (x_ξ \\ A_ξ) must be uncountable.")
    
    print("\n6. Now, construct Y = {y_ξ : ξ < ω₁} by transfinite recursion. At each step ξ, choose y_ξ ∈ A_ξ \\ {y_η : η < ξ}.")
    print("   This is always possible because A_ξ is uncountable while {y_η : η < ξ} is countable.")
    print("7. The set Y is uncountable. We check if it violates maximality for the tower ⟨x_α⟩.")
    print("   Fix an α < ω₁. We need to show |Y \\ x_α| < ω₁.")
    
    print("\n8. If ξ > α, then by construction, y_ξ ∈ A_ξ = ∩_{β ≤ ξ} x_β. Since α < ξ, x_α is one of the sets in this intersection, so y_ξ ∈ x_α.")
    print("9. This means an element y_ξ can only be outside of x_α if ξ ≤ α.")
    print("10. Therefore, Y \\ x_α is a subset of {y_ξ : ξ ≤ α}. This set is countable because α is a countable ordinal.")
    print("11. So, for any α < ω₁, |Y \\ x_α| is countable. This shows Y is a pseudo-intersection.")
    print("\nThe existence of such a Y proves that no tower of length ω₁ (or any smaller ordinal) can be maximal.")
    print("Since δ must be a cardinal greater than ω₁, the smallest possible value is δ ≥ ω₁⁺ = ω₂.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Existence of a maximal tower of length ω₂ ---")
    print("The other side of the inequality, δ ≤ ω₂, comes from a known (but difficult) theorem in ZFC set theory, which states that a maximal tower of length ω₂ does exist.")
    print("This result, often denoted as t(ω₁) = ω₂, where t(κ) is the tower number on κ, establishes that an upper bound for the minimal length is ω₂.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Conclusion ---")
    print("Combining our findings:")
    print(" - From Step 2, we have δ ≥ ω₂.")
    print(" - From Step 3, we have δ ≤ ω₂.")
    print("Therefore, the minimal possible value for δ is ω₂.")
    
    print("\nFinal Answer Equation: δ = ω₂")
