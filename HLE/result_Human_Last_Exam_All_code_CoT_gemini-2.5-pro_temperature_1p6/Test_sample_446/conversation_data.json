    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor, we can cross-reference the given peptide sequences with known integrin-binding motifs from major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The most famous integrin-binding motif is the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence. While all options contain this motif, the flanking amino acids play a crucial role in determining the binding affinity and specificity.\n\nI will write a Python script that simulates a search against a small database of well-known integrin-binding protein sequences. The script will check which of the provided peptide options is found within these canonical sequences. The most classic and widely studied example, particularly for *in vitro* assays, is the RGDSP sequence from fibronectin, which serves as a benchmark for integrin binding studies.\n\n```python\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most likely integrin-binding peptide from a list of candidates\n    by searching for them in a mock database of known integrin-binding protein sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of candidate peptides from the answer choices\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": \"RGDMAA\",\n        \"B\": \"RGDSPSS\",\n        \"C\": \"RGDLTTP\",\n        \"D\": \"RGDQVSK\",\n        \"E\": \"RGDARGG\"\n    }\n\n    # A simplified database of protein sequences known to bind integrins via the RGD motif.\n    # The sequence from Fibronectin (containing RGDSP) is the most canonical example\n    # used in in vitro assays.\n    protein_database = {\n        \"Fibronectin (Human Isoform 1)\": \"YAVTGRGDSPASSKPISINYRT\",\n        \"Vitronectin (Human)\": \"SSGRGDMDVTRGQLVTRGDVFTM\",\n        \"Cyr61/CCN1 (Human)\": \"KTAEKVTTRGDLTTP\",\n        \"Thrombospondin-1 (Human)\": \"WAWGPVTRGDQVSKRL\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Searching for Candidate Peptides in Protein Database ---\")\n    found_peptides = {}\n\n    for choice, peptide in candidates.items():\n        found = False\n        for protein, sequence in protein_database.items():\n            # We check if the core part of the candidate peptide is in the database sequence.\n            # RGDSPSS is a variant of the classic RGDSP motif.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
