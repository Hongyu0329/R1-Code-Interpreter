    "True.\n\nSNP heritability (often denoted as h²_SNP) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all genotyped SNPs combined. It is a theoretical upper limit on the predictive power of any linear model using those specific SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a practical tool that attempts to build such a linear model. It calculates a score for an individual by summing up their alleles, weighted by effect sizes estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). However, these estimated effect sizes are not perfect due to factors like:\n1.  **Finite GWAS sample size:** This leads to statistical noise and uncertainty in the effect size estimates.\n2.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The correlation between SNPs makes it difficult to pinpoint the true causal variant and its exact effect.\n3.  **Mismatched populations:** Differences between the GWAS discovery population and the target population where the PGS is applied can reduce accuracy.\n\nBecause a PGS is built with imperfect, estimated weights, its ability to explain variance in a phenotype (its predictive power, often measured as R²) will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum represented by the SNP heritability. The predictive power of a PGS can approach the SNP heritability as the discovery GWAS sample size becomes infinitely large, but it cannot exceed it.\n\n<<<True>>>"
