    This function determines the correct statements from the provided list
    and prints the sorted concatenation of their indices.

    The true statements are:
    D) For any energy eigenstate |ψ⟩, τ̂|ψ⟩ is also an energy eigenstate.
    E) If τ̂ = L̂_z, then Ŝ(θ) represents rotation about z-axis by angle θ.
    F) The expectation value ⟨τ̂⟩ is conserved if and only if [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
    I) If [τ̂₁, τ̂₂] = iτ̂₃, then e^{-iθ₁τ̂₁}e^{-iθ₂τ̂₂} ≠ e^{-i(θ₁τ̂₁ + θ₂τ̂₂)}.
    J) If |ψ⟩ is eigenstate of Ĥ with energy E, then Ŝ|ψ⟩ has same energy E.

    The sorted indices of these true statements are D, E, F, I, J.
