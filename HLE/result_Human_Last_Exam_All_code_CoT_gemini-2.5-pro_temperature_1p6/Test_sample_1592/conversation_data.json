    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec.\n\nFirst, I will find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\nNext, I will identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec: Ontario, Nunavut, and Newfoundland and Labrador. New Brunswick is also a neighbor but is significantly farther south.\nThen, I will determine the coordinates of the closest point on the border of each of these neighboring provinces/territories.\n*   For **Ontario**, this will be a point on the land border where it meets the coast of James Bay, just west of Waskaganish.\n*   For **Nunavut**, this will be the closest point of land, which is an island in James Bay, as Nunavut's border with Quebec is a maritime one in this region.\n*   For **Newfoundland and Labrador**, the border is far to the east, so I will use a representative point on that border to show it is not the closest.\n\nFinally, I will use the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between Waskaganish and each of these points. The province or territory with the shortest distance is the answer. My script will perform these calculations, print the results for comparison, and then state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth's radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n    \n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad, lon1_rad, lat2_rad, lon2_rad = map(math.radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    \n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    \n    distance = R * c\n    return distance\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to find the closest province/territory to Waskaganish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish = {\"name\": \"Waskaganish\", \"lat\": 51.1939, \"lon\": -78.7614}\n\n    # Coordinates for the closest points in neighboring provinces/territories\n    locations = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Ontario\",\n            \"type\": \"border\",\n            \"lat\": 51.463, # Point on the Ontario-Quebec land border meeting James Bay\n            \"lon\": -79.518\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Nunavut\",\n            \"type\": \"landmass (Charlton Island)\", # Closest significant landmass\n            \"lat\": 52.00, \n            \"lon\": -79.40\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Newfoundland and Labrador\",\n            \"type\": \"border\", # Point on the Quebec-Labrador border\n            \"lat\": 52.00,\n            \"lon\": -65.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    distances = {}\n    print(f\"Finding the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC ({waskaganish['lat']}° N, {abs(waskaganish['lon'])}° W).\\n\")\n\n    for loc in locations:\n        dist = haversine_distance(waskaganish[\"lat\"], waskaganish[\"lon\"], loc[\"lat\"], loc[\"lon\"])\n        distances[loc[\"name\"]] = dist\n        \n        print(f\"Calculating distance to {loc['name']}:\")\n        \n        # Format the numbers for the equation representation\n        lat1_str = f\"{waskaganish['lat']:.4f}\"\n        lon1_str = f\"{waskaganish['lon']:.4f}\"\n        lat2_str = f\"{loc['lat']:.4f}\"\n        lon2_str = f\"{loc['lon']:.4f}\"\n        dist_str = f\"{dist:.2f}\"\n        \n        # Print the simplified equation with the inputs and output\n        print(f\"  Start: Waskaganish ({lat1_str}, {lon1_str})\")\n        print(f\"  End:   {loc['name']} ({lat2_str}, {lon2_str})\")\n        print(f\"  haversine({lat1_str}, {lon1_str}, {lat2_str}, {lon2_str}) = {dist_str} km\\n\")\n\n    # Find the location with the minimum distance\n    closest_location_name = min(distances, key=distances.get)\n    min_distance = distances[closest_location_name]\n\n    print(f\"Comparing the distances, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_location_name}.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
