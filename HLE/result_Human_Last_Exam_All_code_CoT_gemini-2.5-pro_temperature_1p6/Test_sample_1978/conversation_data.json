    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system, `n`**: This is the number of unknown functions `x_i(t)`. It can be inferred from the dimensions of the matrix `A` and the vector `I(t)`.\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, `k`**: This involves analyzing the given boundary conditions to identify and count only the unique, non-redundant constraints.\n3.  **Calculate the index**: For this type of linear boundary-value problem, the index is given by the formula `index = n - k`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these steps and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system, n.\n    # The system is x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t).\n    # The matrix A is specified as a 202000x202000 diagonal matrix.\n    # The vector I(t) is given as (I_1(t), ..., I_202000(t)).\n    # This implies that the state vector x(t) has 202000 components.\n    n = 202000\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, k.\n    # The given boundary conditions are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0\n    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0\n    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0\n\n    # We need to find how many of these conditions are linearly independent.\n    # Let's analyze them:\n    # - Condition 1 is a constraint on x_1.\n    # - Condition 2 is a constraint on x_2.\n    # - Condition 3 is 5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, which is the same as condition 2.\n    # - Condition 4 is 100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, also the same as condition 2.\n    # - Condition 5 is -1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, again the same as condition 2.\n    # - Condition 6 is 100 * (x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0, which is equivalent to x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0.\n\n    # After removing the redundant (linearly dependent) conditions, we are left with three\n    # independent conditions on x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n    k = 3\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.\n    # The index of a linear boundary-value problem is the dimension of the system (n)\n    # minus the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n    index = n - k\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The index of the problem is calculated by subtracting the number of linearly independent boundary conditions from the dimension of the system.\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of the system (n): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k): {k}\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - {k} = {index}\")\n\n\nsolve_problem_index()\n```\n<<<201997>>>"
