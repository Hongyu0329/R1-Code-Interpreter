    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system, n.
    # The system is x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t).
    # The matrix A is specified as a 202000x202000 diagonal matrix.
    # The vector I(t) is given as (I_1(t), ..., I_202000(t)).
    # This implies that the state vector x(t) has 202000 components.
    n = 202000

    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, k.
    # The given boundary conditions are:
    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0
    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0
    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0
    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0

    # We need to find how many of these conditions are linearly independent.
    # Let's analyze them:
    # - Condition 1 is a constraint on x_1.
    # - Condition 2 is a constraint on x_2.
    # - Condition 3 is 5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, which is the same as condition 2.
    # - Condition 4 is 100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, also the same as condition 2.
    # - Condition 5 is -1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0, again the same as condition 2.
    # - Condition 6 is 100 * (x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0, which is equivalent to x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0.

    # After removing the redundant (linearly dependent) conditions, we are left with three
    # independent conditions on x_1, x_2, and x_2024.
    k = 3

    # Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.
    # The index of a linear boundary-value problem is the dimension of the system (n)
    # minus the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).
    index = n - k

    # Print the explanation and the final equation.

    print(f"Dimension of the system (n): {n}")
    print(f"Number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k): {k}")
