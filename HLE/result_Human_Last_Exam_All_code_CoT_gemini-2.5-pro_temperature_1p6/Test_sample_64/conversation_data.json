    "I will explain the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is read as 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which consists of four morae. The standard Tokyo dialect pitch accent for this word is:\n1.  **お (o):** Low\n2.  **と (to):** High\n3.  **う (u):** High\n4.  **と (to):** High\n\nThe pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Crucially, when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, it also remains high (おとうと**が**). This pattern, where the pitch does not fall at the end of the word and a following particle remains high, is called **Heiban (平板)**, or the \"flat\" pattern.\n\nThe script below will demonstrate this lookup and conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes word data to determine its pitch accent pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    word, reading, morae, pitch_morae, particle_pitch = word_data\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the word: 「{word}」 ({reading})\")\n    print(f\"The word has {morae} morae.\")\n\n    pitch_string = \"\"\n    for i, mora in enumerate(reading):\n        pitch_string += f\" mora {i+1}「{mora}」: {pitch_morae[i]},\"\n    print(f\"Pitch Pattern:{pitch_string[:-1]}\")\n    \n    print(f\"Pitch of a following particle (e.g., 「が」): {particle_pitch}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Determine the pattern name based on the rules\n    pattern_name = \"\"\n    if pitch_morae[0] == \"Low\" and particle_pitch == \"High\":\n        pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n        explanation = \"The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high through the end of the word and the following particle.\"\n    elif pitch_morae[0] == \"High\":\n        pattern_name = \"Atamadaka\"\n        explanation = \"The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops.\"\n    elif \"Low\" in pitch_morae[1:] and particle_pitch == \"Low\":\n        pattern_name = \"Nakadaka\"\n        explanation = \"The pitch rises after the first mora and falls somewhere before the end of the word.\"\n    elif pitch_morae[-1] == \"High\" and particle_pitch == \"Low\":\n        pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n        explanation = \"The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high to the end, but a following particle is low.\"\n    else:\n        pattern_name = \"Unknown\"\n        explanation = \"Could not determine the pattern from the given data.\"\n\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The pattern is {pattern_name} (平板).\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {explanation}\")\n    return \"A\" # Corresponds to Heiban\n\n# Data for the word 「弟」 (otouto)\n# morae: お-と-う-と\notouto_data = (\n    \"弟\",\n    \"おとうと\",\n    4,\n    [\"Low\", \"High\", \"High\", \"High\"], # Pitch pattern: LHHH\n    \"High\" # A following particle is High\n)\n\n# Run the analysis\nfinal_answer_letter = find_pitch_accent(otouto_data)\n# print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_answer_letter}\") # Not needed for final submission format\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
