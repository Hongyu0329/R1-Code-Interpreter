    """
    Constructs and prints the SMILES string for a molecule that best fits the
    complex and partially contradictory user requirements.

    The chosen molecule is 1,6-bis(1-iminoethyl-1-amino)-3,4-diazahex-3-ene, which corresponds to the formula C8H18N6.
    This molecule correctly features:
    - Molecular Formula: C8H18N6 (MW: 198.27, Valence Electrons: 80)
    - Heavy Atoms: 14 (8 Carbon, 6 Nitrogen)
    - Heteroatoms: 6
    - Azo Group: 1
    - Amidine Groups: 2
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 4 (from the two -NH2 groups)
    - No rings and no excluded functional groups.

    It deviates from the prompt on:
    - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (6 present vs. 4 requested)
    - Rotatable Bonds (8 present vs. 4 requested)
    - Amine classification (has primary amines and imines, but lacks distinct secondary/tertiary amines).
    These deviations are necessary because the prompt's constraints are mutually exclusive.
