    Calculates the exact value of the limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N.

    The problem asks for the limit of the average number of solutions to the equation:
    F_n + a*F_m^6 + b*F_m^5 + c*F_m^4 + d*F_m^3 + e*F_m^2 + f*F_m + g = 0
    where F_k are Fibonacci numbers, 0 <= m,n < N, and coefficients are integers in [-25, 25].

    Based on the analysis of the Diophantine equation, non-zero contributions to the limit only come from two scenarios for the coefficients:
    1. a=b=c=d=e=f=0. The equation becomes F_n = -g. The contribution from each 'g' is the number of 'n' that solve the equation.
    2. a=b=c=d=e=g=0 and f=-1. The equation becomes F_n = F_m, which contributes 1 to the limit.

    All other choices of coefficients lead to equations with a finite number of solutions, and thus contribute 0 to the limit.

    The code calculates the sum of contributions from these cases.
