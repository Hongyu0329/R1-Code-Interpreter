# Plan:
# 1. Define the parameters for the calculation.
#    - N: Number of bits in the RAM.
#    - tc_ns: Time for one read/write cycle in nanoseconds.
#    - complexity_factor: The multiplier for the chosen March test (March CL).
# 2. Choose the test with the highest fault coverage, which is March CL with a complexity of 12N.
# 3. Calculate the total time required for the test.
# 4. Print the final equation with all the numbers.
# 5. Print the final result in milliseconds.

# Step 1: Define parameters
# Number of bits in a 1Mbit RAM
num_bits = 1_000_000

# Time for one read/write cycle in nanoseconds
cycle_time_ns = 5

# Complexity factor for the March CL test (12N operations)
complexity_factor = 12

# Name of the chosen test
test_name = "March CL"

print(f"Chosen test with the highest fault coverage: {test_name}")
print(f"Complexity of {test_name}: {complexity_factor}N")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Calculate total test time
# Total operations = complexity_factor * N
total_operations = complexity_factor * num_bits

# Total time in nanoseconds = total_operations * cycle_time_ns
total_time_ns = total_operations * cycle_time_ns

# Total time in milliseconds = total_time_ns / 1_000_000
total_time_ms = total_time_ns / 1_000_000

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final result
print("The calculation for the test duration is:")
print(f"Time (ms) = (Complexity Factor * Number of Bits * Cycle Time (ns)) / 1,000,000")
print(f"Time (ms) = ({complexity_factor} * {num_bits} * {cycle_time_ns}) / 1000000")
print(f"Time (ms) = {total_time_ms}")
