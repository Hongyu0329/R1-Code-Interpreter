    "The premise of your question contains a fundamental contradiction in the principles of crystallography and optics. I will use a Python script to explain why this is the case.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define Optical Activity:** In crystallography, a material can be optically active only if its structure is **chiral**. A chiral crystal point group is one that lacks any improper rotation axes (which include mirror planes and inversion centers).\n2.  **Define Achirality:** An achiral structure is, by definition, *not* chiral. This means it *must* possess at least one mirror plane or an inversion center.\n3.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The requirements for \"optical activity\" (requiring a chiral structure) and \"achiral\" are mutually exclusive. A crystal cannot be both chiral and achiral simultaneously.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, there are no crystal classes that are achiral and also have the correct symmetry for optical activity. The script below will programmatically demonstrate this logical conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef explain_crystal_class_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the user's request for crystal classes that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and optically active, and explains the inherent\n    contradiction in the query.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A crystal is optically active if and only if its point group is chiral.\n    # Chiral point groups lack mirror planes (m) and inversion centers (i).\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # An achiral class is one that is NOT chiral.
