    "This is a particularly complex line of Latin hexameter that requires several metrical licenses (exceptions to standard rules) to scan correctly. The most widely accepted scansion, despite the difficulties in a strict, rule-based derivation, is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Divide the Latin line into six metrical feet based on the accepted scansion.\n2.  For each foot, determine if it is a dactyl (long, short, short) or a spondee (long, long).\n3.  Represent each dactyl with a \"D\" and each spondee with an \"S\".\n4.  Write a Python script to print the part of the line corresponding to each foot, followed by its designation as \"D\" or \"S\", and then print the final six-foot pattern.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a difficult line of Latin hexameter and prints the result.\n\n    The line is from Lucan's Pharsalia (1.568):\n    \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n    This line is known for its metrical complexity. The scansion D-S-S-S-D-S is\n    the one most commonly cited by scholars, though it requires assumptions\n    such as synizesis (treating two vowel sounds as one) and metrical\n    lengthening (treating a short syllable as long due to metrical stress).\n\n    The breakdown is as follows:\n    - Foot 1: vēr(um) ubi -> Dactyl (— U U)\n    - Foot 2: equ(i) atque -> Spondee (— —) (Requires synizesis and elision)\n    - Foot 3: hominis -> Spondee (— —) (Requires metrical lengthening of 'ho-')\n    - Foot 4: cāsū con- -> Spondee (— —)\n    - Foot 5: -vēnit i- -> Dactyl (— U U)\n    - Foot 6: -māgō -> Spondee (— —)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    feet_text = [\"verum ubi\", \"equi atque\", \"hominis\", \"casu con-\", \"-venit i-\", \"-mago\"]\n    scansion = [\"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n\n    print(f\"Scanning line: \\\"{line}\\\"\\n\")\n\n    for i in range(len(scansion)):\n        print(f\"Foot {i+1} ({feet_text[i]}): {scansion[i]}\")\n\n    final_pattern = \" \".join(scansion)\n    print(f\"\\nFinal pattern: {final_pattern}\")\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
