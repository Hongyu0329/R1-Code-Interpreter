    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that programmatically determines the smallest number `n` for which a set of `n` elements and a binary operation does not necessarily form a group.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  Since the definition of a group requires the existence of an identity element, the set must be non-empty. Therefore, the search for `n` will start from 1.\n2.  The script will iterate through `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n3.  For each `n`, it will generate all possible binary operations on a set of `n` elements. A binary operation can be represented by a Cayley table (or multiplication table). For a set of size `n`, there are `n^(n*n)` possible tables.\n4.  For each generated operation table, a function will check if it satisfies the axioms of a group (Associativity, Identity Element, Inverse Element). Closure is satisfied by construction.\n5.  If for a given `n`, all possible operations result in a group, the script continues to `n+1`.\n6.  The first `n` for which at least one operation is found *not* to form a group is the answer. The script will then print this value of `n`, display the specific operation table that fails, and explain which group axiom it violates with a clear counterexample.\n\nThis method exhaustively checks all possibilities, guaranteeing the correct smallest number `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_smallest_n_for_non_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest integer n >= 1 for which there exists a binary operation\n    on a set of n elements that does not form a group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_group(op_table, elements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given operation table on a set of elements forms a group.\n        The elements are assumed to be 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(elements)\n\n        # 1.
