    "Here is my plan to solve the puzzle.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs to deduce the transformation rule. The inputs are grids of digits represented as comma-separated strings.\n\n1.  **Parse the Grid**: The first step is to convert the input string into a 2D grid or list of lists of integers. For example, `'001,121'` becomes `[[0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Actor**: In all examples, the input grid contains a single digit '2'. This '2' seems to be the agent of change. My primary hypothesis is that the '2' moves to a new location in the grid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation**:\n    *   In `Input_A` (`001111,121111,111111`), the '2' is at `(row=1, col=1)`. The output is `201111,101111,111111`. This shows the '2' at `(1,1)` became '0', and a '0' at `(0,0)` became a '2'. The '2' moved from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`, a change of `(-1, -1)`.\n    *   In `Input_B`, the '2' is at `(3,6)`. In the output, it becomes '0', and the '0' at `(2,7)` becomes a '2'. The '2' moved from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`, a change of `(-1, +1)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Rule for Movement**: The direction of the move must be determined by the '2's local environment. I will examine the eight neighbors of the '2'. Let's calculate the sum of the values of these eight neighbors (`N`).\n    *   For `Input_A`, the neighbors of '2' at `(1,1)` are `0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1`. The sum `N_A` is 6. The move was `(-1,-1)`.\n    *   For `Input_B`, the neighbors of '2' at `(3,6)` are `0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1`. The sum `N_B` is 4. The move was `(-1,+1)`.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Mathematical Rule**: I need a function that maps `N` to a direction `(dr, dc)`. There are 8 directions. Let's create an ordered list of directions, for example, clockwise starting from Up: `directions = [(-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)]`.\n    I need to find a formula `f(N)` that gives an index into this list. After some trial and error, I found a potential formula: `index = (3 * N + 5) % 8`.\n    *   Check for A: `N_A=6`. `index = (3 * 6 + 5) % 8 = 23 % 8 = 7`. `directions[7]` is `(-1, -1)`. This matches.\n    *   Check for B: `N_B=4`. `index = (3 * 4 + 5) % 8 = 17 % 8 = 1`. `directions[1]` is `(-1, +1)`. This matches.\n    The rule seems correct.\n\n6.  **Handle Special Conditions**: The output can be `'MISSING'`. This likely happens if the move is invalid. A move is invalid if:\n    *   The destination is outside the grid boundaries.\n    *   The value at the destination cell is not '0'. (The '2' can only move to an empty space).\n\n7.  **Apply to Input_C**:\n    *   `Input_C='000000,011120,111111'`.\n    *   The '2' is at `(1,4)`.\n    *   Its neighbors are `0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1`. The sum `N_C` is 4.\n    *   Since `N_C = N_B`, the direction must be the same as in case B: `(-1, +1)`.\n    *   The destination is `(1-1, 4+1) = (0,5)`.\n    *   The value at `(0,5)` in the input grid is `0`. The move is valid.\n    *   The '2' at `(1,4)` becomes '0', and the '0' at `(0,5)` becomes '2'.\n    *   The final grid will be transformed accordingly.\n\n8.  **Final Code**: Based on this logic, I will write a Python script that implements these steps to calculate the final state for `Input_C`.\n\n```python\n# The input string for the puzzle\ninput_str = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n# 1.
