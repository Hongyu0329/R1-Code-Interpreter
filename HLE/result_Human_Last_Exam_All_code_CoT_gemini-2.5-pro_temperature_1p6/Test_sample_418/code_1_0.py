# Step 1: Define the number of equivalence classes for each space.
# Each of the five spaces is homogeneous, meaning all its points are in a single
# equivalence class under its group of auto-homeomorphisms.

# The Torus is homogeneous.
num_classes_torus = 1

# The Sphere is homogeneous.
num_classes_sphere = 1

# The Real Line is homogeneous.
num_classes_real_line = 1

# A three-point discrete space is homogeneous (any permutation is a homeomorphism).
num_classes_discrete_3 = 1

# A five-point discrete space is homogeneous.
num_classes_discrete_5 = 1

# Step 2: Sum the number of classes.
# Since the five spaces are not homeomorphic to each other, any auto-homeomorphism
# of the total space X must map each space to itself.
# Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of
# classes in each individual space.
total_equivalence_classes = (num_classes_torus +
                               num_classes_sphere +

                               num_classes_discrete_5)

# Step 3: Print the result as a detailed equation.
