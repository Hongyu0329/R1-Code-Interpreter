# The user wants to identify the correct statements about probabilistic graphical models.
# Let's analyze each statement:
# A: False. This is a strong claim. For single queries, variable elimination can be more efficient than building a full junction tree.
# B: False. The algorithm's main weakness is its high computational cost on graphs with high treewidth. It is not resilient.
# C: True. The nodes of the junction tree correspond to cliques of variables, and the algorithm computes and passes messages that are potentials (factors) representing joint distributions over these sets of variables.
# D: False. The premise "resilient to graphs with high treewidth" is incorrect.
# E: True. This is the primary limitation of the junction tree algorithm. The complexity is exponential in the treewidth, so high treewidth makes it intractable.
# F: False. This is a duplicate of statement D.
# G: True. This correctly explains *why* the algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth. The size of the potential tables (representing joint distributions) for the cliques becomes exponentially large.
# H: False. The relationship is exponential, not linear.
# I: True. The computational cost grows exponentially with the number of variables in the largest clique. Thus, efficiency diminishes exponentially.
# J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on the size of the largest clique.
# L: True. This is a correct (though elaborately stated) consequence of the running intersection property. The set of cliques containing any given variable must form a connected subtree.
#
# The set of correct statements is {C, E, G, I, L}.
# The final step is to format and print this result.

correct_statements = ['C', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'L']

# Format the output as a comma-separated list enclosed in curly brackets.
output_string = "{" + ", ".join(sorted(correct_statements)) + "}"

print(output_string)
<<<{"C", "E", "G", "I", "L"}>>>
