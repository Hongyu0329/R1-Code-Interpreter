# In this problem, we are asked to find the explicit form of H(t) from an energy estimate.
# The derivation in the text shows the steps to obtain H(t).
# Here, we use python's symbolic math library 'sympy' to represent and print the final expression.

# Define mathematical symbols for time 't' and a dummy variable 's' for integration.
t, s = sympy.symbols('t s')

# We represent the term ||∂_x u(·, s)||_L∞, which is a function of 's',
# with a symbolic function for clear printing.
norm_du_inf = sympy.Function('||∂_x u(·, s)||_L∞')

# According to the problem statement, h(t) is the integral of the above norm from 0 to t.
h_t = sympy.Integral(norm_du_inf(s), (s, 0, t))

# Our derivation shows that H(t) is the exponential of h(t).
# The coefficient in the exponent is 1, and the base is e.
H_t = sympy.exp(h_t)

# Print the resulting expression for H(t).
print("The explicit form of H(t) is:")
print(H_t)
