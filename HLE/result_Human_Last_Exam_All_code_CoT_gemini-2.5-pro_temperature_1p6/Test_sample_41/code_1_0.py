# The meteorological sounding data indicates an environment that is extremely favorable for the development of tornadic supercells.
# Multiple parameters such as CAPE (instability), SRH (low-level wind shear/helicity), and a low LCL (cloud base) are all at levels that strongly support tornado formation, as confirmed by the high STP (Significant Tornado Parameter) value of 4.7.
# However, to find the greatest negative impact, we must look for inhibiting factors.
# One such factor is the Surface Convective Inhibition (CINH) of -38 J/kg. This "cap" can prevent storms from initiating.
# However, the data also shows a forecast maximum temperature (maxT) of 84F, which is greater than the convective temperature (ConvT) of 80F. This indicates that daytime heating is expected to overcome the inhibition, allowing storms to form.
# The most significant negative factor present is the Downdraft CAPE (DCAPE), with a value of 994 J/kg.
# DCAPE measures the potential strength of a storm's downdrafts. While downdrafts are a part of supercell structure, a value as high as 994 suggests the potential for exceptionally strong and expansive outflow.
# This powerful outflow can undercut the storm's rotating updraft (mesocyclone), cutting it off from its source of warm, moist inflow from the surface.
# This process can prevent a tornado from forming or cause a tornado to dissipate. In an environment that is otherwise primed for a significant tornado, this is the most likely failure mode.
# Therefore, 994 is the number representing the greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis.
