    # Analysis of each statement:
    # A. The recursive definition of P_k... introduces an order-dependence that might
    #    not be well-defined... It's unclear how this order is determined.
    # Reasoning: This is a valid critique of the formalism's clarity. A process
    # depending on an "order of appearance" without a strict definition for that order
    # is ambiguous. So, statement A is correct.
    is_A_correct = True

    # B. The claim states that gamma[gamma^-1[P]] = P...
    # Reasoning: This misrepresents the actual claim, which is about the results
    # of program evaluation: gamma[...](S0) = P(S0). Statement B argues against
    # a simplified, incorrect version of the claim. Thus, statement B is incorrect.
    is_B_correct = False

    # C. When you aggregate facts, you potentially lose information...
    #    This means gamma^-1[gamma[P]] might not be identical to P.
    # Reasoning: This is correct. Aggregation (gamma) can map multiple distinct
    # constants to one, losing information. Segregation (gamma^-1) cannot know
    # the original constant and will generate all possibilities from the pre-image,
    # so the original program P is generally not recovered.
    is_C_correct = True

    # D. ...it's not clear if gamma^-1[S0] is meant to generate all possible
    #    combinations... or just replace with a single representative.
    # Reasoning: The recursive definition for segregation uses a union operator
    # over the entire pre-image set (excluding the original constant). This is not
    # ambiguous; it explicitly directs to generate all combinations. Therefore,
    # statement D is incorrect.
    is_D_correct = False

    # E. The claim essentially states that if a Datalog program and a set of facts
    #    are already at a stable level of granularity, further attempts to coarsen or
    #    refine that granularity will have no effect...
    # Reasoning: This is an excellent conceptual summary of the claim. It correctly
    # interprets the preconditions (gamma[P]=P, etc.) as defining a stable coarse
    # grain, and the equation itself as stating that coarse-grained inference
    # is equivalent to the coarsening of a full fine-grained inference.
