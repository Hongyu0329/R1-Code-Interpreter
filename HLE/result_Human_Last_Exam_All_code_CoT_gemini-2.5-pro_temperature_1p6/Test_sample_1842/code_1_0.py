# The Diophantine equation simplifies to (x^3+y^3-z^3)(x^4+y^4+z^4-w^4) = 0.
# Since x,y,z are positive integers, x^3+y^3=z^3 has no solution (Fermat's Last Theorem).
# Thus, we must have x^4+y^4+z^4 = w^4.

# The smallest known positive integer solution to x^4+y^4+z^4 = w^4 was found by Roger Frye.
# This solution provides the (x,y,z,w) with the smallest maximum value.
# The values for {x,y,z} are a permutation of {95800, 217519, 414560} and w is 422481.
val1 = 95800
val2 = 217519
val3 = 414560
w = 422481

# We can assign any of the three values to x, y, and z.
# For example, let's set them as:
x = val1
y = val2
z = val3

# The problem asks for the sum x+y+z.
the_sum = x + y + z
