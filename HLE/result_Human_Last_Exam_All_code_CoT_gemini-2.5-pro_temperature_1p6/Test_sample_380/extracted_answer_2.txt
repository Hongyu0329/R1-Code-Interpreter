No, the local magnetic field is not considered radial at the L1 point due to the Parker spiral nature of the solar wind's magnetic field. Using a coordinate system based on the radial direction is a common but often incorrect approximation, while the physically correct method requires transforming into a local field-aligned coordinate system.
