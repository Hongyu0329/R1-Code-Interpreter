    Provides the symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 circles in a circle.

    The problem of finding the optimal packing of N circles in a circle is computationally
    complex. The results for larger N are based on numerical findings rather than
    formal proofs. For N=1135, the best-known packing configuration has been identified
