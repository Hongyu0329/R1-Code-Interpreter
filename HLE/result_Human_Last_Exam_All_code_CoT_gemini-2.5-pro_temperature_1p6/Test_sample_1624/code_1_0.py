        print("   - A separable space must satisfy the 'Countable Chain Condition' (c.c.c.), meaning any collection of disjoint non-empty open sets must be countable.")
        print("   - Therefore, if X were separable, U would have only a countable number of components.")
        print("   - Since R and S^1 are separable, a countable union of them makes U separable.")

U is open because any point in an inner spine is some distance away from all other spines and the endpoints. U is dense because the only points not in U (the origin and the '1' endpoints) are all limit points of U.")

        print("6. Cardinality of the Constructed Space")
        print("   - The cardinality of our space X_k is the number of spines multiplied by the number of points in each spine.")
