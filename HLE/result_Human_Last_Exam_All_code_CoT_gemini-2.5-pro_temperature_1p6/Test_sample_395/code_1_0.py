    This function calculates the smallest possible value of the union of sets under the given conditions.
    
    Let n be the number of sets, k be the size of each set, and l be the size of the intersection of any two distinct sets.
    Here, n = 2024, k = 45, l = 1.

    We consider a construction that is likely to minimize the size of the union.
    This construction involves having one element, let's call it x_0, that is common to all n sets.
    Let the sets be A_1, A_2, ..., A_n.
    Then x_0 is in every A_i.

    The condition |A_i intersect A_j| = 1 for i != j implies that A_i intersect A_j = {x_0}.
    
    Each set A_i has size k=45. It consists of x_0 and k-1 = 44 other elements.
    Let's call the set of these 44 other elements B_i. So, A_i = {x_0} union B_i.
    
    Since A_i intersect A_j = {x_0}, the sets B_i and B_j must be disjoint for i != j.
    
    The union of all sets is the union of {x_0} and all the B_i sets.
    Union(A_i) = {x_0} union B_1 union B_2 ... union B_n.
    
    Since all B_i are disjoint from each other and from {x_0}, the size of the union is:
    |Union(A_i)| = 1 + |B_1| + |B_2| + ... + |B_n|
                 = 1 + n * |B_i|
                 = 1 + n * (k-1)
    
    With n=2024 and k=45, the size is 1 + 2024 * (45 - 1).
