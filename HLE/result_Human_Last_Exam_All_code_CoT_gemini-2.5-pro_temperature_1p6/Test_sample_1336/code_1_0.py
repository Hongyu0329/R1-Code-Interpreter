    Calculates the total number of smooth coverings for a given prime p > 5.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings D(SL(2,p), b, w)
    of D(PSL(2,p), b, w) for a prime p > 5. This number corresponds to the
    total number of p-blocks of the group G = SL(2, p).

    The calculation proceeds in two steps:
    1. The number of p-blocks of the simple group S = PSL(2, p) is (p+3)/2.
    2. G = SL(2, p) is a central extension of S by a center Z(G) of order 2.
       Since p > 5, the defect groups of the p-blocks of G have trivial
       intersection with the center Z(G). This implies that each p-block of S is
       covered by exactly |Z(G)| = 2 blocks of G.

    Therefore, the total number of p-blocks of G is 2 * ((p+3)/2), which simplifies to p+3.
