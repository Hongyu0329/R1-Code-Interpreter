    "Of the choices provided, several are involved in the evolution of genes, but only a few explain the specific phenomenon of both retaining and diversifying a duplicated gene. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the most likely mechanism:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The primary goal is to find a mechanism that explains two outcomes after a gene is duplicated:\n    *   **Retention:** Why the new copy is kept in the genome instead of being lost (which is a common fate). There must be a selective advantage, or at least no disadvantage, to keeping it.\n    *   **Divergence:** Why the two gene copies become different from each other over time.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous DNA sequences more similar to each other. It actively works *against* divergence, so it cannot be the primary mechanism.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a duplicate gene becomes non-functional. This is a mechanism for gene *loss*, not functional *retention*. While it is a very common fate for duplicates, it doesn't explain how they are retained to serve a purpose.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new function. This strongly favors both retention (as the new function is beneficial) and divergence (as the gene changes). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy specializes by losing one of the original functions, such that both copies are now required to fulfill the complete original role. This provides a strong reason for *retention* (both are needed) and explains *divergence* (as they accumulate different disabling mutations). This is also a strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This describes the rapid diversification of species to fill new ecological niches. It is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.\n\n3.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. Subfunctionalization is often considered more probable as an initial step. It relies on relatively common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. In contrast, neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur before the redundant gene copy is silenced by pseudogenization.\n    *   Therefore, the passive process of subfunctionalization provides a more frequent and immediate route to preserving duplicate genes, making it arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism for initial retention, which then allows for divergence.\n\nThe following Python script systematically performs this analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence\n    to determine the most likely candidate.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'mechanism': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explains_retention': False,\n            'explains_divergence': False,\n            'reason': 'This mechanism causes homogenization, making gene copies more similar, which is the opposite of divergence.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'mechanism': 'Pseudogenization',\n            'explains_retention': False,\n            'explains_divergence': True, # Diverges to non-functionality\n            'reason': 'This is the process of a gene becoming non-functional, which explains gene loss, not functional retention.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'mechanism': 'Neofunctionalization',\n            'explains_retention': True,\n            'explains_divergence': True,\n            'reason': 'One copy gains a new function.

However, the question asks for the 'most likely' one.\n\n        Subfunctionalization provides an immediate pathway for preserving both gene copies because it relies on common, degenerative mutations (losing a part of the original function). Neofunctionalization requires a much rarer event—a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation—to occur before the gene is silenced.\n\n        Therefore, from a probability standpoint, subfunctionalization is considered a more likely initial fate for duplicate genes, ensuring their retention and allowing divergence to proceed.\n    \"\"\")\n    print(conclusion)\n\n    final_answer_key = 'D'\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The most likely mechanism is ({final_answer_key}) {analysis[final_answer_key]['mechanism']}.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer_key}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms()\n```"
