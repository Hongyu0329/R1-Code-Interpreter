# The provided potential function is unphysical for a "well".
# We interpret the problem as finding the energy levels for a particle "confined"
# in a sphere of radius R, which corresponds to the standard infinite spherical well model.
# The parameters V0 in the potential are considered part of a red herring.

# Define the physical constants
R = 3e-9  # meters
m = 9.11e-31  # kg (mass of the particle, assumed to be an electron)
hbar = 1.05457e-34  # J*s (reduced Planck constant)
e_charge = 1.602e-19  # C (elementary charge for J to eV conversion)

# The energy levels of an infinite spherical well are given by:
# E_nl = (hbar^2 * z_nl^2) / (2 * m * R^2)
# where z_nl is the n-th zero of the l-th spherical Bessel function.

# To find the first two energy levels, we need the two smallest zeros.
# The ordering of the zeros determines the energy level ordering.
# - Ground state (E1): Corresponds to the first zero of j_0(x), which is z_10 = pi.
# - First excited state (E2): Corresponds to the first zero of j_1(x), z_11, which is smaller than the second zero of j_0(x) (2*pi).

# The first zero for l=0 (1s state)
z10 = np.pi

# The first zero for l=1 (1p state).
# The zeros of the spherical bessel function j_l(x) are the same as the
# non-zero roots of the cylindrical Bessel function J_{l+1/2}(x).
# We use SciPy to find the first zero of J_{1.5}(x).
z11 = jn_zeros(1.5, 1)[0]

# Calculate the energy prefactor
prefactor_J = hbar**2 / (2 * m * R**2)

# Calculate the first two energy levels in Joules
E1_J = prefactor_J * z10**2
E2_J = prefactor_J * z11**2

# Convert energies to electron-volts (eV)
E1_eV = E1_J / e_charge
E2_eV = E2_J / e_charge

# Calculate the energy difference in eV
delta_E_eV = E2_eV - E1_eV

# Output the results as requested. The "final equation" is the subtraction for Delta E.
