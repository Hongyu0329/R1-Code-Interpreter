    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital:** The first step is to write down the mathematical expression for a normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO). The general form is $\\phi_{n,l,m}(\\mathbf{r}) = N r^{n-1} e^{-\\zeta r} Y_{l,m}(\\theta, \\phi)$. For a 1s orbital, $n=1, l=0, m=0$, which simplifies the expression. We will determine the normalization constant $N$ such that the integral of the squared wavefunction over all space is equal to 1.\n2.  **Set Up the Integral:** The expression $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ represents a quantum mechanical integral. Assuming $i=j$, which is the standard interpretation for an expectation value, we need to solve:\n    \\[\n    \\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}\n    \\]\n    We will write this integral explicitly using spherical coordinates, where the volume element is $d\\mathbf{r} = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$.\n3.  **Solve the Integral:** The integral can be separated into a radial part (involving $r$) and an angular part (involving $\\theta$ and $\\phi$). We will solve each part separately.\n4.  **Combine and Simplify:** The final result is the product of the normalization factor, the radial integral, and the angular integral. We will combine these terms and simplify to get the final analytical answer.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these steps symbolically. The code will define the necessary symbols, calculate the individual components of the integral (normalization constant, radial part, angular part), and then multiply them to demonstrate how the terms combine and simplify to the final result. This will also satisfy the requirement to show the components of the final equation.\n\nThis process will provide a rigorous derivation and confirmation of the value of the integral.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a Slater-Type Orbital\n    using symbolic mathematics with sympy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables\n    # r: radial distance\n    # theta: polar angle\n    # phi: azimuthal angle\n    # zeta: orbital exponent (a positive real number)\n    r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('r theta phi', real=True)\n    zeta = sp.symbols('zeta', positive=True)\n\n    print(\"Evaluating the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital.\")\n    print(\"The orbital is phi_1s(r) = N * exp(-zeta*r).
