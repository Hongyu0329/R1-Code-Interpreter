# The original problem statement contains a contradiction.
# As shown in the derivation, if the limit in the first condition is 1,
# the resulting coefficients a=1/4 and b=1 do not satisfy the integral relation.
# The most likely typo is that the limit should be 3.
# The following code solves the problem assuming the limit is 3.

# Let's verify the logic.
# Assume lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/e^x = 3.
# From the limit, we determine the coefficients b and c.
# lim (a*e^(2x) + b*e^x + c + 3) / e^x = lim (a*e^x + b + (c+3)/e^x)
# For the limit to be finite, c+3=0, so c=-3.
# The limit then evaluates to b. So, b=3.

b = 3
c = -3

# From the condition f(ln(2)) = 0, we find coefficient a.
# f(x) = a*e^(2x) + b*e^x + c
# f(ln(2)) = a*e^(2*ln(2)) + b*e^(ln(2)) + c = a*(2^2) + b*2 + c = 4a + 2b + c
# 4a + 2b + c = 0
# 4a + 2*(3) + (-3) = 0
# 4a + 6 - 3 = 0
# 4a + 3 = 0
# a = -3/4

a = -3.0 / 4.0

# The integral identity is equivalent to the condition a = f(ln(b)).
# Let's verify if our coefficients a=-3/4 and b=3 satisfy this.
# f(ln(b)) = a*(b^2) + b*b + c
f_ln_b = a * (b**2) + b * b + c
is_consistent = (a == f_ln_b)

# All conditions are now consistent. We can find a+b.
