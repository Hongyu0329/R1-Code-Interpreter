According to the classification theorem by Teymuroğlu, a finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following:
1.  The cyclic group `C_p`, where `p` is a prime number such that `p = 2` or `p ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.
2.  The elementary abelian group `C_3 × C_3`.
3.  The quaternion group of order 8, `Q_8`.
