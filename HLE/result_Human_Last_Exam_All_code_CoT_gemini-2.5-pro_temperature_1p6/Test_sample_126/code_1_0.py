def check_structure(name, structure):
    """
    Checks if a given matrix structure conforms to the required block-diagonal form
    for a correctable SWAP variant.

    Required form:
    A 0 0 0
    0 F G 0
    0 J K 0
    0 0 0 P

    This means:
    - U[0,1], U[0,2], U[0,3] must be 0 (except U[0,0] for A) - actually only U[0,1] and U[0,2] must be 0
    - U[1,0], U[1,3] must be 0
    - U[2,0], U[2,3] must be 0
    - U[3,0], U[3,1], U[3,2] must be 0 (except U[3,3] for P) - actually only U[3,1] and U[3,2] must be 0
    Let's refine the required structure:
    - U must be zero for any element connecting subspace {|00>,|11>} to {|01>,|10>}
    - These "forbidden" indices are (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)
    - Additionally, based on the 'phase change' constraint, we deduced D=0 and M=0.
    - So, U[0,3] and U[3,0] must also be zero.

    This leads to the final sparse structure:
    A 0 0 0
    0 F G 0
    0 J K 0
    0 0 0 P
    
    The code will check if a structure from the options has non-zero elements ONLY where allowed by this template.
