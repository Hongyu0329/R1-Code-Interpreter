    # Legal Principles
    # 1. A law firm owes a continuing duty of confidentiality to a former client.
    # 2. A firm cannot act against a former client in a matter where confidential information from the prior representation could be used to the former client's prejudice.
    # 3. The information NC LLP holds (financials, contracts) is directly relevant and prejudicial in the context of an acquisition.
    # 4. Ethical walls may not be sufficient to cure a conflict, especially without the former client's consent.
    # 5. When a conflict exists, the prejudiced party can often waive it with informed consent.
