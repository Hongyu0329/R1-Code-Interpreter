    "Of course. Here is the etymological derivation of the requested Proto-Indo-European verb.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the PIE root:** I will start with the provided Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`. Based on the Latin cognate `sāgīre`, I'll infer that the root has a long vowel, making it `*sēh₂g-`.\n2.  **Trace to Proto-Germanic:** I will apply the sound changes that occurred between PIE and Proto-Germanic (PGmc), primarily the effects of the laryngeal consonant and Grimm's Law, to derive the PGmc form.\n3.  **Trace to Daughter Languages:** From the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form, I will apply the specific sound changes for each subsequent language to find the resulting words in Old Norse (ON), Old English (OE), and Old High German (OHG). These changes include i-umlaut, vowel shifts, and the High German Consonant Shift.\n4.  **Generate Python Script:** I will create a Python script that programmatically prints this step-by-step derivation, explaining each sound change along the way and presenting the final forms for each language. The numbers in the output correspond to the numbered steps of the derivation.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function traces the PIE root *seh₂g- through several Germanic languages\n    by explaining the historical sound changes at each step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the forms for easy reference and printing.\n    pie_verb = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pie_root = \"*sēh₂g-\"\n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkijaną\"\n    on_form = \"sœkja\"\n    oe_form = \"sēcan\"\n    ohg_form = \"suohhen\"\n\n    print(f\"Tracing the etymology of PIE '{pie_verb}':\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
