# The structure of the formula suggests a hierarchical construction for the countermodel.
# The formula is of the form: (C0 AND C1) -> B2
# To falsify it, we need a root world w0 where (C0 AND C1) is true and B2 is false.
# C0 is (P0 -> B1) and C1 is (P1 -> B2).
# P_i is (A_i -> B_i) or (not A_i -> B_i).
# Falsifying P_i at a world w requires two distinct successor worlds (a fan of 2).

# Let's count the number of nodes required.
# Level 0: The root node w0.
nodes = 1
root_node = 1

# To falsify the main formula at w0, we need w0 to see the premises as true, but the conclusion as false.
# w0 validates (P1 -> B2) but not B2. This can be achieved if w0 does not validate P1.
# Falsifying P1 at w0 requires a fan of 2 nodes, let's call them w1 and w2.
level1_nodes = 2
nodes += level1_nodes

# At w1 and w2, P1 must become true (a property of these fan models), so B2 must be forced there.
# Now consider the other premise, C0 = (P0 -> B1), which must also be true at w0.
# This means for all successors of w0 (including w1 and w2), if P0 is true, B1 must be true.
# But w1 and w2 must serve as witnesses for falsifying P1.
# This requires, for instance, w1 to validate A1 but not B1.
# If w1 validates P0, then B1 must be validated at w1. This would prevent w1 from being a witness.
# Therefore, w1 must NOT validate P0.

# To falsify P0 at w1, we need another fan of 2 nodes above w1.
w1_children = 2
nodes += w1_children

# Similarly, w2 must not validate P0. This requires another fan of 2 nodes above w2.
w2_children = 2
nodes += w2_children

# The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at each level of construction.
# Root (1)
#   -> Level 1 for P1 (2 nodes)
#     -> Level 2 for P0 (2 fans of 2, so 4 nodes)

# Total nodes = 1 (w0) + 2 (w1, w2) + 2 (children of w1) + 2 (children of w2)
