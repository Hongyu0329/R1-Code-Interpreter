    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break down the visual clues to construct the character step by step.\n\n*   **\"A wooden stick\"**: This is often interpreted in character components as a single horizontal stroke: `一`.\n*   **\"hanging a square box\"**: This describes the character for \"mouth\" or \"opening\", `口`, positioned below the \"stick\".\n*   **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: The character for \"field\", `田`, visually resembles a ladder or a window pane.\n\nWhen you stack these three components (`一`, `口`, `田`) on top of each other, they form the character `畐` (fù). This component is most famously used on the right side of the character `福` (fú), which means \"fortune\" or \"good luck\". The left side is the radical `礻`, which is related to spirituality and blessings.\n\nTherefore, the riddle describes the character `福`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its components.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The riddle describes the visual components of the character '福' (fú).\n    \n    # Clue 1: \"A wooden stick\"\n    # This represents the top horizontal stroke '一'.\n    part_stick = '一'\n\n    # Clue 2: \"hanging a square box\"\n    # This represents the '口' character.\n    part_box = '口'\n\n    # Clue 3: \"a ladder placed in the center\"\n    # This represents the '田' character, which looks like a ladder.\n    part_ladder = '田'\n\n    # These three parts (一 + 口 + 田) form the right side of the character, '畐'.\n    # The complete character for \"fortune\", '福', adds the '礻' radical on the left.\n    part_radical = '礻'\n    final_character = '福'\n\n    print(\"The riddle describes the character for 'Fortune' or 'Good Luck'.\")\n    print(\"Here is the breakdown based on the clues:\")\n    print(f\"'A wooden stick'                -> {part_stick}\")\n    print(f\"'hanging a square box'          -> {part_box}\")\n    print(f\"'a ladder placed in the center'   -> {part_ladder}\")\n    print(\"\\nThese components, along with a radical, form the final character.\")\n    \n    # The final instruction asks to output each \"number\" in the final equation.\n    # We will interpret \"number\" as \"component\".\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{part_radical} + {part_stick} + {part_box} + {part_ladder} = {final_character}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<福>>>"
