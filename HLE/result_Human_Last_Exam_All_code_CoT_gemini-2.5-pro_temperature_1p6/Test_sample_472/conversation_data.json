    "The user wants me to scan a line of Latin poetry.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the line and probable meter.** The line is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". Its length and source (Plautus, *Mercator* 401) suggest it is a **Trochaic Septenarius**. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) followed by a final long syllable, often with a caesura (pause) after the fourth foot. Common substitutions are allowed.\n2.  **Syllabify the line.** The line works best when syllabified without any elisions:\n    `et ti bi be ne es se so li quom si bi sit ma le` (15 syllables)\n3.  **Scan each syllable's quantity (L for Long, S for Short).**\n    *   A vowel is **long by nature** (e.g., `ō`, `ī`) or if it's a diphthong (`ae`, `oe`, etc.).\n    *   A vowel is **long by position** if it's followed by two consonants (e.g., `e` in `e**st**`).\n    *   Otherwise, a vowel is typically short.\n4.  **Group the syllables into the seven metrical feet**, applying the rules of the trochaic septenarius. A trochee (`L S`) can be substituted by a spondee (`L L`), a tribrach (`S S S`), or, in Plautine verse, sometimes an iamb (`S L`). The final syllable of the line is *anceps* (can be treated as L or S to fit the meter).\n\n**Step-by-step Scansion:**\n*   `et ti-`: `et` is L by position (before `t-`). `ti` is S. -> Foot 1: **L S** (Trochee)\n*   `bi be ne`: `bi`, `be`, and `ne` are all S by nature. -> Foot 2: **S S S** (Tribrach)\n*   `es-se`: `es-` is L by position (before `ss`). `-se` is S. -> Foot 3: **L S** (Trochee)\n*   `so-li`: from *sōlus*, the dative is `sōlī`. Both are L by nature. -> Foot 4: **L L** (Spondee)\n    (This is the natural position for the caesura)\n*   `quom si-`: `quom` is L by position (before `s-`). `si` is S. -> Foot 5: **L S** (Trochee)\n*   `bi sit`: `bi` is S. `sit` is L by position (before `m-`). -> Foot 6: **S L** (Iamb, a common variation in Plautus)\n*   `ma-le`: `ma` is S. The final syllable `-le` is anceps and is treated as L to fit the meter. -> Foot 7: **S L** (Iamb)\n\n**Final Scansion:**\nL S | S S S | L S | L L | L S | S L | S L\n\nI will now generate the Python code to print this result.\n\n```python\n# The line to be scanned is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n# L = Long syllable\n# S = Short syllable\n# The meter is a Trochaic Septenarius, with feet separated by spaces.\n\n# Foot 1: et ti (L S - Trochee)\nfoot_1 = \"L S\"\n\n# Foot 2: bi be ne (S S S - Tribrach)\nfoot_2 = \"S S S\"\n\n# Foot 3: es se (L S - Trochee)\nfoot_3 = \"L S\"\n\n# Foot 4: so li (L L - Spondee)\nfoot_4 = \"L L\"\n\n# Foot 5: quom si (L S - Trochee)\nfoot_5 = \"L S\"\n\n# Foot 6: bi sit (S L - Iamb)\nfoot_6 = \"S L\"\n\n# Foot 7: ma le (S L - Iamb, with final anceps syllable treated as long)\nfoot_7 = \"S L\"\n\n# Combine the feet with spaces in between to represent the full line's scansion.\nfinal_scansion = f\"{foot_1} {foot_2} {foot_3} {foot_4} {foot_5} {foot_6} {foot_7}\"\n\nprint(final_scansion)\n```\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
