    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow a clear step-by-step plan based on established mathematical formulas.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Simplicial Volume of Individuals:** First, we will compute the simplicial volume for each surface, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. For a closed, orientable surface of genus $g > 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$.\n2.  **Determine the Product Formula Coefficient:** The simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds, $M$ of dimension $m$ and $N$ of dimension $n$, is calculated using the formula $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$. Since $\\Sigma_g$ is a surface, its dimension is 2. Therefore, for our case, $m=2$ and $n=2$. We will calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2+2}{2}$.\n3.  **Compute the Final Result:** We will multiply the two individual simplicial volumes by the coefficient calculated in the previous step to get the final answer.\n\n**Execution of the plan:**\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$: $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$: $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n*   The coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n*   The final simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the final equation with all the components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_simplicial_volume_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, Σ_31 and Σ_17.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Genera of the two surfaces\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    # The dimension of a surface is 2\n    m = 2\n    n = 2\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.\n    # The formula for a surface of genus g > 1 is ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4.\n    sv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\n    sv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula.\n    # The coefficient is C(m+n, m).\n    coefficient = math.comb(m + n, m)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of the product space.\n    # ||Σ_g1 × Σ_g2|| = C(m+n, m) * ||Σ_g1|| * ||Σ_g2||\n    total_sv = coefficient * sv1 * sv2\n\n    # Output the final equation showing each number involved in the calculation.\n    print(f\"The calculation for the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} × Σ_{g2} is:\")\n    print(f\"{coefficient} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\nsolve_simplicial_volume_product()\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
