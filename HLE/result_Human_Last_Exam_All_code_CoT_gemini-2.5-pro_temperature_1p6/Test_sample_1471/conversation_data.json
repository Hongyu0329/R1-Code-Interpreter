    "My plan is to solve the equation by first converting the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n1.  **VIII**: V (5) + I (1) + I (1) + I (1) = 8\n2.  **CL**: C (100) + L (50) = 150\n3.  **MMDCCCXI**: M (1000) + M (1000) + D (500) + C (100) + C (100) + C (100) + X (10) + I (1) = 2811\n\nNow, I will substitute these modern numbers back into the original equation:\n`8 / 150 - 2811`\n\nFinally, I will use Python to compute the result of this expression and print the full equation along with the answer.\n\n```python\n# The equation is VIII / CL - MMDCCCXI = ?\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to integers\nnum1 = 8  # VIII\nnum2 = 150 # CL\nnum3 = 2811 # MMDCCCXI\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the full equation with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-2810.9466666666666>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
