# The number of blocks of kG for a finite group G and a field k of characteristic p
# is given by the number of p-regular conjugacy classes of G, provided G is p-solvable.

# 1. Define group and field properties.
p = 2
order_D = 4  # |D| = |(C_2)^2|
order_S = 27 # |S| = |3^{1+2}_+|
order_G = order_D * order_S
print(f"The group G has order {order_G}, and the field k has characteristic p={p}.")

# 2. Justification for using the p-regular classes count.
# The group G has a normal series 1 < D < G.
# D is a p-group (p=2). The quotient G/D is S, a 3-group, hence a p'-group.
# Thus, G is p-solvable, and the number of p-blocks equals the number of p-regular conjugacy classes.

# 3. Identify the p-regular elements.
# The p-regular elements for p=2 are elements of odd order.
# In G, whose order is 108 = 2^2 * 3^3, these are the 3-elements.
# All 3-elements are conjugate into a Sylow 3-subgroup, S.
# We must count the number of G-conjugacy classes with elements in S.

# 4. Determine the normalizer of S in G to count these classes.
# The G-conjugacy classes in S are the same as the N_G(S)-conjugacy classes in S.
# N_G(S) consists of elements g in G that normalize S. This is found to be D^S x S,
# where D^S is the subgroup of elements in D fixed by the action of S.
# The given action of S on D is non-trivial, so a C_3 quotient of S acts as a 3-cycle
# on the non-identity elements of D. This action only fixes the identity element.
size_D_S_fixed_points = 1
print(f"The size of the subgroup of fixed points D^S is {size_D_S_fixed_points}.")
print("This implies that the normalizer N_G(S) is S itself.")

# 5. Count the conjugacy classes of S.
# Since N_G(S) = S, the G-conjugacy classes of 3-elements correspond exactly to
# the conjugacy classes of S.
# S = 3^{1+2}_+ is an extraspecial 3-group of order 27.
# Its center, Z(S), has order 3. Central elements form singleton conjugacy classes.
num_classes_center = 3
print(f"The center Z(S) provides {num_classes_center} conjugacy classes of size 1.")

# Elements not in the center have larger classes.
num_non_central_elements = order_S - num_classes_center
# For any non-central element x, the size of its centralizer C_S(x) is 9.
# The size of its conjugacy class is |S|/|C_S(x)|.
size_non_central_class = order_S // 9
print(f"Each non-central element is in a conjugacy class of size {size_non_central_class}.")

# The number of these classes is the number of non-central elements divided by their class size.
num_classes_non_center = num_non_central_elements // size_non_central_class
print(f"The number of non-central conjugacy classes is {num_non_central_elements}/{size_non_central_class} = {num_classes_non_center}.")

# 6. Final calculation.
# The total number of conjugacy classes of S, and thus the number of blocks of kG,
# is the sum of central and non-central classes.
total_blocks = num_classes_center + num_classes_non_center
print(f"The total number of blocks = (central classes) + (non-central classes)")
print(f"Number of blocks = {num_classes_center} + {num_classes_non_center} = {total_blocks}")

print(f"<<<{total_blocks}>>>")
