    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The problem asks about the semidihedral group of size 512. The general form of a semidihedral group is $SD_{2^n}$, which has an order of $2^n$. For size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element, i.e., of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some element $g$ in the group. The task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Counting Strategy:** We can count the cyclic subgroups by categorizing them based on where their generators lie in the group structure. The group $SD_{2^n}$ contains a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1}$. The other elements are not part of this subgroup.\n\n    *   **Category 1: Subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**: First, we count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups entirely contained within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. A cyclic group of order $N$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$. Here, the order is $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$. The number of divisors of $2^8$ is $8+1=9$, which is equal to $n$.\n    *   **Category 2: Subgroups generated by other elements**: Next, we analyze the elements outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$. These are all of the form $sr^i$.\n        *   Some of these elements have order 2. There are $2^{n-2} = 128$ such elements, and they each generate a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n        *   The remaining elements have order 4. There are $2^{n-2} = 128$ such elements. These elements form pairs that generate the same subgroup, resulting in $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n    *   None of the subgroups in Category 2 are the same as any in Category 1.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from all categories: (subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$) + (subgroups of order 2 from outside $\\langle r \\rangle$) + (subgroups of order 4 from outside $\\langle r \\rangle$). This gives the formula: $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will implement this formula. It will first determine $n$ from the group size 512, then calculate the number of subgroups for each category, and finally sum them up and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_semidihedral(group_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in a semidihedral group.\n\n    Args:\n        group_size (int): The order of the semidihedral group, must be a power of 2.\n\n    Returns:\n        None.
