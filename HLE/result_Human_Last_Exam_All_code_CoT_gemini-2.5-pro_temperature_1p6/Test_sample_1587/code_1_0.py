    # The problem asks for the smallest 'k' for a dissection of order 5 of a square.
    # "Order 5" means there are 5 non-isomorphic ways to assemble the pieces.
    # This is a known, challenging problem in recreational mathematics. Solving it requires
    # referencing discoveries in the field rather than direct computation.

    # Known results for similar problems provide context:
    # A dissection of order 3 is possible with k=6 pieces.
    # A dissection of order 4 is possible with k=7 pieces.

    # The discovery for order 5:
    # A solution for order 5 was found by puzzle expert Robert Reid.
    # His dissection demonstrated that it is possible with 8 pieces.
    # This is the smallest number of pieces currently known for this problem.
