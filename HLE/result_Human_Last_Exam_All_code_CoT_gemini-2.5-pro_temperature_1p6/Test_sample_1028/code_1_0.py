    The Problem: Identifiability in Birth-Death Models
    
    A birth-death model that attempts to estimate time-varying speciation rates (λ(t)) and extinction rates (µ(t)) from a phylogeny containing only extant species is fundamentally non-identifiable. This means that multiple, distinct combinations of λ(t) and µ(t) can result in the exact same likelihood for the observed tree. Essentially, the data from living species alone cannot uniquely distinguish the effects of speciation from extinction through time. The primary identifiable parameter is the net diversification rate, r(t) = λ(t) - µ(t).

    Analysis of the Proposed Strategies:

    Strategies that HELP mitigate the issue:

    A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This is a form of model simplification or regularization. By restricting the rates to be constant over certain time intervals, we reduce the total number of free parameters. Simpler models are less flexible and therefore less prone to identifiability issues. This helps.

    B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Bayesian priors allow us to incorporate external information or beliefs to constrain the possible values of parameters. For example, a prior could state that extinction rates are unlikely to be higher than speciation rates. This additional information can break the mathematical equivalence of different rate dynamics, thus helping with identifiability.

    D. & F. Incorporating fossils: Fossils provide direct information about extinct lineages. By observing when lineages went extinct, we can gain a much stronger signal to estimate extinction rates separately from speciation rates. Whether the fossil is a terminal tip or a sampled ancestor, and regardless of the specific sampling model (lineage removed or not), this additional data is the most effective way to solve the identifiability problem. Both strategies help.

    E. & G. Reparametrizing the model: Recent theory has shown that while λ(t) and µ(t) themselves are not identifiable, specific combinations of them are. These are the 'pulled speciation rate' and 'pulled diversification rate'. By changing the model parameters to these identifiable quantities, we are no longer attempting to estimate something the data cannot support. This is an effective way of working around the identifiability problem. Both reparametrizations help.

    The Strategy that does NOT HELP:

    C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This strategy does the exact opposite of simplification. For each of the 10 time intervals, it models the rate dynamics with a complex 5th-degree polynomial. This creates a massively over-parameterized model with an extremely high degree of flexibility (120 parameters in total). For a model that is already non-identifiable due to being too flexible for the data, increasing its complexity and flexibility will only exacerbate the problem, creating an even larger set of rate dynamics that cannot be distinguished by the likelihood.
    
    Conclusion:
    Making the model significantly more complex is counter-productive when dealing with identifiability.
