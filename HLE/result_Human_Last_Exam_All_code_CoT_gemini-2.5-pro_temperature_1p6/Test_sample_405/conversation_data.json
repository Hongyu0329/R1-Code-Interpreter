    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\nFirst, I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus. Phosphorus is a nonmetal element that can exist in several different structural forms, known as allotropes, which have distinct physical properties, including color.\n\nThe primary allotropes are:\n1.  **White Phosphorus:** A waxy, toxic solid that is typically white but often appears yellowish due to impurities or conversion to red phosphorus upon exposure to light. Therefore, we can count both 'white' and 'yellow'.\n2.  **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous, non-toxic solid that is red in color.\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, it is a crystalline form with a violet or purple hue.\n4.  **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable allotrope, resembling graphite. It is black and flaky.\n\nI will write a Python script to list these allotropes and their colors, count the number of distinct colors, and display the result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus forms to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus is included twice for its pure color and the color it turns upon exposure to light.\n    allotropes_to_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"White Phosphorus (aged/exposed)\": \"yellow\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's)\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    # Extract the unique colors from the dictionary values\n    distinct_colors = sorted(list(set(allotropes_to_colors.values())))\n    \n    # Count the number of unique colors\n    num_colors = len(distinct_colors)\n\n    # Build the equation string to show the calculation\n    # We represent each color as '1' in a sum.\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"The distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equation to find the total number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
