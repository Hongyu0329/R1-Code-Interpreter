    # Step-by-step reasoning
    print("Thinking Process:")
    print("1. The reaction is between an endohedral fullerene (Ce2@C80) and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1,2-disilirane.")
    print("2. The disilirane reacts with the *outer* surface of the C80 cage. The cerium (Ce) atoms are trapped inside the cage and are not directly involved in the chemical bonding with the external reactant.")
    print("3. Before the reaction, the Ce atoms have some freedom of movement within the symmetric cage.")
    print("4. The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the cage exterior breaks the cage's symmetry. This creates an uneven distribution of electron density on the cage.")
    print("5. This change in the external structure influences the electrostatic potential *inside* the cage.")
    print("6. The positively charged cerium ions inside the cage are now attracted to a specific, more stable location due to this new asymmetric potential.")
    print("7. This new, fixed location is at one of the 'poles' of the functionalized fullerene, typically opposite the point where the external group was added. The motion is no longer free or random.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Based on this, the cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene.")
