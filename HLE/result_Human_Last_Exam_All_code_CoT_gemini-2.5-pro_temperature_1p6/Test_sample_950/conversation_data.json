    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Space**: The problem asks about the \"space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\". This is the definition of the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\n2.  **Use a Known Diffeomorphism**: For real Grassmannians, there is a known diffeomorphism $Gr(k, n) \\cong Gr(n-k, n)$. Therefore, $Gr(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $Gr(2, 5)$. They have the same cohomology rings, and studying $Gr(2, 5)$ is often more convenient.\n\n3.  **Find the Cohomology Ring Structure**: I will consult established results from algebraic topology for the structure of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. This ring is a direct sum of integral cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ for different degrees $i$. It is a known fact that these groups can have 2-torsion.\n\n4.  **Identify the Torsion Subgroup**: I will list the known cohomology groups and identify their torsion parts. The torsion subgroup of the entire ring is the direct sum of these individual torsion subgroups.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rank**: The question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup. In the theory of finitely generated abelian groups (which are $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules), the rank is defined as the rank of the free part of the group. A torsion group has, by definition, a trivial free part. Therefore, its rank is 0.\n\n6.  **Construct the Script**: I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final result, including the relevant numbers from the problem's definition.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral\n    cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the mathematical space.\n    # The space of k-subspaces in R^n is the real Grassmannian manifold Gr(k, n).\n    # For this problem, we have k=3 and n=5.\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    \n    print(f\"The space in question is the real Grassmannian manifold Gr({k}, {n}).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Use a known property of Grassmannians.\n    # There is a diffeomorphism Gr(k, n) is congruent to Gr(n-k, n).\n    # So, Gr(3, 5) is diffeomorphic to Gr(5-3, 5) = Gr(2, 5).\n    # We will analyze the cohomology of Gr(2, 5) as it has the same structure.\n    print(f\"This space is diffeomorphic to Gr({n-k}, {n}), so we study the cohomology of Gr({n-k}, {n}).\")\n\n    # Step 3: State the known structure of the integral cohomology ring.\n    # The integral cohomology ring, H*(Gr(k, n); Z), is the direct sum of\n    # cohomology groups H^i(Gr(k, n); Z).
