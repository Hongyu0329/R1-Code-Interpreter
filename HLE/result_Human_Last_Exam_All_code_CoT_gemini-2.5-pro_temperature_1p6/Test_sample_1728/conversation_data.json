    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can write as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The \"sum\" of graphs (also known as the graph join) means that we take the disjoint union of the vertices of the three cycles and add edges between every vertex of one cycle to every vertex of the other two cycles.\n\n2.  **Use Chromatic Number Property:** A key property of the graph sum is that the chromatic number of the sum is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. Therefore, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd (assuming \\( n \\ge 3 \\)).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is bipartite and can be colored with 2 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, the cycle is not bipartite and requires 3 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n4.  **Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for Both Cases:**\n    *   **For even \\( n \\):** \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   **For odd \\( n \\):** \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximal Value:** To find the maximal chromatic number, we simply take the larger of the two possible values, which is 9.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the chromatic numbers for the two cases of a cycle C_n.\n    # Case A: n is odd (n >= 3).
