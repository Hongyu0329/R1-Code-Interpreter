        "Let's evaluate the polynomials at the characteristic vectors {v_j} of the sets {F_j}. \n"
        "Let M be a matrix with entries M_ij = P_j(v_i). Due to the ordering condition (|F_i| <= |F_j| for i < j), it can be shown that P_j(v_i) = 0 for all j > i. \n"
        "This means the matrix M is upper-triangular. \n"
        "The diagonal entries are M_ii = P_i(v_i) = product_{k: l_k < |F_i|} (|F_i| - l_k). These are non-zero because |F_i| cannot be in L (otherwise some F_i intersect F_i would not be in L). \n"
        "An upper-triangular matrix with non-zero diagonal entries is invertible. \n"
        "If a linear combination sum(c_j * P_j(x)) = 0 for some coefficients c_j, this equation must hold when we substitute x = v_i for any i. \n"
        "This gives the system of linear equations M * c = 0, where c is the vector of coefficients. Since M is invertible, the only solution is c = 0. \n"

        "This bound is a known result in extremal set theory, a refinement of the Frankl-Wilson theorem. The 'ordered' property is key to the proof. \n"
        "1. The size ordering (|F_i| <= |F_j| for i < j) is used to establish the linear independence of m polynomials {Q_i}, similar to those in part (a), but modified to be in n-1 variables.\n"
        "2. The structural ordering (n in F_i for i<=r, n not in F_i for i>r) allows the problem to be restricted to the ground set [n-1]. We define polynomials Q_i(x_1,...,x_{n-1}) from the original P_i(x_1,...,x_n) by fixing x_n to 1 or 0 appropriately. These m new polynomials are also linearly independent.\n"
        "3. These Q_i polynomials can be shown to reside in the vector space of polynomials in n-1 variables of degree at most s.\n"
        "4. The dimension of this space is given by the sum of binomial coefficients: sum_{i=0 to s} C(n-1, i).\n"
        "5. Since we have m linearly independent polynomials in a space of that dimension, m cannot exceed the dimension of the space. Hence, m <= sum_{i=0 to s} C(n-1, i)."
