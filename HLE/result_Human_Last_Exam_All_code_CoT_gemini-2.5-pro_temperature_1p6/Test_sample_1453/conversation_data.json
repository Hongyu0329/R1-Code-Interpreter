    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its heptad repeat pattern, typically denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are buried in the core of the coiled-coil, and their identity and packing efficiency (\"knobs-into-holes\") are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Write a Python script to identify the correct heptad repeat \"frame\" for the sequence. This is done by testing all seven possible starting frames (i.e., where the first residue is 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.) and selecting the one that maximizes the hydrophobicity of the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n2.  Once the optimal frame is found, the script will display the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  Based on the identified residues, the script will apply known rules for coiled-coil assembly to predict the oligomeric state. The combination of Leucine (L) at position 'a' and Isoleucine (I) at position 'd' is a well-established signature for a tetrameric (4-helix) coiled-coil.\n4.  The script will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final predicted oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state based on\n    the residues at the 'a' and 'd' heptad positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n    \n    # Define canonical hydrophobic residues for core scoring\n    hydrophobic_residues = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W'}\n    heptad_positions_map = \"abcdefg\"\n    \n    best_frame_info = {\n        \"start_pos\": None,\n        \"score\": -1,\n        \"positions\": None\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Test all 7 possible heptad frames to find the optimal one\n    for frame_start_index in range(7):\n        current_positions = collections.defaultdict(list)\n        score = 0\n        \n        for i, amino_acid in enumerate(sequence):\n            # Determine the position ('a' through 'g') for the current amino acid\n            pos_name = heptad_positions_map[(i + frame_start_index) % 7]\n            current_positions[pos_name].append(amino_acid)\n\n        # Score the frame based on how many 'a' and 'd' residues are hydrophobic\n        for res in current_positions.get('a', []) + current_positions.get('d', []):\n            if res in hydrophobic_residues:\n                score += 1\n        \n        # If this frame is better than the previous best, save it\n        if score > best_frame_info[\"score\"]:\n            best_frame_info[\"score\"] = score\n            best_frame_info[\"start_pos\"] = heptad_positions_map[frame_start_index]\n            best_frame_info[\"positions\"] = current_positions\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the Heptad Repeat Pattern\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The optimal heptad frame starts with the first residue at position '{best_frame_info['start_pos']}'.\")\n    print(\"This frame places the most hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Display the residues at the core positions for the best frame\n    a_residues = best_frame_info[\"positions\"]['a']\n    d_residues = best_frame_info[\"positions\"]['d']\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Core 'a' and 'd' Positions\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'a' positions: {', '.join(a_residues)}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'd' positions: {', '.join(d_residues)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Predict oligomeric state based on the a/d residue pattern\n    print(\"Step 3: Predicting the Oligomeric State\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Prediction based on 'Knobs-into-Holes' packing rules:\")\n    print(\"1.
