# The user wants me to select the best option from a multiple-choice question.
# Based on the legal analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that the
# Sale of Goods Act applies, a core condition of the contract was breached,
# and Lewis is entitled to a remedy (a refund).

# Option A is incorrect because the issue is with the goods themselves not being fit for the specified purpose.
# Option B is incorrect because a contract for a custom-made tangible item is typically treated as a sale of goods.
# Option C is incorrect because it ignores the specific details of the contract which are fundamental to the agreement.
# Option E is incorrect because implied conditions are included by law unless expressly excluded.
# Option D accurately reflects the legal situation. The SGA applies, there was a breach of an implied condition, and Lewis has recourse.

best_option = 'D'
