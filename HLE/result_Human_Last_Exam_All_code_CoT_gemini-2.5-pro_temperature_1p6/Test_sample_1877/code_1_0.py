    Solves the problem by calculating the Lyapunov time for the given parameters
    and then computing the final requested value.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Establish the physical model: The minimum number of iterations to distinguish a chaotic orbit from a stable periodic one is the Lyapunov time. This is the time it takes for initial rounding errors (due to finite precision) to grow exponentially to overwhelm the calculation.
    2.  Use the formula for Lyapunov time: T ≈ (p * ln(10)) / λ, where 'p' is the number of significant digits and 'λ' is the Lyapunov exponent.
    3.  Assign values from the problem: p = 7 (for Era B). For the logistic map's chaotic regime, a standard value for the Lyapunov exponent λ = ln(2) is used (this corresponds to r=4).
    4.  Calculate T(3, 7), noting that n=3 provides the stable orbit context.
    5.  Compute the final expression: ceil(T(3, 7) / 12).
    6.  Print the steps and the final result clearly.
