    This function determines the smallest number of topologically distinct
    compactifications of the ray with a remainder X, where X is an arbitrary
    nondegenerate locally-connected compact metric space.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Let N(X) be the number of such compactifications for a given remainder space X.
       The problem asks for the minimum of N(X) over all valid X.
    2. For any valid space X, at least one such compactification can be constructed.
       This means N(X) must be at least 1.
    3. We need to check if N(X) = 1 is achievable for some valid X.
    4. Consider X = S^1 (a circle). This space is nondegenerate, locally-connected,
       compact, and metric. Due to the homogeneity of the circle (all points are
       topologically identical), there is only one way to attach a ray to it,
       up to homeomorphism. Thus, N(S^1) = 1.
    5. Another example is a two-point space X = {a, b} with the discrete topology.
       This space also satisfies all the required conditions. For this X, N(X) is also 1.
    6. Since N(X) >= 1 for all X and we have found an X where N(X) = 1,
       the smallest possible number is 1.
