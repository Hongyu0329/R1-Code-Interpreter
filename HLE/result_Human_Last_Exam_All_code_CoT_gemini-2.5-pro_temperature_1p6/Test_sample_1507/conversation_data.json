    "The user wants to find the number of triangles on the surface of the outer hull of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the geometric shape:** The \"outer hull\" (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a standard regular icosahedron. The great icosahedron is a star polyhedron, and its vertices are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Understand the question:** The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\". Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of triangles, this is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Formulate a calculation:** We can calculate the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron using its other properties, such as the number of vertices (V) and how many triangles meet at each vertex.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\n    *   At each vertex, 5 triangles meet.\n    *   If we multiply the number of vertices by the number of triangles at each vertex (12 * 5), we get 60. This counts each triangle 3 times (once for each of its own vertices).\n    *   Therefore, to get the actual number of triangles (faces), we must divide this result by 3.\n    *   The final calculation is `F = (12 * 5) / 3`.\n4.  **Write the code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic, performs the calculation, and prints the result. The script will explicitly show the numbers used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_great_icosahedron_hull_triangles():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the surface of the\n    convex hull of a great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The outer hull (convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # The question is asking for the number of triangular faces on this regular icosahedron.\n\n    # A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\n    num_vertices = 12\n\n    # 5 triangles meet at each vertex.\n    triangles_per_vertex = 5\n\n    # Each triangle has 3 vertices.\n    vertices_per_triangle = 3\n\n    # To calculate the total number of faces (triangles), we can multiply the number of vertices\n    # by the number of triangles meeting at each vertex.
