    """
    This function calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 
    one object and three morphisms. This is equivalent to finding the number
    of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Represent the three morphisms as {0, 1, 2}, with 0 as the identity.
    2. The composition rules form a 3x3 multiplication table. The identity rules
       fix the first row and column. This leaves 4 entries to define.
    3. Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible ways to fill these 4 entries.
    4. For each potential table, check if the composition rule is associative.
       This filters for valid monoids (categories).
    5. Count the number of unique monoids up to isomorphism. Two monoids are
       isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the
       non-identity elements (swapping 1 and 2).
