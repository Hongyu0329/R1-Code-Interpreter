    "Answering your question requires us to determine the number of structurally distinct categories that have a single object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understanding the structure:** A category with one object is equivalent to a structure called a **monoid**. A monoid consists of a set of elements, an associative binary operation (composition), and an identity element for that operation.\n    *   Our set of elements is the set of three morphisms. Let's call them `e`, `f`, and `g`.\n    *   One of these morphisms must be the identity morphism. We'll label it `e`.\n    *   The binary operation is the composition of morphisms, let's denote it by `∘`.\n    *   This operation must be associative: `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)` for any morphisms `a, b, c`.\n    *   `e` must act as the identity: `e ∘ a = a` and `a ∘ e = a` for any morphism `a`.\n\n2.  **Systematic Enumeration:** The problem is now to find how many non-isomorphic monoids of size 3 exist. We can solve this computationally.\n    *   Let the morphisms be represented by numbers `{0, 1, 2}`, with `0` being the identity element `e`.\n    *   The composition `∘` can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n    *   The identity axiom fixes the first row and column of this table (`0 ∘ x = x` and `x ∘ 0 = x`).\n    *   This leaves 4 entries in the table to be determined: `1∘1`, `1∘2`, `2∘1`, and `2∘2`. Each of these can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible table structures.\n\n3.  **Filtering for valid categories (monoids):**\n    *   We will iterate through all 81 possible tables.\n    *   For each table, we'll check if the composition operation is associative. Any table that satisfies the associativity axiom represents a valid category/monoid.\n\n4.  **Counting non-isomorphic categories:**\n    *   Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by renaming the non-identity morphisms. In our case (`{0, 1, 2}`), this means swapping the labels `1` and `2`.\n    *   We will iterate through our list of valid monoids. We'll count them, making sure not to double-count any that are isomorphic to each other. We can do this by keeping track of the multiplication tables we've already seen, including their swapped-label versions.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to find the exact number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with \n    one object and three morphisms. This is equivalent to finding the number\n    of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1. Represent the three morphisms as {0, 1, 2}, with 0 as the identity.\n    2. The composition rules form a 3x3 multiplication table. The identity rules\n       fix the first row and column. This leaves 4 entries to define.\n    3. Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible ways to fill these 4 entries.\n    4. For each potential table, check if the composition rule is associative.\n       This filters for valid monoids (categories).\n    5. Count the number of unique monoids up to isomorphism. Two monoids are\n       isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the\n       non-identity elements (swapping 1 and 2).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    # There are 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n    possible_products = itertools.product(elements, repeat=4)\n\n    valid_monoids = []\n\n    for products in possible_products:\n        # T[i][j] represents the composition i o j\n        T = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0]]\n        \n        # Unpack the 4 products for the non-identity part of the table\n        T[1][1], T[1][2], T[2][1], T[2][2] = products\n        \n        # Check for associativity: (a*b)*c == a*(b*c)\n        is_associative = True\n        for a in elements:\n            for b in elements:\n                for c in elements:\n                    # Composition is mapping integers to integers, e.g. T[a][b]\n                    if T[T[a][b]][c] != T[a][T[b][c]]:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            valid_monoids.append(tuple(products))\n\n    # Identify and count non-isomorphic monoids\n    visited_monoids = set()\n    isomorphism_class_count = 0\n    \n    # phi is the permutation swapping the non-identity elements 1 and 2\n    def phi(x):\n        if x == 1: return 2\n        if x == 2: return 1\n        return 0\n\n    for monoid_key in valid_monoids:\n        if monoid_key in visited_monoids:\n            continue\n\n        isomorphism_class_count += 1\n        visited_monoids.add(monoid_key)\n        \n        v11, v12, v21, v22 = monoid_key\n        \n        # Calculate the key for the isomorphic monoid under swapping of 1 and 2\n        # T'[i'][j'] = phi(T(phi_inv(i'), phi_inv(j')))\n        # T'[1][1] = phi(T(phi(1), phi(1))) = phi(T(2,2)) = phi(v22)\n        # T'[1][2] = phi(T(phi(1), phi(2))) = phi(T(2,1)) = phi(v21)\n        # etc.\n        swapped_key = (phi(v22), phi(v21), phi(v12), phi(v11))\n        visited_monoids.add(swapped_key)\n\n    print(f\"The number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\")\n    print(f\"My calculation finds this number to be: {isomorphism_class_count}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<12>>>\n```"
