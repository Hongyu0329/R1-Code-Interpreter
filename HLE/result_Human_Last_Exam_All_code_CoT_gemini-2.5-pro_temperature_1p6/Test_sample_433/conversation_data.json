    "Based on sterile compounding guidelines, such as those from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the rule for single-dose ampules is very strict due to the nature of their container. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Container Type:** The user specifies a \"single dose container ampule\". An ampule is a sealed glass container that, once broken open, cannot be resealed. This is a critical distinction from a vial, which has a rubber stopper that can be repeatedly punctured.\n2.  **Analyze the Environment:** The container is punctured \"in a sterile environment,\" which typically means an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment.\n3.  **Consult Sterility Guidelines:** According to USP Chapter <797> and best practices from organizations like the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), an open ampule is considered an open system. Its sterility cannot be maintained or guaranteed after it has been opened.\n4.  **Determine the Rule:** Because the ampule cannot be resealed, the contents are directly exposed to the environment. Therefore, the medication must be withdrawn and used immediately. There is no acceptable storage time after opening. Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded and not saved for later use.\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for an opened single-dose ampule is \"immediate use.\" In terms of a time duration for storage, it is effectively **0 hours**.\n\nThe following Python script will print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule opened in a sterile environment.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"Single-Dose Ampule\"\n    key_principle = \"Cannot be resealed after opening, compromising sterility.\"\n    \n    # According to USP <797> and ISMP guidelines, there is no storage time for an open ampule.\n    bud_storage_time_hours = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Key Principle: {key_principle}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Official Guideline ---\")\n    print(\"Once a single-dose ampule is opened, its contents must be used immediately.\")\n    print(\"Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for later use.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for storage after opening is: {bud_storage_time_hours} hours.\")\n\nget_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
