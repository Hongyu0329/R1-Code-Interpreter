    "Of course. Here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to predict the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) for five given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n2.  **Prediction Strategy:** The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). Different amino acids at these positions favor different oligomeric states. We will write a Python script to perform this prediction.\n3.  **Heptad Repeat Phasing:** We will assume a standard heptad repeat phasing for all sequences. Since the sequences are all 28 amino acids long (4 repeats of 7), we'll assume the repeat starts at the beginning, but the 'a' and 'd' positions must be assigned. Based on the common GCN4 motif, we'll assign the second residue as the first 'a' position and the fifth residue as the first 'd' position (`g-a-b-c-d-e-f` phasing).\n4.  **Prediction Logic:** We will implement a simplified prediction model based on key determinants observed in experimental studies:\n    *   An **Asn (N)** residue at an 'a' position is a very strong determinant for a **dimer (2)**, as it can form a stabilizing inter-helical hydrogen bond specific to the dimer geometry.\n    *   A **Thr (T)** residue, which is beta-branched, at a 'd' position is a strong indicator of a **tetramer (4)**.\n    *   In the absence of these strong determinants, we will classify the sequence as a **trimer (3)**, which is a common and stable default state for many generic coiled-coil sequences.\n5.  **Execution:** The Python script will loop through each sequence, extract the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, apply the prediction logic, and print the resulting oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define a function to predict the oligomeric state based on key residues\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on\n    simplified rules focusing on residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    Assumes a 28-residue sequence with g-a-b-c-d-e-f phasing.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 'a' positions are at index 1, 8, 15, 22\n    # 'd' positions are at index 4, 11, 18, 25\n    a_positions = [1, 8, 15, 22]\n    d_positions = [4, 11, 18, 25]\n\n    a_residues = [sequence[i] for i in a_positions]\n    d_residues = [sequence[i] for i in d_positions]\n\n    # Rule 1: Asn (N) at an 'a' position strongly favors a dimer.\n    if 'N' in a_residues:\n        return 2  # Dimer\n\n    # Rule 2: Thr (T) at a 'd' position strongly favors a tetramer.\n    if 'T' in d_residues:\n        return 4  # Tetramer\n\n    # Rule 3: Otherwise, default to trimer, a common stable state.\n    return 3 # Trimer\n\n# The list of protein sequences to analyze\nsequences = [\n    \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n    \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n    \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n    \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n    \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\"\n]\n\n# A list to store the results\nresults = []\n\n# Analyze each sequence and store the result\nfor seq in sequences:\n    state = predict_coiled_coil_state(seq)\n    results.append(state)\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format\n# Use sys.stdout.write to prevent print's default newline and space for this specific format\noutput_string = \", \".join(map(str, results))\nprint(f\"The predicted oligomeric states are: {output_string}.\")\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
