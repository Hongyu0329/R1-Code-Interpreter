A. Correct. This describes mixed-precision quantization, a standard technique where only the most time-consuming parts of a network are quantized to gain speed.

B. Correct. This describes a standard high-performance quantization scheme. Applying per-token (row-wise) scales to activations and per-channel (column-wise) scales to weights allows the use of fast INT8 GEMM kernels, with scaling applied efficiently after the main computation.

C. Correct. INT4 quantization, using specialized kernels, provides significant speed-ups for LLMs. The newer H100 GPU, with its more powerful hardware, naturally offers greater performance benefits than the older A100.

D. Not Correct. This statement is highly misleading. Non-uniform quantization requires a dequantization step that involves a table lookup (a "gather" operation) for each weight before it can be used in computation. This process is computationally expensive and memory-inefficient on GPUs. The performance penalty of this on-the-fly dequantization often negates or outweighs the benefit from a smaller weight memory footprint. Therefore, claiming it can bring "substantial" speed-up compared to the highly optimized native FP16 format is generally incorrect.

E. Correct. Quantization is not limited to integers. Low-precision floating-point formats like FP8, BF16, and the 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) are also used for quantization and are effective for training and inference.
