    # In his 1900 thesis, "Théorie de la spéculation," Louis Bachelier modeled the
    # random walk of stock prices. He was a student of the great mathematician Henri Poincaré.
    # Bachelier discovered that the probability distribution of these prices spreads over time
    # in a way that is mathematically identical to a well-known physical process.
    
    # This process is described by the diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation.
    # While the random walk itself is also the basis for describing Brownian Motion
    # (analyzed by Einstein five years later), Bachelier's direct analogy and mathematical
    # foundation was based on the propagation of heat.
