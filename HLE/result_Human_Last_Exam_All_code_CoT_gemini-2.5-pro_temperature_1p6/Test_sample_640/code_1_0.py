# Based on the analysis of multichannel quantum scattering theory,
# including the non-uniqueness of the inverse scattering problem,
# we identify the correct statements.

# Statement 1: `S_ntc => V_ntc`. This is correct as it's the contrapositive of the true statement `V_tc => S_tc`.
# Statement 2: `S_diag => V_diag`. This is incorrect. Isospectral NTC potentials can produce diagonal S-matrices (e.g., S=I).
# Statement 3: `V_ntc => F_ntc`. This is incorrect because its contrapositive `F_tc => V_tc` is false.
# Statement 4: `F_ntc => S_ntc`. This is incorrect. An NTC Jost matrix can produce a TC S-matrix.
# Statement 5: `exists V_ntc` with `F_diag`. This is correct. It is the negation of statement 3, which is false.

# The final answer contains the numbers of the correct statements.
# In this case, statements 1 and 5.
