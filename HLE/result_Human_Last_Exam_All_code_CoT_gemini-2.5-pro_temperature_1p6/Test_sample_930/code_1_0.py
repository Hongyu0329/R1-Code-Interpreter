def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    A mutualist is an organism that engages in a mutually beneficial relationship.
    In this context, mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis are organisms that benefit the plant (e.g., by pollinating it)
    and also receive a benefit from the plant (e.g., nectar as food).

    Analysis of options:
    - 1) Danaus plexipus (Adult): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
    - 2) Megachile frigidus (Adult): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
    - 3) Formica rufa (Adult): Defends the plant from herbivores while feeding on nectaries. MUTUALIST.
    - 4) Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
    - 5) Pepsis thisbe (Adult): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
    - 6) Megachile ericetorum (Adult): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
    - 7) Danaus plexipus (Larva): Herbivore (eats leaves). Not a mutualist.
    - 8) Megachile frigidus (Larva): Develops in a nest, no direct interaction with the plant. Not a mutualist.
    - 9) Formica rufa (Larva): Develops in a nest, no direct interaction with the plant. Not a mutualist.
    - 10) Sphex ichneumoneus (Larva): Parasitoid, no direct interaction with the plant. Not a mutualist.
    - 11) Pepsis thisbe (Larva): Parasitoid, no direct interaction with the plant. Not a mutualist.
    - 12) Megachile ericetorum (Larva): Develops in a nest, no direct interaction with the plant. Not a mutualist.

    The mutualists are the adult insects that act as pollinators or defenders.
