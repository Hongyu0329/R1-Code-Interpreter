    "In quantum many-body physics, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle through a system. The functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is fundamental to understanding how particles behave in the absence of interactions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Definition**: The Green's function is fundamentally the inverse of the Schrödinger operator. For a non-interacting system, the time-independent operator is $(E - H_0)$, where $E$ is the energy of a probe and $H_0$ is the non-interacting Hamiltonian of the system.\n    \n    $G_0(E) = (E - H_0)^{-1}$\n\n2.  **Energy Eigenbasis**: The problem is simplified by working in the basis of eigenstates of $H_0$. Let $|k\\rangle$ be an eigenstate of $H_0$ with its corresponding energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. In this basis, the Hamiltonian operator $H_0$ is diagonal.\n    \n    $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Deriving the Formula**: Applying the inverse operator from Step 1 to an eigenstate $|k\\rangle$ gives:\n    \n    $G_0(E) |k\\rangle = (E - H_0)^{-1} |k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k} |k\\rangle$\n    \n    This shows that the Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. To ensure causality (i.e., the effect does not precede the cause), a small imaginary term, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), is added to the denominator. This gives the retarded Green's function:\n    \n    $G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThe final expression shows that the bare Green's function $G_0$ for a state $k$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the probe energy $E$ and the particle's own energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the retarded bare Green's function for a given set of parameters and prints the equation with the numbers substituted, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(E, epsilon_k, eta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the retarded bare Green's function G_0(E, epsilon_k).\n\n    Args:\n        E (float): The energy of the probing particle.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue for state k.\n        eta (float): A small positive constant for causality.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the bare Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    denominator = (E - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n    return G0\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n\n# Define the single-particle energy eigenvalue (in arbitrary units, e.g., eV)\nepsilon_k = 2.0\n\n# Define the probe energy, set close to the particle energy to see a strong response\nE = 2.05\n\n# Define the infinitesimal constant eta (kept small but finite for calculation)\neta = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the Green's function\nG0 = calculate_bare_greens_function(E, epsilon_k, eta)\n\n# Print the explanation and the result\nprint(\"The retarded bare Green's function G_0 depends on the probe energy (E) and the single-particle energy (epsilon_k).\")\nprint(\"The formula is: G_0(k, E) = 1 / (E - epsilon_k + i*eta)\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation Example ---\")\nprint(f\"Given values:\")\nprint(f\"  Probe Energy (E)          = {E}\")\nprint(f\"  Particle Energy (epsilon_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"  Constant (eta)            = {eta}\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\")\n# Here we output each number in the final equation\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({E} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({(E - epsilon_k):.2f} + {eta:.2f}i)\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated complex value is:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} + {G0.imag:.4f}i\")\n\n```\n<<<In its common retarded form, the functional dependence is $G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $E$ is the probe energy, $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue, and $i\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal imaginary term.>>>"
