# Define the segment lengths
L1 = 40.0  # Shoulder to Elbow
L2 = 28.0  # Elbow to Wrist
L3 = 15.0  # Wrist to Hand
L4 = 10.0  # Hand to Finger

# --- Constraint Interpretation ---
# Circumference of arm segments is 10 cm
circumference = 10.0
# Radius r = C / (2 * pi)
radius = circumference / (2 * math.pi)
# Minimum surface-to-surface distance for non-adjacent segments is 1 cm
surface_gap = 1.0
# Minimum centerline-to-centerline distance is the gap + two radii
d_min = surface_gap + 2 * radius

# --- Geometric Modeling for the (+-+- zig-zag) configuration ---
# For a parallel folded model, the separations d13 and d24 are related.
# d24 = d13 * (L3 / L2).
# To satisfy d13 >= d_min and d24 >= d_min, we find the limiting constraint.
# d13 * (L3 / L2) >= d_min  => d13 >= d_min * (L2 / L3)
# So, the minimal d13 must be d_min * (L2 / L3).
# We choose the tightest possible valid configuration.
d13 = d_min * (L2 / L3)
d24 = d_min # This will be true by definition with the d13 above.

# --- Coordinate Calculation ---
# P0 (Shoulder) is at the origin
P0 = (0.0, 0.0)

# P1 (Elbow) is at (L1, 0)
P1 = (L1, 0.0)

# P2 (Wrist) calculation
# The vertical separation between S1 and S3 is h = d13.
# The horizontal distance component of S2 can be found using Pythagoras:
# (P2_x - P1_x)^2 + (P2_y - P1_y)^2 = L2^2
# (P2_x - L1)^2 + h^2 = L2^2
# P2_x - L1 = -sqrt(L2^2 - h^2)  (negative because it folds back)
h = d13
horizontal_dist_S2 = math.sqrt(L2**2 - h**2)
P2_x = L1 - horizontal_dist_S2
P2_y = h
P2 = (P2_x, P2_y)

# P3 (Hand) calculation
# S3 is parallel to S1, moving in the positive x direction
P3_x = P2_x + L3
P3_y = P2_y
P3 = (P3_x, P3_y)

# P4 (Finger Tip) calculation
# S4 is parallel to S2. The vector for S4 is a scaled version of the vector for S2.
S2_vector = (P2[0] - P1[0], P2[1] - P1[1])
scale_factor = L4 / L2
S4_vector = (S2_vector[0] * scale_factor, S2_vector[1] * scale_factor)

P4_x = P3_x + S4_vector[0]
P4_y = P3_y + S4_vector[1]
P4 = (P4_x, P4_y)

# Final distance is the magnitude of the vector P4
final_distance = math.sqrt(P4[0]**2 + P4[1]**2)
