# Given parameters
Ro = 3.0  # Basic reproduction number
infection_rate_vaccinated = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people got the infection

# Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Efficacy (VE)
# Vaccine Efficacy is the percentage of people protected from infection by the vaccine.
# If 6% of vaccinated people get infected, then 100% - 6% = 94% are protected.
VE = 1.0 - infection_rate_vaccinated

# Step 2: Calculate Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT)
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop the spread.
# HIT = 1 - (1 / Ro)
HIT = 1.0 - (1.0 / Ro)

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_critical)
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated,
# accounting for vaccine efficacy.
# p_critical = HIT / VE
p_critical = HIT / VE

# Output the results

print("\n4. To find the minimum required vaccine coverage (p_critical), we adjust the Herd Immunity Threshold by the Vaccine Efficacy:")

print(f"\nTherefore, the final calculation is:")
# Use HIT formula directly in the print statement for clarity
print(f"p_critical = (1 - 1/{Ro}) / {VE:.2f} = {p_critical:.4f}")

# Convert to a percentage for the final answer
p_critical_percentage = p_critical * 100
