    "To find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes:** I'll define the first cube (C1) in a standard coordinate system. The most convenient representation is a cube with a side length of 1, occupying the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The problem states the cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". For the cube C1, the main diagonal connects the vertex at (0,0,0) to the one at (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is (1,1,1). I will interpret the \"shift of 1/2\" as a scaling factor on this vector. This results in a shift vector of `1/2 * (1,1,1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n3.  **Define the Second Cube:** Applying this shift to C1, the second cube (C2) will occupy the space where `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the volume where both cubes exist. This region is found by taking the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n    *   For the x-axis, the overlap is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   The side length of the intersection along the x-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   Due to symmetry, the side lengths along the y and z axes are also 1/2.\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2. Its volume is calculated by cubing this side length.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\n# Side length of the original cubes\nside_length = 1.0\n\n# The shift value along each axis. \"Shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\"\n# is interpreted as a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\nshift_per_axis = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the side length of the intersection region.\n# On any given axis, the first cube is at [0, 1] and the second is at [0.5, 1.5].\n# Their intersection is the interval [0.5, 1], which has a length of 0.5.\nintersection_side = side_length - shift_per_axis\n\n# The volume is the side length of the intersection cube, cubed.\nvolume = intersection_side ** 3\n\n# Print the final equation showing the multiplication of the side lengths.\nprint(f\"The side length of the intersection cube is {intersection_side}.\")\nprint(f\"The volume calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{intersection_side} * {intersection_side} * {intersection_side} = {volume}\")\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
