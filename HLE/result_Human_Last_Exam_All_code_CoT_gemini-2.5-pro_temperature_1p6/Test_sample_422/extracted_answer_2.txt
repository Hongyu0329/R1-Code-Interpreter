The two problems are (1) the Contradiction of States, where if Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive states, the JTB requirement that Knowledge is a type of Belief becomes a contradiction, and (2) the Circularity of Justification, where the justification for a belief must itself be either a belief (leading to an infinite regress) or knowledge (making the definition circular).
