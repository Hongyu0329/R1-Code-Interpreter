    "Based on the constraints you provided, specifically that our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief and we must ignore Gettier problems, we can identify two fundamental issues with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will represent the JTB definition (\"Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief\") as a conceptual equation. To satisfy the output requirements, I will assign a number to each component (e.g., Knowledge=1, Belief=2, etc.).\n2.  Next, I will analyze the first problem, which arises from the constraint that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are the only two available, and therefore mutually exclusive, epistemic states. This contradicts the JTB formulation where Knowledge is a *type* of Belief.\n3.  Then, I will analyze the second problem, which concerns the nature of \"Justification.\" A justification must have its own epistemic state. Under the given constraints, it must be either a Belief (which leads to an infinite regress) or Knowledge (which makes the definition circular).\n4.  The Python code will print out a step-by-step explanation of these two problems, using the assigned numbers to illustrate the \"equation.\"\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge under the given constraints,\n    while also fulfilling the output format requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the JTB formula conceptually with numbers.\n    # Let's define: Knowledge = 1, Belief = 2, Justification = 3, Truth = 4.\n    # The formula Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief is thus represented as:\n    knowledge = 1\n    belief = 2\n    justification = 3\n    truth = 4\n\n    print(\"The JTB definition of Knowledge can be represented with the conceptual equation:\")\n    print(f\"Knowledge({knowledge}) = Justification({justification}) + Truth({truth}) + Belief({belief})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the first problem based on the provided constraints.\n    print(\"\\nProblem 1: The Contradiction of Exclusive States\\n\")\n    print(\"The prompt constrains our epistemic states to ONLY Knowledge or Belief.\")\n    print(f\"This means a mental state is either {knowledge} (Knowledge) or {belief} (Belief), but they are mutually exclusive.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the JTB definition states that Knowledge is a specific type of Belief (one that is also justified and true).\")\n    print(\"This creates a contradiction, which we can see in our equation:\")\n    print(f\"The equation `Knowledge({knowledge}) = ... + Belief({belief})` claims that state {knowledge} is built upon, or is a subset of, state {belief}.\")\n    print(f\"But if {knowledge} and {belief} are mutually exclusive states, then one cannot be a type of the other.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the JTB definition is incompatible with this constraint.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the second problem based on the provided constraints.\n    print(\"\\nProblem 2: The Circularity or Regress of Justification\\n\")\n    print(f\"The JTB definition requires a Justification({justification}) for a Belief({belief}) to become Knowledge({knowledge}).\")\n    print(\"Let's ask: What is the epistemic state of the justification itself?\")\n    print(\"According to the prompt's constraints, the justification must also be either Knowledge or Belief.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Case A: The justification's state is Belief({belief}).\")\n    print(\"If our justification is just another belief, then to be a valid justification, it must not be arbitrary.\")\n    print(\"This means our justifying belief also needs a justification, which would be another belief, leading to an infinite regress (e.g., Justification_A requires Justification_B, which requires Justification_C...).\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCase B: The justification's state is Knowledge({knowledge}).\")\n    print(\"If the justification for gaining knowledge must itself be knowledge, the definition becomes circular.\")\n    print(\"The equation becomes self-referential:\")\n    print(f\"Knowledge({knowledge}) = Justification(which is itself Knowledge, {knowledge}) + Truth({truth}) + Belief({belief}).\")\n    print(\"This means you would need to already have Knowledge in order to satisfy the conditions for gaining that same Knowledge, which is a circular argument.\")\n\n# Execute the explanation\nexplain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are (1) the Contradiction of States, where if Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive states, the JTB requirement that Knowledge is a type of Belief becomes a contradiction, and (2) the Circularity of Justification, where the justification for a belief must itself be either a belief (leading to an infinite regress) or knowledge (making the definition circular).>>>"
