    "The problem asks us to identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. We are to assume that different colors are assigned different numerical values to maximize the rank for any given design.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:**\n    *   The Danish flag has a red field with a white cross. When representing this as a matrix, there are only two types of unique rows:\n        1.  A row from the red field, intersected by the vertical white bar (e.g., `Red, Red, ..., White, ..., Red, Red`).\n        2.  A row from the horizontal white bar (e.g., `White, White, ..., White, ..., White, White`).\n    *   Since there are two linearly independent row patterns, the rank of the Danish flag's matrix is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flags' Ranks:**\n    *   The rank of a flag's matrix is determined by its geometric design, specifically the number of unique row or column patterns.\n    *   **Rank 1:** A single solid color.\n    *   **Rank 2:**\n        *   A design with two horizontal stripes of different colors.\n        *   A design with vertical stripes using only two different colors (e.g., A-B-A pattern).\n        *   A design like Benin's or Madagascar's, with a vertical bar at the hoist and two horizontal stripes at the fly, which creates two unique row patterns.\n    *   **Rank 3 or higher:**\n        *   Flags with three or more horizontal or vertical stripes of unique colors.\n        *   Flags with simple designs (like bicolors or tricolors) but with a central emblem or symbol that breaks the uniformity of the stripes.\n        *   Flags with complex designs like diagonals, chevrons, or cantons, which create many unique row patterns.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Create a data structure to represent the essential design features of various African flags.\n    *   Write a function to calculate the rank based on these features.\n    *   Iterate through the flags, calculate their rank, and compare it to the Danish flag's rank (which is 2).\n    *   Print the names of the countries whose flags have a rank of 2.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_flag_rank_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies African national flags that share the same linear algebraic rank as the Danish flag.\n    The rank is determined by the flag's geometric pattern, assuming maximal rank where different colors have different values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    #
