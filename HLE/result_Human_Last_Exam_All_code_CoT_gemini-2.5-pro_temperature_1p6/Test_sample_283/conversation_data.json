    "To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of submatrix multiplications that occur during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the HSS Multiplication Process:** The multiplication of two HSS matrices, `C = A * B`, is performed recursively. At each level of the hierarchy, a matrix is partitioned into a 2x2 block form:\n    ```\n    A = [[A_d1, A_o12],\n         [A_o21, A_d2]]\n    ```\n    where `A_d1` and `A_d2` are the diagonal blocks (which are themselves HSS matrices of a lower level), and `A_o12`, `A_o21` are the off-diagonal blocks (which are represented as low-rank matrices).\n\n2.  **Count Multiplications at Each Step:** The block multiplication `C = A * B` expands to 8 sub-block products and 4 additions.\n    ```\n    C_d1  = A_d1*B_d1   + A_o12*B_o21\n    C_o12 = A_d1*B_o12  + A_o12*B_d2\n    C_o21 = A_o21*B_d1  + A_d2*B_o21\n    C_d2  = A_o21*B_o12 + A_d2*B_d2\n    ```\n    - The two products involving only diagonal blocks (`A_d1*B_d1`, `A_d2*B_d2`) are handled by recursive calls to the HSS multiplication algorithm.\n    - The other 6 products involve at least one low-rank, off-diagonal block. We will count each of these as a single \"low-rank-involved\" multiplication.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    - For a tree of depth `d=4`, the partitioning stops at level 4, which consists of `2^4 = 16` leaf blocks. At this level, the multiplications are dense matrix multiplications.\n    - At each non-leaf level `l` (from 0 to 3), there are `2^l` nodes. At each of these nodes, we perform the 2x2 block multiplication described above, which introduces 6 new low-rank-involved multiplications.\n    - The total number of multiplications is the sum of the dense multiplications at the leaf level and the low-rank-involved multiplications at all non-leaf levels.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script to calculate these quantities for a depth of 4 and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices with a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n\n    # 1.
