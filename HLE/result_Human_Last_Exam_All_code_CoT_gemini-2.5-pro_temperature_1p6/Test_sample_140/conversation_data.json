    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to fit the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes (15\\*15\\*15 / 9\\*1\\*1 = 375) gives a theoretical maximum, but it doesn't account for the physical constraints of packing the blocks.\n\n2.  **Devise a Packing Strategy:** I will use a greedy, staged packing approach. This involves filling a section of the cube with blocks aligned in one direction, then taking the largest remaining empty space and trying to fill it by reorienting the blocks. I'll repeat this process until no more blocks can fit.\n\n3.  **Stage 1: Main Packing:**\n    *   Align the 9-unit side of the blocks along one edge of the 15-unit cube.\n    *   Calculate how many blocks fit in this orientation: `(15//9) * (15//1) * (15//1)`.\n    *   This will fill a `9x15x15` section of the cube, leaving a `6x15x15` empty space.\n\n4.  **Stage 2: Packing the First Remainder:**\n    *   Take the remaining `6x15x15` space.\n    *   We cannot align the 9-unit side of the blocks along the 6-unit edge. So, we must align it with one of the 15-unit edges.\n    *   Calculate how many blocks fit: `(6//1) * (15//9) * (15//1)`.\n    *   This will fill a `6x9x15` section of the remaining space, leaving a new empty space of `6x6x15`.\n\n5.  **Stage 3: Packing the Second Remainder:**\n    *   Take the remaining `6x6x15` space.\n    *   Again, the 9-unit side of the blocks cannot align with the 6-unit edges. It must be aligned with the 15-unit edge.\n    *   Calculate how many blocks fit: `(6//1) * (6//1) * (15//9)`.\n    *   This leaves a final empty space of `6x6x6`.\n\n6.  **Stage 4: Final Check:**\n    *   No 9x1x1 block can fit inside a `6x6x6` space because its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the space (6).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Sum the number of blocks from each stage to get the total. The code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit inside a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_dim = 15\n    block_dims = [9, 1, 1]\n\n    # --- Stage 1: Main Packing ---\n    # Pack the 15x15x15 cube with blocks aligned as 9x1x1.\n    # We can fit 1 block along the 9-unit dimension and 15 along the other two.\n    # This fills a 9x15x15 volume.\n    blocks_stage1 = (cube_dim // block_dims[0]) * (cube_dim // block_dims[1]) * (cube_dim // block_dims[2])\n    \n    # The remaining space is a 6x15x15 block.\n    rem_space1 = [cube_dim % block_dims[0], cube_dim, cube_dim] # [6, 15, 15]\n\n    # --- Stage 2: Packing the first remaining space ---\n    # We must reorient the blocks to 1x9x1 to fit in the 6x15x15 space.\n    blocks_stage2 = (rem_space1[0] // block_dims[1]) * (rem_space1[1] // block_dims[0]) * (rem_space1[2] // block_dims[2])\n    \n    # The remaining space from this stage is 6x6x15.\n    rem_space2 = [rem_space1[0], rem_space1[1] % block_dims[0], rem_space1[2]] # [6, 6, 15]\n    \n    # --- Stage 3: Packing the second remaining space ---\n    # We must reorient the blocks to 1x1x9 to fit in the 6x6x15 space.\n    blocks_stage3 = (rem_space2[0] // block_dims[1]) * (rem_space2[1] // block_dims[2]) * (rem_space2[2] // block_dims[0])\n    \n    # The final remaining space is 6x6x6, where no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    total_blocks = blocks_stage1 + blocks_stage2 + blocks_stage3\n    \n    print(\"This problem can be solved by packing in stages:\")\n    print(f\"Stage 1: In the main 15x15x15 volume, we can fit {blocks_stage1} blocks.\")\n    print(f\"This leaves a 6x15x15 space.\")\n    print(f\"Stage 2: In the 6x15x15 space, we can fit another {blocks_stage2} blocks by turning them.\")\n    print(f\"This leaves a 6x6x15 space.\")\n    print(f\"Stage 3: In the 6x6x15 space, we can fit a final {blocks_stage3} blocks by turning them again.\")\n    print(f\"The final remaining space is 6x6x6, which is too small for any more blocks.\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal number of blocks:\")\n    print(f\"{blocks_stage1} + {blocks_stage2} + {blocks_stage3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
