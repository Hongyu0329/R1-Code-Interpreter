    "This is a fascinating problem from the field of topology. At first glance, a famous theorem seems to provide a straightforward answer, but a subtle detail changes the outcome completely.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **The Intuitive Answer and a Standard Theorem:** For \"well-behaved\" sets, the intersection must be connected. A theorem in topology states that if `A` and `B` are **closed, connected, and locally connected** subsets of a suitable space (like the plane or a square) and their union `A ∪ B` is connected, then their intersection `A ∩ B` must also be connected. If this were to apply, the largest number of components would be 1.\n\n2.  **The Loophole:** The problem statement requires `A` and `B` to be closed and connected, but it **does not** require them to be *locally connected*. A set is locally connected if every point has a small neighborhood that is connected. While common shapes (lines, circles, filled polygons) are locally connected, some pathological sets exist that are connected but not locally connected. The famous \"Topologist's Sine Curve\" is a primary example.\n\n3.  **Exploiting the Loophole:** Because `A` and `B` are not required to be locally connected, we can construct them using such \"pathological\" curves. It has been shown that by using intricate, space-filling constructions based on these types of curves, it's possible for `A` and `B` to meet all the conditions (closed, connected, union is the square) while their intersection `A ∩ B` has any finite number of connected components.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since we can construct valid sets `A` and `B` such that their intersection has `n` components for any finite number `n` we choose, there is no single \"largest number\" of components. The number can be arbitrarily large.\n\n### Demonstration with Code\n\nWhile constructing these pathological sets in continuous space is mathematically complex, we can demonstrate the core idea in a discrete space (a grid), which is easier to visualize. The following Python code builds two connected sets of pixels, `A` and `B`, on a grid. Their union covers the whole grid, and their intersection has a specified number of components.\n\nThe code below sets up a case with 4 components. The set `A` is represented by `'A'` characters plus the intersection `'I'` characters. The set `B` is all `'B'` characters plus the `'I'` characters. You can see that `A` is a connected path, `B` is the connected background, and their intersection `I` consists of 4 disjoint points. This principle can be extended to any number of components.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_components(grid_size=15, n_components=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates a construction on a discrete grid where the intersection\n    of two connected sets has n_components.\n\n    - Grid legend:\n      'A': Belongs to set A only\n      'B': Belongs to set B only\n      'I': Belongs to the Intersection (A and B)\n      '.': Empty\n    \"\"\"\n    if n_components < 1:\n        print(\"Number of components must be at least 1.\")\n        return\n\n    # Initialize grid\n    grid = np.full((grid_size, grid_size), 'B', dtype=str)\n\n    # 1.
