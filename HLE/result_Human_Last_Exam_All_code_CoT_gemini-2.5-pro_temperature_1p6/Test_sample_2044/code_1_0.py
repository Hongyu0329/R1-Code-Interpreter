    # Stating the core scientific principle
    print("Scientific Principle: The rat olfactory bulb exhibits a spatial organization called a 'chemotopic map'.")
    print("This means that the physical location of activated glomeruli corresponds to the chemical structure of the odorant.")
    print("\nFor aliphatic odorants (molecules in a straight chain), one of the clearest organizational rules relates their carbon chain length to a position along the anterior-posterior (front-to-back) axis of the olfactory bulb.")

    # Explaining the specific mapping
    print("\nThe Mapping Rule: As the carbon chain of an odorant gets longer, the region of glomeruli it activates shifts systematically from the anterior to the posterior of the olfactory bulb.")
    print("Therefore:")
    print(" - Short chain molecules activate anterior glomeruli.")
    print(" - Long chain molecules activate posterior glomeruli.")

    # Evaluating the given options
    print("Evaluating the Answer Choices:")
    print("A. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more anteriorly -> Incorrect.")
    print("B. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more posteriorly -> Correct.")
    print("C. Short chain molecules tended to be processed more anteriorly -> This is also factually correct, as it describes the other end of the same mapping rule.")
    print("D. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more superiorly -> Incorrect. The primary organizational axis for chain length is anterior-posterior.")
    print("E. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more inferiorly -> Incorrect.")

    # Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion: Both B and C are correct statements describing the same phenomenon. However, they describe the opposite ends of the spectrum. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, both can be considered correct. Since the prompt asks for one answer, and B describes the destination for longer chains which directly follows the rule of 'as chain length increases, position shifts posteriorly', it is a very common and direct way to state the finding.")
