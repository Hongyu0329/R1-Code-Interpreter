    print("--------------------------------------------------\n")

    # Step 1: Summarize the key clinical findings.
    print("1. Clinical Phenotype:")
    print("   - Reproductive: Primary amenorrhea, infertility, and ovarian dysgenesis.")
    print("   - Growth: Short stature (10th-15th percentile).")
    print("   - Cardiovascular: Fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and elevated blood pressure.")
    print("   - Overall Picture: The combination of short stature, ovarian failure, and potential cardiac issues is highly suggestive of Turner Syndrome.\n")

    # Step 2: Incorporate the genetic test result.
    print("2. Genetic Finding:")
    print("   - Karyotype: Normal chromosomal complement (46,XX).")
    print("   - Implication: This result rules out classic Turner Syndrome, which is caused by a missing X chromosome (45,X).\n")

    # Step 3: Resolve the discrepancy.
    print("3. Reconciling the Phenotype and Karyotype:")
    print("   - The patient has the symptoms of Turner Syndrome but not the typical chromosomal abnormality.")
    print("   - This points to a 'submicroscopic' or 'molecular' genetic lesion on one of the X chromosomes that is too small to be detected by standard karyotyping.\n")

    # Step 4: Propose the most likely molecular cause.
    print("4. The Molecular Hypothesis:")
    print("   - The short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) contains key genes that, when missing, produce the Turner phenotype.")
    print("   - SHOX Gene: Located on Xp, its loss (haploinsufficiency) causes short stature.")
    print("   - Ovarian Genes: Xp also contains genes critical for ovarian maintenance. Their loss leads to ovarian dysgenesis.")
    print("   - Therefore, a deletion of the short arm of one X chromosome (Xp deletion) would unify all the patient's symptoms.\n")

    # Step 5: Final conclusion.
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most likely molecular abnormality is a deletion on the short arm of one of the X chromosomes (Xp deletion). This would be confirmed with higher-resolution genetic testing like FISH or a chromosomal microarray.")
