# Step 1: Analyze the user's request and sources. The goal is to identify a scene added to the 2010 restored version of "Kriemhild's Revenge".
# Step 2: The most relevant source is [2], the Le Monde article, as it specifically covers the restoration.
# Step 3: Examine the article for a description of the ending. The article contains the following key passage in French: "Plus stupéfiant encore : dans les dernières minutes de La Vengeance de Kriemhild, Etzel, après le massacre, porte dans ses bras son enfant mort pour le déposer au côté de sa femme, qui vient d'être tuée par Hildebrand."
# Step 4: Translate the passage. It reads: "Even more stunning: in the final minutes of Kriemhild's Revenge, Etzel, after the massacre, carries in his arms his dead child to place him beside his wife, who has just been killed by Hildebrand."
