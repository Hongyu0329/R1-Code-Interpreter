    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will identify the two Nobel laureates who were featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n2.  I will write a Python script that stores these names in variables.\n3.  The script will then print the names to the console, providing a direct answer to your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial from the year 2000.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates featured in the commercial.\n    laureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n    \n    # The year of the commercial.\n    year = 2000\n\n    print(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous {year} Enron commercial, 'Ask Why', were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate2}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
