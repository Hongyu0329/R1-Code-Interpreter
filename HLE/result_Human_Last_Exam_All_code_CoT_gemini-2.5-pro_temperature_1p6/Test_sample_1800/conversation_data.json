    "Of course. Determining the ideal stoichiometry for a catalyst is a complex task that typically involves extensive laboratory research. The \"ideal\" ratio can depend heavily on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure).\n\nHowever, by synthesizing findings from numerous published scientific studies, we can identify a generally accepted range for maximizing catalytic performance. The key is to achieve high dispersion of Ni atoms on the ceria support, maximizing the active Ni-CeOâ‚‚ interface while preventing the formation of large Nickel clusters, which are less active.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will review the scientific literature in my training data for the two distinct reactions: Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS).\n2.  For the WGS reaction, the literature often points to a lower nickel concentration being optimal to maintain high dispersion and prevent deactivation.\n3.  For water splitting, a slightly higher nickel concentration is often found to be effective, balancing the number of active sites with particle stability.\n4.  I will create a Python script to present these findings clearly. The script will not compute these values but will report the consensus from scientific research, explicitly printing out the numbers involved as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes findings from scientific literature on the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio\n    for Ni-Ceria catalysts in Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Based on a review of scientific literature, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is reaction-dependent:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction ---\n    wgs_ni_part = 1\n    wgs_ce_part = 9\n    wgs_at_percent = 10\n    print(f\"1.
