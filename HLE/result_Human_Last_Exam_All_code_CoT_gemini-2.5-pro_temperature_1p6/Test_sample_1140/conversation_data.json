    "For the synthesis of a 100 amino acid peptide that includes an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine ('X'), the most suitable and powerful technique would be **Recombinant Protein Expression using Genetic Code Expansion**.\n\nDirect chemical synthesis (Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, or SPPS) is challenging for peptides of this length, as the overall yield decreases significantly with each amino acid addition, making purification of the full-length 100-mer difficult.\n\nGenetic code expansion is a biological technique that overcomes this limitation. Here's how it works:\n1.  **Gene Modification:** The DNA sequence coding for the peptide is modified. A stop codon (typically the amber stop codon, TAG) is inserted at the position where the unnatural amino acid 'X' should be.\n2.  **Engineered Machinery:** A specially engineered set of molecules, called an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair, is introduced into the expression host (e.g., *E. coli*). This pair is designed to uniquely recognize the unnatural amino acid (azido phenylalanine) and not interact with any of the cell's natural amino acids or tRNAs.\n3.  **Synthesis:** The host cells are grown in media containing the azido phenylalanine. The engineered synthetase attaches azido phenylalanine to its corresponding tRNA. When the ribosome translates the modified gene and encounters the TAG stop codon, the engineered tRNA delivers azido phenylalanine, incorporating it into the growing peptide chain.\n\nThis method allows for the efficient, site-specific incorporation of the unnatural amino acid and is highly scalable, making it ideal for producing large quantities of the final 100aa peptide.\n\nAs a related task, here is a Python script to calculate the precise molecular weight of a representative 100-amino acid peptide containing azido phenylalanine (represented as 'X').\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Weights:** Create a dictionary mapping each standard amino acid code, plus 'X' for azido phenylalanine, to its monoisotopic residue molecular weight.\n2.  **Create Sequence:** Define a sample 100-amino acid peptide sequence that includes the snippet from the prompt.\n3.  **Count Amino Acids:** Tally the occurrences of each unique amino acid in the sequence to simplify the final calculation.\n4.  **Calculate Total Weight:** Iterate through the unique amino acids, calculate their total contribution to the peptide's weight, and sum these values. Finally, add the weight of a single water molecule (Hâ‚‚O) to account for the N- and C-termini.\n5.  **Display Results:** Print a clear breakdown of the calculation, showing the contribution of each amino acid type and the final equation for the total molecular weight.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_peptide_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the molecular weight of a peptide with an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Monoisotopic mass of the residue (the AA minus H2O).\n    residue_mw = {\n        'A': 71.03711,   # Alanine\n        'R': 156.10111,  # Arginine\n        'N': 114.04293,  # Asparagine\n        'D': 115.02694,  # Aspartic acid\n        'C': 103.00919,  # Cysteine\n        'E': 129.04259,  # Glutamic acid\n        'Q': 128.05858,  # Glutamine\n        'G': 57.02146,   # Glycine\n        'H': 137.05891,  # Histidine\n        'I': 113.08406,  # Isoleucine\n        'L': 113.08406,  # Leucine\n        'K': 128.09496,  # Lysine\n        'M': 131.04049,  # Methionine\n        'F': 147.06841,  # Phenylalanine\n        'P': 97.05276,   # Proline\n        'S': 87.03203,   # Serine\n        'T': 101.04768,  # Threonine\n        'W': 186.07931,  # Tryptophan\n        'Y': 163.06333,  # Tyrosine\n        'V': 99.06841,   # Valine\n        # Unnatural amino acid: p-Azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF)\n        # Residue mass = Monoisotopic MW(AzF) - Monoisotopic MW(H2O)\n        # 206.0798 - 18.01056 = 188.06924 Da\n        'X': 188.06924\n    }\n    \n    # Representative 100 amino acid sequence containing M...KAVCLXVIGATR...A\n    peptide_sequence = (\n        \"MSDEKRFNTILWHGRYQCMKW\"  # 21\n        \"KAVCLXVIGATR\"           # 12 (with UAA 'X')\n        \"PWETGNHVIYLSPADNVQAGF\"  # 21\n        \"KTLYICGGHERWQPGMLDHIN\"  # 21\n        \"TSEWCNAVFPQKVWSTGYMVA\"  # 25\n    )\n\n    # The weight of the termini (H- and -OH), equivalent to one water molecule.\n    water_mw = 18.01056\n\n    print(f\"Calculating monoisotopic molecular weight for the {len(peptide_sequence)}aa peptide:\")\n    print(f\"{peptide_sequence}\\n\")\n    print(\"The total molecular weight is the sum of all residue weights plus the weight of one water molecule for the termini.\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Calculation Breakdown ---\")\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each amino acid in the sequence\n    aa_counts = Counter(peptide_sequence)\n    \n    # Sort the items for a consistent, readable output\n    sorted_counts = sorted(aa_counts.items())\n    \n    sum_of_residues_mw = 0.0\n    for aa, count in sorted_counts:\n        # Safely get the mw, default to 0 if not found (though all should be here)\n        mw = residue_mw.get(aa, 0)\n        contribution = count * mw\n        sum_of_residues_mw += contribution\n        print(f\"Contribution from {aa} ({count}x): {count:>2} * {mw:<9.5f} = {contribution:9.5f} Da\")\n\n    total_mw = sum_of_residues_mw + water_mw\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(\"Total MW = (Sum of all residue weights) + (Weight of H2O)\")\n    print(f\"Total MW = {sum_of_residues_mw:.5f} + {water_mw:.5f}\")\n    print(f\"Final Molecular Weight = {total_mw:.5f} Da\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_peptide_mw()\n```\n<<<Recombinant Protein Expression using Genetic Code Expansion>>>"
