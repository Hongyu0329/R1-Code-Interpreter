    "The user wants to find the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` represents the number of certain Feynman diagrams in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantity**: The problem asks for `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in QED. This order (`2n`) is related to the number of loops in the diagrams, with order `2n` typically corresponding to `n`-loop diagrams. These are usually the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams.\n\n2.  **Find the Sequence**: These numbers are not derived from a simple formula. They are the result of complex combinatorial enumerations in quantum field theory, and the values for the first few orders are well-established in physics literature. The sequence `a(n)` for `n=1, 2, 3, 4` is:\n    *   `a(1)` (Order 2, 1-loop): 1\n    *   `a(2)` (Order 4, 2-loops): 2\n    *   `a(3)` (Order 6, 3-loops): 12\n    *   `a(4)` (Order 8, 4-loops): 86\n\n3.  **Formulate the Code**: As requested, I will provide a Python script to solve the task. Since there is no simple formula, the code will use a lookup table (a dictionary) to store the known values of the sequence.\n\n4.  **Solve for a(3)**: The script will be set up to retrieve the value for `n=3`, which corresponds to `a(3)`.\n\n5.  **Format the Output**: The code will print the final answer as an equation, clearly stating the value of `a(3)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the value of `a(3)`:\n```python\ndef get_qed_diagram_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, a(n),\n    of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in QED.\n\n    The values are based on established results from physics research.\n    There is no simple generative formula for this sequence; it is\n    determined by direct enumeration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping n to a(n)\n    # The key 'n' corresponds to the order '2n' (or n-loops).\n    known_values = {\n        1: 1,    # a(1) for order 2\n        2: 2,    # a(2) for order 4\n        3: 12,   # a(3) for order 6\n        4: 86,   # a(4) for order 8\n    }\n\n    if n in known_values:\n        return known_values[n]\n    else:\n        return \"The value for the given n is not in the pre-computed list.\"\n\n# The problem asks for the value of a(3).\nn_value = 3\nresult = get_qed_diagram_count(n_value)\n\n# Print the final equation with all its numbers\nprint(f\"a({n_value}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
