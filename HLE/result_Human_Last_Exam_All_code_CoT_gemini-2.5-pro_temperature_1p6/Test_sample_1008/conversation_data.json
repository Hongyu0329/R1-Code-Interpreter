    "The hierarchy of sound in a dance scene is crucial for creating an immersive and emotionally resonant experience. The primary driver of a dance scene is almost always the music, which dictates the rhythm, mood, and choreography. Sound effects, such as footsteps and costume rustles, ground the dance in reality and add a layer of texture. Speech is typically used sparingly, if at all, as it can distract from the music and physical performance.\n\nHere is a Python script that will print the hierarchy in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in a film's dance scene.\n    \n    In a typical dance scene:\n    1. Music is the most important element, as it provides the foundation for choreography and mood.\n    2. Sound Effects (like footsteps, cloth sounds) are next, adding realism and texture to the performance.\n    3. Speech/Dialogue is usually the least important, often mixed low or omitted entirely to avoid distracting\n       from the music and dance.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The hierarchy of sound importance\n    hierarchy = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n    \n    # Joining the list into a string separated by a comma and a space\n    result = \", \".join(hierarchy)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
