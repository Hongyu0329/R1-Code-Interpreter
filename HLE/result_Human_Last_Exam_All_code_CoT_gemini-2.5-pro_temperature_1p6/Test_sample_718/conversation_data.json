    "When a question from a specialized field of mathematics is presented without the full context of definitions, a common strategy is to analyze a representative example that satisfies all the given conditions. This approach can often reveal the expected answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will choose a specific poset `J` that is a canonical example of an **upper semilattice** and for which the associated algebra `K[J]` is **tame**. A perfect candidate is the \"diamond lattice\", let's call it `L`.\n    *   **Upper Semilattice**: `L` is a lattice, which means for any two elements `x, y`, both their least upper bound (`x ∨ y`) and greatest lower bound (`x ∧ y`) exist. Being a lattice implies it is an upper semilattice.\n    *   **Tame**: The representation theory of the diamond lattice is well-understood. It is of *finite representation type*, which is a stronger condition than being tame. Any poset of finite type is also of tame type.\n2.  I will determine the global dimension of the poset algebra `K[L]`. The global dimension is the maximum projective dimension over all possible representations (functors). If the global dimension is `n`, then every functor `f: L -> Vect_K` is `n`-resolvable. This provides the value for `n`.\n3.  The projective dimension of a representation is calculated by constructing its minimal projective resolution. The global dimension of the algebra is the maximum of the projective dimensions of the simple representations.\n4.  I will write a Python script that programmatically follows the steps of calculating the projective dimensions for all simple representations of the diamond lattice. The code will print out the dimension for each simple module and then find the maximum, which is our `n`.\n\nThe diamond lattice `L` consists of four elements `{1, 2, 3, 4}` with ordering relations `1 < 2`, `1 < 3`, `2 < 4`, `3 < 4`.\n\nThe python code below will calculate the projective dimension for each simple module associated with this lattice.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_poset_relations(poset_edges):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the full set of ordering relations from the covering relations.\n    This uses transitive closure.\n    \"\"\"\n    nodes = sorted(list(set(x for edge in poset_edges for x in edge)))\n    n = len(nodes)\n    node_to_idx = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}\n    adj_matrix = [[(1 if i == j else 0) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n\n    for u, v in poset_edges:\n        i, j = node_to_idx[u], node_to_idx[v]\n        adj_matrix[i][j] = 1\n\n    # Floyd-Warshall for transitive closure\n    for k in range(n):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if adj_matrix[i][k] and adj_matrix[k][j]:\n                    adj_matrix[i][j] = 1\n    \n    relations = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if adj_matrix[i][j]:\n                relations.add((nodes[i], nodes[j]))\n    return relations\n\nclass PosetRepresentation:\n    \"\"\"Represents a vector space at each poset element.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, poset_nodes, relations, dims):\n        self.nodes = sorted(poset_nodes)\n        self.node_to_idx = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(self.nodes)}\n        self.relations = relations\n        self.dims = {node: dim for node, dim in dims.items()}\n\n    def is_zero(self):\n        return all(d == 0 for d in self.dims.values())\n        \n    def __str__(self):\n        return \"Rep(\" + \", \".join(f\"{n}:{d}\" for n, d in sorted(self.dims.items())) + \")\"\n\ndef get_simple_rep(poset_nodes, simple_at):\n    \"\"\"Returns the simple representation Si.\"\"\"\n    dims = {node: (1 if node == simple_at else 0) for node in poset_nodes}\n    return PosetRepresentation(poset_nodes, None, dims)\n\ndef get_projective_rep(poset_nodes, relations, projective_at):\n    \"\"\"Returns the indecomposable projective representation Pi.\"\"\"\n    dims = {node: (1 if (projective_at, node) in relations else 0) for node in poset_nodes}\n    return PosetRepresentation(poset_nodes, relations, dims)\n\ndef get_syzygy(rep):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the first syzygy (kernel of projective cover map) of a representation.\"\"\"\n    if rep.is_zero():\n        return rep, []\n\n    # Minimal elements in the support of the representation\n    support = {n for n, d in rep.dims.items() if d > 0}\n    if not support:\n        return rep, []\n        \n    minimal_elements = {\n        s for s in support \n        if not any((o, s) in rep.relations for o in support if o != s)\n    }\n\n    # Projective cover is the sum of projectives at these minimal elements\n    projective_covers = [\n        get_projective_rep(rep.nodes, rep.relations, m) for m in minimal_elements\n    ]\n    \n    # The map from the cover to the rep is determined by the dimensions.\n    # We create a matrix for each node in the poset.\n    syzygy_dims = {}\n    for node in rep.nodes:\n        # Dimension of the codomain at node\n        codim = rep.dims.get(node, 0)\n        \n        # Dimension of the domain at node\n        domain_dim = sum(p.dims.get(node, 0) for p in projective_covers)\n        \n        # We assume the map is surjective where possible, and compute the kernel dimension.\n        # This is a simplification.
