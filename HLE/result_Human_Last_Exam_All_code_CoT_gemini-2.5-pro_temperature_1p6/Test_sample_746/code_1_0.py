    print("\nStep 1: Definitions")
    print(" - A dispersion point 'p' is a point in a connected space X such that X \\ {p} is totally disconnected.")
    print(" - A totally disconnected space is one where the only connected subsets are single points.")

    print("\nStep 2: Key Lemma")
    print(" - Lemma: Any connected subset C of X with more than one point must contain ALL dispersion points of X.")
    print(" - Proof: Assume a dispersion point p is NOT in C. Then C is a subset of X \\ {p}. Since X \\ {p} is totally disconnected, C must be a single point, which contradicts that C has more than one point. Thus, p must be in C.")

    print("\nStep 3: Proof by Contradiction")
    print(" - Assume there are 3 or more dispersion points. Let's name three of them: p1, p2, p3.")
    print(" - Since p1 is a dispersion point, X \\ {p1} is totally disconnected.")
    print(" - In the totally disconnected space X \\ {p1}, we can find a separation (two disjoint open sets U, V) such that p2 is in U and p3 is in V.")
    print(" - Let's form a new set K = U U {p1}. This set K is a connected subset of X.")
    print(" - K contains p1 and p2, so it has more than one point. By our lemma, K must contain ALL dispersion points.")
    print(" - Therefore, K must contain p3.")
    print(" - But, p3 is in V, which is disjoint from U. And p3 is not p1. So p3 cannot be in K = U U {p1}.")
    print(" - This is a contradiction. The initial assumption of having 3 or more dispersion points must be false.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print(" - The number of dispersion points must be less than 3. So, the maximum is at most 2.")
    print(" - Known topological examples (like the double Knaster-Kuratowski fan) show that a space can have 2 dispersion points.")
