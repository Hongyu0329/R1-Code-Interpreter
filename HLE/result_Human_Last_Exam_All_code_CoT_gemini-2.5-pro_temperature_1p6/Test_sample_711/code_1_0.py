# The dimensions of the obsidian platform provide the numbers for the equation.
dimension1 = 3
dimension2 = 3

# Calculate the result of the equation.
# This number can be interpreted as the quantity of the block to obtain.
result = dimension1 * dimension2

# Per the instructions, this code outputs each number in the final equation.
# This equation justifies the quantity of the essential starting block (Log)
# needed to escape the paradoxical trap.
