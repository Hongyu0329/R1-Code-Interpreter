# The problem is to calculate the sum S = sum_{(n, m) in S} 1/4^n.
#
# Our step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that for each n >= 1,
# there are exactly two possible values for m. These values are m=0 and
# m = N_n, where N_n is the size of the set S_p.
#
# The set of pairs is S = {(n, 0) for n in {1, 2, ...}} U {(n, N_n) for n in {1, 2, ...}}.
#
# So, for each n, there are two pairs in S. This means that for each n, we add
# the term 1/4^n twice to the total sum.
#
# The total sum is Sum = sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4^n + 1/4^n)
#                  = sum_{n=1 to infinity} 2 * (1/4)^n
#                  = 2 * sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n
#
# This is a geometric series with first term a = 1/4 and common ratio r = 1/4.
# The sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r).
#
# Sum of (1/4)^n from n=1 to infinity is (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.
#
# So the total sum is 2 * (1/3) = 2/3.

# We will use sympy to perform the summation formally.
