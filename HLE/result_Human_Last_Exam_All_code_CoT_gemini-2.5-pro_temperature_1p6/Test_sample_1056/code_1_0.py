def compute_abelianization_properties():
    """
    This function calculates the rank and torsion order for the given group G.

    The group G is the subgroup of Homeo_+[0, 1] of piecewise linear functions
    with breakpoints in Z[tau] and slopes in tau^Z, where tau = (sqrt(5)-1)/2.

    The abelianization of this group, Ab(G), is known to be isomorphic to Z x Z.
    Ab(G) is the direct sum of two copies of the integers.

    The rank 'r' of an abelian group is the number of Z copies in its
    free part. For Z x Z, the rank is 2.

    The torsion subgroup 'T' of an abelian group consists of all elements
    of finite order. For Z x Z, the only element of finite order is the
    identity (0,0). So the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.
    The order of the torsion subgroup, 't', is the number of elements in it, which is 1.
