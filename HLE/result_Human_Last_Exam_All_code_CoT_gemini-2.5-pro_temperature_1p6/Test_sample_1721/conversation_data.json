    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem and determine the value of `c`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the largest possible density `c` for a set `A` of integers from `{1, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A = {a + a' | a, a' in A}` contains no perfect square numbers.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Constructive Method:** A powerful way to construct such a set `A` is using modular arithmetic. We can select numbers for `A` based on their remainders when divided by a specific integer `m` (the modulus).\n    *   Let's define `A` as the set of all numbers `n` in `{1, ..., N}` such that `n mod m` falls into a specific set of remainders `R`.\n    *   For any `a, a'` in this `A`, the sum `a+a'` will have a remainder `(a mod m) + (a' mod m)` modulo `m`. These sum-remainders form the set `R+R = {r1 + r2 mod m | r1, r2 in R}`.\n    *   If we ensure that `R+R` does not contain any quadratic residues modulo `m` (the remainders of square numbers), then `A+A` cannot contain any squares.\n    *   The density `c` of such a set `A` is `|R|/m`.\n\n3.  **Search for the Best `c`:** We want to maximize `c = |R|/m`. I will write a Python script that searches for the best `c` by:\n    *   Iterating through various moduli `m`.\n    *   For each `m`, finding the largest possible set of remainders `R` that satisfies the condition `(R+R)` is disjoint from the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`.\n    *   Keeping track of the maximum ratio `|R|/m` found.\n\n4.  **Final Code and Answer:** The Python code will perform this search and print its findings. Based on the code's output, it will state the final answer and present the equation for `c`. The most effective construction known for this problem yields `c = 1/3`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_c():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for the largest density c of a set A where A+A has no squares,\n    using the method of residue classes.\n\n    The method is as follows:\n    1. For a modulus m, we construct a set A as {n | n (mod m) is in R}, where R is a subset of {0, ..., m-1}.\n    2. For this construction, the sumset A+A has elements whose residues modulo m fall in R+R = {r1+r2 (mod m) | r1, r2 in R}.\n    3. The set of squares, when taken modulo m, forms the set of quadratic residues QR_m.\n    4. To ensure A+A has no squares, we must have (R+R) be disjoint from QR_m.\n    5. The density of such a set A is c = |R|/m.\n    6. We search for the pair (m, R) that maximizes this density c.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    m_limit = 35  # Search up to this modulus.
