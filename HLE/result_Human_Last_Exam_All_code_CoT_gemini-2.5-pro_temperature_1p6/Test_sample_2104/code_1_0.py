# Step 1 & 2: Determine n1 and n2.
# Based on the analysis, the conditions are satisfied by any positive even integer n.
# The 1st and 2nd smallest positive even integers are 2 and 4.
n1 = 2
n2 = 4

print(f"The first smallest integer n1 is: {n1}")

alpha = (n1 - 1) / n2
print(f"The argument alpha is (n1-1)/n2 = ({n1}-1)/{n2} = {alpha}")

# Step 4: Determine the Hamiltonian H(p, q) by substituting n1 and n2.
# H = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - (2/n1) * sqrt((n2-n1)/(n1/2)) * q^(n1/2))
# Let's calculate the coefficient for the q term.
coeff_numerator = n2 - n1
coeff_denominator = n1 / 2
coeff_sqrt = math.sqrt(coeff_numerator / coeff_denominator)
coeff_multiplier = 2 / n1
full_coeff = coeff_multiplier * coeff_sqrt
q_power = n1 / 2

# The potential V(q) is 1/2 * (q^2 - full_coeff * q^q_power)
# V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - (2/2)*sqrt((4-2)/(2/2)) * q^(2/2))
# V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - 1*sqrt(2/1) * q^1)
# V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - sqrt(2)*q)

# This is the potential of a displaced harmonic oscillator.
# The Hamiltonian is H = p^2/2 + V(q)
# H = p^2/2 + 1/2*q^2 - (sqrt(2)/2)*q
# To find the period, we only need the terms p^2/2m and 1/2*k*q^2.
# Here, m=1 and k=1.

# Step 5: Calculate the period T.
# The period T = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k).
m = 1
k = 1
period = 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(m / k)

# The final equation is T = 2 * pi * sqrt(1/1) = 2 * pi
