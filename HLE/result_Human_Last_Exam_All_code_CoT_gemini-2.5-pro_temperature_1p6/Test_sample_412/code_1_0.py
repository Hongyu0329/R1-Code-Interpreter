# This script will print the components of the logical statement
# that correctly defines continuity in nonstandard analysis, and then the final answer.

# The nonstandard characterization of continuity for a function f is that
# it preserves the relation of being infinitesimally close to a standard point.
# This means that for any standard point x_0, if a (possibly nonstandard)
# point x_1 is infinitesimally close to x_0, then their images under f
# must also be infinitesimally close.

# Let's break down the correct statement (Option B):
# forall x_0 in X, forall x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)

print("The final logical statement describing continuity is composed of the following parts:")
print("Quantifier for the standard point: forall x_0 in X")
print("Quantifier for the (possibly nonstandard) point: forall x_1 in X*")
print("Condition: x_0 ~ x_1")
print("Implication: ==>")
print("Conclusion: f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)")
print("\nThis corresponds to option B.")

# Final Answer
print("<<<B>>>")
