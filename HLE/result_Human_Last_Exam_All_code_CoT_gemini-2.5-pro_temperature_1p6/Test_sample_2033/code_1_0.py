def calculate_l(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Calculates the value of l(a,b,c,d) based on the derived formula.

    The problem simplifies significantly under the following key assumptions:
    1. The probability distribution of the matrix X depends on the eigenvalues of X * S^-1.
    2. The complex probability density function f(v) simplifies after accounting for the change-of-variable Jacobian,
       leading to a log-probability of H(v) = -1/(2*sigma^2) * sum(v_i^2) - (n+1)/2 * sum(v_i).
    3. The eigenvalues of X_1 * S^-1 are {c, c^2, ..., c^n} and for X_2 * S^-1 are {d, d^2, ..., d^n}.
       This makes the final result independent of a and b.

    Args:
        a (float): Problem parameter (not used in the final formula).

        c (float): Problem parameter, base for eigenvalues of X1.
