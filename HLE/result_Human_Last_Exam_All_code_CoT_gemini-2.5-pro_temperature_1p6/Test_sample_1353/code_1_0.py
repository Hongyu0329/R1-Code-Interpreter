    # which is a lowest weight vector (FP=0), the string terminates
    # with a highest weight vector Q. The bi-degree of Q is (b, a).
    # Given the starting bi-degree is (4, 3), the terminal bi-degree is (3, 4).
    # The string has length k+1 where k = a - b = 4 - 3 = 1.

    # This refers to a standard construction of starters in DH_n from the
    # Vandermonde polynomial Delta(x), which has bi-degree (C(n,2), 0).
    # A starter of bi-degree (a, b) can be constructed by applying b operators
    # of the form E_{1,r_i} = Sum_j y_j * (d/dx_j)^r_i.
    # Each such operator increases y-degree by 1 and decreases x-degree by r_i.

    # The operators E_{r,0} = Sum_i y_i^r are power-sum polynomials in y-variables.
    # Any polynomial "constructed using" them is a polynomial in these y-variable polynomials.
    # Such a polynomial has an x-degree of 0.
