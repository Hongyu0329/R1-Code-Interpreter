    - '3*T(adj) - Sum[T(r_i)]' is the coefficient from a one-loop calculation. This term is directly related to the Adler-Bardeen theorem, which states the chiral anomaly is one-loop exact.

    The key insight of the NSVZ formula is that all quantum corrections beyond one-loop are systematically packaged into the anomalous dimension terms (gamma_i). In other words, the complex all-loop structure is simplified because the underlying non-renormalized quantity (the chiral anomaly) is determined by just the one-loop result. The full beta function for the physical coupling 'g' then inherits this structure, where the one-loop part is fundamental and it 'absorbs' all higher corrections via the gamma factors.
