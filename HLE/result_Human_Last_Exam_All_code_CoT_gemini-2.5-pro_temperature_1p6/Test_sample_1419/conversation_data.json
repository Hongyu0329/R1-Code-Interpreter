    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic calculation in the study of critical phenomena using the Renormalization Group. Here is my plan to derive the expression for the fixed point coupling:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The core of the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` of the theory changes as we vary the energy scale. For `φ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ε` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` is well-known.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, denoted `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point in the theory. At a fixed point, the coupling constant stops changing with the energy scale, which mathematically means the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for `u*`**: By setting the beta function to zero, we obtain an algebraic equation for `u*`. Solving this equation will give us the non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  **Present the Code**: I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to perform this calculation symbolically. The script will define the beta function, solve for the fixed point, and print the resulting expression clearly, showing all numerical components as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*\n    in the phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the symbols and the one-loop beta function.\n    # We work in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.
