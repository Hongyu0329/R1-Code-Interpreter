    "To solve this problem, we need to find the structure of the stable reduction of the given curve over a 2-adic field. The \"thickness\" of the double point in this context refers to the intersection multiplicity of the components of the stable reduction at that point.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the curve equation**\n\nThe given curve is $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$. We are working over a 2-adic field like $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ or an extension thereof.\nTo analyze the reduction, it's often helpful to transform the equation into a monic polynomial form. Let's make the change of variables $x = t/2$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$z^2 = 2(t/2)^5 + 2(t/2)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = 2(t^5/32) + 2(t^3/8) + 1$\n$z^2 = t^5/16 + t^3/4 + 1$\nTo clear the denominators, we multiply by 16:\n$16z^2 = t^5 + 4t^3 + 16$\nLet $w = 4z$. The equation becomes:\n$w^2 = t^5 + 4t^3 + 16$\nThis new curve, let's call it $C'$, is birationally equivalent to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so they have the same stable reduction over any extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the roots of the polynomial**\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $w^2=f(t)$ is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(t) = t^5 + 4t^3 + 16$. We can find these valuations using the Newton polygon of $f(t)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v=v_2$.\n\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon are the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $t^i$.\nThe coefficients are:\n*   $a_5 = 1 \\implies v_2(a_5) = 0$. Point: $(5,0)$.\n*   $a_4 = 0 \\implies v_2(a_4) = \\infty$.\n*   $a_3 = 4 = 2^2 \\implies v_2(a_3) = 2$. Point: $(3,2)$.\n*   $a_2 = 0 \\implies v_2(a_2) = \\infty$.\n*   $a_1 = 0 \\implies v_2(a_1) = \\infty$.\n*   $a_0 = 16 = 2^4 \\implies v_2(a_0) = 4$. Point: $(0,4)$.\n\nThe Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of these points: $(0,4)$, $(3,2)$, and $(5,0)$.\nIt consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,4)$ to $(3,2)$. The slope is $(2-4)/(3-0) = -2/3$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is $3-0=3$. This means there are 3 roots (let's call this set $R_1$) with valuation $v_2(\\beta) = -(\\text{slope}) = 2/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3,2)$ to $(5,0)$. The slope is $(0-2)/(5-3) = -1$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is $5-3=2$. This means there are 2 roots (set $R_2$) with valuation $v_2(\\beta) = -(\\text{slope}) = 1$.\n\nSo the roots of $f(t)$ are partitioned into two sets, $R_1$ and $R_2$, based on their 2-adic valuations.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (the \"Deligne-Mumford stable reduction\"), a partition of the roots of the defining polynomial into clusters leads to a stable model whose special fiber consists of several components. In our case, the partition $R = R_1 \\cup R_2$ implies that the stable model's special fiber, $X_s$, consists of two main components, say $C_1$ and $C_2$, corresponding to the two sets of roots.\n\nThe geometric genus of the component corresponding to a set of $k$ roots is $g = \\lfloor(k-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n*   For component $C_1$ (from the 3 roots in $R_1$), the genus is $g_1 = \\lfloor(3-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$.\n*   For component $C_2$ (from the 2 roots in $R_2$), the genus is $g_2 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n\nThe original curve has genus $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. The arithmetic genus of the special fiber of any stable model must be equal to the genus of the generic fiber. Thus, the arithmetic genus of $X_s$ is $p_a(X_s) = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the intersection multiplicity (thickness)**\n\nWhen a curve degenerates into two components $C_1$ and $C_2$, its arithmetic genus is given by the formula:\n$p_a(C_1 \\cup C_2) = g(C_1) + g(C_2) + (C_1 \\cdot C_2) - 1$\nwhere $(C_1 \\cdot C_2)$ is the intersection multiplicity of the two components. This intersection number is what is referred to as the \"thickness\" of the singular points connecting the components.\n\nWe have all the other values in the formula:\n*   $p_a(X_s) = 2$\n*   $g(C_1) = 1$\n*   $g(C_2) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$2 = 1 + 0 + (C_1 \\cdot C_2) - 1$\n$2 = (C_1 \\cdot C_2)$\n\nThis implies that the two components $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect with multiplicity 2. This could mean they intersect at two distinct points, each with multiplicity 1, or at a single point with multiplicity 2. In either case, the total intersection number, which is the \"thickness\", is 2. The phrase \"the double point\" in the question suggests the components meet at a single point of tangency.\n\nThe equation representing this final calculation is:\n$2 = 1 + 0 + \\text{thickness} - 1$\nTherefore, the thickness is 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the steps to calculate the thickness of the double point.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Genus of the original curve z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1.\n    # The degree of the polynomial in x is 5.\n    # Genus g = floor((deg-1)/2)\n    g = 2\n\n    # After a change of variables (x=t/2, w=4z), the curve is birationally\n    # equivalent to w^2 = t^5 + 4t^3 + 16.\n    # The Newton Polygon of t^5 + 4t^3 + 16 shows the roots of the polynomial\n    # split into two clusters.\n    # Cluster 1 (R1): 3 roots.\n    # Cluster 2 (R2): 2 roots.\n    num_roots_R1 = 3\n    num_roots_R2 = 2\n\n    # The stable reduction has two main components, C1 and C2, corresponding\n    # to these clusters of roots.\n    # The genus of the component for a cluster of k roots is g_k = floor((k-1)/2).\n    g1 = (num_roots_R1 - 1) // 2  # Genus of component C1\n    g2 = (num_roots_R2 - 1) // 2  # Genus of component C2\n\n    # The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction fiber (pa) must equal the genus\n    # of the original curve (g).\n    pa = g\n\n    # The formula for the arithmetic genus of a curve degenerating into two components is:\n    # pa = g1 + g2 + thickness - 1\n    # We solve for the thickness.\n    # thickness = pa - g1 - g2 + 1\n    thickness = pa - g1 - g2 + 1\n    \n    print(\"The genus of the curve is g = {}.\".format(g))\n    print(\"The stable reduction has two components, C1 and C2.\")\n    print(\"The number of roots for C1 is {}.\".format(num_roots_R1))\n    print(\"The number of roots for C2 is {}.\".format(num_roots_R2))\n    print(\"The genus of C1 is g1 = {}.\".format(g1))\n    print(\"The genus of C2 is g2 = {}.\".format(g2))\n    print(\"The arithmetic genus of the stable fiber is pa = {}.\".format(pa))\n    print(\"The relationship is given by the formula: pa = g1 + g2 + thickness - 1\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values:\")\n    print(\"{} = {} + {} + thickness - {}\".format(pa, g1, g2, 1))\n    print(\"Solving for the thickness gives: thickness = {}\".format(thickness))\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
