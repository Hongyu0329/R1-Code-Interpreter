# Step 5: Determine the values of the constants based on analysis and assumptions.
# We found the relationships:
# K4 = 2
# K2 = K1 / 2
# K3 = -K1 / 4

# To find a unique solution, we make a normalization assumption. A natural choice
# is to set the coefficient of the leading term in the denominator's parenthesis to 1.
# The term is K2 * l * sqrt(lambda_m), so we assume K2 = 1.
K2 = 1

# From this assumption, we can find the other constants.
K1 = 2 * K2
K3 = -K1 / 4
K4 = 2

# The term 'K' in the product is undefined in the problem statement and is likely a typo.
# If it were the 'k' from the boundary condition, the result would not be a constant value.
# Thus, we compute the product of the determined constants K1, K2, K3, K4.
product = K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 6: Print the final equation and the result.
