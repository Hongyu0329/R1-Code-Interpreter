    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will find the name of the character the protagonist marries in Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\". Then, I will write a simple Python script to store this name in a variable and print it in a formatted string as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# In the story, he forms a deep bond and ultimately merges with an Integrated\n# Autonomous Unit (JAI) who was his guide. This act of merging is the\n# closest equivalent to marriage in the book's post-human context.\n# This script will print her name.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(f\"The main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość', Adam Zamoyski, marries (or more accurately, merges with) a character named: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
