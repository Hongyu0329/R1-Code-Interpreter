    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:** These are the points $(u, d)$ where both $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$ are zero. These points represent the steady states of the system.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** By linearizing the system at each equilibrium point, we can determine its type (e.g., node, saddle, center). This is done by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Typically, the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point act as separatrices. We will look for an invariant curve that passes through a saddle point. An invariant curve is a curve $d=f(u)$ such that if a trajectory starts on the curve, it stays on the curve.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Finding and Classifying Equilibrium Points**\n\nFirst, we set $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives equilibrium values at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives two equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nBy analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system at these points, we can classify them:\n*   **(0, 0)** is a degenerate point.\n*   **(1, 0)** is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **(1, -1)** is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Separatrix**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (1, -1) are separatrices. Let's find the equation for one of these manifolds. We hypothesize that there might be a simple algebraic relationship between $d$ and $u$ that describes an invariant curve passing through the saddle point (1, -1) and another equilibrium point, like (0, 0).\n\nLet's test the candidate curve $d = -u^2$.\n*   At $u=1$, $d = -1^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   At $u=0$, $d = -0^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nNow, we must verify if this curve is an actual trajectory (an invariant manifold) of the system. A curve $d(u)$ is a trajectory if it satisfies the equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. A more direct way is to substitute $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$ into the first differential equation and see if it holds true.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic verification. It substitutes the proposed separatrix equation into the ODE and simplifies both sides to check for equality.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef verify_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies if the curve d = -u**2 is a separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n    A separatrix is an invariant manifold, meaning a trajectory that starts on it stays on it.\n    We verify this by substituting d = -u**2 into the first ODE and checking if the equation holds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define time t as a symbol and u, d as functions of t\n    t = sp.Symbol('t')\n    u = sp.Function('u')(t)\n    d = sp.Function('d')(t)\n\n    # Define the system of differential equations\n    # d'(t) = 2*d(t)**2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)**2)*d(t) - u(t)**3*(1-u(t))\n    d_prime_expr = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    # u'(t) = u(t)**2*(u(t)-1)\n    u_prime_expr = u**2 * (u - 1)\n\n    # Define the candidate separatrix equation: d(t) = -u(t)**2\n    separatrix_candidate = -u**2\n\n    # Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) of the first ODE: d'(t)\n    # We differentiate our candidate d with respect to t\n    lhs = sp.diff(separatrix_candidate, t)\n    # The result contains u'(t), which we substitute with its expression from the second ODE\n    lhs = lhs.subs(sp.diff(u, t), u_prime_expr)\n\n    # Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the first ODE\n    # We substitute our candidate for d into the expression for d'(t)\n    rhs = d_prime_expr.subs(d, separatrix_candidate)\n\n    # Check if LHS and RHS are equal by simplifying their difference.\n    # If the difference simplifies to 0, the candidate is a valid invariant manifold.\n    if sp.simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0:\n        print(\"Verification successful.\")\n        print(\"The equation d = -u**2 is a separatrix of the system.\")\n        \n        # As requested, output the numbers in the final equation.\n        # The equation is of the form d = a * u**p\n        a = -1\n        p = 2\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe equation for the separatrix is d = a * u**p\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient a is: {a}\")\n        print(f\"The power p is: {p}\")\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"d = ({a}) * u**({p})\")\n\n    else:\n        print(\"Verification failed.\")\n        print(\"The curve d = -u**2 is not a separatrix.\")\n\n# Run the verification\nverify_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
