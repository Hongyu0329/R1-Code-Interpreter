def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the topological problem based on logical deduction.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A key theorem in continuum theory states that if a continuum X is aposyndetic,
       then for any point p in X, the set X\{p} is continuum-connected.
    2. A point p is a non-block point if X\{p} contains a dense continuum-connected subset.
       Since X\{p} is itself continuum-connected and dense in itself, this condition is met for every p.
    3. Thus, for an aposyndetic continuum, the set of non-block points is the entire space X.
    4. The problem then becomes finding the minimum cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.
    5. A single-point space is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff).
    6. It is also vacuously aposyndetic, as there are no distinct pairs of points.
    7. The cardinality of a single-point space is 1. Since a continuum must be non-empty,
       this is the smallest possible cardinality.

    # The smallest possible cardinality is found from the degenerate case of a single-point continuum.
    smallest_cardinality = 1
    
    print("The smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points is:")
