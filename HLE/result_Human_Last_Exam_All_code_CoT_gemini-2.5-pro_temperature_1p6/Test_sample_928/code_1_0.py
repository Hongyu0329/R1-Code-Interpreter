# The question asks for the two nouns from the last syntactically correct and incorrect sentences
# in the same section of Chomsky's work where "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" appears.

# As determined by analyzing the text of Chomsky's "Syntactic Structures" (1957),
# the last syntactically incorrect sentence presented is "I saw a fragile of." This sentence has no nouns.
# The last syntactically correct sentence is "a talk was to take place in the auditorium."

# The nouns from the correct sentence are "talk" and "auditorium".
noun_from_correct_sentence_1 = "talk"
noun_from_correct_sentence_2 = "auditorium"

# The incorrect sentence contains no nouns.
# The total number of nouns from both sentences is two, matching the question.
