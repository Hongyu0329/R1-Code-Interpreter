    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number**: The chromatic number of a graph, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required to color its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n2.  **Relate Chromatic Number to Number of Vertices**: For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n3.  **Identify the case for maximum chromatic number**: The maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G) = n$, is achieved if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$). In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so all vertices must have a different color.\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Constraint**: The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. So, $\\chi(G) < n$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. This tells us that we will never need more than $n-1$ colors for such a graph.\n5.  **Verify if the upper bound is achievable**: Now we need to determine if a chromatic number of $n-1$ is actually achievable for a graph that is not complete. Let's construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G$ composed of two disconnected components:\n    *   A complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$.\n    *   A single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n    This graph has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    The chromatic number of this graph is determined by the maximum chromatic number of its components. The $K_{n-1}$ component requires $n-1$ colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of those colors. Thus, the chromatic number of the entire graph is $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n6.  **Conclusion**: We have shown that any graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors, and that there exists such a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n7.  **Calculation**: With $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors needed is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this simple calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # For any graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph,\n    # the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring is n - 1.\n    # This is because a graph needs n colors if and only if it is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since our graph is not complete, its chromatic number is at most n-1.\n    # This maximum is achievable for a graph consisting of a K_{n-1} component\n    # and a single isolated vertex.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # Print the equation and the final answer.\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
