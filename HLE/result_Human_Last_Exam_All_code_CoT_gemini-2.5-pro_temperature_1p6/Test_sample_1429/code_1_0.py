print("\n--- Question A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable? ---")
print("Yes. The machine model is Turing-complete, given the premise that for any computation, we can choose machine parameters (R, A, W) that are large enough. Here's why:")
print("1. Turing-Completeness: The instruction set includes `ADD`, `BITWISENAND`, and `BRANCHIFZERO`. `BITWISENAND` is logically complete, and with `ADD` and conditional branching, the machine can perform any algorithm. This is characteristic of a Turing-complete register machine.")
print("2. Unbounded Memory (by definition): The concept of 'boopable' relies on the existence of a machine size N such that for any larger machine, the program computes the correct result. This effectively grants the machine access to arbitrarily large (but finite for any given run) memory and register space, mimicking the infinite tape of a Turing machine.")
print("3. Simulation: A standard Turing machine can simulate our machine. To compute f(x) for a boopable function f, the simulator would take the program L, determine a sufficiently large N, and run the simulation. Since a boopable function is defined to halt, the simulation will always terminate. Therefore, any boopable function is Turing-computable.")

print("\n--- Question B: Does there exist a program L for the specified machine and constraints? ---")
print("Yes. Such a program is possible. The constraints are very tight: the total number of non-booping instructions must be less than 50.")
print("The core idea is a program `L` that contains a small setup routine followed by a large, contiguous block of `2^32` `BOOP` instructions. The setup routine's job is to jump to the correct starting `BOOP` to ensure exactly `x` of them are executed.")
print("  - The program `L` has a length like `S + 2^32 + 1` (where S is the size of the setup code, e.g., S=40), which is within the allowed `2^32 + 50`.")
print("  - To execute `x` boops, the program must jump to address `TargetAddr = S + 2^32 - x`.")
print("  - This requires an indirect jump, which is implemented by having the code write a `BRANCH` instruction with the computed target address into memory and then executing it (self-modifying code).")
print("  - The feasibility of this hinges on the instruction format. The problem description is ambiguous. Assuming a favorable format where the address is in the LSBs of the instruction word, this instruction can be built very quickly.")

print("\n--- Python Code: Simulating the Fast Setup Process ---")
print("The following demonstrates that the setup (overhead) can be completed in well under 50 steps.")

# Simulation of the instructions needed for the setup phase.
# Let x be the input, residing in register r0.
overhead_instructions = []

# Step 1: Compute -x = NOT(x) + 1

overhead_instructions.append("r_not_x <- BITWISENAND r0, r0      # Compute NOT(x)")
overhead_instructions.append("r_neg_x <- ADD r_not_x, r_one        # Finish 2's complement for -x")

# Step 2: Compute Target Address = (S + 2^32) + (-x)
# S is the start address of the BOOP block (a constant, e.g., 40).
overhead_instructions.append("r_base <- LOAD &const_S_plus_2_32  # Load base value S + 2^32")
overhead_instructions.append("r_target <- ADD r_base, r_neg_x      # Compute final target address")

# Step 3: Create the final BRANCH instruction
# The instruction format is assumed to be `Op|...|Addr`.
# The template is the instruction `BRANCHIFZERO 0, r_zero`.
overhead_instructions.append("r_template <- LOAD &branch_template # Load 'BRANCHIFZERO 0, r_zero'")
overhead_instructions.append("r_instr <- ADD r_template, r_target  # Add in the computed address")

# Step 4: Write and execute the new instruction
overhead_instructions.append("STORE &trampoline <- r_instr      # Write instruction to memory")

# The Program Counter naturally advances to the trampoline address and executes the jump.
# This jump itself counts as one step of the overhead.
overhead_instructions.append("BRANCHIFZERO r_target, r_zero  # The jump instruction itself executes")
