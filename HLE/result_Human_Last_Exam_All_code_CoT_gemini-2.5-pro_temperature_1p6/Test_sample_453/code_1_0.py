    Calculates the second-order energy shift for an electron in a hydrogen atom
    in the n=3, l=2 state due to the relativistic kinetic energy correction.

    The state |n=3, l=2> is a "circular orbit" state (l = n-1).
    For such states, it is a known result that the first-order perturbation theory
    for the relativistic kinetic energy correction gives the exact result. This means
    that all higher-order corrections, including the second-order shift, are zero.
    
    The perturbation Hamiltonian is H' = -p^4 / (8 * m^3 * c^2).
    The second-order energy shift is given by the formula:
    E^(2) = sum_{k!=n} |<k|H'|n>|^2 / (E_n^(0) - E_k^(0))

    For circular orbit states, this sum evaluates to zero.
