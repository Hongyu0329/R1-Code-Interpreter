    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n1.  First, I will research and compile a list of all the unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown in Major League Baseball history, covering both the American League and the National League.\n2.  A player wins the batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league in three specific statistical categories in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI).\n3.  Some players, like Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, have won it more than once. For the purpose of counting the \"winners,\" I will count each player only once.\n4.  I will create a Python script that stores these unique winners in a list.\n5.  The script will then print each winner's name.\n6.  Finally, the script will calculate and print the total number of unique players in the list, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the unique players who have won the \n    MLB batting Triple Crown.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A list of unique players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n    # Note: Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won twice, but are counted once as unique winners.\n    winners = [\n        # National League Winners\n        \"Paul Hines\",\n        \"Tip O'Neill\",\n        \"Hugh Duffy\",\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\",\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\",\n        \"Chuck Klein\",\n        \"Joe Medwick\",\n        # American League Winners\n        \"Nap Lajoie\",\n        \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Jimmie Foxx\",\n        \"Lou Gehrig\",\n        \"Ted Williams\",\n        \"Mickey Mantle\",\n        \"Frank Robinson\",\n        \"Carl Yastrzemski\",\n        \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n    \n    total_winners = len(winners)\n    \n    print(\"The unique players who have won the MLB Triple Crown are:\")\n    \n    # We will list each player, as each one is a component of the final count.\n    for i, name in enumerate(winners):\n        print(f\"{i + 1}. {name}\")\n        \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of unique Triple Crown winners: {total_winners}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
