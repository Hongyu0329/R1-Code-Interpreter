    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for core and valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **For Carbon (a second-row atom):**\n        *   The core (1s) orbital is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians, the '6' in 6-31G).\n        *   The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" valence).\n        *   The inner valence part is described by 1 s-function and 1 set of p-functions (px, py, pz) -> `1s + 3p = 4` functions. (from 3 primitives, the '3' in 6-31G).\n        *   The outer valence part is described by another 1 s-function and 1 set of p-functions -> `1s + 3p = 4` functions. (from 1 primitive, the '1' in 6-31G).\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):**\n        *   It has no core orbitals. The 1s orbital is its valence orbital.\n        *   The valence 1s orbital is split into two parts.\n        *   Inner part: 1 s-function (from 3 primitives).\n        *   Outer part: 1 s-function (from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its number of basis functions and sum the results.\n    *   Total = (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the total number of contracted Gaussian functions\n# for a toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n# Step 1: Define the number of atoms in toluene.\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Step 2: Define the number of contracted functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set.\n# For Carbon (C): 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 functions.\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2 functions.\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of functions from each element.\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Step 4: Sum the functions to get the total for the molecule.\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Step 5: Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.\nprint(f\"To find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"First, calculate the functions for the {num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms: {num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_carbon} = {total_carbon_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Next, calculate the functions for the {num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_hydrogen} = {total_hydrogen_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Finally, sum them together for the total number of functions.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
