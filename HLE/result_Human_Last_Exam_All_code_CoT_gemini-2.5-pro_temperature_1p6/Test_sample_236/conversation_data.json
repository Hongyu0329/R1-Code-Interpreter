    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Knots:** Identify all knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n2.  **Relate Surgery to the Group:** An integral surgery (with coefficient p = ±1) on a knot `K` produces a homology 3-sphere. The class of this homology sphere in the homology cobordism group (Θ₃ᴴ) is determined by its Rohlin invariant. The group Θ₃ᴴ is isomorphic to ℤ/2ℤ, so there are two elements: the trivial element (represented by the 3-sphere S³) and one non-trivial element.\n3.  **Use the Arf Invariant:** The Rohlin invariant of the homology sphere resulting from surgery on knot `K` is equal to the Arf invariant of `K` (mod 2).\n    *   If `Arf(K) = 0`, the surgery represents the trivial element of Θ₃ᴴ.\n    *   If `Arf(K) = 1`, the surgery represents the non-trivial element of Θ₃ᴴ.\n4.  **Calculate and Count:** We will find the Arf invariant for each knot and count how many unique group elements (trivial or non-trivial) are generated.\n\nThe Python code below executes this plan by using the known Arf invariants for these simple knots.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many homology cobordism group elements can be represented\n    by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping knots (with at most 4 crossings) to their Arf invariants.\n    # The Arf invariant determines the element in the homology cobordism group (Z/2Z).\n    # Arf(K) = 0 -> Trivial element\n    # Arf(K) = 1 -> Non-trivial element\n    knots_and_arfs = {\n        \"0_1 (Unknot)\": 0,\n        \"3_1 (Trefoil)\": 1,\n        \"4_1 (Figure-eight)\": 0\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Homology Cobordism Group Elements from Knots <= 4 Crossings\\n\")\n    print(\"The element is determined by the knot's Arf invariant.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Use a set to automatically handle uniqueness of the resulting group elements (0 or 1)\n    found_elements = set()\n    arf_values_for_equation = []\n\n    for knot, arf in knots_and_arfs.items():\n        found_elements.add(arf)\n        arf_values_for_equation.append(str(arf))\n        element_type = \"Trivial\" if arf == 0 else \"Non-trivial\"\n        \n        print(f\"Knot: {knot}\")\n        print(f\"Arf Invariant: {arf}\")\n        print(f\"Resulting Element: {element_type} (class {arf})\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n        \n    num_elements = len(found_elements)\n    \n    # Construct the final equation string showing all numbers involved\n    arfs_str = \", \".join(arf_values_for_equation)\n    final_equation = f\"count(unique values of {{{arfs_str}}}) = {num_elements}\"\n\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(f\"The distinct elements found correspond to Arf invariants: {sorted(list(found_elements))}\")\n    print(\"The final count is derived from the unique Arf invariants:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism_elements()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
