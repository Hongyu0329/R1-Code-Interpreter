    Analyzes the network transformation problem to determine the correct statement.

    The problem describes transforming a Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world network into an ultra-small-world network.

    1.  **Initial State**: A WS graph with `n` vertices, average degree 6. Its average path length `L` scales as `log(n)`.
    2.  **Target State**: An ultra-small-world graph where `L` scales as `log(log(n))`.
    3.  **Transformation**: Rewiring operations `m(n)` that remove one edge and add another.
    4.  **Constraints**: Clustering `C(G)` must stay `≥ 0.3`, max degree `≤ ⌈log(n)⌉`, min degree `≥ 3`.

    Reasoning steps:
    - The change in average path length scaling from `O(log n)` to `O(log log n)` is a fundamental, global change in the network's topology.
    - Such a macroscopic change cannot be achieved by a microscopic number of alterations. Modifying a sub-linear number of edges (`o(n)`) would only create a small perturbation, which is insufficient to alter the global path length scaling law.
    - Therefore, the number of required rewiring operations, `m(n)`, must be proportional to the size of the graph, `n`. This means `m(n)` must be on the order of `n`.
    - Mathematically, this is expressed as `m(n) ∈ Θ(n)`.

    Let's check the other options for contradictions:
    - A) `m(n) ∈ Θ(n log log n)`: This is likely too high. Rewiring `n log log n` edges when the graph only has `3n` edges is excessive.
    - D) `At least n/4 vertices must reach degree ⌈log(n)⌉`: This is impossible. For large n, the sum of degrees would be `(n/4) * log(n)`, which is much larger than the graph's total degree sum of `6n`.
    - F) `...must have power-law degree distribution`: This is contradicted by the problem's constraint that the maximum degree is capped at `⌈log(n)⌉`. Power-law networks have hubs with degrees that are not bounded this tightly.
    - H) `...requires at least n/6 edge removals from the original lattice structure`: This is not necessary. The transformation can be achieved by rewiring the `~0.6n` long-range shortcuts that already exist in the WS graph, which would not touch the original lattice edges at all, thus preserving clustering.
    - I) and K): These contradict the goal of the transformation, which is to change the average path length.
    - Other options (C, E, G, J, L) describe specific structural outcomes or intermediate states that are not necessarily the only way to achieve the goal, so the word "must" makes them likely incorrect.

    The most defensible and general conclusion is that the number of operations scales linearly with the number of vertices.
