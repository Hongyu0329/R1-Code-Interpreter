def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the provided Go puzzle by analyzing the board state and
    determining the killing move for White.

    The board state is as follows:
    - Black stones: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    - White stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    - It is White's turn to move.

    Analysis Steps:
    1. The black group at {C1, C2} is the most vulnerable target.
    2. Its liberties are at the points B1 and B2.
    3. White's options are to play at B1 or B2.

    4. Scenario 1: White plays B1.
       - W[B1] puts the B{C1, C2} group in atari.
       - Black's only response to save the group is B[B2].
       - B[B2] connects all black stones into a large group with liberties at A1, A3, and A4.
       - This group has enough space and liberties to eventually live. For instance, if White attacks with W[A1], Black can capture the attacking stones with B[A3].
       - Therefore, W[B1] is not a killing move.

    5. Scenario 2: White plays B2. This is a tesuji (clever play).
       - W[B2] is a throw-in. It puts the B{C1, C2} group in atari (with its last liberty at B1).
       - The W[B2] stone itself is also in atari (with its last liberty at B1).
       - Black's turn. Black must play B[B1] to capture W[B2]. If Black plays elsewhere, White plays W[B1] and captures the B{C1, C2} group.
       - Black plays B[B1], capturing W[B2]. The board now has a black stone at B1, and B2 is empty again. The black group {B1, C1, C2} now has two liberties (at A1 and B2) and seems safe.
       - White's turn. White plays at B2 *again*.
       - This new W[B2] puts the B{B1, C1, C2} group back into atari. Its only liberty is A1.
       - Black's turn. Black must play B[A1] to prevent capture.
       - Black's move at A1 connects the {B1, C1, C2} group with the B[A2] stone. The new large group is {A1, A2, B1, C1, C2}.
       - White's turn. This large black group is now completely surrounded. Its only liberty is at A3.
       - White plays W[A3], capturing the entire group.

    Conclusion: Black cannot escape this sequence. The move B2 initiates a kill.
    There are no other moves for White that can force a kill.
