# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the problem statement
# The user wants to calculate the value of the function l(k).
# l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1
# where p_k is the probability density function of a random variable z,
# and d_k is its differential entropy.

# The random variable z is defined as:
# z = (det(M))^k / (det(X))^(2k)
# The matrix X simplifies to X = Q * D_v * Q^T * S, where D_v is a diagonal
# matrix with entries exp(v_i), and S is from the Cholesky decomposition M = S * S^T.
# The determinant of X is det(X) = det(Q * D_v * Q^T * S) = det(Q) * det(D_v) * det(Q^T) * det(S).
# Since Q is orthogonal, det(Q) * det(Q^T) = 1.
# det(D_v) = product(exp(v_i)) = exp(sum(v_i)).
# From M = S * S^T, we have det(M) = det(S)^2, so det(S) = sqrt(det(M)).
# Thus, det(X) = exp(sum(v_i)) * sqrt(det(M)).
# Substituting this into the expression for z:
# z = (det(M))^k / (exp(sum(v_i)) * sqrt(det(M)))^(2k)
# z = (det(M))^k / (exp(2k * sum(v_i)) * (det(M))^k)
# z = exp(-2k * sum(v_i)).
# So, z depends only on the sum of the components of the random vector v.

# Step 3: Analyze the probability density function f(v)
# v is sampled from a PDF f(v) = l_1(v) * l_2(v).
# Let's examine l_2(v):
# l_2(v) is proportional to the product:
# P = product_{i=1 to n} product_{j >= i to n} sinh(|v_i - v_j| / 2).
# This double product includes terms where i = j.
# For any term where i = j, we have |v_i - v_j| = |v_i - v_i| = 0.
# The value of sinh(0) is 0.
# Because one of the terms in the overall product is always 0, the entire product P is 0.
# This means l_2(v) = 0 for all v in R^n.
# Consequently, the PDF f(v) = l_1(v) * l_2(v) = 0 for all v.

# Step 4: Evaluate p_k(1) and d_k
# A function that is zero everywhere cannot be a valid probability density function because its
# integral over R^n is 0, not 1.
# However, if we proceed formally with this "distribution", the probability of any event is 0.
# This implies that the probability density function of z, p_k(z), must also be 0 for all z.
# Therefore, p_k(1) = 0.
p_k_at_1 = 0

# The differential entropy d_k is defined as H(z) = - integral( p_k(z) * ln(p_k(z)) dz ).
# Since p_k(z) = 0, the integrand is 0 * ln(0).
# The limit of x*ln(x) as x -> 0 is 0. So the integrand is 0 everywhere.
# The integral of 0 is 0.
# Therefore, d_k = 0.
d_k = 0

# Step 5: Calculate l(k)
# We substitute these values into the expression for l(k).
# l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1
c1 = 2
c2 = 1
result = p_k_at_1 + c1 * d_k - c2

# Step 6: Print the final calculation
print(f"The calculation for l(k) is based on the finding that the defined probability density function f(v) is identically zero.")
print(f"This leads to p_k(1) = 0 and d_k = 0.")
print(f"Substituting these values into the formula l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1:")
print(f"{p_k_at_1} + {c1} * {d_k} - {c2} = {result}")
