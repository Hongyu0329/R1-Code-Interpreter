    # The key weakness for many is Requirement #2: Coercion.
    # For example, Liveness Detection (D) or Challenge-Response (F) can't distinguish
    # between a willing and a coerced user, as a live user under duress will
    # still pass the liveness checks.
    # Strong MFA (I) is also vulnerable, as an attacker can force a user to provide all factors.
    # Data-centric solutions like Hashing (J) or ZKP (C) don't stop active attacks
    # like spoofing or coercion at the point of authentication.

        "Requirement 2 (Coercion)": "This is the key strength. A coerced user will likely be in an anomalous context (e.g., unusual location, time). The system can detect this anomaly and block or challenge the authentication.",
        "Requirement 3 (Data Exposure)": "Mitigates the risk. Stolen biometric data alone becomes insufficient for authentication without the required matching context.",
        "Requirement 4 (Applicability)": "The contextual layer is independent of the biometric modality used (face, voice, fingerprint, etc.), making it universally applicable."
