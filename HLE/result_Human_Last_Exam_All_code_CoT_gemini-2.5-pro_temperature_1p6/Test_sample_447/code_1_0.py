    print("Analysis: AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase) is the enzyme that directly causes somatic hypermutation (SHM). A mutation in AID will impair or eliminate SHM, preventing the generation of high-affinity antibodies.\n")

    # G2 Analysis
    print("Group [G2] CD40-KO: SELECTED")
    print("Analysis: The CD40-CD40L interaction between B cells and T helper cells is essential for forming germinal centers, where SHM occurs. A CD40 knockout prevents this, severely impairing the antibody response.\n")

    # G3 Analysis
    print("Group [G3] H2-IAd-(E137A/V142A): SELECTED")
    print("Analysis: H2-IAd is the MHC Class II molecule that presents antigen (OVA) to CD4+ T helper cells. A mutation can disrupt this presentation, leading to poor T cell activation and insufficient help for B cells.\n")

    # G4 Analysis
    print("Group [G4] CD8-(V247D): NOT SELECTED")
    print("Analysis: CD8 is on cytotoxic T cells, not the CD4+ helper T cells required for this type of B cell response. This mutation is not expected to significantly impact the antibody titer.\n")

    # G5 Analysis

    print("Analysis: Similar to G3, this mutation in the MHC Class II molecule H2-IAd is expected to impair antigen presentation to T helper cells, reducing the subsequent B cell response.\n")
    
    # G6 Analysis
    print("Group [G6] MyD88-KO: SELECTED")
    print("Analysis: MyD88 is a critical adapter for the CpG adjuvant, which acts via TLR9 to boost the immune response. A MyD88 knockout eliminates the adjuvant's effect, leading to a much weaker response and lower antibody titers.\n")
