# The question is a theoretical one from fine-grained complexity theory.
# The task is to identify the maximum integer k for which counting k-matchings
# in a graph can be done in subcubic time, i.e., O(|V|^(3-epsilon)).

# Based on the analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms:
# - For k <= 6, counting k-matchings can be reduced to counting various
#   k-edge subgraphs, all of which are known to be countable in subcubic time.
#   The main tool is fast matrix multiplication.
# - For k = 7, this reduction requires counting 7-cycles (C_7).
# - The best known algorithm for counting C_7 is super-cubic. It is a major
#   open problem in fine-grained complexity to find a subcubic one.
# - Under the standard assumption that no such algorithm for C_7 exists,
#   the complexity of counting 7-matchings is also super-cubic.

# Therefore, the maximum value for k is 6.

maximum_k = 6
