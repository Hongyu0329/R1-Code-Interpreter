    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the partition function followed by a Python script that presents the final equations.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Quantity**: The goal is to find the grand canonical partition function, Z. The general definition is $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(H - \\mu_{res} N)}]$, where $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$, H is the Hamiltonian, N is the particle number operator, and $\\mu_{res}$ is the chemical potential of the reservoir.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**: The problem provides a Hamiltonian $H' = -\\mu N$. This is best interpreted as the grand canonical Hamiltonian itself, $K = H - \\mu_{res} N$. We will denote the parameter $\\mu$ from the problem statement as the effective chemical potential to avoid confusion. So, we are calculating the partition function for the operator $K = -\\mu N$. The partition function is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta K}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu N)}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta \\mu N}]$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Path Integral**: The trace can be calculated using the path integral formalism. The partition function Z is given by a functional integral over fields $\\psi(\\tau)$:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S}$\n    The action, S, for a system of non-interacting particles is generally $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu_{res}) \\psi_k(\\tau)$, where $\\epsilon_k$ are the single-particle energies. In our case, the grand canonical operator $K=-\\mu N$ corresponds to a system where the single-particle grand canonical energies $(\\epsilon_k - \\mu_{res})$ are all equal to $-\\mu$. This is equivalent to a system with zero kinetic energy ($\\epsilon_k=0$) and an effective chemical potential of $\\mu$. The action simplifies to:\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Path Integral**: This action describes particles that can be created or annihilated but do not move or interact. The path integral is Gaussian and can be evaluated exactly. The result depends on whether the particles are fermions (described by Grassmann fields) or bosons (described by complex fields). The calculation yields:\n    *   **For Fermions**: The partition function for a single state k is $Z_k = 1 + e^{\\beta \\mu}$.\n    *   **For Bosons**: The partition function for a single state k is $Z_k = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}}$. For this to be well-defined, the geometric series used in its derivation must converge, which requires $e^{\\beta \\mu} < 1$, implying $\\mu < 0$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Answer**: The total partition function Z is the product of the single-state partition functions over all possible single-particle states (e.g., all momentum and spin states). If we assume there are M such identical states, we raise the single-state result to the power of M.\n\nThe following Python script will print this derivation and the final equations.\n\n```python\ndef partition_function_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script presents the derivation and final equations for the partition function Z\n    for a system with the grand canonical Hamiltonian K = -μN, calculated using path integrals.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Derivation and Result for the Partition Function Z ###\")\n    print(\"\\nThe grand canonical partition function Z for a system with grand canonical\")\n    print(\"Hamiltonian K = -μN is given by Z = Tr[exp(-βK)] = Tr[exp(βμN)].\")\n    print(\"This trace can be evaluated using a path integral over fields ψ, where Z = ∫D[ψ*,ψ]exp(-S),\")\n    print(\"with the action S = ∫dτ Σₖ ψₖ*(∂_τ - μ)ψₖ.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe evaluation of this path integral depends on the particle statistics.\")\n    print(\"Let M be the total number of identical single-particle states available.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Define the symbols for the equation as strings\n    Z = \"Z\"\n    one = \"1\"\n    exp = \"exp\"\n    beta = \"β\"\n    mu = \"μ\"\n    M = \"M\"\n\n    # --- Fermion Case ---\n    print(\"\\nCase 1: The system consists of FERMIONS.\")\n    print(\"For fermions, each state can be occupied by at most one particle.\")\n    print(\"The result of the path integral for the partition function Z is:\")\n    # Print the final equation, showing each symbolic component\n    print(f\"  {Z} = ({one} + {exp}({beta} * {mu}))^{M}\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(f\"  {Z}: The Partition Function\")\n    print(f\"  {beta}: The inverse temperature, 1/(k_B * T)\")\n    print(f\"  {mu}: The effective chemical potential\")\n    print(f\"  {M}: The number of identical single-particle states\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Boson Case ---\n    print(\"\\nCase 2: The system consists of BOSONS.\")\n    print(\"For bosons, each state can be occupied by any number of particles.\")\n    print(\"The calculation requires that μ < 0 for the result to be well-defined.\")\n    print(\"The result of the path integral for the partition function Z is:\")\n    # Print the final equation, showing each symbolic component\n    print(f\"  {Z} = ({one} - {exp}({beta} * {mu}))^(-{M})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere the symbols have the same meaning as above.\")\n\npartition_function_calculation()\n```\n<<<The partition function Z depends on particle statistics.
