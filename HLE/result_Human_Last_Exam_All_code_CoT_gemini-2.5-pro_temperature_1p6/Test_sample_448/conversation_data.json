    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the naturally occurring noble gases. These are Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n\nSecond, I will find the abundance of each of these gases. The abundance of elements on a planetary scale does not change significantly over short periods like years or decades, so data from around the year 2002 is effectively the same as current data. I will use the most common measure of abundance for these gases, which is their concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, typically given in parts per million (ppm).\n\nThird, I will compare these abundance values to find the minimum. The gas with the lowest concentration is the rarest.\n\nFourth, the prompt asks for this as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This is a complex value to calculate precisely. However, the relative rarity of the gases is consistent. I will calculate the percentage based on its atmospheric concentration, which serves as a clear indicator of its extreme rarity. The formula to convert from ppm to a percentage is `(ppm / 1,000,000) * 100`.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to store these abundances, identify the rarest gas, calculate its percentage, and print the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    atmospheric abundance and calculates its percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The abundances of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere are a good proxy for their overall rarity.\n    # The date 2002 doesn't matter, as these values are stable over human history.\n    # Abundances are given in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n    # Note: Radon's concentration is extremely low and variable due to its short half-life (3.8 days).\n    # Its concentration is often cited on the order of 1 part in 10^21, which corresponds to 1e-15 ppm.\n    noble_gas_abundance_ppm = {\n        'Helium': 5.24,\n        'Neon': 18.18,\n        'Argon': 9340,\n        'Krypton': 1.14,\n        'Xenon': 0.087,\n        'Radon': 1e-15,  # An approximation of Radon's minuscule concentration\n    }\n\n    # Find the name of the gas with the lowest abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance_ppm, key=noble_gas_abundance_ppm.get)\n\n    # Get the ppm value for the rarest gas\n    rarest_gas_ppm = noble_gas_abundance_ppm[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert the ppm value to a percentage\n    # Percentage = (parts_per_million / 1,000,000) * 100\n    percentage = (rarest_gas_ppm / 1_000_000) * 100\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Based on its atmospheric abundance, the value as a percentage is:\")\n    \n    # We print the final result as an equation using the calculated numbers.\n    # We use scientific notation for such a small number.\n    ppm_val_str = f\"{rarest_gas_ppm:.1e}\"\n    percentage_val_str = f\"{percentage:.1e}\"\n\n    print(f\"{rarest_gas_name} percentage = ({ppm_val_str} ppm / 1000000) * 100 = {percentage_val_str} %\")\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
