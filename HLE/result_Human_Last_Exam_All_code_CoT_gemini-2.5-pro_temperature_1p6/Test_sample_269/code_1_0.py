# The provided Scheme code uses call-with-current-continuation (call/cc)
# to create a complex, non-linear control flow. By tracing the execution,
# we can determine the exact sequence of numbers that will be printed.

# The final output sequence is determined by how the continuation `k`
# is captured and invoked repeatedly.

# This script simply prints the final, deduced output sequence.

# The 'end' parameter is used to print spaces between numbers instead of newlines.
# The final 'print()' adds a newline character at the very end.
