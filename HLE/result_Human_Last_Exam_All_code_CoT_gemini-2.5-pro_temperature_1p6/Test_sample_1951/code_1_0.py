# The incorrect statement is D.
# A, B, C, and E are generally considered correct descriptions when comparing standard
# State Enumeration Graphs (SEGs) with monotonic Logical Attack Graphs (LAGs).
#
# A: Correct. The generation complexity for both graph types is exponential in the worst case.
# B: Correct. SEGs are more expressive and can model non-monotonic actions (e.g., logging out)
#    that standard LAGs cannot.
# C: Correct. The monotonicity assumption is the key factor that allows LAGs to be much
#    more compact than SEGs by avoiding the state-space explosion problem.
# D: Incorrect. Calculating probabilities in graphs with cycles is difficult but not impossible.
#    Techniques from Markov chains (for SEGs) or loopy belief propagation (for LAGs) can be used.
# E: Correct. This is the reason for B's correctness. Standard LAGs handle added facts (monotonicity)
#    but not the removal of facts (negation), whereas SEGs model full state transitions.
