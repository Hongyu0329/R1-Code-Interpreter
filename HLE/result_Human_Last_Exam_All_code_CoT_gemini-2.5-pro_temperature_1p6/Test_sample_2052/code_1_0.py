def solve_matrix_model_questions():
  """
  This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the two-matrix model.
  
  (a) Does superintegrability hold for n = 3?
  The two-matrix model is superintegrable if and only if the potentials for both matrices
  are at most quadratic. For n=3, the potential includes the term (1/3)Tr(Φ₂³), which is cubic.
  Therefore, the model is not superintegrable.

  (b) For n = 4, is the operator W_{-4} necessary?
  The model Z_{-n}(t) is defined by the inclusion of the Tr(Φ₂ⁿ) term in the action.
  In the operator formalism, the operator responsible for introducing this term is precisely W_{-n}.
  These operators for different 'n' are independent generators of the associated W-algebra.
  Thus, W_{-4} is necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t).
