    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\n1.  **Partition Function and Action**: In finite-temperature quantum field theory, the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed as a functional integral over all field configurations. This is done in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate `t` is replaced by an imaginary time `τ = it`. At a finite temperature `T`, this imaginary time is compactified on a circle of circumference `β = 1/T`.\n    The partition function is:\n    `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`\n    where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action.\n\n2.  **Euclidean Action**: For a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action is:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x [ ½(∂_μ ϕ)² + ½m² ϕ² ]`\n    where `d⁴x = dτ d³x`. The metric is Euclidean, so `(∂_μ ϕ)² = (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Operator `D`**: The action can be rewritten using integration by parts. The term `∫ d⁴x (∂_μ ϕ)²` becomes `∫ d⁴x ϕ(-∂²_μ)ϕ`, where `∂²_μ = ∂²_τ + ∇²` is the four-dimensional Laplacian. The surface terms vanish due to periodic boundary conditions in time and fields vanishing at spatial infinity.\n    Thus, the action takes a quadratic form:\n    `S[ϕ] = ½ ∫ d⁴x ϕ (-∂² + m²) ϕ`\n    This can be expressed using an inner product notation `S[ϕ] = ½(ϕ, Dϕ)`, where the operator `D` is `D = -∂² + m²`.\n\n4.  **The Inner Product `(ϕ, Dϕ)`**: The inner product itself is defined as `(A, B) = ∫ d⁴x A(x)B(x)`. Therefore, the expression the user is asking for, `(ϕ, Dϕ)`, is:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) Dϕ(x) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) (-∂² + m²) ϕ(x)`\n    From the previous step, we can see that this is simply twice the free-field action:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = 2 * S[ϕ]`\n\n5.  **Momentum Space Representation**: For concrete calculations, it's more convenient to work in momentum space. Due to the periodicity in Euclidean time `τ`, we use a Fourier series for the time dimension and a Fourier transform for the spatial dimensions.\n    *   A field `ϕ(τ, x)` is expanded as: `ϕ(τ, x) = T Σ_n ∫ (d³k / (2π)³) e^(iω_n τ + i k⋅x) ϕ̃(ω_n, k)`\n    *   The frequencies `ω_n = 2πnT` are called the (bosonic) Matsubara frequencies, where `n` is any integer.\n    *   In this basis, the differential operator `-∂² + m²` becomes `ω_n² + |k|² + m²`.\n    *   The integral over spacetime `∫ d⁴x` becomes a sum over Matsubara frequencies and an integral over momentum `T Σ_n ∫ (d³k / (2π)³)`.\n\n6.  **Final Expression**: By substituting the Fourier expansion into the inner product expression, we arrive at the final form in momentum space:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = T Σ_n ∫ (d³k / (2π)³) (ω_n² + |k|² + m²) |ϕ̃(ω_n, k)|²`\n    This expression represents the sum of contributions from all momentum modes of the field.\n\nThe following Python code will print this result and its components clearly.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ) in finite-temperature field theory\n    and explains its components.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the formula as strings for display\n    temperature_factor = \"T\"\n    summation = \"Σ_{n=-∞ to ∞}\"\n    integration = \"∫ d³k / (2π)³\"\n    propagator_inverse = \"(ω_n² + |k|² + m²)\"\n    field_fourier_mode = \"|ϕ̃(ω_n, k)|²\"\n    matsubara_frequency_def = \"ω_n = 2πnT\"\n\n    # Assemble the final formula string\n    formula = (\n        f\"{temperature_factor} {summation} {integration} \"\n        f\"{propagator_inverse} * {field_fourier_mode}\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ)\")\n    print(\"is twice the free-field action, S_free[ϕ].
