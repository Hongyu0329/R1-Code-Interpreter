    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the specific manuscript in which the poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved. The poem, written by Thomas Chestre, survives in only one manuscript.\n\nSecond, I will research the contents of this manuscript to find which other texts it contains. These manuscripts were often miscellanies, or collections of different works bound together.\n\nThird, I will identify the specific text within that manuscript that is considered a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores the title of this book of manners in a variable and then prints it to the user as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_companion_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the title of the book of manners\n    that was preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n    # This manuscript contains several Middle English texts, including a courtesy poem,\n    # which is a type of book of manners.\n    \n    book_title = \"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\"\n    \n    print(\"The Middle English poem 'Sir Launfal' is preserved in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\")\n    print(\"Alongside it is a book of manners, or a courtesy poem, known as:\")\n    print(book_title)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_companion_book()\n```\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What book of manners was Sir Launfal preserved alongside?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
