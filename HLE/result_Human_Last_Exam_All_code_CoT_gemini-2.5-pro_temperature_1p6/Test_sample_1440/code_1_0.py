    print("Any other point y in S is connected to 'a' by an arc that lies entirely in S. This arc is a proper subcontinuum and has no interior in X, so it's nowhere dense. Thus, all points in S are equivalent to 'a'.")
    print("A point in L cannot be equivalent to 'a' because any continuum containing them would be the whole space X, which is not nowhere dense.")
