    "In this task, we need to determine which word from the provided list was not used in a rhyme by Chaucer in \"The Book of the Duchess.\" A word cannot be part of a rhyme in a text if it does not appear in the text at all. Therefore, the most straightforward approach is to check for the presence of each word from the answer choices within the poem's text.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python script to download the complete text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  The script will then take the list of potential answers: \"Wente\", \"Here\", \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\".\n3.  It will iterate through this list. For each word, it will perform a case-insensitive search to see if the word exists anywhere in the downloaded text. To ensure accuracy, the search will look for whole words only (e.g., it will find \"here\" but not as a part of \"there\").\n4.  The script will print whether each word was found or not, and the first word that isn't found in the text is our answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_unrhymed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds which word from a list does not appear in Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\".\n    A word cannot be rhymed if it's not in the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the plain text of \"Book of the Duchess\" from Project Gutenberg\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2247/pg2247.txt\"\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the text file: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Wente\",\n        'B': \"Here\",\n        'C': \"Fool\",\n        'D': \"Hool\",\n        'E': \"Countour\"\n    }\n\n    not_found_word_choice = None\n    not_found_word = \"\"\n\n    print(\"Checking for the presence of each word in 'The Book of the Duchess':\\n\")\n\n    for choice_key, word in choices.items():\n        # Use regex to find the whole word, case-insensitively.\n        # \\b ensures we match whole words only.\n        pattern = r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b'\n        if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):\n            print(f\"Result for '{word}': Found in the text.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Result for '{word}': NOT found in the text.\")\n            if not_found_word_choice is None:\n                not_found_word_choice = choice_key\n                not_found_word = word\n    \n    if not_found_word_choice:\n        print(f\"\\nThe word '{not_found_word}' is not in the text, so Chaucer could not have made a rhyme with it.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nAll words were found in the text. The analysis might require phonetic checks.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_unrhymed_word()\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
