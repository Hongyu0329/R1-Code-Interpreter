The correct option is B because the pose described is the same in both ballet schools, just numbered differently.

Analysis of Option B: First arabesque (RBS) vs. Third arabesque (Vaganova)

- Arabesque is a pose on one leg with the other leg extended behind. The arms determine the type.
- Royal Ballet School (First arabesque): The arm on the same side as the supporting leg is forward, and the other arm is to the side.
- Vaganova Academy (Third arabesque): The arm on the same side as the supporting leg is forward, and the other arm is to the side.

Conclusion: The positions are identical.

---------------------------------
Why other options are incorrect:
A. 'Fifth position' is for the feet; 'third position in arms' is for the arms. They are not comparable.
C. 'Assemblé' and 'brisé' are two distinct types of jumps in all ballet methods.
D. 'En dedan' (inward) and 'en dehors' (outward) describe opposite directions of a turn.
E. A 'temps levé' is a hop on one foot. A 'sissonne' is a jump from two feet landing on one. They are different steps.
