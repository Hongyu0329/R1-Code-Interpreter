    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem and generate the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` is 1. As it's an electron, its spin angular momentum quantum number `s` is 1/2.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by the vector addition of `L` and `S`. The possible values of `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   So, the possible `j` values are 1/2 and 3/2.\n3.  **Determine Z-Component of Total Angular Momentum (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n    *   For `j = 3/2`, `m_j` can be `-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2`.\n    *   For `j = 1/2`, `m_j` can be `-1/2, 1/2`.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ have a common set of eigenstates, denoted as `|j, m_j>`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J_z$ is `ħ * m_j`.\n    *   For simplicity and by convention, we'll set `ħ = 1`. The eigenvalues become `j * (j + 1)` and `m_j`, respectively.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the `l` and `s` values.\n    *   Calculates the possible `j` values.\n    *   Loops through each `j` and its corresponding `m_j` values.\n    *   Calculates and prints the eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ for each common eigenstate.\n    *   Uses the `fractions` module to display the quantum numbers and eigenvalues as neat fractions.\n    *   Prints the final eigenvalue equations `J^2|j, m_j> = ...` and `J_z|j, m_j> = ...` for each state.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Explain the setup\nprint(\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\nprint(\"A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1.\")\nprint(\"An electron has spin angular momentum quantum number s=1/2.\")\nprint(\"We will work in units where ħ = 1.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Step 2: Define quantum numbers\nl = 1\ns = 0.5\n\n# Step 3: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j\n# j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\nj_values = [abs(l - s), l + s]\n\nprint(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Loop through each possible j value to find the eigenvalues\nfor j in j_values:\n    # Eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)\n    j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n    \n    # Possible values for m_j, the z-component of J, range from -j to j in steps of 1\n    # Generate m_j values from -j to j\n    num_mj_steps = int(2 * j + 1)\n    mj_values = [-j + i for i in range(num_mj_steps)]\n    \n    j_frac = Fraction(j)\n    j2_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(j2_eigenvalue)\n\n    print(f\"For the case j = {j_frac}:\")\n    print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as j*(j+1):\")\n    print(f\"  J^2 eigenvalue = {j_frac} * ({j_frac} + 1) = {j2_eigenvalue_frac}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe corresponding common eigenstates |j, m_j> have the following J^2 and J_z eigenvalues:\")\n    \n    # Loop through all possible m_j values for the given j\n    for mj in mj_values:\n        # Eigenvalue of J_z is m_j\n        jz_eigenvalue = mj\n        \n        mj_frac = Fraction(mj)\n        jz_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(jz_eigenvalue)\n        \n        print(f\"  For state |j={j_frac}, m_j={mj_frac}>:\")\n        # Final eigenvalue equations\n        print(f\"    J^2 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {j2_eigenvalue_frac} |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\")\n        print(f\"    J_z |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {jz_eigenvalue_frac} |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\")\n        \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n```\n<<<The sets of (J^2 eigenvalue, J_z eigenvalue) are: For j=3/2: {(15/4, 3/2), (15/4, 1/2), (15/4, -1/2), (15/4, -3/2)}.
