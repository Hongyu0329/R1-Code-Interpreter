    This function identifies the correct statements and prints the final answer choice.
    
    Statement I is plausible from the perspective of an individual who misuses the drug by injection.
    Statement II is clinically accurate for specific populations like pregnant women.
    Statement III is clinically accurate for patients taking the medication as prescribed.
    Statement IV is incorrect as the safety profiles are well-understood.
    Statement V contains a factual error regarding naloxone.
    
    Therefore, statements I, II, and III are the ones supported by evidence.

    # The statements supported by evidence are I, II, and III.
    # I: Perspective of misuse (injecting Suboxone is "less safe" for the user as it induces withdrawal).
    # II: Perspective of special populations (Subutex is safer for pregnant patients).
    # III: Perspective of prescribed use (both have similar safety when taken sublingually).
    # This corresponds to option B.
