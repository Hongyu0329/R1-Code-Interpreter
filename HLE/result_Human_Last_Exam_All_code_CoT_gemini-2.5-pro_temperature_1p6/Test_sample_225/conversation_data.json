    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. Lissajous curves are a family of curves described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A*sin(a*t + δ)` and `y(t) = B*sin(b*t)`. In our case, `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and `δ=π/2` (since `cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)`).\n\n2.  **Use the Standard Formula:** For Lissajous curves where `a` and `b` are coprime integers (integers with no common divisors other than 1), there are established formulas to calculate the number of self-intersection points. Since `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, we can use the specific formula for when `a` and `b` are both odd.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** The formula for the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve `(cos(at), sin(bt))` where `a` and `b` are odd coprime integers is:\n    `Number of intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We substitute `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula. This calculation can be implemented in a simple Python script. The script will show each step of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of self-intersection points\n    for a Lissajous curve with parameters a=9 and b=5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the curve equations x=cos(at), y=sin(bt)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # Check if the conditions for the formula are met.\n    # a and b should be coprime and both odd.\n    if math.gcd(a, b) == 1 and a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:\n        # The formula for the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve\n        # where a and b are odd coprime integers.\n        intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) // 2\n\n        print(f\"The curve is a Lissajous curve with parameters a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n        print(\"The number of self-intersection points is found using the formula:\")\n        print(\"N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {a-1} * {b-1} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {(a-1)*(b-1)} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {intersections}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The standard formula does not apply for the given a and b.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
