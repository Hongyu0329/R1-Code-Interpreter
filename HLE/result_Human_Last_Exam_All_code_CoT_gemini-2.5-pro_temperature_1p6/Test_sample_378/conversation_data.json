    "Based on my research, there seems to be a confusion of names. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identifying himself as such.\n\nTherefore, since this event never occurred, I cannot provide a year. The python script below will clarify this.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks for the public identification of Goodluck Jonathan as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    president_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    historical_figure_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n    \n    # Information based on publicly available records.\n    # There is no record of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan identifying as Azikiwe.\n    # The name 'Azikiwe' belongs to Nigeria's first president.\n    \n    print(f\"Fact Check:\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the former president in question is {president_name}.\")\n    print(f\"{historical_figure_name} was a different person, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: There is no record of a year when Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe, as this event did not happen.\")\n\ncheck_name_identity()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as this is not part of his name.>>>"
