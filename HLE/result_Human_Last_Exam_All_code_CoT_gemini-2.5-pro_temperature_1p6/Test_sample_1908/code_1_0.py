    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have.

    Let X be a set with cardinality c (the continuum).
    Let T be a non-trivial, non-discrete topology on X.
    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {emptyset, X}.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of complements S that T can have.

    - According to a theorem by P. Bankston, for any non-discrete T1 topology on an infinite set of cardinality k,
      the number of complements is at least 2^k.
      For k = c, this number is at least 2^c.

    - According to a result by W.J.R. Mitchell, the cofinite topology on a set of cardinality k has exactly 2^k complements.
      The cofinite topology on a set of size c is a valid T1 topology.
      This means that the minimum number of complements for a T1 topology is exactly 2^c.

    - For non-T1 topologies, the number of complements can be even larger. For instance, the "included-point"
      topology on a set of size c has 2^(2^c) complements.

    Therefore, the smallest possible number of complements is 2^c.
