    This function solves the problem about topological groups on the integers.

    The problem asks for the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z)
    with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    Let's break down the properties:
    1.  A totally bounded group topology on Z must be precompact, meaning its completion is a compact group K.
    2.  The problem implicitly assumes the topology is Hausdorff (otherwise, limits are not unique, and the question is ill-posed). For a Hausdorff topology, Z embeds injectively as a dense subgroup of K.
    3.  "No nontrivial convergent sequences" implies the topology is a P-space (countable intersections of open sets are open).
    4.  If a dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is a P-space, the entire space must be a P-space. So, the completion K must be a P-space.
    5.  A compact Hausdorff P-space must be finite. A simple proof is that in a P-space, singleton sets {x} are open (as they are G-delta sets in a Hausdorff space), so the topology is discrete. A compact discrete space is finite.
    6.  So, the completion K of Z must be a finite group.
    7.  This leads to a contradiction: the infinite set Z cannot be injectively embedded into a finite group K.

    Therefore, no such topology exists. The number is 0.
