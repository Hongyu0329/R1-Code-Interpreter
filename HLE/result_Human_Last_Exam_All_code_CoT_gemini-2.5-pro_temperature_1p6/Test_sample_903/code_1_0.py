# Based on the chemical analysis, we can determine the atoms coordinated to the Zinc center.

# 1. The ligand 1,3-Di[3-(2â€™-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene
#    is a tetradentate N4 ligand, providing four Nitrogen donor atoms.
donors_from_ligand = ["N", "N", "N", "N"]

# 2. The reactant ZnBr2 provides the Zn(II) center and two Bromide ions,
#    which can act as ligands.
donors_from_salt = ["Br", "Br"]

# 3. Zinc(II) commonly forms 6-coordinate complexes. In this case, it will form
#    a stable, neutral complex by coordinating with the tetradentate N4 ligand
#    and the two bromide anions.
coordinated_atoms = donors_from_ligand + donors_from_salt

# The final list of atoms coordinated to the Zn center is:
print("Coordinated atoms to the Zn center:")
# We use a sorted list for clarity, matching the format in the answer choices.
print(', '.join(sorted(coordinated_atoms)))
