    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can perform an exhaustive search. I will write a Python script to accomplish this.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Let the set be $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. A binary operation is a function that takes two elements from $S$ and returns one element from $S$. We can represent any operation using a 3x3 Cayley table.\n2.  The **commutative property** ($x*y = y*x$) implies that the Cayley table is symmetric about its main diagonal. This significantly reduces the number of operations we need to check. We only need to define the 6 entries on and above the diagonal. For each of these 6 entries, there are 3 possible outcomes (0, 1, or 2). This gives a total of $3^6 = 729$ unique commutative operations.\n3.  The **associative property** ($(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)$) must hold for all possible choices of $x, y, z$ from the set $S$. There are $3^3 = 27$ such combinations to verify for each operation.\n4.  The script will iterate through all 729 commutative operations. For each one, it will construct the full Cayley table and then check if the associative property holds for all 27 cases.\n5.  A counter will keep track of how many operations satisfy both properties. The final count will be the answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = list(range(n))\n\n    # For a commutative operation, the Cayley table is symmetric.\n    # We only need to define the values for the upper triangle including the diagonal.\n    # The number of such entries is n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    num_choices = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # Total number of commutative operations is n^(number of choices).\n    total_commutative_ops = n ** num_choices\n\n    # Number of associativity equations to check for each operation is n^3.\n    num_associativity_checks = n ** 3\n    \n    print(f\"Let the set be S = {{0, 1, 2}}.
