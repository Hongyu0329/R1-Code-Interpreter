# Step 1: Define the key information from the scenario.
lesion_hemisphere = "right"
lesion_location_detail = "optic radiation, outside Meyer's loop"
behavior_action = "accurately reaches for target in lower left"
behavior_awareness = "signals 'no stimulus' for the same target"

# Step 2: Analyze the anatomical impact of the lesion.
print("--- Anatomical Analysis ---")
print(f"A lesion in the {lesion_hemisphere} hemisphere affects the contralateral (left) visual field.")
print(f"The optic radiation carries visual information to the cortex.")
print(f"Meyer's loop carries info from the SUPERIOR visual field.")
print(f"The lesion is outside Meyer's loop, affecting the fibers that carry info from the INFERIOR visual field.")
print("Conclusion 1: The lesion causes a visual field defect in the LOWER LEFT quadrant.\n")

# Step 3: Analyze the behavioral observations.
print("--- Behavioral Analysis ---")
print(f"Observation 1: The primate '{behavior_action}'. This indicates that the location of the stimulus is being processed, likely by subcortical pathways, allowing for a correct motor response.")
print(f"Observation 2: The primate '{behavior_awareness}'. This indicates a lack of conscious visual perception of the stimulus, as this processing occurs in the visual cortex, which is damaged.")
print("Conclusion 2: The ability to respond to a visual stimulus without consciously perceiving it is the definition of blindsight.\n")

# Step 4: Synthesize the analysis to determine the final answer.
print("--- Synthesis ---")
print("The primate is demonstrating blindsight specifically in the area of its visual field defect.")
print("Based on the anatomical analysis, this defect is in the lower left quadrant.")
print("Therefore, the primate demonstrates blindsight for stimuli in the lower left quadrant.")

# Step 5: State the final answer choice.
