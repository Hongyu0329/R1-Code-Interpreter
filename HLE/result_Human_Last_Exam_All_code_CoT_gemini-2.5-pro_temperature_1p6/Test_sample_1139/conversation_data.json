    "To determine the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model in question, we need to find the dimension of the bosonic part of its target space.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the correct mathematical object**: For disordered systems of symmetry class D with `N` replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the symmetric superspace `G/H = O(2N|2N) / (O(N|N) x O(N|N))`.\n2.  **Find the number of bosonic variables**: This number corresponds to the dimension of the bosonic part of the space `G/H`. This can be calculated by taking the difference between the number of bosonic generators of the group `G` and the subgroup `H`.\n3.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bosonic parts**:\n    *   The Lie superalgebra for `G = O(2N|2N)` is `o(2N|2N)`. Its bosonic part is `o(2N) ⊕ o(2N)`.\n    *   The Lie superalgebra for `H = O(N|N) x O(N|N)` is `o(N|N) ⊕ o(N|N)`. Its bosonic part is `o(N) ⊕ o(N) ⊕ o(N) ⊕ o(N)`.\n    *   The dimension of an orthogonal Lie algebra `o(k)` is `k(k-1)/2`.\n4.  **Execute the calculation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations for the given number of replicas, `N=2`, and print out the steps and the final resulting equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Number of replicas\nN = 2\n\n# --- Introduction and setup ---\nprint(f\"Calculating the number of bosonic variables for a sigma-model of class D with N = {N} replicas.\")\nprint(\"The target superspace is G/H where G = O(2N|2N) and H = O(N|N) x O(N|N).\")\nprint(\"The number of variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of G/H.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate bosonic dimension of G = O(2N|2N) ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Find the dimension of the bosonic part of G = O(2N|2N).\")\nprint(\"The bosonic subalgebra of o(2N|2N) is o(2N) + o(2N).\")\nk_G = 2 * N\ndim_o_kG = k_G * (k_G - 1) // 2\ndim_bos_G = 2 * dim_o_kG\nprint(f\"The dimension of o(k) is k(k-1)/2.\")\nprint(f\"For G, k = 2*N = {k_G}.\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of o({k_G}) = {k_G}*({k_G}-1)/2 = {dim_o_kG}.\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of G's bosonic part = 2 * dim(o({k_G})) = 2 * {dim_o_kG} = {dim_bos_G}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate bosonic dimension of H = O(N|N) x O(N|N) ---\nprint(\"Step 2: Find the dimension of the bosonic part of H = O(N|N) x O(N|N).\")\nprint(\"The bosonic subalgebra of o(N|N)+o(N|N) is o(N)+o(N)+o(N)+o(N).\")\nk_H = N\ndim_o_kH = k_H * (k_H - 1) // 2\ndim_bos_H = 4 * dim_o_kH\nprint(f\"For each component of H, k = N = {k_H}.\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of o({k_H}) = {k_H}*({k_H}-1)/2 = {dim_o_kH}.\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of H's bosonic part = 4 * dim(o({k_H})) = 4 * {dim_o_kH} = {dim_bos_H}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the final number of variables ---\nprint(\"Step 3: Subtract the dimensions to find the number of variables.\")\nnum_variables = dim_bos_G - dim_bos_H\nprint(f\"Number of bosonic variables = dim_bos(G) - dim_bos(H)\")\n\n# --- Final Answer Output ---\n# This part is specifically for the final display.\nfinal_equation = f\"{dim_bos_G} - {dim_bos_H} = {num_variables}\"\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(final_equation)\n\n# --- End of calculation ---\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput_str = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output to the actual console\nprint(output_str)\n\n# Extract the final numeric answer for the <<<...>>> format\nfinal_answer_value = num_variables\nprint(f'<<<{final_answer_value}>>>')\n```"
