    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Decode the Value of S:** The variable `S` is given as `SNYWR`. Based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard, these letters correspond to digits. I will map these letters to their corresponding numbers to find the value of S.\n    *   'S' is above '3'\n    *   'N' is above '6'\n    *   'Y' is above '6'\n    *   'W' is above '2'\n    *   'R' is above '4'\n    So, `S = 36624`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Geometric Condition:** The problem describes a triangle ABC with given side `BC`, angle `B`, and asks for the number of integer values of side `AC` that would lead to two possible values for side `AB`. This is the classic \"Ambiguous Case\" of the Law of Sines (Side-Side-Angle or SSA). For two distinct triangles to be possible, the length of the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be strictly greater than the triangle's altitude from the third vertex (`A`) and strictly less than the length of the other given side (`BC`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Inequality:** Let `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `∠B = 30°`. The altitude `h` from vertex `A` to the line containing side `BC` is given by `h = c * sin(B)`, which is not helpful. Let's use the altitude from C to AB. A better way is using the condition derived from the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.\n\n    The condition for two possible triangles is: `a * sin(B) < b < a`.\n    *   `a = BC = S = 36624`\n    *   `∠B = 30°`, so `sin(B) = sin(30°) = 0.5`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bounds:**\n    *   Lower bound: `BC * sin(30°) = 36624 * 0.5 = 18312`.\n    *   Upper bound: `BC = 36624`.\n    *   Therefore, the length of `AC` must satisfy the inequality `18312 < AC < 36624`.\n\n5.  **Count the Integers:** The problem asks for the number of *integer* values for `AC`. I will count the number of integers between 18312 and 36624 (exclusive). The formula for the number of integers in an interval `(x, y)` is `y - x - 1`.\n\n6.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result along with the final equation used for the count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of integer values for side AC for which there are \n    two possible triangles ABC, given BC and angle B.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Decode the value of S from SNYWR\n    # S=3, N=6, Y=6, W=2, R=4\n    s_value = 36624\n    \n    # Step 2: Assign the given parameters\n    bc_length = s_value\n    angle_b_degrees = 30\n    \n    # Step 3: Formulate the inequality for the ambiguous case (SSA)\n    # The condition for two possible triangles is: BC * sin(B) < AC < BC\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the lower and upper bounds for AC's length\n    # sin(30 degrees) is exactly 0.5\n    lower_bound = bc_length * math.sin(math.radians(angle_b_degrees))\n    upper_bound = bc_length\n    \n    # We need to count the number of integers AC such that:\n    # lower_bound < AC < upper_bound\n    # Note: Since lower_bound is an integer, the smallest integer value for AC\n    # is lower_bound + 1.
