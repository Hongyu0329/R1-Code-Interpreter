def solve_chemistry_problem():
    """
    Solves the chemistry problem by identifying the metal and reaction equation.
    
    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1. Hypothesize a comproportionation reaction: M(s) + 2MCl3(aq) -> 3MCl2(aq),
       where 'M' is the unknown metal. This fits the problem's constraints:
       - Plate of metal 'A' is M.
       - A's chloride is divalent (MCl2).
       - In this reaction, the plate mass only decreases (no deposition).
    2. Use the given mass decrease (0.172 g) and initial salt mass (1 g) to
       set up a stoichiometric equation to solve for the molar mass of M (M_M).
       - n_M_dissolved = 0.172 / M_M
       - n_MCl3_initial = 1 / (M_M + 3 * 35.5)
       - From stoichiometry: n_M_dissolved = 0.5 * n_MCl3_initial
    3. Solve the equation for M_M.
    4. Identify the metal by comparing M_M to the periodic table.
    5. Verify the result with the final concentration data (this step is done
       internally in the logic but not required for the final printout).
    6. Print the identified metal and the balanced chemical equation.
