    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define \"Historical Saint\":** First, I will clarify the term \"historical saint.\" For this task, I will define it as a post-biblical figure who has been canonized or is widely venerated as a saint within Christian traditions. This excludes biblical figures like Moses or David, as well as angels like Michael, who are sometimes referred to as saints but belong to a different category. Milton's work focuses almost exclusively on biblical narratives.\n\n2.  **Acquire the Text:** I will write a Python script that programmatically fetches the complete plain text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost* from the Project Gutenberg website.\n\n3.  **Create a Search List:** I will compile a list of prominent historical saints' names to search for within the text. This list will include well-known figures like Augustine, Francis, Patrick, and Aquinas.\n\n4.  **Perform the Search:** The script will iterate through the list of saints and search for each name (case-insensitively) within the text of the poem.\n\n5.  **Count and Report:** The script will keep a count of how many distinct saints' names are found. It will then print the list of found names (if any), the total count, and a final equation representing this count, as requested.\n\nBased on literary analysis, Milton, as a 17th-century Protestant, was unlikely to mention post-biblical saints in a laudatory way, as the veneration of saints was a practice he associated with the Catholic Church, which he heavily criticized. Therefore, the expected result is zero. The code will serve to verify this.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script downloads Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and searches for mentions of\n    historical, post-biblical saints by name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
