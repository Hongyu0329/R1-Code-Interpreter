    Solves the probability problem about a complex-valued Brownian motion.

    The solution proceeds with the following steps:
    1.  The process X_t is identified as a transient diffusion in the complex plane, meaning |X_t| -> infinity as t -> infinity. This is due to the h-transform with h(z)=ln|z|, which induces a persistent outward drift.
    2.  The quantity V_n is the proportion of the area of a disk B_n covered by the Wiener sausage of radius 1 generated by X_t. The disk B_n is centered at n on the real axis and has a radius of n/3. As n -> infinity, B_n moves to infinity.
    3.  We analyze the limit of the expectation E[V_n]. By Fubini's theorem, E[V_n] is the average probability that a point x in B_n is covered by the sausage.
    4.  The probability of being covered, P(x in S), is the probability that the path of X_t, starting at some z_0, hits the unit disk centered at x.
    5.  Since X_t is transient, the probability of hitting any finite remote region D(x, 1) tends to 0 as the region's center x moves to infinity.
    6.  As n -> infinity, the disk B_n moves to infinity. Therefore, the average hitting probability over B_n, which is E[V_n], must tend to 0.
    7.  V_n is a non-negative random variable. By Markov's inequality, for any constant a > 0, P(V_n >= a) <= E[V_n] / a.
    8.  With a = 2/3, we have P(V_n > 2/3) <= E[V_n] / (2/3). Since E[V_n] -> 0, the probability P(V_n > 2/3) must also tend to 0.
