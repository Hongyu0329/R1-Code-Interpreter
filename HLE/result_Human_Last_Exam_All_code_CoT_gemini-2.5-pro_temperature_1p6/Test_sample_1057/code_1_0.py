    This function explains and prints the formula for the Joule heat

    # --- Explanation ---
    # The problem asks for the total Joule heat dissipated when a charged sphere
    # leaks its charge and shrinks to zero radius.
    #
    # 1. The initial electrostatic potential energy (U) of a sphere with radius 'a'
    #    charged to a potential 'V' is U = (1/2) * C * V^2, where C is the capacitance.
    #
    # 2. The capacitance (C) of an isolated sphere is C = 4 * pi * epsilon_0 * a.
    #
    # 3. Substituting C, the initial energy is U = (1/2) * (4 * pi * epsilon_0 * a) * V^2.
    #    This simplifies to U = 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * a * V^2.
    #
    # 4. By conservation of energy, this initial stored energy is completely converted
    #    into Joule heat (H) as the sphere's charge and radius go to zero.
    #
    # Therefore, the final formula for the dissipated heat is H = 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * a * V^2.
