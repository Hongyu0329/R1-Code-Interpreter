#
# This script analyzes the causal path diagram to determine the most likely signs for each path.
#

# --- Variable Definitions ---
# C: Nectar caffeine concentration
# F: Flower level foraging duration
# R: Pollinator retention
# Y: Total yield

# --- Path Analysis ---

# Path a: C -> F (Effect of Caffeine on Foraging Duration)
# Reasoning: Caffeine is a stimulant that enhances reward memory, making pollinators spend MORE time on the flower.
# A higher C leads to a higher F.
path_a_sign = '+'

# Path b: F -> Y (Effect of Foraging Duration on Yield)
# Reasoning: Longer foraging duration on a flower leads to better pollination for that flower, increasing fruit set and yield.
# A higher F leads to a higher Y.
path_b_sign = '+'

# Path c: C -> R (Effect of Caffeine on Pollinator Retention)
# Reasoning: Caffeine's memory-enhancing properties make pollinators more loyal, increasing their retention rate.
# A higher C leads to a higher R.
path_c_sign = '+'

# Path d: R -> Y (Effect of Pollinator Retention on Yield)
# Reasoning: Higher pollinator retention means more visits to the plant over time, leading to more overall pollination.
# A higher R leads to a higher Y.
path_d_sign = '+'

# Path e: C -> Y (Direct effect of Caffeine on Yield)
# Reasoning: Caffeine can act as a defense against herbivores/pests. This protection has a direct positive effect on yield
# that likely outweighs the metabolic cost of producing it.
# A higher C leads to a higher Y.
path_e_sign = '+'

# --- Output the results ---
