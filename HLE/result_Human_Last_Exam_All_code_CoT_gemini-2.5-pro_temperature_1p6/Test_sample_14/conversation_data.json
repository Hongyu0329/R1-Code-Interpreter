    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the unit you're looking for.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The request is for a flying unit in the game \"Beyond All Reason\" (BAR) that meets three criteria:\n    *   It is built from a Tier 1 (T1) building.\n    *   It can shoot.\n    *   Its shots can stun enemy targets.\n2.  **Scan Faction Rosters:** I will go through the T1 air units for the two main factions, ARM and CORTEX.\n    *   **CORTEX T1 Air:** Shadow (fighter), Scorcher (bomber), Liche (gunship). The Liche gunship deals area-of-effect damage with rockets but does not stun.\n    *   **ARM T1 Air:** Freedom Fighter (fighter), Thunder (bomber), Hawk (gunship). The Hawk gunship is equipped with a laser that has a paralyzing effect, effectively stunning units it hits.\n3.  **Identify the Unit:** The ARM Hawk is the unit that matches all the criteria.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that declares the variables for the Tier, Unit Name, and Ability, and then prints the answer in a clear, formatted way, including a final \"equation\" line to meet the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef find_stunning_t1_flyer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the T1 flying unit in BAR that can stun enemies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the characteristics of the unit based on game knowledge.\n    unit_tier = 1\n    unit_name = \"Hawk\"\n    unit_faction = \"ARM\"\n    unit_ability = \"Stun/Paralyze\"\n\n    print(f\"The flying unit from a Tier {unit_tier} building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemies is the {unit_faction} {unit_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis unit is a gunship known for its ability to paralyze enemy units with its laser weapon, making them unable to move or fire.\")\n\n    # Fulfilling the request to show each part of the \"final equation\".\n    print(\"\\n--- Answer Breakdown ---\")\n    print(f'Tier({unit_tier}) + Unit(\"{unit_name}\") = Ability(\"{unit_ability}\")')\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_stunning_t1_flyer()\n```\n<<<Hawk>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which flying unit from 1 tier building in BAR can shoot and stun enemy targets? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
