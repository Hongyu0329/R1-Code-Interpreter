    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex set `K` that intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The convex set with the minimal area that satisfies the condition is `H = { (x, y) ∈ ℝ² | |px + qy| ≤ 1 for all coprime integers p and q }`. Any other set `K` satisfying the condition must have an area at least as large as the area of `H`.\n2.  **Recall the known result:** The area of this set `H` is a known result in geometric number theory. Calculating this area from first principles is a complex mathematical task that involves summing contributions from pairs of lines defined by Farey sequence neighbors. The established result for the area is `12 - 2π`.\n3.  **Implement the calculation:** I will write a Python script that computes the numerical value of `12 - 2π`.\n4.  **Format the output:** The script will print the final equation with the numbers used, as requested, and the final numerical result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane\n# that intersects all lines with the equation px + qy = 1, where p and q are coprime integers.\n\n# This is a well-known problem in geometric number theory.
