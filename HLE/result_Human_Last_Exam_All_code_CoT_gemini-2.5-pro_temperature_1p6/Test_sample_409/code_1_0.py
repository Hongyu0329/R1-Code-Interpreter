# Plan: We need to determine the minimal cohomology degree at which
# non-trivial extensions and obstructions become significant in semi-abelian categories.
# We will model the degrees at which these concepts appear and find the minimum.

# Step 1: Define the cohomology degrees for key phenomena.

# H^1 classifies derivations and complements. It does not classify general extensions.
degree_derivations = 1

# H^2 classifies extensions of an object B by a module A.
# A non-zero element in H^2 corresponds to a non-trivial (non-split) extension.
# This non-zero element is also the obstruction to the splitting of the extension.
degree_extensions_and_obstructions_to_splitting = 2

# H^3 classifies obstructions to the existence of certain extensions, a more complex problem.
degree_obstructions_to_extension_existence = 3

# Step 2: Determine the minimal degree asked for by the question.
# The question asks for the minimal degree where *non-trivial extensions* and *obstructions*
# are significant. Degree 2 is the first level where we classify non-trivial extensions
# and encounter the direct obstruction to them being trivial (i.e., splitting).
# Therefore, this is the minimal significant degree for the question.

minimal_significant_degree = min(
    degree_extensions_and_obstructions_to_splitting,
    degree_obstructions_to_extension_existence
)

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final answer.
print("In categorical cohomology (like for semi-abelian categories):")
print(f"H^1 (Degree {degree_derivations}): Classifies derivations.")
print(f"H^2 (Degree {degree_extensions_and_obstructions_to_splitting}): Classifies extensions AND obstructions to splitting those extensions.")
print(f"H^3 (Degree {degree_obstructions_to_extension_existence}): Classifies obstructions to the existence of more complex extensions.")
print("\nThe minimal degree at which non-trivial extensions and their direct obstructions become significant is 2.")
print("\nFinal Answer Equation:")

# The final equation is `minimal_significant_degree = 2`.
# The following line prints each part of this conceptual equation,
# including the number `2` as requested.
