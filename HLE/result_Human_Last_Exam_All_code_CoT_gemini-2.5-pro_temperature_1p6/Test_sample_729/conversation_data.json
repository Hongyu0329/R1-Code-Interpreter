    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group belongs to the family of groups $Q_{4n}$, defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. For $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, which means $n = 32$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Power Subgroups:** The number of power subgroups in $Q_{4n}$ depends on whether $n$ is even or odd. The set of power subgroups is known to be:\n    *   $\\{Q_{4n}\\} \\cup \\{\\langle x^d \\rangle \\mid d \\text{ is an even divisor of } 2n\\}$, if $n$ is even.\n    *   $\\{Q_{4n}\\} \\cup \\{\\langle x^d \\rangle \\mid d \\text{ divides } n \\}$, if $n$ is odd.\n\n3.  **Apply the Correct Formula:** Since $n = 32$ is even, we use the first formula. The power subgroups are the group $Q_{128}$ itself, plus all unique cyclic subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is an even divisor of $2n$. In our case, $2n = 2 \\times 32 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** The task simplifies to counting the number of even divisors of 64 and adding 1 (for the group $Q_{128}$ itself).\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Calculate the value of $2n=64$.\n    *   Find all divisors of 64.\n    *   Filter this list to keep only the even divisors.\n    *   Count the number of even divisors.\n    *   Add 1 to this count to get the total number of power subgroups and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_{group_order}.\")\n\n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_4n, the order is 4n.\n    # From the group order, we find n.\n    n = group_order // 4\n    print(f\"The group Q_{group_order} is of the form Q_4n, which gives n = {group_order} / 4 = {n}.\")\n\n    # The formula for the number of power subgroups depends on the parity of n.\n    # Since n=32 is even, the power subgroups are Q_4n itself and the cyclic subgroups <x^d>\n    # where d is an even divisor of 2n.\n    print(f\"Since n = {n} is even, the power subgroups consist of two types:\")\n    print(f\"1.
