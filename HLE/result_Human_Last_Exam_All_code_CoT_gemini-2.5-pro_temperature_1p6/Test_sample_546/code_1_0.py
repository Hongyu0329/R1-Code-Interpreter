# The problem simplifies to calculating 2**81, regardless of the value of p.
# My step-by-step derivation shows that the complicated expression for f(p)
# simplifies to a constant value.
# The final equation is f(p) = 2**81.
# Here is the calculation of this value.

result = 2**81
# The prompt requires to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is result = 2**81
print(f"2 ** 81 = {result}")
