    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use a known theorem from algebraic graph theory. A direct computational approach is infeasible due to the immense size of the graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the graph type:** The graph is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph with partitions of equal size.\n2.  **Recall the definition (optional but good for context):** The Alon-Tarsi number $AT(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there is an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that the out-degree of every vertex is less than $k$, and the number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $D$.\n3.  **Apply the established theorem:** There is a well-known result for the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs, $K_{n,m}$:\n    *   If the partitions have different sizes ($n \\neq m$), then $AT(K_{n,m}) = 2$.\n    *   If the partitions have the same size ($n = m$) and this size is at least 2, then $AT(K_{n,n}) = 3$.\n4.  **Solve for the specific case:** In our problem, we have $K_{1000,1000}$. Here, $n = 1000$ and $m = 1000$. Since $n=m$ and $1000 \\ge 2$, the theorem directly implies that the Alon-Tarsi number is 3.\n5.  **Create the script:** The Python code below will implement this theorem to provide the answer. It will define a function that calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for any $K_{n,m}$ and then use it for the specific case of $n=1000, m=1000$.\n\n```python\ndef get_alon_tarsi_number_for_K_nm(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_n,m\n    based on a known mathematical theorem.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The size of the first partition.\n        m (int): The size of the second partition.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or str: The Alon-Tarsi number or an error message.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        return \"Invalid partition size. n and m must be positive.\"\n\n    # Handle the special case of K_1,1, which is just an edge.\n    if n == 1 and m == 1:\n        # AT(K_1,1) = 2\n        result = 2\n    # Case where partitions have equal size (n >= 2)\n    elif n == m:\n        # Theorem: AT(K_n,n) = 3 for n >= 2\n        result = 3\n    # Case where partitions have different sizes\n    else:\n        # Theorem: AT(K_n,m) = 2 for n != m\n        result = 2\n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the user's specific request for the Alon-Tarsi number of K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 1000\n    m = 1000\n\n    print(f\"Finding the Alon-Tarsi number for the complete bipartite graph K_n,m where n={n} and m={m}.\")\n    print(\"This is based on the following theorem:\")\n    print(\"1.
