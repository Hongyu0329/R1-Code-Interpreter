    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership degree. The problem provides crisp values for these, simplifying the calculation to a standard fuzzy logic operation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the input values**:\n    *   Antecedent firing strength `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   Consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  **Choose a T-Norm**: A t-norm is a type of binary operation used in fuzzy logic to represent the intersection. The most common t-norm is the **minimum** operator. I will use `min(a, b)` for this calculation.\n3.  **Apply the T-Norm**: The rule activation level is calculated by applying the t-norm to the two provided values.\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `t_norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Using the minimum t-norm: `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: Write a simple script to define the variables, perform the calculation, and print the equation with the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nantecedent_firing_level = 0.7\nconsequent_membership_degree = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to combine these values. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n# The rule activation level is the result of this operation.\nrule_activation_level = min(antecedent_firing_level, consequent_membership_degree)\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers and the result\nprint(\"The rule activation level is calculated as the t-norm (minimum) of the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership degree.\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({antecedent_firing_level}, {consequent_membership_degree}) = {rule_activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
