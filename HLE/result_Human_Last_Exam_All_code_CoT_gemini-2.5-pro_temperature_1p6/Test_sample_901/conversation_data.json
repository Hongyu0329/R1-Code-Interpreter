    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** Analyze the substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, to determine the likely reaction mechanism. The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base points towards an E2 elimination reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Substrate Conformation:** Determine the stereochemistry (*cis* or *trans*) of the substrate from its name. Then, analyze its chair conformations to find the most stable one, which will be the primary conformer undergoing reaction. The most stable conformer will have the bulkier methyl group in an equatorial position.\n3.  **Apply E2 Stereochemical Requirement:** The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) are anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane chair, this means both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions. We will identify all available axial β-hydrogens in the stable conformer.\n4.  **Apply Regioselectivity Rule:** When multiple β-hydrogens are available, the regioselectivity is determined by the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. This favors the Hofmann elimination pathway, where the base abstracts the most sterically accessible (least hindered) proton, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n5.  **Name the Product:** Based on the favored elimination pathway, we will identify the structure of the major alkene product and provide its IUPAC name.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that explains this entire reasoning process step-by-step and prints the final answer, including the numerical part of the product's name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    to identify the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reactants and Reaction Type ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Reaction ---\")\n    print(\"Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a secondary alkyl halide)\")\n    print(\"Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, sterically hindered base)\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Substrate Conformation ---\n    print(\"--- Substrate Stereochemistry and Conformation ---\")\n    print(\"1.

The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is very bulky. It preferentially attacks the most sterically accessible β-hydrogen.\")\n    print(\"3. The β-hydrogen at C6 is less sterically hindered than the β-hydrogen at C2 (which is near the equatorial methyl group).\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The reaction follows the Hofmann rule, favoring the removal of the C6 proton.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 5: Final Product ---\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    print(\"--- Final Product Identification ---\")\n    print(f\"The major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product: {product_name}\")\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers from the final product name.\n    final_number = 3\n    print(\"\\nAs requested, the number in the final product's name is:\")\n    print(final_number)\n\n# Run the analysis\nidentify_elimination_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
