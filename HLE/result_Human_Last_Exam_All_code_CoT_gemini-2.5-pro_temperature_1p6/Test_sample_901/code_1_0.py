    print("--- Analysis of the Reaction ---")
    print("Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a secondary alkyl halide)")
    print("Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, sterically hindered base)")
    print("Conclusion: These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Substrate Conformation ---
    print("--- Substrate Stereochemistry and Conformation ---")
    print("1. The (1S,2R) configuration means the bromo and methyl groups are 'cis' to each other.")
    print("2. For a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, one group is axial and the other is equatorial in its chair form.")
    print("3. The methyl group is bulkier than the bromo group. Therefore, the most stable conformer has the methyl group in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain.")
    print("4. In this most stable conformer, the bromo group must be in the axial position.")
    print("Conclusion: The reaction proceeds from the conformer with an axial bromo group and an equatorial methyl group.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Step 3: Apply E2 Stereochemical Requirements ---
    print("--- E2 Mechanism Requirements ---")
    print("1. E2 elimination requires an 'anti-periplanar' geometry: the leaving group (Br) and a β-hydrogen must both be axial.")
    print("2. Our substrate has an axial Br at C1. We need to find axial β-hydrogens on adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).")
    print("   - At C2: The methyl group is equatorial, so the hydrogen at C2 is axial. An elimination pathway exists here.")
    print("   - At C6: This carbon has one axial and one equatorial hydrogen. An elimination pathway also exists here.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Step 4: Apply Regioselectivity Rule (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev) ---
    print("--- Regioselectivity and Product Formation ---")
    print("1. Two products are possible:")
    print("   - Zaitsev Product (from removing H at C2): 1-methylcyclohexene (a tri-substituted, more stable alkene).")
    print("   - Hofmann Product (from removing H at C6): 3-methylcyclohexene (a di-substituted, less stable alkene).")
    print("2. The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is very bulky. It preferentially attacks the most sterically accessible β-hydrogen.")
    print("3. The β-hydrogen at C6 is less sterically hindered than the β-hydrogen at C2 (which is near the equatorial methyl group).")
    print("Conclusion: The reaction follows the Hofmann rule, favoring the removal of the C6 proton.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Step 5: Final Product ---
