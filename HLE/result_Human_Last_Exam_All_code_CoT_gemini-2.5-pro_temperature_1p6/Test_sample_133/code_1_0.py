    """
    Based on a manual and programmatic analysis of the game state, this function
    determines the optimal move for player 'O'.

    1.  A check for immediate wins reveals none are possible in the current turn.
    2.  Analysis for a forced win (a move creating two unstoppable threats) points
        to a single optimal move.
    3.  The move 'f4' creates two threats simultaneously:
        - It makes the winning diagonal spot 'f3' (completing c6-d5-e4) playable.
        - It creates a winning horizontal threat with d4-e4-f4, playable at 'c4' or 'g4'.
    
    The opponent can only block one of these threats, guaranteeing a win for 'O' on the
    subsequent turn.
