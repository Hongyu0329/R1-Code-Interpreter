    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone in the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. The product is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n2.  **Determine Molecular Properties:** We need to find the values for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula, which is:\n    `BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / 2`\n    For the product, ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (C₈H₁₄O₂):\n    *   **N_atoms**: The number of non-hydrogen atoms. There are 8 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `N_atoms = 8 + 2 = 10`.\n    *   **N_bonds**: The total number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms, counting bond order (i.e., a double bond counts as 2).\n        *   7 C-C single bonds (5 in the ring, 1 connecting the ring to the ester group, 1 in the ethyl group).\n        *   2 C-O single bonds.\n        *   1 C=O double bond.\n        *   Total `N_bonds` = (7 * 1) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 2) = 11.\n    *   **N_cycles**: The number of rings in the molecule. There is one cyclopentane ring. So, `N_cycles = 1`.\n3.  **Calculate the BMC:** Substitute the values into the formula:\n    `BMC = (10 * 11 * 1) / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone\n# is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n# We will calculate its Böttcher Molecular Complexity.\n\n# The formula for Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC) is:\n# BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / 2\n\n# N_atoms: Number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n# For ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (C8H14O2), this is 8 carbons + 2 oxygens.\nN_atoms = 10\n\n# N_bonds: Total number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (counting bond order).\n# - 7 C-C single bonds\n# - 2 C-O single bonds\n# - 1 C=O double bond (counts as 2)\n# Total N_bonds = 7 + 2 + 2 = 11\nN_bonds = 11\n\n# N_cycles: Number of rings in the molecule.\n# There is one cyclopentane ring.\nN_cycles = 1\n\n# Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity\nbmc_value = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / 2\n\n# Print the calculation with each number explicitly shown\nprint(f\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated as (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {N_atoms} * {N_bonds} * {N_cycles} / 2 = {bmc_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<55.0>>>"
