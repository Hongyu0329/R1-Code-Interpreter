# The user wants a Python script to solve a complex physics problem involving a custom computer architecture.
#
# My analysis reveals the following:
#
# 1. Pandora's Recessional Velocity:
#    - Redshift z = (501 nm - 500 nm) / 500 nm = 0.002.
#    - Recessional velocity v_rec = z * c â‰ˆ 0.002 * 300,000 km/s = 600 km/s.
#
# 2. Pioneer's Velocity Profile:
#    - Pioneer's velocity increases in stages for 400 days and then becomes constant.
#    - This velocity can be calculated iteratively. For example, v_new = v_old * 1.04.
#    - On the Wuxing computer, this would use the 'frac' type (e.g., multiplication by 26/25).
#
# 3. The Core Problem:
#    - To calculate the travel time (question a), we must determine when Pioneer reaches Pandora.
#    - This requires solving: distance_pioneer(t) = initial_distance_pandora(D) + distance_pandora_travels(t).
#    - The equation cannot be solved without knowing the initial distance, D.
#
# 4. The Missing Data:
#    - The problem provides no value for D, the distance to Pandora.
#    - It is impossible to calculate this distance from the given information without making external assumptions (like assuming a value for the Hubble Constant, H0).
#
# 5. Conclusion on Computability:
#    - Since a key input variable (D) is missing, a program cannot be written to solve the problem as stated.
#    - The problem instructions specify that if a program cannot be written, the output should be "0:0".
#
# Therefore, the Python script will print this required output.

print("0:0")
