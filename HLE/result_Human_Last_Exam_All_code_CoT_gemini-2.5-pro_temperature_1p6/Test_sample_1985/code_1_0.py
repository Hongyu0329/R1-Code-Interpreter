    This function calculates the squared L2 norm of x(1) based on the problem's boundary conditions.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1.  The problem is decoupled into scalar components because all operators are diagonal.
    2.  The value of x(1) is determined algebraically from the boundary conditions:
        Mx(0) - Nx(1) = alpha
        x(0) = 1/2 * alpha
    3.  Substituting the second condition into the first gives:
        M * (1/2 * alpha) - Nx(1) = alpha
        => Nx(1) = (M/2 - I) * alpha
        => x(1) = N^{-1} * (M/2 - I) * alpha
    4.  Component-wise, this is x_n(1) = (1/N_n) * (M_n/2 - 1) * alpha_n.
    5.  Given alpha_n = 0 for n != k where k = 2^2024, it follows that x_n(1) = 0 for n != k.
    6.  The norm ||x(1)||^2 is therefore just |x_k(1)|^2 for k = 2^2024.
    7.  We calculate x_k(1) using the properties of M and N at index k.
