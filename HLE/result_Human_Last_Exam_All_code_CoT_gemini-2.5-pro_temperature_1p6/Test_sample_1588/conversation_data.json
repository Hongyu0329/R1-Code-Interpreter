    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying Witt's formula for the dimension of the n-th homogeneous component of a free Lie algebra on k generators. The number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion corresponds to this dimension.\n\nThe formula is:\nL_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]\n\nFor this specific problem:\n*   The order is `n = 10`.\n*   The expansion involves commutators of two elements (X and Y), so we have `k = 2` generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe steps to implement this are:\n1.  Find all divisors of `n=10`.\n2.  For each divisor `d`, compute the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, compute the term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n4.  Sum all these terms.\n5.  Divide the total sum by `n`.\n6.  Finally, I will print the entire calculation step-by-step, showing how each number in the formula is derived, leading to the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        else:\n            d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    # If any prime factor has a power greater than 1, mu(n) is 0\n    if any(p > 1 for p in factors.values()):\n        return 0\n    \n    # Otherwise, it's (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in BCH expansion\n    and prints the step-by-step formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Order of the expansion\n    n = 10\n    # Number of generators (X and Y)\n    k = 2\n\n    # Step 1: Find divisors\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Calculate terms for Witt's formula\n    mu_values = [mobius(d) for d in divisors]\n    powers = [n // d for d in divisors]\n    term_values = [m * (k**p) for m, p in zip(mu_values, powers)]\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum the terms\n    total_sum = sum(term_values)\n    \n    # Step 5: Get final result\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Step 6: Print the detailed calculation\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is given by Witt's formula, which evaluates to {result}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n\n    # Build the first line of the equation: result = (1/n) * [ (mu(d1))*k^(n/d1) + ... ]\n    part1_terms = []\n    for mu, d, p in zip(mu_values, divisors, powers):\n        part1_terms.append(f\"({mu})*{k}^{p}\")\n    part1_str = \" + \".join(part1_terms)\n    print(f\"{result} = (1/{n}) * [ {part1_str} ]\")\n\n    # Build the second line of the equation: result = (1/n) * [ term1 + term2 + ... ]\n    part2_str = str(term_values[0])\n    for term in term_values[1:]:\n        if term >= 0:\n            part2_str += f\" + {term}\"\n        else:\n            part2_str += f\" - {-term}\"\n    print(f\"{result} = (1/{n}) * [ {part2_str} ]\")\n\n    # Build the third line: result = (1/n) * [ sum ]\n    print(f\"{result} = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    \n    # Final answer\n    print(f\"{result} = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
