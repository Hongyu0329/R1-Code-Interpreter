# The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set difference
# between the maximum and minimum of two cardinals, lambda and mu.

# As shown in the reasoning, the definitions of lambda and mu provided
# in the problem lead to the provable conclusion in ZFC that lambda = mu.
# Let's represent the cardinals with symbolic variables.
l = "lambda"
m = "mu"

# The relationship proved is mu <= lambda and lambda <= mu, so lambda = mu.
# Therefore, max({lambda, mu}) is lambda and min({lambda, mu}) is lambda.
max_val = l
min_val = l

# The set difference is max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu}), which is lambda \ lambda.
# The set difference of a set with itself is the empty set.
# The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

result_cardinality = 0

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is effectively |max({l, m}) \ min({l, m})| = 0,
# because l = m. Let's demonstrate with a numerical example for clarity,
# although lambda and mu are infinite cardinals.
# If lambda = mu = 5 (as an example set {0,1,2,3,4})
# max({5, 5}) is 5. min({5, 5}) is 5.
# set({0,1,2,3,4}) - set({0,1,2,3,4}) = set()
# len(set()) = 0

# The "numbers" in the final equation are just 0.
