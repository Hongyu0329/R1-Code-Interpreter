    # The question asks if the following statement, let's call it P(k), is true,
    # given the existence of a k+-Kurepa tree.
    # P(k): EXISTS a function f from pairs of ordinals in kappa^++ to kappa,
    #       such that FOR EVERY subset x of kappa^++ with order type kappa^+ + kappa,
    #       the size of the image f''[x]^2 is kappa.

    # --- Step 2: Formulate the negation of the statement ---
    # The negation, not P(k), is as follows:
    # not P(k): FOR EVERY function f from pairs of ordinals in kappa^++ to kappa,
    #           there EXISTS a subset x of kappa^++ with order type kappa^+ + kappa,
    #           such that the size of the image f''[x]^2 is LESS THAN kappa.

    # --- Step 3: Relate the negation to Partition Calculus ---
    # The negated statement is a standard assertion in combinatorial set theory,
    # specifically in partition calculus. This statement is represented by a
    # partition relation arrow.

    print("  - ...such that the image of the pairs from the subset has size less than 'kappa' (second subscript).")

    # --- Step 4: Cite the decisive theorem from ZFC ---

    # for any infinite cardinal k. This result is a theorem in ZFC and does

    print("This result is a theorem of ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Step 5: Draw the final conclusion ---
    # Since 'not P(k)' is a theorem of ZFC, the original statement P(k) must be false.
    # This conclusion holds for any infinite cardinal k, regardless of any additional
    # assumptions. Therefore, the premise about the existence of a k+-Kurepa tree is
    # irrelevant information.

    print("Step 5: Draw the conclusion.")
    print("Since the negation 'not P(kappa)' is a theorem, the original statement P(kappa) is false.")
    print("This means that such a function 'f' as described in the question can never exist, for any infinite cardinal kappa.")
    print("The assumption about the existence of a kappa^+-Kurepa tree is a red herring and does not affect the answer.")
    print("-" * 20)
