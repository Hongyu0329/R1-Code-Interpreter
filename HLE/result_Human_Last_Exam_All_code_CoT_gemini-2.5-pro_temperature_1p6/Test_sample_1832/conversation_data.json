    "I will solve this problem by programmatically calculating the Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define the Schwarzschild Metric**: I will use Python's symbolic math library, `sympy`, to define the coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and the mass parameter $M$. Then, I will construct the diagonal Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n2.  **Apply the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n3.  **Calculate and Count**: I will write a script that iterates through all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ possible combinations of the indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$. For each combination, the script will compute the Christoffel symbol using the formula above.\n4.  **Output Results**: If the calculated symbol is non-zero, the script will print its expression. A running counter will keep track of the total number of non-zero symbols, which will be printed at the end. This total count will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, cos, Symbol, diag, diff, pprint, pretty\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates, prints, and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define coordinates, parameters, and the metric\n    # Let G=c=1 for simplicity.
