    Solves for the susceptibility chi* based on the duality relation in 2D magnetostatics.

    The problem states that for an infinitely long rectangular prism, the following
    equation must be satisfied:
    Nm(a/b, chi) + Nm(b/a, chi*) = 1

    This is a known theorem in magnetostatics that holds true if the relative
    permeabilities of the materials satisfy the condition: mu_r * mu_r* = 1.

    The relative permeability (mu_r) is related to susceptibility (chi) by:
    mu_r = 1 + chi.

    Therefore, the condition becomes: (1 + chi) * (1 + chi*) = 1.
    We will solve this equation for chi*.
