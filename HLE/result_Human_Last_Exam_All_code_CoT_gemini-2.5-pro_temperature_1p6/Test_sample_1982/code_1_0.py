# Step 1: Define the given constants.
c1 = 10**4

# Step 2: Determine the value of x_11.
# The problem provides:
# l1 = (1 + 10^5)^5
# alpha1 = (1 + 10^5)^6 * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10)
# We deduce that x_11 = alpha_1 / l_1.
# To simplify, let z = 10^5.
# x_11 = ((1 + z)^6 * (1 - z + z^2)) / (1 + z)^5
# x_11 = (1 + z) * (1 - z + z^2)
# Using the sum of cubes formula, (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) = a^3+b^3, where a=1 and b=z:
# x_11 = 1^3 + z^3 = 1 + z^3
z = 10**5
x11 = 1 + z**3

# Step 3: Solve for u_1.
# From the matrix equation, we derive the relationship u_1 = (x_11 - 1) / c_1.
# Now, we substitute the values and calculate u_1.
u1_numerator = x11 - 1
u1 = u1_numerator / c1

# Step 4: Print the derivation and the final answer.
print("From the matrix equation, we derive the formula: u_1 = (x_11 - 1) / c_1")
print(f"Using the provided l_1 and alpha_1, we find that x_11 = {x11:.1f}")
print(f"The given value for c_1 is {c1:.1f}")
print("\nSubstituting the numbers into the equation:")
# As per the requirement to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"u_1 = ({x11:.1f} - 1.0) / {c1:.1f}")
print(f"u_1 = {u1_numerator:.1f} / {c1:.1f}")
print(f"\nThe calculated value of the control u_1 is: {u1}")

# Final Answer
# The variable `final_answer_value` is not strictly needed but helps clarity.
final_answer_value = u1
