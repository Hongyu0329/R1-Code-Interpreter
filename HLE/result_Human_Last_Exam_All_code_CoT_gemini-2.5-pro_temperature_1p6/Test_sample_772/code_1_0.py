def solve_alpha():
    """
    This function calculates the exponent alpha for the given problem.

    The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of n(N), the smallest integer
    such that X^n = G for any compact set X in G = SO_3(R) with Haar measure 1/N.
    We are looking for alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The slowest growing sets X, which determine n(N), are neighborhoods of proper subgroups H of G.
    2. A theoretical model of set growth shows that n(N) is related to N by n(N) ~ N^(2 / (d - k)),
       where d = dim(G) and k = dim(H).
    3. To find the worst-case n(N), we must maximize the exponent 2 / (d - k). This is done by
       maximizing the subgroup dimension k.
    4. We identify the dimension of G = SO_3(R) and the maximum dimension of its proper subgroups.
    5. We substitute these values into the formula to find alpha.
