    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ at the prime $p=2$, we need to find a \"good\" model of the curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The stable reduction is the special fiber of this model, which should only have ordinary double points as singularities.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation in a standard order:\n$C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nIf we consider this equation over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and reduce it modulo 2, we get:\n$y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + x^2 + 0 \\cdot x \\pmod 2$\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$\nThis is equivalent to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0$ in characteristic 2, which represents a \"double line\" ($y=x$). This is a highly singular reduction.\n\nTo find a better model, we can perform a change of variables. We'll try a transformation of the form $x=2^n x'$ and $y=2^n y'$. The goal is to find an integer $n$ such that the new equation for $(x', y')$ is integral and its reduction modulo 2 is as simple as possible, ideally smooth.\n\nLet's substitute $x=2^n x'$ and $y=2^n y'$ into the original equation:\n$(2^n y')^2 = 8(2^n x')^5 + 4(2^n x')^4 + 4(2^n x')^3 + (2^n x')^2 + 8(2^n x')$\n$2^{2n} (y')^2 = 8 \\cdot 2^{5n} (x')^5 + 4 \\cdot 2^{4n} (x')^4 + 4 \\cdot 2^{3n} (x')^3 + 2^{2n} (x')^2 + 8 \\cdot 2^n (x')$\n\nDividing by $2^{2n}$:\n$(y')^2 = 8 \\cdot 2^{3n} (x')^5 + 4 \\cdot 2^{2n} (x')^4 + 4 \\cdot 2^{n} (x')^3 + (x')^2 + 8 \\cdot 2^{-n} (x')$\n$(y')^2 = 2^{3n+3} (x')^5 + 2^{2n+2} (x')^4 + 2^{n+2} (x')^3 + (x')^2 + 2^{3-n} (x')$\n\nFor this new equation to have integer coefficients, the exponent of 2 in the last term, $3-n$, must be non-negative. This means $n \\le 3$.\nLet's test $n=3$:\n$(y')^2 = 2^{3(3)+3} (x')^5 + 2^{2(3)+2} (x')^4 + 2^{3+2} (x')^3 + (x')^2 + 2^{3-3} (x')$\n$(y')^2 = 2^{12} (x')^5 + 2^8 (x')^4 + 2^5 (x')^3 + (x')^2 + (x')$\n\nThe reduction of this new equation modulo 2 is:\n$(y')^2 \\equiv x' + (x')^2 \\pmod 2$\n\nThis is the equation of the special fiber of our new model. To check for singular points, we find the partial derivatives of $G(x', y') = (y')^2 - (x')^2 - x' = (y')^2 + (x')^2 + x'$ (in $\\mathbb{F}_2$):\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y'} = 2y' \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x'} = 2x' + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\n\nA point is singular only if both partial derivatives are zero. Since $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x'}$ is always 1, there are no singular points on this curve. The curve is smooth.\n\nSince we found a coordinate transformation that leads to a model with a smooth special fiber, the original curve has **good reduction** at $p=2$. The stable reduction is this smooth curve itself. A smooth curve, by definition, has no singular points, and therefore no double points.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes the transformation and confirms the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stable reduction of the given curve at p=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coefficients of y^2 = c5*x^5 + c4*x^4 + c3*x^3 + c2*x^2 + c1*x\n    # from y^2=8*x+1*x^2+4*x^3+4*x^4+8*x^5\n    c = {\n        5: 8,\n        4: 4,\n        3: 4,\n        2: 1,\n        1: 8\n    }\n\n    print(\"Original curve equation: y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x\")\n    print(\"Reducing this model modulo 2 gives y^2 = x^2, which is singular.\\n\")\n    \n    # We found the transformation n=3 works.\n    # x = 2^3 * x_new, y = 2^3 * y_new\n    n = 3\n    p = 2\n    \n    print(f\"Applying the transformation x = {p**n}*x' and y = {p**n}*y':\")\n\n    # Calculate new coefficients for y_new^2 = c'_5*x_new^5 + ...\n    # c'_i = c_i * 2^(i*n - 2*n)\n    c_new = {i: c[i] * (p ** (i * n - 2 * n)) for i in c}\n\n    print(\"The transformed equation is:\")\n    equation_str = \"y'^2 = \"\n    terms = []\n    # Print the equation with its coefficients\n    for i in sorted(c_new.keys(), reverse=True):\n        terms.append(f\"{c_new[i]}*x'^{i}\")\n    equation_str += \" + \".join(terms)\n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe coefficients of the new equation are:\")\n    for i in sorted(c_new.keys(), reverse=True):\n        print(f\"c'_{i}: {c_new[i]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nReducing the new equation modulo 2:\")\n    reduced_eq = \"y'^2 = x'^2 + x'\"\n    print(reduced_eq)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo check for singularities, we check the partial derivatives of G(x', y') = y'^2 - x'^2 - x'.\")\n    print(\"In F_2, G(x', y') = y'^2 + x'^2 + x'.\")\n    print(\"dG/dx' = 2x' + 1 = 1 (mod 2)\")\n    print(\"dG/dy' = 2y' = 0 (mod 2)\")\n    print(\"Since dG/dx' is never zero, there are no singular points.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe reduced curve is smooth.
