    "Here is a plan to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$:\n\n1.  **Represent the complex numbers**: We will express the variable $z$ in its Cartesian form, $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. The imaginary unit $i$ has a multi-valued exponential representation due to the periodic nature of the complex exponential function, so we write $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$. This general form is crucial for finding all solutions.\n\n2.  **Substitute and simplify**: We will substitute these forms into the original equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n    *   The left-hand side (LHS) becomes $(x + yi) \\cdot i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\n    *   The right-hand side (RHS) becomes $i^z = i^{x+yi} = (e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)})^{x+yi} = e^{(x+yi)i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\n3.  **Equate real and imaginary parts**: By equating the LHS and RHS, we obtain a system of two transcendental equations in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n    *   Real part: $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n    *   Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n\n4.  **Solve the system for different cases**:\n    *   **Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**: We will set $y=0$ in the system and solve for $x$. This leads to the two simple real solutions, $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n    *   **Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**: We will set $x=0$ and solve the resulting equation for $y$. This reveals an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, which exist only for non-positive integer values of $k$ ($k \\le -1$). These solutions cannot be expressed in a simple closed form and require numerical methods to be found.\n    *   **Case 3: Other solutions**: We'll briefly analyze the case for general complex solutions where $x,y \\ne 0$. A special check for solutions on the unit circle ($|z|=1$) shows that $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are the only such solutions. Other solutions are not easily found analytically.\n\n5.  **Provide a Python script**: To find the numerical values for the purely imaginary solutions, I will provide a Python script that uses the `scipy.optimize.fsolve` function to solve the relevant transcendental equation for the first few values of $k$. The script will print the two real solutions and the first few purely imaginary solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nimport warnings\n\n# Suppress warning from fsolve if it doesn't converge, though it's expected to here.\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore', 'The iteration is not making good progress')\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints solutions to the equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the complex equation: z * i = i^z\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\n    # Case 1: Real solutions (z = x + 0i)\n    # The analysis shows two real solutions.\n    print(\"Found two real solutions:\")\n    z1 = 1.0\n    z2 = -1.0\n    print(f\"z = {z1}\")\n    print(f\"z = {z2}\")\n    \n    # Verification for real solutions\n    # For z = 1: 1*i = i; i^1 = i.
