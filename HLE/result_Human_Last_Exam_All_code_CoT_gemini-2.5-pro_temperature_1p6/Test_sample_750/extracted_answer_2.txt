The solutions are z=1, z=-1, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for integers $k \le -1$, where each $y_k$ is the unique real root of the equation $-y = \exp(-y (\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi))$. The first few imaginary solutions are approximately z = -0.27289562i (for k=-1) and z = -0.12537527i (for k=-2).
