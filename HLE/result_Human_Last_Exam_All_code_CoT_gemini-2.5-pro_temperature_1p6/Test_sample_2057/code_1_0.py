def solve_hat_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the hat puzzle and prints the result.
    The logic is based on deductive reasoning about what each person knows in each round.
    The configuration that satisfies the condition that everyone answers "No" in the first two rounds is unique
    (up to rotation and reflection). This configuration is BWBWBWWBB.
    
    In the third round, the 4 people with white hats are able to deduce their hat color.
    The reasoning is complex, but it boils down to this: If a white-hatted person were to assume they
    had a black hat, the resulting hypothetical world (with 6B, 3W hats) would create a situation where
    someone else should have been able to solve the puzzle in an earlier round. This creates a contradiction,
    allowing them to be certain they have a white hat. The same logic does not apply to the black-hatted people.
