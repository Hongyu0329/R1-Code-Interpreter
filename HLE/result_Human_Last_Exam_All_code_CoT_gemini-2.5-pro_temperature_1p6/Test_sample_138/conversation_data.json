    "To determine the number of positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant, we can use known theorems from the mathematical theory of quadratic forms. A key result provides a necessary condition for the existence of such a lattice.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Mathematical Condition:** There is a theorem that must be satisfied for any positive definite even lattice of odd dimension. For an even lattice `L` with an odd dimension `n` and determinant `d`, the expression `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * d` must be congruent to `0`, `1`, or `4` modulo `8`.\n2.  **Define Parameters:** Set the dimension `n = 17` and the determinant `d = 2`.\n3.  **Perform Calculation:** Compute the value of the expression `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * d` for the given parameters.\n4.  **Check Condition:** Verify if the result of the calculation modulo 8 falls into the allowed set `{0, 1, 4}`.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the check, conclude whether such a lattice can exist. If the condition is not met, no such lattice exists, and the number is 0.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices(n, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks for the existence of a positive definite even lattice with\n    a given odd dimension 'n' and determinant 'd'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Task: Find the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"We will use a necessary condition for the existence of such lattices.\")\n    print(\"\\nTheorem:\")\n    print(\"For a positive definite even lattice 'L' of ODD dimension 'n' and determinant 'd',\")\n    print(\"the following congruence must be satisfied:\")\n    print(\"  (-1)^(n*(n-1)/2) * d â‰¡ r (mod 8), where r must be in the set {0, 1, 4}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"This theorem applies only to odd dimensions, but the given dimension n={n} is even.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Define the lattice parameters.\")\n    print(f\"Dimension n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Determinant d = {d}\")\n\n    # Calculate the exponent for the sign term\n    exponent = (n * (n - 1)) // 2\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the term (-1)^(n*(n-1)/2).\")\n    print(f\"The exponent is n*(n-1)/2 = {n}*({n-1})/2 = {exponent}.\")\n\n    # The sign is (-1) raised to the exponent\n    sign = (-1)**exponent\n    print(f\"The sign term evaluates to (-1)^{exponent} = {sign}.\")\n\n    # Calculate the full expression\n    value_to_check = sign * d\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the full expression to be checked.\")\n    print(f\"The expression is (-1)^(n*(n-1)/2) * d = {sign} * {d} = {value_to_check}.\")\n\n    # Check the condition modulo 8\n    remainder = value_to_check % 8\n    allowed_remainders = {0, 1, 4}\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Check if the condition is satisfied.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation to check is: Is ({value_to_check} mod 8) in {allowed_remainders}?\")\n    print(f\"Calculating the remainder: {value_to_check} mod 8 = {remainder}.\")\n    \n    # Final conclusion\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    if remainder in allowed_remainders:\n        print(f\"The result {remainder} is in the allowed set {allowed_remainders}.\")\n        print(\"The necessary condition is met.
