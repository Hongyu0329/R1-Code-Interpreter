    print("This is the expected value of the potential outcome Y^a, for a subgroup of the population defined by their OBSERVED treatment A and OBSERVED confounder L.")

    print("By the consistency axiom of potential outcomes, if an individual's observed treatment is A=a, their potential outcome Y^a is simply their observed outcome Y.")
    print("Therefore, the equation becomes: E(Y^a | A=a, L=l) = E(Y | A=a, L=l).")
    print("The term E(Y | A=a, L=l) is a standard statistical association that can be computed directly from observed data. So, this part IS identifiable.")

    print("Let's evaluate E(Y^a | A=a', L=l), where a' is not equal to a.")
    print("This is the average outcome if treatment were 'a', for the subgroup that was actually observed to have received a different treatment, 'a'.")
    print("To identify this, we typically need the 'conditional exchangeability' assumption (Y^a is independent of A given L). If this were true, E(Y^a | A,L) would equal E(Y^a | L).")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Using the problem's key condition")
    print("The problem explicitly states that E(Y^a | A,L) != E(Y^a | L).")
    print("This tells us that conditional exchangeability does NOT hold. This is due to the unmeasured confounder U, which creates a statistical link between the treatment A one receives and their potential outcome Y^a, even after accounting for L.")
    print("Because of this unmeasured confounding, we cannot determine what the outcome for the A=a' group would have been under treatment 'a'. The observed data P(Y, A, L) does not contain enough information to make this inference.")
    print("Therefore, E(Y^a | A=a', L=l) is NOT identifiable.")
    
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("To identify the function E(Y^a | A,L), we must be able to identify it for ALL possible inputs.")
    print(" - We can identify it for the part of its domain where A = a.")
    print(" - We CANNOT identify it for the part of its domain where A != a.")
    print("Since we cannot identify the function for all its inputs, the function as a whole is not identified.")
