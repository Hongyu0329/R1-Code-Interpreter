    # Step 1: Determine X2
    # The given formula for the decay rate is:
    # Γ(Z → f f̄) = (G_F * m_Z^3 / (12 * sqrt(2) * π)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
    # For neutrinos, c_V = 1/2 and c_A = 1/2.
    c_V_sq_plus_c_A_sq = (0.5)**2 + (0.5)**2  # This is 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5
    
    # Substituting this into the formula for Γ:
    # Γ(Z → ν ν̄) = (G_F * m_Z^3 / (12 * sqrt(2) * π)) * (1/2)
    # Γ(Z → ν ν̄) = G_F * m_Z^3 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π)
    # The problem defines Γ(Z → ν ν̄) = X2 * G_F * m_Z^3.
    # By comparison, X2 = 1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π).

    # Step 2: Determine X1
    # The standard kinematic relation for a 1 -> 2 decay (Z -> f f_bar) is:
    # Γ = <|M|^2> / (16 * π * m_Z)
    # We are given |M|^2 = X1 * G_F * m_Z^4. We assume |M|^2 means <|M|^2>.
    # Rearranging for <|M|^2> and substituting the problem's Γ formula:
    # <|M|^2> = 16 * π * m_Z * Γ
    # <|M|^2> = 16 * π * m_Z * [ (G_F * m_Z^3 / (12 * sqrt(2) * π)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2) ]
    # Simplifying the expression:
    # <|M|^2> = (16 / (12 * sqrt(2))) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
    # <|M|^2> = (4 / (3 * sqrt(2))) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
    # <|M|^2> = (2 * sqrt(2) / 3) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
    
    # For neutrinos, where c_V^2 + c_A^2 = 1/2:
    # |M|^2 = (2 * sqrt(2) / 3) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (1/2) = (sqrt(2) / 3) * G_F * m_Z^4
    # Comparing to |M|^2 = X1 * G_F * m_Z^4, we get X1 = sqrt(2) / 3.

    # Step 3: Calculate (X1 * X2)^-1
    # X1 * X2 = (sqrt(2) / 3) * (1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π))
    # The sqrt(2) terms cancel.
    # X1 * X2 = 1 / (3 * 24 * π) = 1 / (72 * π)
    # Therefore, (X1 * X2)^-1 = 72 * π.
