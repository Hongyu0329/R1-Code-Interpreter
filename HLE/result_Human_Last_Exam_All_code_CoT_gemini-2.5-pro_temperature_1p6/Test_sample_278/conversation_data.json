    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve's Boundaries**: We'll determine the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. The curve is defined differently for two intervals of `t`.\n    *   **x-coordinate**: The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π]`. The cosine function always stays within the range `[-1, 1]`. Thus, `x_min = -1` and `x_max = 1`.\n    *   **y-coordinate**: The y-coordinate has two parts:\n        *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, the maximum `y` is 1.\n        *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to -1 and back to 0. Therefore, `y` ranges from 0 to -5. The minimum `y` is -5.\n    *   Combining both intervals, the overall range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box**: We'll calculate the total width and height of the figure based on the ranges we found.\n    *   Width = `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   Height = `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Enclosing Square**: The side length of the smallest square that can enclose the figure must be equal to the larger of its width or height.\n    *   `side_length = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area**: The area of this square is the square of its side length.\n    *   `Area = side_length * side_length = 6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the boundaries for the x and y coordinates based on the parametric equations.\n\n# For x = cos(t), as t goes from 0 to 2*pi, the range of cos(t) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1.0\nx_max = 1.0\n\n# For y, we analyze two parts:\n# For t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). The maximum value is sin(pi/2) = 1.\ny_max_part1 = 1.0\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5 * sin(t). The minimum value is 5*sin(3*pi/2) = -5.\ny_min_part2 = -5.0\n\n# The overall y range is the combination of the two parts.\ny_min = y_min_part2\ny_max = y_max_part1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box of the figure.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 3: The side of the smallest outcircling square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length**2\n\n# Print the results, including the final equation.\nprint(f\"The full range of the x-coordinate is [{x_min}, {x_max}].\")\nprint(f\"The full range of the y-coordinate is [{y_min}, {y_max}].\")\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\nprint(\"The area is calculated from the side length.\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is Area = {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated area is {int(area)}.\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
