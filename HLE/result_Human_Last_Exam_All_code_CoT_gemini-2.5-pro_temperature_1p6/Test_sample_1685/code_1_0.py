# Step 1: The simplified ODE for large x leads to a power-law solution y(x) = A/x.
# Step 2: The balance of terms in the simplified ODE y''' â‰ˆ y^4 gives an equation for the coefficient A.
# The equation is A^3 = -6.
A_cubed = -6.00

# Step 3: Solve for A.
# We need to compute the cubic root of -6.
# Note: In Python, (-6)**(1/3) results in a complex number. 
# We calculate the real cubic root as -(|-6|**(1/3)).
A = -math.pow(abs(A_cubed), 1/3)

# Step 4: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.
A_rounded = round(A, 2)

# Step 5: Print the final analytical expression for y(x).
