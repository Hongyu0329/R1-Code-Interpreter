    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\nThe reaction you've described is a classic organic chemistry transformation known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction involves a conjugated diene (butadiene) reacting with a substituted alkene, known as a dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene), to form a six-membered ring.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the product:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The diene is 1,3-butadiene (`C4H6`), and the dienophile is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (`C2Cl2F2`).\n2.  **Determine Connectivity**: In this [4+2] cycloaddition, the ends of the diene (carbons 1 and 4) form new single bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile. A new double bond forms between carbons 2 and 3 of the original diene.\n3.  **Structure Formation**: This process results in a cyclohexene ring with two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on the adjacent carbon.\n4.  **IUPAC Naming**: The product is named by numbering the cyclohexene ring to give the double bond positions 1 and 2, and then assigning the lowest possible numbers to the substituents, prioritizing alphabetical order (\"chloro\" before \"fluoro\") in case of a tie. This leads to the name **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe following script will print the reaction details and the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    diene = \"Buta-1,3-diene\"\n    diene_formula = \"C4H6\"\n    dienophile = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\"\n    dienophile_formula = \"C2Cl2F2\"\n\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Diene: {diene} ({diene_formula})\")\n    print(f\"Dienophile: {dienophile} ({dienophile_formula})\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: Diels-Alder [4+2] Cycloaddition\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # The product is determined by the cycloaddition mechanism.\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n    \n    # Locants (numbers) in the name\n    locant_1 = 4\n    locant_2 = 4\n    locant_3 = 5\n    locant_4 = 5\n    locant_5 = 1\n\n    print(\"Reaction Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{diene_formula} + {dienophile_formula} ---> {product_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Product IUPAC Name:\")\n    # The prompt requested to output each number in the final name/equation.\n    # The numbers are 4, 4, 5, 5, and 1.\n    print(f\"{locant_1},{locant_2}-dichloro-{locant_3},{locant_4}-difluorocyclohex-{locant_5}-ene\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
