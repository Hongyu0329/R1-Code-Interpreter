    This function solves the problem.
    The problem asks for the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k in a recursively defined polynomial.
    Let G(P) = product_{i=1 to p^k} (P(x)-i).
    The polynomial is P_{p^n}(x) = G o G o ... o G (x), where G is applied p^n times.

    Let's analyze the polynomial transformation modulo p.
    The set {1, 2, ..., p^k} mod p is {0, 1, ..., p-1} repeated p^{k-1} times.
    So, G(P(x)) (mod p) is congruent to (product_{j=0 to p-1} (P(x)-j))^{p^{k-1}}.
    By Fermat's Little Theorem for polynomials, product_{j=0 to p-1} (y-j) is congruent to y^p - y (mod p).
    Let f(y) = y^p - y.
    So G(P(x)) (mod p) is congruent to (f(P(x)))^{p^{k-1}}.
    Since raising to power p is an endomorphism in characteristic p, the non-zero terms of (f(P(x)))^{p^{k-1}} are the same as f(P(x)).
    
    So, we need to analyze the p^n-th iterate of the polynomial map f(y) = y^p - y, modulo p.
    Let P_j(x) be the polynomial after j iterations.
    P_0(x) = x.
    P_1(x) = f(x) = x^p - x (mod p).
    P_2(x) = f(f(x)) = (x^p-x)^p - (x^p-x) = x^{p^2} - x^p - (x^p-x) = x^{p^2} - 2x^p + x (mod p).
    
    The j-th iterate is given by the formula f^{o j}(x) = sum_{i=0 to j} C(j,i) * (-1)^{j-i} * x^{p^i} (mod p), where C(j,i) is the binomial coefficient.
    
    We need the p^n-th iterate, so j = p^n.
    P_{p^n}(x) (mod p) is sum_{i=0 to p^n} C(p^n, i) * (-1)^{p^n-i} * x^{p^i}.
    By Lucas's Theorem, C(p^n, i) (mod p) is non-zero if and only if the base-p digits of i are less than or equal to the corresponding digits of p^n.
    The base-p representation of p^n is a 1 followed by n zeros.
    This means i must be of the form c*p^n where c is a digit. Since i <= p^n, c can be 0 or 1.
    
    So, only two terms in the sum are non-zero (mod p):
    1. For i=0: C(p^n, 0)*(-1)^{p^n}*x^{p^0} = 1 * (-1) * x = -x (since p is odd, p^n is odd).
    2. For i=p^n: C(p^n, p^n)*(-1)^0*x^{p^{p^n}} = 1 * 1 * x^{p^{p^n}}.
    
    So, P_{p^n}(x) is congruent to x^{p^{p^n}} - x (mod p).
    This polynomial has exactly two coefficients that are not zero modulo p.
    A coefficient not divisible by p is also not divisible by p^k.
    This analysis suggests that for any p, k, n, the number of such coefficients is 2.
    The problem asks for an expression in terms of p, k, and n.
    The simplest such expression is a constant.
    
    For the sake of providing a numerical answer in the required format, let's represent this as an equation.
    The number of coefficients is N.
    N = 2.
    To express this in terms of p,k,n, we can write it as:
    2 * (p / p) * (k / k) * (n / n) if n, k > 0.
    Or more simply: 2 + 0*p + 0*k + 0*n
    The final answer is a number, so we print 2.
