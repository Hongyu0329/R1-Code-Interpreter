# A plane is a 2-dimensional affine subspace in 10-dimensional space.
# Its codimension is the dimension of the ambient space minus the dimension of the subspace.
dim_space = 10
dim_plane = 2
codimension_of_plane = dim_space - dim_plane

# A point is a 0-dimensional affine subspace.

# The exponent 'c' in the relationship S = O(N^c) is given by the ratio of the codimensions
# when using an optimal construction based on intersecting hyperplanes.
# This ratio is the number of hyperplanes needed to define a point divided by the number
# of hyperplanes needed to define a plane.
