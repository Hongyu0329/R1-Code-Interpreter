    Analyzes the statements about Quaternion RoPE and determines which are true.

    The logic for each statement is as follows:
    A) TRUE. The inner product ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ can be shown to be equal to ⟨q, R_{n-m}(k)⟩, which depends only on the relative position n-m. This relies on the rotation operators R being unit quaternions and sharing the same rotation axis.
    B) FALSE. Quaternion multiplication is non-commutative. In general, (R_p A)(R_p B) is not equal to AB.
    C) TRUE. The property of encoding relative positions, as seen in (A), requires that R_m and R_n have the same rotation axis 'u'. If the axis changed with position, the composition R_{-m}R_n would not simplify to R_{n-m}.
    D) FALSE. The rotation angle mθ is a scalar based on a 1D position m. This system encodes 1D relative positions, not 3D.
    E) TRUE. The norm is multiplicative: |R_m(v)| = |R_m * v| = |R_m| * |v|. Since R_m is a unit quaternion, |R_m| = 1. Thus, |R_m(v)| = |v|.
    F) TRUE. For a scalar α, quaternion multiplication is associative with scalar multiplication: R_m * (αv) = α * (R_m * v).
    G) TRUE. The rotation is an isometry. ⟨R_m(q), R_m(k)⟩ = ⟨q, R_{m-m}(k)⟩ = ⟨q, R_0(k)⟩ = ⟨q, k⟩. Thus, if ⟨q, k⟩ = 0, the inner product is preserved as 0.
    H) TRUE. Since R_m and R_n share the same axis, they commute and follow the law R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}. The composition (R_m ∘ R_n)(v) = R_m * (R_n * v) = (R_m * R_n) * v = R_{m+n} * v.
    J) TRUE. The expression is ([R_m, R_n])v = (R_m*R_n - R_n*R_m)v. Since R_m and R_n share an axis, they commute, so their commutator is 0. The result is the zero quaternion, which has a real part of 0 and is thus purely imaginary (a pure quaternion).
    K) FALSE. The resulting real part is v_0*cos((m+n)θ) - sin((m+n)θ)*(vector_part(v) . u), which is not generally equal to the original real part v_0.
    L) TRUE. The 4x4 matrix for left-multiplication by q = a + bi + cj + dk has 'a' on all four diagonal elements. The trace is 4a. For R_m, a = cos(mθ), so the trace is 4cos(mθ).
    M) FALSE. The commutator [R_m, R_n] is 0 for ANY fixed rotation axis u, not only if it's parallel to (1,1,1). The "if and only if" condition makes this statement false.
    N) FALSE. From (E), |R_m(v)| = |v|. For a unit quaternion v, the magnitude is always 1, so the limit is 1, not 1/√2.

    The true statements are A, C, E, F, G, H, J, L.
