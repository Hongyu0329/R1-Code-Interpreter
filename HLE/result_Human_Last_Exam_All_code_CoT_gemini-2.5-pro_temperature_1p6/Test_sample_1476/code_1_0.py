    This function demonstrates the conclusion from the problem's premises.
    
    The premises are:
    1. The sum of the edge signal x1 around any cycle is zero, which implies x1 is in Im(B1.T).
    2. The divergence of x1 is zero (B1 * x1 = 0), which implies x1 is in ker(B1).

    These two conditions together imply that the edge signal x1 must be the zero vector,
    because Im(B1.T) and ker(B1) are orthogonal subspaces whose only common element is the zero vector.
