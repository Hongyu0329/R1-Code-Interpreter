    Analyzes the growth factor mu(X^3)/mu(X) for a family of sets in SL_2(R).

    The problem is to find the largest K such that mu(X^3) >= K*mu(X) for any
    compact set X in SL_2(R). This K is the infimum of the ratio mu(X^3)/mu(X).

    We model this by considering a family of sets X_A constructed within the
