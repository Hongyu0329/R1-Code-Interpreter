    print("The phrase 're-measures' suggests a repetitive, cyclical movement. For the sea, this strongly points to the ebb and flow of the tides. The tide constantly moves up and down the shore, literally changing and re-measuring the line between land and water.")

    # Explanation of the second reason
    print("Reason 2: Introspective Contemplation")
    print("The action of measuring something over and over again is also a powerful metaphor for a state of mind. It evokes the idea of someone dwelling on a thought, particularly the concept of 'distance' in all its forms (physical, emotional). The poem's personal and reflective tone supports this interpretation.")
