    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to analyze this very small number. A direct computation would result in underflow. Instead, we can use logarithms to determine the magnitude and the leading digits of the number.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Let our number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find its leading digits, we can express it in scientific notation in base 10, which looks like $D \\times 10^M$, where $1 \\le D < 10$. The digits of $D$ will be the non-zero digits of $N$.\n2.  To achieve this, we take the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$.\n3.  Let's call the result $x$. So, $N = 10^x$. We can decompose $x$ into its integer part $M = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ and its fractional part $f = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n4.  This allows us to write $N = 10^{M+f} = 10^f \\times 10^M$.\n5.  The term $10^M$ sets the position of the decimal point (it tells us how many zeros there are at the start). The term $D = 10^f$ gives the sequence of non-zero digits. Since $0 \\le f < 1$, the value of $D$ will be between $1$ and $10$.\n6.  The Python script below will perform these calculations using high-precision arithmetic from the standard `decimal` library to find the value of $D$ and extract its first two digits.\n\nThe code will compute the terms of the following calculation:\nLet $A = 7^{13}$ and $B = \\log_{10}(e)$. We calculate the exponent $x = -A \\cdot B$.\nThe leading digits are determined by $D = 10^f$, where $f$ is the fractional part of $x$.\n\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations to ensure accuracy.\n    # The integer part of the exponent is ~4.2e10, which has 11 digits.\n    # To get the fractional part with sufficient accuracy, 50 digits of precision is safe.\n    getcontext().prec = 50\n\n    print(\"The goal is to find the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\")\n    print(\"We express the number as 10^x and find the leading digits from the fractional part of x.\\n\")\n\n    # Let N = e^(-7^13).
