    # The number of rows with monsters is (2023 - 2) + 1.
    num_monsters = 2022

    # Step 2: Analyze the implications of the monster placement rules.
    # We are told there are 2022 monsters and 2023 columns.

    # Step 3: Determine the core of the problem.
    # Turbo's guarantee of success depends on identifying the single safe column.
    # To be certain which column is safe, he must eliminate all other possibilities.
    # This means he must identify all 2022 unsafe columns.

    # Step 4: Consider the worst-case scenario.
    # In the worst-case, for every attempt Turbo makes to test a new, potentially safe column,
    # he will find a monster. A malevolent "adversary" could arrange the monsters this way.
    # Each failed attempt can, at best, identify one new column as unsafe.
    # Therefore, to identify all 2022 unsafe columns, Turbo will need 2022 failed attempts in the worst-case.
    worst_case_failed_attempts = num_unsafe_cols

    # Step 5: Calculate the total number of attempts for the guarantee.
    # After 2022 failed attempts, Turbo knows which 2022 columns are unsafe.
    # By elimination, he is now certain that the last remaining column is the safe one.
    # He will then need one final attempt to travel down the safe column to win.
    final_successful_attempt = 1
