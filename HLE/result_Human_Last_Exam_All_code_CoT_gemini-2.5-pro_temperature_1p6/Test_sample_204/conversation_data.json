    "To solve this problem, we will calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field. The Hopf charge, an integer topological invariant, describes how the vector field texture wraps the 3D space. It can be calculated using the Whitehead formula, which, in a more intuitive form, corresponds to the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the sphere S².\n\nLet the vector field be `n(x,y,z) = (nx, ny, nz)`. The preimages of two points, `p1` and `p2`, on the S² sphere are the sets of points in 3D space, `C1 = n⁻¹(p1)` and `C2 = n⁻¹(p2)`, that map to these points. For regular choices of `p1` and `p2`, these preimages are closed loops in 3D space, and the Hopf charge `Q_H` is their linking number, `Lk(C1, C2)`.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Choose two suitable points, `p1` and `p2`, on the S² sphere. We'll pick the South Pole, `p1 = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the equator, `p2 = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  Solve for the set of points in `(x, y, z)` space that map to `p1` and `p2`. This will give us the equations for the two curves, `C1` and `C2`.\n3.  Analyze the geometry of these two curves to determine their linking number. While a formal calculation can be complex, we can determine the linking by observing their relative positions and intersections with shared planes.\n4.  Provide a Python script using `matplotlib` to visualize the two curves. This will give a clear graphical confirmation of their linking, and thus the Hopf charge.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Finding the Preimages**\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole `p1 = (0, 0, -1)`:**\n    We need `nz = cos(G) = -1`. This implies `G = π`.\n    From the definition `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, we get `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`, which means `r2 = 0`.\n    The condition `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)² + z²) = 0` is satisfied when both terms under the square root are zero:\n    `z = 0`\n    `x*x + y*y - 0.5 = 0`  => `x² + y² = 0.5`\n    This describes a circle `C1` in the `z=0` plane with a radius of `sqrt(0.5)`.\n\n*   **Preimage of the Equatorial Point `p2 = (1, 0, 0)`:**\n    We need `nx = 1`, `ny = 0`, `nz = 0`.\n    - `nz = cos(G) = 0` => `G = π/2`. This gives `exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2`, so `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    - `ny = sin(G) * sin(f) = 0`. Since `G=π/2`, `sin(G)=1`, so we must have `sin(f) = 0`. This implies `y = 0` and `x` is non-zero (since `f=atan2(y,x)`).\n    - `nx = sin(G) * cos(f) = 1`. Since `sin(G)=1`, we need `cos(f)=1`. This implies `f=0`, which corresponds to the half-plane `y=0, x > 0`.\n    The curve `C2` is therefore defined by the conditions `y=0`, `x>0`, and `r2 = ln(2)/10`. Substituting the definition of `r2`:\n    `sqrt((x² - 0.5)² + z²) = ln(2)/10`\n    `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n    This is the equation for a closed loop `C2` in the `y=0, x > 0` half-plane.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Linking Number and Visualization**\n\nThe first curve, `C1`, is a circle in the `xy`-plane. The second curve, `C2`, is a loop in the `xz`-plane.\nThe curve `C1` pierces the `xz`-plane (the plane containing `C2`) at `(sqrt(0.5), 0, 0)`.\nThe curve `C2` is a loop in the `xz`-plane surrounding the point `(sqrt(0.5), 0, z=0)`. We can see this because for `z=0`, `C2` crosses the x-axis at `x = sqrt(0.5 ± (ln(2)/10))`. The point `(sqrt(0.5), 0, 0)` from `C1` lies inside the loop `C2`.\n\nTherefore, the circle `C1` and the loop `C2` are linked exactly once. By convention, the Hopf charge for this fundamental configuration is taken to be positive.\n\nThe following Python code visualizes these two curves, showing that they are indeed linked once.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_hopfion_preimages():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and plots the preimages of two points for the given\n    vector field, demonstrating that their linking number is 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating the preimages for the Hopf charge calculation.\")\n\n    # --- Curve C1: Preimage of the South Pole (0,0,-1) ---\n    # This is a circle in the z=0 plane with radius sqrt(0.5)\n    radius_c1 = np.sqrt(0.5)\n    theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)\n    x_c1 = radius_c1 * np.cos(theta)\n    y_c1 = radius_c1 * np.sin(theta)\n    z_c1 = np.zeros_like(theta)\n    print(\"Preimage C1 (p1=(0,0,-1)): A circle of radius {:.3f} in the z=0 plane.\".format(radius_c1))\n\n\n    # --- Curve C2: Preimage of the Equatorial point (1,0,0) ---\n    # This is a loop in the y=0 plane.\n    # (x**2 - 0.5)**2 + z**2 = R**2, where R = ln(2)/10\n    R = np.log(2) / 10.0\n    # Parameterize the curve\n    phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 200)\n    # x must be positive, and 0.5 + R*cos(phi) is always positive as R < 0.5\n    x_c2 = np.sqrt(0.5 + R * np.cos(phi))\n    y_c2 = np.zeros_like(phi)\n    z_c2 = R * np.sin(phi)\n    print(\"Preimage C2 (p2=(1,0,0)): A loop in the y=0 plane.\")\n\n\n    # --- Plotting ---\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n    # Plot the curves\n    ax.plot(x_c1, y_c1, z_c1, label='C1: Preimage of (0,0,-1)', lw=2)\n    ax.plot(x_c2, y_c2, z_c2, label='C2: Preimage of (1,0,0)', lw=2)\n\n    # Plot the point where C1 pierces the plane of C2\n    ax.scatter([np.sqrt(0.5)], [0], [0], color='red', s=100, label='Linking Point')\n\n    # Formatting the plot\n    ax.set_xlabel('X axis')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Y axis')\n    ax.set_zlabel('Z axis')\n    ax.set_title('Preimage Curves C1 and C2 for Hopfion')\n    ax.legend()\n    ax.grid(True)\n    ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')\n    \n    # Set view for clarity\n    ax.view_init(elev=25, azim=-50)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe plot shows that the blue circle (C1) and the orange loop (C2) are linked together once.\")\n    print(\"The linking number Lk(C1, C2) is therefore +/- 1.\")\n    print(\"By convention, the Hopf Charge Q_H is taken to be positive.\")\n\n    # The final answer\n    hopf_charge = 1\n    print(f\"\\nThe Hopf charge of this field is {hopf_charge}.\")\n\n    plt.show()\n\n# Run the function\nplot_hopfion_preimages()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
