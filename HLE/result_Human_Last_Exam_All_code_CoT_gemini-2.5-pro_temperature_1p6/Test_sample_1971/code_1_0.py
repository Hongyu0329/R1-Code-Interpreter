    # --- Part 1: Derivation of beta ---
    # The variation of the super-cosmological constant term, L_cos, must be a
    # total derivative. We enforce the stronger condition that the terms linear
    # in the auxiliary field S vanish.
    # The S-linear terms in the variation delta(L_cos) are collected:
    # 1. From delta(e) in alpha*e*S: (alpha*e*kappa/2) * S * epsilon_bar*gamma*psi
    # 2. From delta(S) in alpha*e*S: (-alpha*e*kappa/4) * S * epsilon_bar*gamma*psi
    # 3. From delta(psi) in the gravitino term: (alpha*e*kappa*beta) * S * epsilon_bar*gamma*psi
    #
    # Summing these gives: alpha*e*kappa * (1/4 + beta) * S * epsilon_bar*gamma*psi
    # For this to vanish, the coefficient must be zero.
    # 1/4 + beta = 0  =>  beta = -1/4

    # --- Part 2: Derivation of alpha^2 ---
    # The scalar potential for the field S is V(S) = (1/3)S^2 - alpha*S.
    # Minimizing V(S) gives the vacuum expectation value (VEV) S_0.
    # dV/dS = (2/3)S - alpha = 0  => S_0 = 3*alpha/2.
    # The effective cosmological constant Lambda is the value of V at the minimum.
    # Lambda_eff = V(S_0) = (1/3)*(3*alpha/2)^2 - alpha*(3*alpha/2) = -3*alpha^2/4.
    #
    # The Ricci scalar R of the vacuum solution is related to Lambda_eff by the
    # trace of the Einstein equations: R = 4*kappa^2 * Lambda_eff.
    # R = 4*kappa^2 * (-3*alpha^2 / 4) = -3*kappa^2*alpha^2.
