    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. At steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which means their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero.\n\nLet $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\cdot P_0 + 0.65 \\cdot P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\cdot P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) \\cdot P_1 + 0.392 \\cdot P_2 + 0.008 \\cdot P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\cdot P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\cdot P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\cdot P_2 - 0.008 \\cdot P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nThe sum of the first four equations is zero, which means one of them is redundant. We can solve for the four unknown probabilities ($P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$) by using three of the first four equations and the normalization condition (equation 5).\n\nThe plan is to set this up as a matrix equation, $A\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{b}$, and solve it using Python with the NumPy library.\nThe equations we will use are:\n*   $-0.019 \\cdot P_0 + 0.65 \\cdot P_1 = 0$\n*   $0.4 \\cdot P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\cdot P_2 = 0 \\implies 0.4 \\cdot P_1 - 0.4 \\cdot P_2 = 0$\n*   $0.008 \\cdot P_2 - 0.008 \\cdot P_3 = 0$\n*   $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nThis gives a system of 4 linear equations with 4 variables, which can be solved. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# For the steady-state solution, we set the derivatives to zero.\n# This results in a system of linear equations. We can represent this\n# in matrix form A*P = b, where P = [P0, P1, P2, P3]^T.\n# We will use three of the balance equations and the normalization condition.\n#\n# 1. -lambda_01*P0 + lambda_10*P1 = 0\n# 2. lambda_12*P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*P2 = 0\n# 3. lambda_23*P2 - lambda_31*P3 = 0\n# 4. P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n#\n# The matrix A and vector b are:\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations A*P = b\ntry:\n    P = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    P0 = P[0]\n    P1 = P[1]\n    \n    # Calculate the required sum\n    result = P0 + P1\n    \n    # Print the result in the requested format\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = P0 + P1\")\n    print(f\"                    = {P0} + {P1}\")\n    print(f\"                    = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations could not be solved due to a singularity.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
