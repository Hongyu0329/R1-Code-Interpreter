    "The specific heat scaling exponent, α, can be calculated using the epsilon expansion in the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory. This method provides an approximation for critical exponents in a spatial dimension `d` that is slightly below the upper critical dimension `d_c`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the Model and Parameters**: The problem relates to the O(N) model of magnetism. The key parameters are the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c`, and the number of spin components `N`. For this model, `d_c` is 4. The problem specifies `d=3`. Since `N` is not specified, we will assume the most common case, the Ising model, for which `N=1`.\n2.  **Define the Epsilon Expansion**: The expansion parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Formula**: The formula for the specific heat exponent α, to the first order in `ϵ`, is given by:\n    α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: Substitute the values of `d`, `d_c`, and `N` into the formula to compute α. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print each step.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Parameters for the calculation\nd = 3      # Spatial dimension\nd_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the O(N) model\nN = 1      # Number of spin components (assuming the Ising model)\n\n# --- Explanation ---\nprint(\"This script calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α for d=3 using the epsilon expansion from renormalization group theory.\")\nprint(\"The general formula for α to the first order in epsilon (ϵ = d_c - d) for the O(N) model is:\")\nprint(\"α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ\\n\")\n\n# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Define the system parameters.\")\nprint(f\"  - Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\nprint(f\"  - Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\nprint(f\"  - Number of spin components, N = {N} (assuming the Ising model)\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the expansion parameter ϵ.\")\nepsilon = d_c - d\nprint(f\"  ϵ = d_c - d\")\nprint(f\"  ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Substitute the parameters into the formula for α.\")\n# Retrieve each number for the equation output\nnumerator_term_1 = 4\nnumerator_term_2 = N\ndenominator_term_1 = 2\ndenominator_term_2 = N\ndenominator_term_3 = 8\nfinal_epsilon = epsilon\n\n# Print the equation with all numbers\nprint(f\"  α = ({numerator_term_1} - {numerator_term_2}) / ({denominator_term_1} * ({denominator_term_2} + {denominator_term_3})) * {final_epsilon}\")\n\n# Calculate intermediate values for clarity\nnumerator_val = numerator_term_1 - numerator_term_2\ndenominator_intermediate = denominator_term_2 + denominator_term_3\ndenominator_val = denominator_term_1 * denominator_intermediate\nprint(f\"  α = {numerator_val} / ({denominator_term_1} * {denominator_intermediate}) * {final_epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"  α = {numerator_val} / {denominator_val} * {final_epsilon}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 4: Compute the final value of α.\")\nalpha_fraction = Fraction(numerator_val * epsilon, denominator_val)\nalpha_decimal = float(alpha_fraction)\n\nprint(f\"  The exact value of α as a fraction is: {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\")\nprint(f\"  The decimal value is α ≈ {alpha_decimal:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
