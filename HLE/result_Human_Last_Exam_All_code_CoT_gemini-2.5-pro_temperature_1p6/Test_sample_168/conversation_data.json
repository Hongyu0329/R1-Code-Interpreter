    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  First, I need to understand the question. The question asks which animal can hear a sound that humans typically cannot: the sound of our own muscles twitching. This implies the sound is either too low or too high in frequency, or too low in volume for us to perceive.\n2.  I will research the frequency of the sound produced by human muscle contractions. This is known as mechanomyography or acoustomyography. The frequency is very low, typically in the 5-45 Hz range.\n3.  Next, I will research the hearing frequency ranges of all the animals listed in the options: Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, and Human.\n4.  I will then write a Python script to compare the muscle twitch frequency range with the hearing range of each animal.\n5.  The script will print out the frequency data for the muscle twitch and for each animal's hearing.\n6.  The script will analyze which animal's hearing range best matches the ultra-low frequency of muscle twitches. While some animals, like baleen whales, can hear in this range, the herring is famously known for its extreme sensitivity to low-frequency pressure waves in water, a key survival trait to detect predators. This specific sensitivity makes it the classic answer to this question.\n7.  The script will conclude by stating the most likely animal.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine which one\n    might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of the sound source (human muscle twitches).\n    muscle_twitch_min_hz = 5\n    muscle_twitch_max_hz = 45\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the frequency of human muscle twitches.\")\n    # The user asked to show numbers in an equation-like format.\n    # We will represent the range as: Low_End <= Frequency <= High_End\n    print(f\"The sound frequency of a muscle twitch is in the range: {muscle_twitch_min_hz} Hz <= F <= {muscle_twitch_max_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(\"This is a very low frequency, mostly classified as 'infrasound'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Compare this frequency with the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the hearing range of each animal.\")\n\n    # Human\n    human_min_hz = 20\n    print(f\"A.
