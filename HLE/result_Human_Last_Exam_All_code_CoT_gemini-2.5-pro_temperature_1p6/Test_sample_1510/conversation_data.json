    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, I will determine which of the possible 2D crystallographic point groups (also known as crystal classes) have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The two point groups with order 2 are C2 (2-fold rotation) and D1 (or 'm', a single reflection).\n\n2.  **List All Wallpaper Groups:** I will create a comprehensive list of all 17 wallpaper groups and associate each one with its corresponding point group and the order of that point group.\n\n3.  **Filter and Count:** I will then filter this list to find only those wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n4.  **Group and Sum:** Finally, I will group the results by their point group type (C2 or D1), count the number of wallpaper groups in each, and sum these counts to get the total number. The code will print out this detailed breakdown and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n    It prints a detailed breakdown of the groups and the final calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its\n    # point group (crystal class) and the order of that point group.\n    # The notation used is: Hermann-Mauguin for wallpaper groups, Schoenflies for point groups.\n    # D1 is also commonly denoted as 'm'.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        'p1': ('C1', 1),\n        'p2': ('C2', 2),\n        'pm': ('D1', 2),\n        'pg': ('D1', 2),\n        'cm': ('D1', 2),\n        'p2mm': ('D2', 4),\n        'p2mg': ('D2', 4),\n        'p2gg': ('D2', 4),\n        'c2mm': ('D2', 4),\n        'p4': ('C4', 4),\n        'p4mm': ('D4', 8),\n        'p4gm': ('D4', 8),\n        'p3': ('C3', 3),\n        'p3m1': ('D3', 6),\n        'p31m': ('D3', 6),\n        'p6': ('C6', 6),\n        'p6mm': ('D6', 12)\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n\n    # Group the wallpaper groups by their point group name if the order is 2\n    groups_by_point_group = {}\n    for group_name, (pg_name, pg_order) in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if pg_order == target_order:\n            if pg_name not in groups_by_point_group:\n                groups_by_point_group[pg_name] = []\n            groups_by_point_group[pg_name].append(group_name)\n\n    print(f\"Finding wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order}:\\n\")\n\n    counts = []\n    # Print the detailed results\n    for pg_name in sorted(groups_by_point_group.keys()):\n        groups = groups_by_point_group[pg_name]\n        count = len(groups)\n        counts.append(count)\n        print(f\"Point Group {pg_name} (order {target_order}):\")\n        print(f\"  - Count: {count}\")\n        print(f\"  - Groups: {', '.join(sorted(groups))}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    # Print the final calculation and total\n    total_count = sum(counts)\n    calculation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{calculation_string} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
