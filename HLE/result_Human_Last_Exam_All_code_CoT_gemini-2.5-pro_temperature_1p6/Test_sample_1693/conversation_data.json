    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Scope**: The search is for a French ship of any type, sunk by a German U-boat (either directly by torpedo/gunfire or indirectly by a mine laid by a U-boat). The sinking must have occurred between September 3, 1939, and June 22, 1940. \"Largest\" will be determined by Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n2.  **Research**: I will consult naval history records, specifically looking at lists of Allied ships sunk during this period. I will cross-reference the nationality, cause of sinking, date, and tonnage.\n3.  **Identify Candidates**: Key candidates are the tanker *Emile Miguet* (14,115 GRT, sunk by torpedo from U-48) and the passenger liner *SS Champlain* (28,124 GRT, sunk by a mine laid by U-65).\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: Comparing the two, the *SS Champlain* had a significantly larger tonnage. Its sinking on June 17, 1940, falls within the specified timeframe.\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script to present this finding, clearly stating the ship's name, its tonnage, the date it was sunk, and the responsible U-boat, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the ship and the event\n    ship = {\n        \"name\": \"SS Champlain\",\n        \"type\": \"passenger liner\",\n        \"tonnage_grt\": 28124,\n        \"sunk_date_day\": 17,\n        \"sunk_date_month\": \"June\",\n        \"sunk_date_year\": 1940,\n        \"u_boat_number\": 65,\n        \"cause\": \"a mine laid by the U-boat\",\n        \"armistice_date_day\": 22,\n        \"armistice_date_month\": \"June\",\n        \"armistice_date_year\": 1940\n    }\n\n    # Print the detailed answer\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of {ship['armistice_date_month']} {ship['armistice_date_day']}, {ship['armistice_date_year']} was the {ship['type']} '{ship['name']}'.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {ship['sunk_date_month']} {ship['sunk_date_day']}, {ship['sunk_date_year']} after striking {ship['cause']} U-{ship['u_boat_number']}.\")\n\n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final statement\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Figures ---\")\n    print(f\"Ship's displacement: {ship['tonnage_grt']} GRT\")\n    print(f\"U-boat involved: {ship['u_boat_number']}\")\n    print(f\"Year of sinking: {ship['sunk_date_year']}\")\n    print(f\"Day of sinking: {ship['sunk_date_day']}\")\n    print(f\"Year of armistice: {ship['armistice_date_year']}\")\n    print(f\"Day of armistice: {ship['armistice_date_day']}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner SS Champlain, with a displacement of 28,124 GRT.
