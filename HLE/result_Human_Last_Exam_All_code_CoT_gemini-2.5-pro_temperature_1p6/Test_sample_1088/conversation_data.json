    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set like 6-311G** is not a single number; it depends on the specific atom it is applied to. I will provide a Python script that calculates this value for representative atoms (Hydrogen and Carbon) and explains the calculation step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**)**:\n    *   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n        *   **6**: The core electrons (like 1s in Carbon) are described by a single function that is a combination of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   **311**: The valence electrons (like 1s in Hydrogen or 2s/2p in Carbon) are described by three functions. The first is a combination of **3** primitives, the second is a single primitive (**1**), and the third is also a single primitive (**1**).\n    *   **\\*\\***: This part describes the addition of \"polarization functions\" to improve accuracy.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set of d-functions consists of **6** primitives.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type functions to hydrogen atoms. A standard set of p-functions consists of **3** primitives.\n\n2.  **Calculate for Specific Atoms**:\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H)**: It has no core electrons. We'll sum the primitives for its valence 1s orbital (`3+1+1`) and the p-type polarization functions (`3`).\n    *   **For Carbon (C)**: It has a 1s core (`6`), 2s and 2p valence orbitals (each calculated with `3+1+1`), and d-type polarization functions (`6`).\n\n3.  **Python Script**: I will write a script that performs these calculations and prints the final equations for both Hydrogen and Carbon.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G**\n    basis set for Hydrogen and Carbon atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom.\")\n    print(\"Here is the calculation for Hydrogen and Carbon as examples:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for Hydrogen (H) ---\n    # Hydrogen has one valence electron (1s) and no core electrons.\n    # The '311' rule applies to its valence s-orbital.\n    # The second '*' in '**' adds p-functions to H.\n    h_val_s = 3 + 1 + 1\n    h_pol_p = 3  # A set of p-functions (px, py, pz)\n    h_total = h_val_s + h_pol_p\n\n    print(\"--- For a Hydrogen (H) atom ---\")\n    print(\"It has no core electrons.
