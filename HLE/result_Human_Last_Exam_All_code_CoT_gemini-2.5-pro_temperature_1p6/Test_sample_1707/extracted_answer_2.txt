The final equation to be solved for T is: alpha = T * S
where S is the sum of two geometric series.

The numbers in this equation are:
alpha = 10^10000
S = 2 / (10^5000000 - 1)

The solution for T is a very large integer. Its exact value is:
T = (10^5010000 - 10^10000) / 2

This integer T has the following structure:
 - The digit 4
 - Followed by 4,999,999 repetitions of the digit 9
 - Followed by the digit 5
 - Followed by 9,999 repetitions of the digit 0
