    # General Principle: Duty of Confidentiality

    # The Public Safety Exception
    exception_rule = "However, there is a 'public safety exception' (Rule 3.3-3). A lawyer MAY disclose confidential information, but NO MORE THAN IS REQUIRED, when the lawyer reasonably believes there is an IMMINENT RISK of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure is necessary to prevent the harm."
    
    # Applying the facts to the exception
    analysis = {
        "1. Reasonable Belief?": "Yes. Eric made a specific threat ('I bought a gun... going to my wife's apartment tonight to end things') which, given his recent behaviour, James could reasonably believe to be credible.",
        "2. Imminent Risk?": "Yes. The timeline given by Eric was 'tonight', which is clearly an imminent risk.",
        "3. Death or Serious Bodily Harm?": "Yes. The stated plan was a murder-suicide, the most extreme form of death and harm.",
        "4. Disclosure Necessary?": "Yes. Disclosure to the police was the only practical way to intervene and prevent the tragedy.",
        "5. Was it 'No More Than Required'?": "Mostly. Information like names and local addresses was essential. The Florida vacation properties might have been excessive, but in a crisis, the core disclosure was justified and done in good faith."

    # Evaluating the multiple-choice options
    conclusion = """
    Based on the analysis, James's actions were justified under the public safety exception.

    - Option A is incorrect: The threat was imminent.
    - Option B is incorrect: The duty of confidentiality is not absolute and has this exception.
    - Option C is a possibility, but the over-disclosure of minor details (Florida properties) likely does not invalidate the fundamentally correct and necessary decision to disclose the core threat.
    - Option D is incorrect: Disclosure is discretionary ('may'), not mandatory ('must'), and is justified by the threat, not the police request.
    - Option E is the best fit. James acted on a reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure was necessary to prevent that harm. This aligns perfectly with the justification for the public safety exception.
