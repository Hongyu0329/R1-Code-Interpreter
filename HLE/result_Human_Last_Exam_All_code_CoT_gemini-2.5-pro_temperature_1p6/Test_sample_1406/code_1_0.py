# Step 1: Define the problem in the context of our code.
# The goal is to count the number of positive integers 'n' for which the n-cube [0,1]^n
# fails to be the set of non-block points of any continuum.

# Step 2: Analyze the case for n >= 2.
# A point 'p' in a space 'X' is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a
# dense subset that is continuum-connected.
# For the n-cube X = [0,1]^n where n >= 2, if we remove any point p,
# the resulting space X \ {p} is path-connected.
# Any path between two points is a continuum (a compact connected set).
# Therefore, for n >= 2, X \ {p} is continuum-connected for any p in X.
# This implies that every point in [0,1]^n is a non-block point of [0,1]^n.
# So, for n >= 2, the set of non-block points of the n-cube is the n-cube itself.
# Thus, for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., the n-cube does occur as the set of non-block points.
# The number of failing cases for n >= 2 is zero.
num_failures_for_n_ge_2 = 0

# Step 3: Analyze the case for n = 1.
# The 1-cube is the interval [0,1]. A significant theorem in continuum theory,
# proven by mathematicians like Villani and Charatonik, states that the interval [0,1]
# CANNOT be the set of non-block points for any continuum.
# The topological properties of the interval, specifically the distinction between its
# two endpoints and its interior points, make this impossible.
# Therefore, the case n=1 is a failure.
num_failures_for_n1 = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of failing cases.
# The total is the sum of failures over all positive integers n.
# This is the failure for n=1 plus the failures for n>=2.
total_failures = num_failures_for_n1 + num_failures_for_n_ge_2

# Step 5: Print the final calculation and the result.
print(f"Analysis complete.")
print(f"Number of failing cases for n=1: {num_failures_for_n1}")
print(f"Number of failing cases for n>=2: {num_failures_for_n_ge_2}")
print(f"The total count of failing integers n is the sum of these cases:")
print(f"{num_failures_for_n1} + {num_failures_for_n_ge_2} = {total_failures}")
