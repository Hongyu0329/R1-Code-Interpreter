    Step-by-Step Analysis:

    1.  Information Breakdown:
        -   CA (watermelon-adapted) biotype thrives on a raffinose-rich diet (3:8 sucrose:raffinose). Raffinose is a Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide (RFO).
        -   MA (cotton-adapted) biotype thrives on a sucrose-only diet.
        -   Inference: Watermelon is likely high in raffinose; Cotton is likely low in raffinose and high in sucrose.
        -   Biological Principle: Metabolizing raffinose requires the enzyme galactosidase. Enzyme production is often induced by its substrate.

    2.  Evaluating the Answer Choices:
        A. 'CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.'
           - This is TRUE. The text explicitly states CA does well on a raffinose-rich diet while MA does well on a sucrose-only diet.

        B. 'CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.'
           - This is TRUE. This is a direct summary of the first sentence.

        C. 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.'
           - This is TRUE. CA moves from high-raffinose (watermelon) to low-raffinose (cotton). The enzyme for raffinose (galactosidase) would decrease due to the lack of its substrate.

        D. 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.'
           - This is NOT TRUE. While galactosidase activity would decrease, the direct cause is the *lower raffinose level* (the substrate), not necessarily a higher glucose level. This statement presents an incorrect cause for the effect.

        E. 'Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.'
           - This is TRUE. MA moves from low-raffinose (cotton) to high-raffinose (watermelon). The aphid would likely increase the production of the enzyme (galactosidase) needed to process the newly abundant substrate.

    3.  Conclusion:
        -   The statement that is not true is D because it attributes the change in enzyme activity to the wrong cause.
