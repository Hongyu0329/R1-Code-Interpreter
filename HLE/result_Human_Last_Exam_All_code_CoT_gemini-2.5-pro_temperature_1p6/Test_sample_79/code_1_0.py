It means the parent generation dies before the offspring generation reproduces. It does not preclude the possibility of parental care before the parents die.")

However, broad-sense heritability is H^2 = 0.7, meaning 30% of phenotypic variance is due to the environment. The problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the west and east halves. A systematic environmental difference (e.g., climate, resources) could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype.")
