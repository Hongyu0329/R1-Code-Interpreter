    "My plan is to first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for the specific philosophical decomposition mentioned in the query. My knowledge base indicates that Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the school, analyzed the concept of a \"hallmark\" (or \"criterion\") by distinguishing between \"symptoms\" (fallible indicators) and \"signals\" (infallible indicators).\n\nOnce the philosopher is identified, I will write a simple Python script. The script's purpose is to declare the answer as a string variable and then use the `print()` function to output the name, fulfilling the request to provide a solution via code.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify a specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n# The key concepts are the decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n# Based on philosophical history, this work is attributed to Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n# The following code will print the name of the philosopher.\nphilosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\nprint(\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who made this distinction is:\")\nprint(philosopher_name)\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
