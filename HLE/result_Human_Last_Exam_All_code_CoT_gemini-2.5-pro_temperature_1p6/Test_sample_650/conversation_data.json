    "My plan is to analyze the computational time complexity of the given `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Initialization:** I will examine the cost of the operations performed before the loop begins.\n2.  **Analyze the Loop Condition and Iterations:** The core of the algorithm's complexity lies in the `while` loop. I will determine how many times the loop runs as a function of the inputs `n` and `c`. The key is to observe how the value of `q` decreases in each iteration.\n3.  **Analyze the Loop Body:** I will assess the cost of the operations performed inside each loop iteration.\n4.  **Combine the Results:** I will combine the costs from the initialization, the number of loop iterations, and the loop body to determine the overall time complexity using Big-O notation.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this detailed step-by-step explanation, concluding with the final time complexity formula. This script will also explicitly print the characters of the final formula to adhere to the prompt's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step analysis of the computational\n    time complexity for the provided IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nTo find the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm, we analyze the number of fundamental operations it performs relative to the size of the input 'n'.\n\nStep 1: Analyze Initialization\nThe first step of the algorithm is:\n`i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\nThis block consists of a fixed number of operations: two assignments, one division/floor operation, one multiplication, and one subtraction. The time taken for these operations does not grow with 'n' (assuming 'n' fits in a machine word). Therefore, the complexity of the initialization step is constant, or O(1).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the `while` loop\nThe main work of the algorithm happens in the `while q > 0` loop. The total running time is dominated by the number of times this loop executes.\n- **Loop Progression:** The value of `q` is what controls the loop. Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`. Inside the loop, the value of `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`. This means the number being processed is effectively divided by the base `c` in each iteration.\n- **Number of Iterations:** The loop will continue as long as `q > 0`. This process of repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` will continue until the result is 0. The number of times you can divide a number `n` by a base `c` before it becomes less than 1 is defined by the logarithm: `log_c(n)`. Thus, the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times. For complexity analysis, this is O(log_c(n)).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Loop Body\nThe operations inside the loop are:\n`i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\nSimilar to the initialization step, this block contains a fixed number of basic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). The cost of a single iteration is constant, or O(1).\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the initialization cost and the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration.\nTotal Time = (Initialization Cost) + (Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)\nT(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) * O(1)\nT(n) = O(log_c(n))\n\nThe final computational time complexity is logarithmic in `n`.\n\nThe final equation representing the time complexity T(n, c) is:\nO(log_c(n))\n\nTo fulfill the prompt's requirement, here are the individual components of the final equation:\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n    final_equation = \"O(log_c(n))\"\n    for char in final_equation:\n        print(char, end=\" \")\n    print()\n\nanalyze_complexity()\n```\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
