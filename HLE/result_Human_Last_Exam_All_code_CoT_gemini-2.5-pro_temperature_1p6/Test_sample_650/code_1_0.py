To find the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm, we analyze the number of fundamental operations it performs relative to the size of the input 'n'.

Step 1: Analyze Initialization
The first step of the algorithm is:
`i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`
This block consists of a fixed number of operations: two assignments, one division/floor operation, one multiplication, and one subtraction. The time taken for these operations does not grow with 'n' (assuming 'n' fits in a machine word). Therefore, the complexity of the initialization step is constant, or O(1).

Step 2: Analyze the `while` loop
The main work of the algorithm happens in the `while q > 0` loop. The total running time is dominated by the number of times this loop executes.
- **Loop Progression:** The value of `q` is what controls the loop. Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`. Inside the loop, the value of `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`. This means the number being processed is effectively divided by the base `c` in each iteration.
- **Number of Iterations:** The loop will continue as long as `q > 0`. This process of repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` will continue until the result is 0. The number of times you can divide a number `n` by a base `c` before it becomes less than 1 is defined by the logarithm: `log_c(n)`. Thus, the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times. For complexity analysis, this is O(log_c(n)).

Step 3: Analyze the Loop Body
The operations inside the loop are:
`i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`
Similar to the initialization step, this block contains a fixed number of basic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). The cost of a single iteration is constant, or O(1).

Step 4: Conclusion
The total time complexity is the sum of the initialization cost and the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration.
Total Time = (Initialization Cost) + (Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)
T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) * O(1)
T(n) = O(log_c(n))

The final computational time complexity is logarithmic in `n`.

The final equation representing the time complexity T(n, c) is:
O(log_c(n))
