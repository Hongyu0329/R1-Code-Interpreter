    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert them from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be accurately represented if it falls outside the gamut of the destination color space (sRGB).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Gamut Concept:** The ROMM RGB color space (which is based on ProPhoto RGB) has a much larger gamut (range of colors) than the standard sRGB color space. When we convert a color from a larger gamut to a smaller one, some colors may fall outside the destination's range. These are called \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n2.  **The Conversion Process:** A standard conversion involves two main stages:\n    a. **Linearization:** ROMM RGB values are encoded with a gamma of 1.8. We first need to convert these to linear values. This is done by raising each component (R, G, B) to the power of 1.8.\n    b. **Linear Transformation:** We then apply a 3x3 transformation matrix to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values.\n3.  **Check for Gamut Clipping:** After the matrix transformation, we get the resulting linear sRGB values. For a color to be representable in sRGB, all its linear components (R, G, and B) must be within the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of sRGB's gamut and cannot be represented without clipping, which alters the color.\n4.  **Implementation:** The Python code below will perform these steps for each given color. It will linearize the inputs, apply the standard conversion matrix, and then check if the results are within the `[0.0, 1.0]` range. Colors that fail this check are the ones that cannot be represented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the colors to be tested.
