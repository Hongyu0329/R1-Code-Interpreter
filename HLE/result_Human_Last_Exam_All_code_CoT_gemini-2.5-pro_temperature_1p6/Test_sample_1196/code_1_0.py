# The user wants to identify the scenario most likely to cause a misleading GWAS association due to Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).
#
# A misleading association occurs when a genotyped SNP shows a strong statistical signal,
# not because it is the causal variant, but because it is strongly correlated (in LD)
# with the true, unobserved causal variant nearby. The signal effectively comes from
# the entire genomic region (the LD block or haplotype), but is "tagged" by the genotyped SNP.
#
# Let's analyze the choices:
# A. Three SNPs tightly linked within a single LD block on one chromosome.
#    - This describes a situation where it's difficult to identify the true causal variant
#      among the three, as they are all correlated. This is a valid example of the problem.
# B. Two SNPs located at the extreme ends of an LD block.
#    - Similar to A, these SNPs are still linked and would make fine-mapping the causal signal difficult.
# C. Two SNPs located on different chromosomes but within regions of high recombination.
#    - SNPs on different chromosomes are not in LD (barring population structure). High recombination
#      actively breaks down LD. This scenario is the LEAST likely to be misleading due to LD.
# D. A single SNP located centrally within an LD block but next to a recombination hotspot.
#    - The SNP is still representative of the LD block it's in. The hotspot just defines the
#      boundary of that block. This is similar to A and B.
# E. Three Tag SNPs predicting all alleles in an inherited haplotype.
#    - This is the most accurate and fundamental description of the problem in the context of a GWAS.
#      A haplotype is an LD block. "Tag SNPs" are chosen specifically to be proxies for the entire haplotype.
#      Therefore, an association with a Tag SNP is inherently an association with the haplotype.
#      This is the classic definition of an indirect association, which can be "misleading" if one
#      assumes the Tag SNP itself is the functional variant. This scenario is not just a possibility;
#      it's the intended mechanism by which GWAS leverages LD, and it perfectly encapsulates why
#      the resulting associations can be misleading about the specific causal variant.

print("Reasoning:")
print("A haplotype is a block of genetic variants (alleles) that are inherited together due to high Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).")
print("In GWAS, it is not feasible to genotype every single variant. Instead, a few 'Tag SNPs' are selected that can reliably predict the other variants within the haplotype.")
print("If a true causal variant exists somewhere within this haplotype, it will cause the entire haplotype to be associated with the trait.")
print("Consequently, the Tag SNPs for that haplotype will show a strong statistical association, even though they are likely not the causal variants themselves.")
print("This creates a 'misleading association' because the genotyped Tag SNP is just a proxy for the causal variant, which could be another SNP entirely within the same block. This is the core challenge LD presents for interpreting GWAS results.")
