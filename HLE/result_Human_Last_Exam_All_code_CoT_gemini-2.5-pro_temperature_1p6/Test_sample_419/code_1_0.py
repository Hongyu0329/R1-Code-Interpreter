    # 1. PBS Control: Cells are treated with the sugar-dependent antibody (Anti-MUC1-glyco)
    #                and the anti-flag antibody in PBS buffer.
    # 2. GalNAc Inhibition: Cells are treated with the same antibodies, but in the presence
    #                       of a high concentration of N-acetylgalactosamine (500 mM).
    #
