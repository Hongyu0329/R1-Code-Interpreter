# The problem is a game of optimization between two agents, A and B.
# My analysis leads to a game-theoretic approach to find the solution.

# Agent A's goal is to choose a move distance D to maximize its win probability.
# Our goal is to choose agent B's move distance F to minimize A's maximized win probability.
# Let P(A wins) be this minimized probability.

# Step 1: A's optimal win probability as a function of F.
# Based on the physics of the problem, A's best strategy for a given F yields a win probability of max(F, 1-F).
# P_A_wins(F) = max(F, 1 - F)

# Step 2: Minimize A's win probability by choosing the optimal F.
# We need to find the value of F in the range [0, 1] that minimizes the function max(F, 1 - F).
# The minimum occurs where F = 1 - F, which solves to F = 0.5.
optimal_F = 0.5

# Step 3: Calculate the minimized probability of A winning.
# We plug the optimal F back into A's win probability function.
# P(A wins) = max(0.5, 1 - 0.5)
minimized_prob_A_wins = max(optimal_F, 1 - optimal_F)

# Step 4: Compute the final required value.
# The problem asks for the floor of the reciprocal of this minimized probability.
# The final expression is floor(1 / P(A wins)).
numerator = 1
denominator = minimized_prob_A_wins
final_result = math.floor(numerator / denominator)

# Output the components of the final calculation as requested.
print(f"The equation for the final answer is floor({numerator} / P(A wins)).")
print(f"The minimized probability, P(A wins), is calculated as max(F, 1-F) at the optimal F.")
print(f"The optimal F that minimizes A's chances is {optimal_F}.")
print(f"This leads to P(A wins) = max({optimal_F}, 1-{optimal_F}) = {minimized_prob_A_wins}.")
print(f"So, the final calculation is: floor({numerator} / {denominator}) = {final_result}.")
