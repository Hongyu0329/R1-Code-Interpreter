        "for any reasonably smooth initial data, a unique smooth solution exists for all positive time. "
        "This property is called 'global regularity'.\n\n"
        "Therefore, a solution starting from smooth initial data will remain smooth forever and "
        "cannot 'blow up' in finite time. The situation is dramatically different in 3D, "
        "where the same question is a major unsolved problem and one of the Clay Millennium Prize Problems."
