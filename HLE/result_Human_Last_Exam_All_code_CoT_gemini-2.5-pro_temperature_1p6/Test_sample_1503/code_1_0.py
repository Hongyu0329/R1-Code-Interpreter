# (a) True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily a critical point of the energy functional J.
# Reasoning: False. The Pohozaev identity P(u,v)=0 is a necessary condition derived for critical points of J.
# It is not a sufficient condition. A function can satisfy the identity without being a solution to the underlying Euler-Lagrange equations.

# (b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) in P?
# Reasoning: No. The scaling u_t affects the anisotropic kinetic terms differently, leading to a polynomial equation in the scaling parameter t.
# Such an equation is not guaranteed to have a unique positive solution for any arbitrary function (u,v).
# Here is a demonstration with a sample polynomial that could arise from setting P(u_t, v_t) = 0.
print("--- Demonstration for (b) ---")
# Consider a hypothetical equation for t: t^4 - 5*t + 1 = 0.
# The coefficients could correspond to the norms of a particular (u,v).
equation_coeffs = [1, 0, 0, -5, 1]
roots = np.roots(equation_coeffs)
# Filter for positive real roots

    print(f"Positive real root {i+1}: {root:.4f}")
print(f"Since there are {len(positive_real_roots)} positive roots, the scaling parameter t is not unique for this example.")

# (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b) satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
# Reasoning: Yes. Finding a minimizer on the Pohozaev manifold typically involves a minimax argument.
# The functional J is maximized along scaling directions and then minimized across different functions.
# The condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0 ensures that the point is indeed a maximum along the scaling path,
# which is a fundamental part of the variational construction.
