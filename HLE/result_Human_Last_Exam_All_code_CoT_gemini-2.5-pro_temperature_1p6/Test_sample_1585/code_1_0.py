# Step 1: Analyze the conditions for the graph G.
# The graph G must be 4-regular.
# Every vertex must belong to exactly 5 induced cycles of length 5.
# This implies that for any vertex v, the subgraph induced by its 4 neighbors, G[N(v)],
# must contain exactly C(4,2) - 5 = 1 edge.

# Step 2: Count triangles in two ways.
# Let T be the total number of triangles in G.
# First way (summing over vertices):
# The number of triangles containing a vertex v is the number of edges in G[N(v)], which is 1.
# Summing over all n vertices: 3 * T = sum(edges in G[N(v)]) = n * 1 = n.
# So, T = n / 3.

# Second way (summing over edges):
# An edge (u, v) is in a triangle u-v-w if and only if w is a common neighbor.
# This means (u, v) is an edge in G[N(w)]. Since G[N(w)] has only one edge,
# every edge in the graph participates in exactly one triangle.
# Summing over all E edges: 3 * T = sum(triangles per edge) = E * 1 = E.
# Since the graph is 4-regular, the number of edges E = (4 * n) / 2 = 2n.
# So, 3 * T = 2n.

# Step 3: Find the contradiction.
# We have two equations for T:
# 1) T = n / 3
# 2) 3T = 2n
# Substitute (1) into (2): 3 * (n / 3) = 2n, which simplifies to n = 2n.
# The only integer solution to n = 2n is n = 0.

# Step 4: Determine n_2 and n_3.
# The analysis shows that no graph with n > 0 vertices can satisfy these properties,
# regardless of its planarity.
# Therefore, the set of such graphs is empty for both the 2-planar and 3-planar cases.
# The smallest possible number of vertices is thus 0.
n_2 = 0
n_3 = 0

# Step 5: Calculate the final expression.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# Output the equation with the final numbers.
print(f"Based on the analysis, no such graph with n>0 exists.")
print(f"Therefore, the only possible value for n_2 and n_3 is 0.")
print(f"n_2 = {n_2}")
print(f"n_3 = {n_3}")
print(f"The final calculation is ({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {result}")

# The final answer in the specified format
print(f"\n<<<{result}>>>")
