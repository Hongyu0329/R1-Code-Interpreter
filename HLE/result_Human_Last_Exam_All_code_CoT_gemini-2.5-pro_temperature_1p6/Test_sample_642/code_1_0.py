    Solves for the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k approaches infinity.

    1. f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing Machine to recognize
       the language L_k = {w in {0,1}* : number of 1s in w is divisible by k}.

    2. An optimal Turing Machine uses its tape to store a counter and the value k.
       The number of states, f(k), is dominated by the information needed to specify k,
       which is best encoded in binary. This requires a number of states proportional to log(k).
       So, f(k) can be modeled as: f(k) = floor(log2(k)) + C, where C is a constant.

    3. We need to compute the limit of the difference: f(k+1) - f(k).
       lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)] = lim_{k->inf} [floor(log2(k+1)) - floor(log2(k))]

    4. Let g(k) = floor(log2(k+1)) - floor(log2(k)).
       This difference g(k) is 1 if k+1 is a power of 2, and 0 otherwise.
       For example:
       g(7) = floor(log2(8)) - floor(log2(7)) = 3 - 2 = 1
       g(8) = floor(log2(9)) - floor(log2(8)) = 3 - 3 = 0

    5. The sequence of g(k) values for k=1, 2, 3, ... is {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...}.
       This sequence does not converge in the strict sense. However, the '1's become
       infinitely sparse. The proportion of k for which g(k)=1 tends to zero.
       In asymptotic analysis, such a limit is taken to be the "almost everywhere" value.

    6. The limiting value is therefore 0.
