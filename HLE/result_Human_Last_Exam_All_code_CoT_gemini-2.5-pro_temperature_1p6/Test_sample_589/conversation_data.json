    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question. First, I will identify the specific scene and movie based on your description. The key elements are a teenager, a pink bike, and a direct confrontation with an oncoming car. This points to a dramatic coming-of-age film. I have identified the movie as \"Now and Then\" (1995), produced by New Line Cinema. In the film, the character Samantha, upset about her parents' divorce, rides her pink bike head-on toward a car, which stops just in time.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to display the name of the film.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_pink_bike_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the movie\n    matching the user's description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Film details based on the query:\n    # A teenager rides a pink bike toward an oncoming car.\n    movie_title = \"Now and Then\"\n    studio = \"New Line Cinema\"\n    year = 1995\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_with_pink_bike_scene()\n```\n<<<Now and Then>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
