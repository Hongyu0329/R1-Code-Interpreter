    # The problem specifies that X is totally-disconnected, meaning its only connected subsets are single points.

    # This space is totally-disconnected, has infinitely many points, and is compact.
    # We can define an ultrametric on S that generates the same topology, for instance:
    # d(x, y) = |x - y| is not ultrametric, but d(1/n, 1/m) = max(1/n, 1/m) and d(0, 1/n) = 1/n is.
