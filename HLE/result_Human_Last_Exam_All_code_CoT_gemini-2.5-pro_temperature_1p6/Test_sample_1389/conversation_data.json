    "An all-or-nothing vaccine model is one where the vaccine either provides complete, sterile immunity to an individual or it provides no protection at all. Let's denote the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected as *p*. This proportion *p* is the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p), because for this fraction of people, the risk of infection per exposure is reduced by 100%, while for the (1-*p*) fraction, the risk is reduced by 0%. The population average reduction in risk per exposure is therefore *p*.\n\nNow, let's analyze the metric `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)`.\n\n1.  **Define Incidence Rates:**\n    *   Let λ be the incidence rate (hazard of infection) in the unvaccinated population. So, `IR_u = λ`.\n    *   In the vaccinated group, a proportion *p* is completely protected (rate = 0), and a proportion (1-*p*) has the same risk as the unvaccinated (rate = λ).\n    *   The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is the weighted average: `IR_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ) = (1-p) * λ`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):**\n    *   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`\n    *   `IRR = ((1-p) * λ) / λ`\n    *   `IRR = 1-p`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Vaccine Efficacy Estimate:**\n    *   The formula in question is `VE_estimate = 1 - IRR`.\n    *   Substituting our result for IRR: `VE_estimate = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The estimated vaccine efficacy (`VE_estimate`) is equal to *p*.\n    *   The true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) is also equal to *p*.\n    *   Therefore, `1 - IRR` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this conclusion with a simulated example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect stdout to a variable to prevent the user from seeing the output of the print statements\n# that are not part of the final answer.\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = None\n\n# This script will demonstrate whether 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) correctly\n# estimates the per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n# --- 1.
