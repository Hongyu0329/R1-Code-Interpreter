    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we will systematically classify all possible structures for such a category.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the basic constraints.** A category with two objects, let's call them A and B, must have an identity morphism for each object. This means two of the four morphisms are `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This leaves two additional morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Classify distributions of morphisms.** The four morphisms must belong to one of the four Hom-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, `Hom(B,B)`. We can classify the possible categories by how the two non-identity morphisms, `f` and `g`, are distributed among these sets. We only need to consider distributions that are unique up to swapping the object labels A and B.\n\n3.  **Analyze each case.** For each distribution, we must define the composition law for all composable pairs of morphisms. This composition must be associative and respect the identity morphisms. We then count the number of non-isomorphic structures that satisfy these rules.\n\n4.  **Sum the results.** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each distinct case.\n\nThis enumeration leads to the following cases and counts:\n\n*   **Case 1: Both `f` and `g` are endomorphisms on the same object (e.g., A).**\n    This means `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}` and `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`. This structure is a disjoint union of a category on B (with just one object and its identity) and a category on A with one object and three morphisms. A one-object category is a monoid. We need to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, which is a known result in algebra to be 7.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both `f` and `g` are morphisms between the two distinct objects in the same direction (e.g., A to B).**\n    This means `Hom(A,B) = {f, g}`, and the only other morphisms are identities. There are no composable pairs of non-identity morphisms, so the category laws are trivially satisfied. Since `f` and `g` have no composition rules to distinguish them, they are interchangeable. This leads to just 1 category.\n\n*   **Case 3: One endomorphism on each object.**\n    This means `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}` and `Hom(B,B) = {id_B, g}`. This is a disjoint union of two one-object, two-morphism categories (monoids of order 2). There are two types of monoids of order 2 (one where `f o f = f`, and one where `f o f = id_A`). We can pair them up in three non-isomorphic ways: (type 1, type 1), (type 2, type 2), and (type 1, type 2). This gives 3 categories.\n\n*   **Case 4: One endomorphism (e.g., on A) and one morphism between distinct objects (e.g., A to B).**\n    This means `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}` and `Hom(A,B) = {g}`. The monoid structure on A gives two possibilities (`f o f = f` or `f o f = id_A`). For each, the composition `g o f` is forced to be `g`. Both possibilities lead to valid, non-isomorphic categories. This gives 2 categories.\n\n*   **Case 5: One morphism in each direction between the distinct objects.**\n    This means `Hom(A,B) = {f}` and `Hom(B,A) = {g}`. The composition laws are forced by the available morphisms: `g o f` must be `id_A`, and `f o g` must be `id_B`. This structure is well-defined and is known as the \"walking isomorphism\". It gives 1 category.\n\nThe following Python code sums up the counts from these cases to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    The explanation of each case is printed, followed by the final calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the number of categories with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms,\")\n    print(\"we first note that 2 morphisms must be the identities, id_A and id_B.\")\n    print(\"We then classify categories based on the distribution of the remaining 2 morphisms, f and g.\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: Both f, g in Hom(A, A).
