The patient's chronic multi-system symptoms (facial rash, joint pain, fever, blood in urine) are highly characteristic of an autoimmune disease, most likely Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The acute event, a rapid decline in kidney function to the point of needing dialysis, is a classic presentation of a severe flare of lupus nephritis.

The cause of kidney damage in lupus nephritis is the deposition of large quantities of immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) within the glomeruli of the kidneys. This deposition triggers a powerful inflammatory cascade that activates the classical complement pathway. As the complement system is activated to attack these complexes, its components, specifically C3 and C4, are consumed and their levels in the blood drop significantly.

Therefore, a sharp decrease in serum C3 and C4 complement levels would have been the most direct and crucial lab finding to indicate the cause of the rapid renal function decline, as it directly reflects the active, immune-mediated assault on the kidneys.

Final Answer: The lab parameter that could have best indicated the cause of the rapid renal function decline is Decreased C3 and C4 complement levels.
