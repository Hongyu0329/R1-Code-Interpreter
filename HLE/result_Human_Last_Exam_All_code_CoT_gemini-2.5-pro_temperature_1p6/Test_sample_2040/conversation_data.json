    "Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effect, including SPDC, is a lack of inversion symmetry (i.e., the material must be non-centrosymmetric).\n\nIdeal, defect-free, flat boron nanosheets (borophene) in their most commonly synthesized forms (like the β12 and χ3 phases) possess a center of inversion symmetry. In such centrosymmetric structures, the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Therefore, an ideal, free-standing boron nanosheet would **not** be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\nHowever, in any real-world sample, this ideal symmetry can be broken. Factors that could break the inversion symmetry and potentially lead to a weak SPDC signal include:\n*   **Structural imperfections:** Wrinkles, ripples, or folds in the sheet.\n*   **Edges:** The atoms at the edge of the nanosheet are in a different environment, which breaks the symmetry locally.\n*   **Defects:** Vacancies or impurities in the crystal lattice.\n*   **Strain:** Applying mechanical strain to the nanosheet can distort the lattice and break the inversion symmetry.\n\nWhile these effects could induce a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, it would likely be very small compared to materials specifically designed for nonlinear optics (e.g., BBO, KDP crystals). In conclusion, while theoretically disallowed in perfect structures, a weak SPDC effect might be observable in realistic boron nanosheets due to symmetry-breaking defects and imperfections.\n\nHere is a Python script that models the energy conservation law at the heart of the SPDC process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the pump photon wavelength (e.g., from a common green laser) and a chosen signal photon wavelength.\n2.  Use the energy conservation equation for SPDC to calculate the corresponding idler photon wavelength. The equation, in terms of wavelength (λ), is: `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`.\n3.  Rearrange the formula to solve for the idler wavelength: `λ_idler = 1 / (1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal)`.\n4.  Print the pump, signal, and the calculated idler wavelengths as a formatted equation to show the final result, including all the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan: Demonstrate the energy conservation principle in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n# 1. Define the wavelength of the incoming high-energy photon (the \"pump\").\n# 2. Define the wavelength of one of the down-converted photons (the \"signal\").\n# 3. Calculate the wavelength of the other down-converted photon (the \"idler\") based on the law of energy conservation.\n#    The equation is: 1/lambda_pump = 1/lambda_signal + 1/lambda_idler\n# 4.
