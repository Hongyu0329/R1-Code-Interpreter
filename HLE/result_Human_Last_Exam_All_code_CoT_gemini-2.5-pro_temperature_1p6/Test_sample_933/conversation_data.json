    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), we need to review the standard industrial and laboratory production methods.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The most common method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  **State the Chemical Equation:** The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄.\n3.  **Investigate Reaction Conditions:** This reaction is typically performed by heating the reactants in a sealed nickel vessel. The outcome is highly dependent on the temperature, pressure, and ratio of reactants.\n4.  **Determine Optimal Temperature:** According to established chemical literature, heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (in a volume ratio of approximately 1:5) to 400°C is the standard condition for producing Xenon tetrafluoride efficiently.\n5.  **Evaluate Other Temperatures:**\n    *   At temperatures significantly lower than 400°C, the reaction rate is too slow to be considered efficient.\n    *   At higher temperatures (e.g., above 600°C) and with an excess of fluorine, the reaction tends to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard synthesis methods, 400°C is the established temperature for efficient XeF₄ production. Among the choices provided, it represents the coldest temperature at which this efficiency is achieved.\n\nThe following Python code will print the explanation and the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_xenon_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine the\n    optimal temperature from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Answer choices provided by the user\n    choices = {\n        'A': 600,\n        'B': 400,\n        'C': 200,\n        'D': 78,\n        'E': 0,\n        'F': -78\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the synthesis process\n    explanation = (\n        \"The standard and most efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\\n\"\n        \"is by the direct chemical reaction of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2) gases.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The reaction is typically carried out by heating the elements in a sealed\\n\"\n        \"nickel container.
