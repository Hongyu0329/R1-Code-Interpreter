    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** I will first analyze the question \"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single such graph.\" The key is to understand what an \"induced subgraph\" being a clique implies.\n2.  **Formulate the Core Logic:** If a graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`, say on a set of vertices `S`, then any subset of `S` also forms a clique. This means if `G` has a clique of its largest size, `k_max` (this is called the clique number `ω(G)`), it automatically contains induced cliques of all sizes from `1` to `k_max`. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is equal to `ω(G)`.\n3.  **Transform the Problem:** The problem then becomes: what is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices?\n4.  **Solve the Transformed Problem:** The largest possible clique in a graph with `n` vertices is `n`. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`, where all vertices are connected to each other. For `n=128`, the maximum clique size is 128.\n5.  **Address Potential Ambiguity:** I'll briefly explore an alternative interpretation where the question might be misread as asking about *maximal* cliques. This interpretation leads to a more complex construction (a disjoint union of cliques) and a calculation to find how many distinct integers can sum up to 128. I will perform this calculation to demonstrate thoroughness and to satisfy the prompt's request for an \"equation\".\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** I will show that the alternative interpretation yields a much smaller number and conclude that the first, simpler interpretation is correct. The final answer is `128`.\n7.  **Final Code:** The Python code will not compute the final answer (as it's derived from logic), but will instead present this entire reasoning, including the calculation for the alternative case, and print the final, correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph on n=128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    # --- Part 1: The Correct Interpretation and Solution ---\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Problem\")\n    print(\"The problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes in a single graph with n = 128 vertices.\")\n    print(\"An induced subgraph on a set of vertices S includes all edges from the original graph between vertices in S.\")\n    print(\"If a set of vertices S forms a clique, the induced subgraph G[S] is a complete graph K_|S|.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Core Insight\")\n    print(\"If a graph has a clique of a certain size k, it automatically has induced cliques of all smaller sizes.\")\n    print(\"For example, if there is a clique of size k, any subset of j < k vertices from that clique also forms a clique.\")\n    print(\"This means the set of all possible clique sizes in a graph G is {1, 2, ..., k_max}, where k_max is the size of the largest clique in G (known as the clique number, omega(G)).\")\n    print(\"So, the number of different clique sizes is simply k_max.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Finding the Maximum\")\n    print(\"To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we must maximize the clique number k_max.\")\n    print(f\"For a graph with n = {n} vertices, the largest possible clique number is n.\")\n    print(f\"This maximum is achieved by the complete graph K_{n}, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n    print(f\"In K_{n}, any subset of k vertices forms a clique of size k.
