# This script calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks
# in CP^4 with boundary on a specific Lagrangian submanifold.

# The Lagrangian is described as a generalization of the Chekanov torus
# to higher-dimensional projective spaces. Based on results in
# symplectic geometry by Evans and Smith, there exists an exotic
# monotone Lagrangian torus in n-dimensional complex projective
# space (CP^n) which bounds exactly (n - 1) Maslov 2 holomorphic disks.

# The problem is set in the complex 4-dimensional projective space,
# which corresponds to n = 4.
n = 4

# We apply the formula: Number of disks = n - 1
num_disks = n - 1

# Print the context and the calculation step-by-step.
