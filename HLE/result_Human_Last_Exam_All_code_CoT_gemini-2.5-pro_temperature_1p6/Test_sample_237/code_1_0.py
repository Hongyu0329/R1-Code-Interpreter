    This script solves the Wuxing factorial problem by:
    1. Defining the value of z, the minimum memory size in D, based on design analysis.
    2. Implementing a bignum algorithm to calculate 100!, mirroring the optimal C code.
    3. Reconstructing the full number to find y (the first 3 digits) and to print the full result.
    4. Printing the final answer in the z:y format.
