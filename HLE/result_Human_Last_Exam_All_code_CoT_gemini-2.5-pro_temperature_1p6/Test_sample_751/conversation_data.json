    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we will follow a structured approach. The core idea of duality is that the observability properties of a system `(A, C)` are directly related to the controllability properties of its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Select an Output:** The given system has a multi-output matrix `C`. The standard observer canonical form is defined for single-output systems. Therefore, we must select one of the outputs to base our transformation on. We will choose the first output, corresponding to the first row of `C`, which is `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`. We must first verify that the pair `(A, c_1)` is observable.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transformation Matrix (P):** We need to find a similarity transformation `z(k) = P^{-1}x(k)` that converts the system `(A, c_1)` into observer canonical form `(A_o, c_1_o)`. In this form, the new output vector `c_1_o = c_1 * P` will be `[0, 0, 1]`, and the new system matrix `A_o = P^{-1}AP` will have a specific structure determined by the characteristic polynomial of `A`.\n\n3.  **Construct P using a Direct Method:** Instead of explicitly performing calculations on the dual system, we can directly construct the transformation matrix `P`. The condition `c_1_o = c_1 * P = [0, 0, 1]` and the structure of `A_o` lead to a set of linear equations for the columns of `P`. Specifically, we can find the first column of `P`, `p_1`, by solving the equation `O_1 * p_1 = [0, 0, 1]^T`, where `O_1` is the observability matrix of the pair `(A, c_1)`. The remaining columns of `P` are then found by the relations `p_2 = A * p_1` and `p_3 = A * p_2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the New C Matrix:** Once we have the correct transformation matrix `P`, we apply it to the original, full output matrix `C` to find the new output matrix in the observer canonical form basis: `C_new = C * P`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n              [2, 1, 1],\n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\n# Choose the first row of C to create a single-output system for the transformation\nc1 = C[0, :].reshape(1, -1)\nprint(\"Original A matrix:\\n\", A)\nprint(\"\\nOriginal C matrix:\\n\", C)\nprint(\"\\nSelected output vector c1 for transformation:\\n\", c1)\n\n# Step 2: Form the observability matrix for (A, c1) and check for observability\nO1 = np.vstack([c1,\n                c1 @ A,\n                c1 @ A @ A])\n\nprint(\"\\nObservability matrix O1 for (A, c1):\\n\", O1)\n\n# Check if the system is observable by checking the determinant of O1\ndet_O1 = np.linalg.det(O1)\nprint(f\"\\nDeterminant of O1: {det_O1:.2f}\")\nif abs(det_O1) < 1e-9:\n    print(\"The system (A, c1) is not observable. Cannot convert to observer canonical form.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The system (A, c1) is observable.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the transformation matrix P\n    # The first column p1 is found by solving O1 * p1 = [0, 0, 1]^T\n    # This is equivalent to p1 = inv(O1) * [0, 0, 1]^T\n    O1_inv = np.linalg.inv(O1)\n    e3 = np.array([[0], [0], [1]])\n    \n    p1 = O1_inv @ e3\n    \n    # The other columns are found by p_k+1 = A * p_k\n    p2 = A @ p1\n    p3 = A @ p2\n    \n    # Construct the transformation matrix P from its columns\n    P = np.hstack([p1, p2, p3])\n    \n    print(\"\\nTransformation matrix P:\\n\", P)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the new C matrix in the observer canonical form basis\n    C_new = C @ P\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\")\n    print(C_new)\n\n    # For verification, we can also compute the new A matrix (A_o)\n    # A_new = np.linalg.inv(P) @ A @ P\n    # print(\"\\nNew A matrix (for verification):\\n\", np.round(A_new, 5))\n\n\n<<<\n[[0.  , 0.  , 1.  ],\n [0.5 , 0.5 , 1.5 ]]\n>>>\n```"
