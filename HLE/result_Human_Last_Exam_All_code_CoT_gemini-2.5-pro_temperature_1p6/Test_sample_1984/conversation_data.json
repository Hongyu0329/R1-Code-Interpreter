    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine $m$, the number of stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:**\n    An equilibrium point of a differential equation $x'(t) = f(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. For the given equation, $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n    $$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\n    We can factor out $-x$:\n    $$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n    The quadratic term is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$:\n    $$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\n    The solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine Stability of Equilibrium Points:**\n    The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n    *   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the point is stable.\n    *   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the point is unstable.\n    *   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is needed.\n\n    First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n    $$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\n    Now, we test each equilibrium point:\n    *   **For $x = 0$:**\n        $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n        Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n    *   **For $x = 1$:**\n        $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n        The first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. Since $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for $x \\neq 1$, the sign of $f(x)$ near $x=1$ is determined by the sign of $-x$, which is negative. Thus, for values of $x$ both slightly less than 1 and slightly greater than 1, $f(x)$ is negative. This means that solutions to the left of $x=1$ move further left (away from 1), so the point is not stable.\n\n3.  **Count Stable Equilibrium Points:**\n    Based on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x = 0$. Therefore, $m = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Expression:**\n    Now we compute the final expression, $m - 2^{4048}$:\n    $$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n    The following Python code will calculate this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the final result based on the analysis of the differential equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From our analysis, the number of stable equilibrium points is m = 1.\n    m = 1\n\n    # The power in the expression 2^4048.\n    power = 4048\n    \n    # Calculate 2^4048.
