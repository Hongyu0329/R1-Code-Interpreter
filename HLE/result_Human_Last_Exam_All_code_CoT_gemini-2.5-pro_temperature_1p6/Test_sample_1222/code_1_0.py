Part (a): Does the existence of a non-zero sigma(a) imply that g acts by a reflection when sigma(a) != 0 for all arrows a in Q_1?

Answer: No.

Explanation:
The statement "The map g acts as a reflection on Q with g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}" is provided in the 'Definitions and Notation' section. This means it is a fundamental premise of the problem, an axiom upon which the entire setup is built. The existence of a non-zero map sigma(a) is a condition that depends on this setup but does not create it. The properties of g are given 'a priori' and are not implied by other conditions within the problem.

Part (b): Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.

Answer: The condition requires that the quiver Q has a single source vertex for all its arrows, let's call it i_0. The condition on d is then d = n - 2*i_0.

Explanation:
A quiver-Taft map sigma is a (1, g)-coderivation, satisfying:
Delta(sigma(x)) = (sigma @ id + g @ sigma)(Delta(x))

For an arrow a: i -> j, the coproduct is Delta(a) = a @ e_j + e_i @ a.
Applying the coderivation property to 'a' gives:
Delta(sigma(a)) = (sigma(a) @ e_j + g(a) @ sigma(e_j)) + (sigma(e_i) @ a + g(e_i) @ sigma(a))

Since sigma(e_k) = 0 for any vertex e_k, this simplifies to:
Delta(sigma(a)) = sigma(a) @ e_j + g(e_i) @ sigma(a)

The standard coproduct on the path sigma(a) (a path from i to j) is:
Delta(sigma(a)) = sigma(a) @ e_j + e_i @ sigma(a)

Comparing the two expressions for Delta(sigma(a)), we get:
e_i @ sigma(a) = g(e_i) @ sigma(a)
=> (e_i - g(e_i)) @ sigma(a) = 0

This equation implies that either sigma(a) = 0 or e_i = g(e_i).
For sigma(a) to be non-zero, its source vertex 'i' must be a fixed point of g.
Using g(e_i) = e_{n-d-i}, the condition becomes i = n - d - i, or n - d = 2i.

The question asks for a condition on 'd' such that sigma(a) != 0 for ALL arrows 'a'. This can only be true if every arrow 'a' has a source vertex 'i' that is a fixed point of g. This forces all arrows in the quiver to share the same source vertex, say i_0.
Thus, the condition on d is: n - d = 2*i_0, or d = n - 2*i_0.
