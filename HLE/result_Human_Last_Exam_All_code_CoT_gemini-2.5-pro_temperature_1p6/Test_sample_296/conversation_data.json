    "This problem can be solved by using the known properties of the Grigorchuk group, denoted as Γ. Instead of a direct computation on the group's complex structure, we can use a more straightforward approach based on its quotients and abelianization.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Utilize a key property of the Grigorchuk group:** Any subgroup of a finite index *n* in Γ corresponds to a homomorphism from Γ into the symmetric group S_n. A crucial theorem about the Grigorchuk group states that all its finite quotients are elementary abelian 2-groups (groups of the form (Z/2Z)^k).\n2.  **Apply this property:** A subgroup of index 4 means the quotient group Γ/H (where H is the normal core of the subgroup) is a group of order being a power of 2 and must be embedded in S_4. The only transitive quotient group that is an elementary abelian 2-group and has order a multiple of 4 is the Klein four-group, V4 = (Z/2Z)^2. This implies any subgroup of index 4 must be a normal subgroup.\n3.  **Use the abelianization:** Since the quotient Γ/H is abelian, the subgroup H must contain the commutator subgroup [Γ,Γ]. Therefore, finding subgroups of index 4 in Γ is equivalent to finding subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, Γ/[Γ,Γ].\n4.  **Count subgroups in the abelianization:** The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be (Z/2Z)^3. This group has order 2^3 = 8. A subgroup of index 4 in this group must have order 8 / 4 = 2.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We just need to count the number of subgroups of order 2 in (Z/2Z)^3. In this group, every non-identity element has order 2, and each one generates a distinct subgroup of order 2. The script will perform this final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grigorchuk_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group\n    by counting the subgroups of its abelianization.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 2  # The group is a 2-group\n    dim = 3  # The dimension of the abelianization (Z/2Z)^3\n    index = 4\n\n    print(\"The number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group can be found by analyzing its abelianization, which is (Z/2Z)^3.\")\n    print(f\"The abelianization group G = (Z/{p}Z)^{dim} has order {p}^{dim}.\")\n    group_order = p**dim\n    \n    print(f\"A subgroup of index {index} in G must have order |G| / {index}.\")\n    subgroup_order = group_order // index\n\n    print(f\"So we need to find the number of subgroups of order {subgroup_order} in (Z/{p}Z)^{dim}.\")\n\n    # In (Z/pZ)^d, subgroups of order p correspond to 1-dimensional subspaces in the vector space (F_p)^d.\n    # The number of non-zero vectors is p^d - 1.\n    # Each 1-D subspace contains p-1 non-zero vectors.\n    # So the number of subgroups is (p^d - 1) / (p - 1).\n    \n    numerator = group_order - 1\n    denominator = p - 1\n    num_subgroups = numerator // denominator\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of such subgroups is calculated by counting the number of non-identity elements and dividing by the number of generators per subgroup.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    \n    # Final output as requested\n    print(f\"({p}^{dim} - 1) / ({p}^1 - 1) = {num_subgroups}\")\n\n\nsolve_grigorchuk_subgroups()\n\n```\n<<<7>>>"
