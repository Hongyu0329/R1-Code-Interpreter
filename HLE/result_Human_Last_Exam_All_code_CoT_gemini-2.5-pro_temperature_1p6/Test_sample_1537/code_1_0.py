def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the topological problem and prints the result.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset
    of a Hausdorff topological group G of cardinality c (the continuum) with a specific property.

    1. Upper Bound: The number of components of a subset of G cannot exceed the
       cardinality of G itself. So the number is at most c.

    2. Existence of an Example: We need to show that this upper bound can be achieved.
       This requires constructing a suitable group G and an open subset W.
       - A group G that fulfills the requirements is a non-locally connected topological
         vector space (TVS) of cardinality c. A standard example is L_p[0,1] for 0 < p < 1.
         Any TVS satisfies the given property about closures of neighborhoods.
       - In such a non-locally connected space, it is possible to construct an open set W
         that has c non-open components. The construction is analogous to a "Cantor teepee"
         or a "broom space" with c bristles, where c is the cardinality of the Cantor set.

    3. Conclusion: The maximum number is c = 2^aleph_0.
