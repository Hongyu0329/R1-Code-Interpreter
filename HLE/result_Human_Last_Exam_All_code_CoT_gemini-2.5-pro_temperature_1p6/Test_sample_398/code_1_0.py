# This is a theoretical problem. This script illustrates the reasoning with a concrete example.

# Step 1: Define a maximal planar graph G.
# A graph is maximal planar on n>=3 vertices if it is planar and has 3n-6 edges.
# The complete graph K5 has 10 edges. It is known to be non-planar.
# A maximal planar graph on 5 vertices must have 3*5 - 6 = 9 edges.
# The graph K5 minus one edge (K5-e) has 9 edges and is a maximal planar graph.

n = 5
G_complete = nx.complete_graph(n)
e_to_remove = (0, 1) # An arbitrary edge to remove
G = G_complete.copy()
G.remove_edge(*e_to_remove)

print(f"Let G be the graph K{n} with edge {e_to_remove} removed.")
print(f"G has {G.number_of_nodes()} vertices and {G.number_of_edges()} edges.")
print(f"A maximal planar graph on {n} vertices has 3*n - 6 = {3*n-6} edges. G fits this.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Form G' by adding an edge e to G.
# e is an edge not in G. The only such edge here is the one we removed.
e_to_add = e_to_remove
G_prime = G.copy()
G_prime.add_edge(*e_to_add)

print(f"Let G' be G with the edge e = {e_to_add} added back.")
print(f"G' is the complete graph K{n}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Analyze G' based on graph theory.
print("1. Is G' planar?")
print("No. By definition, adding an edge to a maximal planar graph makes it non-planar.")
print("This rules out options A and D.")
print("-" * 20)

print("2. How many crossings are needed for G'?")
print("A known theorem states that for a maximal planar G, the crossing number of G' = G U {e} is exactly 1.")
print("This means G' can be drawn with 'at most one crossing'.")
print("This rules out option C, which suggests more crossings may be needed.")
print("-" * 20)

print("3. Is the one-crossing drawing unique?")
print("No. Consider our example where G' is K5. We need to draw K5 with one crossing.")
print("We can create a drawing where the edge (0,1) crosses edge (2,3).")
print("We can also create a different drawing where edge (0,1) crosses edge (2,4).")
print("Since the pair of edges that cross can be different, the drawing is not unique.")
print("This rules out option E.")
print("-" * 20)

print("Final Conclusion: The only statement that holds true is B.")
print("B. G' can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing, but this is not unique.")
