# This script prints the name of the physicist who fits the description.
# The story involves physicist Paul Kirkpatrick at Stanford University.
# A janitor, Otto, was cleaning a long, flexible metal mirror used for demonstrations.
# He noticed that the reflection of the overhead lights on the ceiling formed sharp lines when the mirror was bent.
# This observation of astigmatic focusing led Kirkpatrick to develop the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system,
# which uses two perpendicular concave mirrors for X-ray microscopy.
