    Solves the group theory problem based on a strict interpretation of the notation.

    The problem provides a subnormal series:
    G = G_1 <| G_2 <| ... <| G_n <| G_{n+1} = {1}
    where '<|' denotes "is a normal subgroup of".

    This structure implies the following:
    1. G_n is a normal subgroup of G_{n+1} = {1}. The only subgroup of the trivial group {1} is {1} itself. So, G_n = {1}.
    2. G_{n-1} is a normal subgroup of G_n = {1}. This implies G_{n-1} = {1}.
    3. Inductively, this leads to G_i = {1} for all i, including G = G_1.
    
    Therefore, the only group G satisfying the condition is the trivial group G = {1}.

    For G = {1}:
    - The minimal group G_hat where any p-nonsingular system over G has a solution is G itself, so G_hat = {1}. Such a group exists and is unique.
    - The derived length of G_hat = {1} is 0. The derived series for H={1} is H^(0)={1}, so the length is 0.

    This interpretation is consistent with all the problem's conditions and yields a single numerical value for part (b).
