# The total number of boxes.
N = 20

# Alice's optimal strategy is to leave one random box closed and open the other N-1.
# She wins if the number in the closed box is not the global minimum or the global maximum
# among all N numbers.
# There are 2 "losing" numbers (the minimum and maximum).
losing_cases = 2

# The number of winning cases is the total number of boxes minus the losing cases.
winning_cases = N - losing_cases

# The probability of success is the ratio of winning cases to the total number of cases.
# From Alice's perspective, the number in the box she leaves closed is equally likely
# to have any rank from 1 to N.
probability = winning_cases / N

# The result is 18/20, which simplifies to 9/10.

# We print the calculation as an equation as requested.
print(f"The maximal probability p can be calculated as:")
print(f"p = ({N} - {losing_cases}) / {N}")
print(f"p = {winning_cases} / {N}")
print(f"p = {probability}")

# The answer corresponds to the fraction 9/10.
# Among the choices:
# A. 0
# B. 1/10
# C. 1/2
# D. 19/20
# E. 1/20
# F. 1
# G. 9/10
# The correct choice is G.
