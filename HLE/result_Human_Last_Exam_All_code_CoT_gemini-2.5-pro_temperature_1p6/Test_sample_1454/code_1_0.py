    Solves for the smallest possible number of nondegenerate, locally connected components of the set F.

    The set F is a closed set in the unit square that satisfies the self-similarity relation:
    F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
    where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}.

    This relation defines F as a fixed point of a Hutchinson operator. We must consider all
    possible closed sets F satisfying this condition.

    1. The empty set: F = emptyset.
       The equation holds: emptyset = union_{d in D} (emptyset+d)/4 = emptyset.
       The empty set is a closed set.
       The number of components of the empty set is 0. Therefore, the number of components
       that are nondegenerate and locally connected is 0.

    2. The non-empty attractor: F = A.
       The theory of Iterated Function Systems guarantees a unique non-empty compact attractor A.
       This attractor can be shown to be the set A = C x [0,1], where C is the "middle-half"
       Cantor set on [0,1].
       The components of A are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
       These components are all nondegenerate and locally connected.
       The number of components is equal to the cardinality of the Cantor set, which is
       uncountably infinite.

    Comparing the possible numbers of components (0 and uncountably infinite), the smallest
    possible number is 0.
