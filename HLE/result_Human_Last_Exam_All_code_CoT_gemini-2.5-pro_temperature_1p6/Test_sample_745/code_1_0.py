    This function explains the reasoning to find the largest number of components
    the set X \ C can have, based on the problem's conditions.

    Problem Setup:
    - X: connected T1 topological space, |X| = c (continuum)
    - A: connected subset of X
    - C: a connected component of X \ A

    Goal: Find max number of components of X \ C.

    Reasoning:
    1. The set X \ C can be written as A U ((X \ A) \ C).
       Let {C_i} be the set of components of X \ A. C is one of these, say C_0.
       Then X \ C = A U union(C_i for i != 0).

    2. The components of X \ C are formed by A and those C_i that "connect" to it,
       plus any remaining C_i (or groups of C_i) that are isolated.
       A C_i is connected to A if their closures intersect (since they are disjoint).

    3. The crucial insight is that A does not have to be a closed set.
       If A is not closed, its boundary (closure(A) \ A) is non-empty.
       A component C_i of X \ A must have its closure intersect the closure of A.
       However, it can do so by intersecting the boundary of A, without touching A itself.

    4. We can construct a space X to maximize the number of components.
       Let A be a non-closed connected set, for instance A = [0,1) in R.
       Its boundary is the single point {1}.
       Let's construct continuum-many (c) components for X \ A whose closures
       all intersect the boundary of A at {1}, but do not intersect A itself.
       Let's also construct one component, C, whose closure does intersect A.

    5. Let k be the number of components of X \ A. We can construct X such that k = c.
       We choose C to be the one component whose closure intersects A.
       The remaining k-1 components do not have their closures intersecting A.
       They are all separated from A and from each other.

    6. The components of X \ C are then:
       - A single component containing A.
       - Each of the other k-1 components of X \ A, as they are isolated.

    7. The total number of components is therefore 1 + (k - 1) = k.
       Since we can construct the space such that X \ A has k = c components,
       the maximum number of components for X \ C is c.

    The equation for the number of components (N) is:
    N = 1 (for the component containing A) + (k - 1) (the number of isolated components)
    If k = c (continuum), then:
    N = 1 + (c - 1) = c
