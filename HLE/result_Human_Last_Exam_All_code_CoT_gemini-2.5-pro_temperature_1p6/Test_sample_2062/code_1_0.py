# Part (a): Explanation
# The statement is true. Similarity of matrices implies they share the same characteristic
# polynomial, hence the same eigenvalues with identical algebraic multiplicities. For diagonal
# matrices, these are simply the diagonal entries.
# Conversely, if two diagonal matrices, A and B, have the same multiset of diagonal entries,
# the diagonal of B is a permutation of the diagonal of A. A permutation matrix P can
# be constructed such that B is similar to A, proving similarity.
answer_a = "Yes"

# Part (b): Calculation
# We need to find the number of similarity classes for 3x3 diagonal matrices with
# eigenvalues from a set of 3 distinct values {α, β, γ}.
# A similarity class is uniquely determined by the multiset of its eigenvalues.
# This is a combinations with repetition problem: choosing k=3 eigenvalues (for the diagonal)
# from n=3 distinct options {α, β, γ}.
# The formula is C(n + k - 1, k).

n = 3  # Number of distinct eigenvalue options
k = 3  # Dimension of the matrix / number of eigenvalues to choose

# The prompt states to "output each number in the final equation".
# The equation is C(n + k - 1, k) = C(3 + 3 - 1, 3). The numbers are 3, 3, 1, 3.

print(f"The equation is C({n} + {k} - 1, {k}). The numbers in the equation are {n}, {k}, and 1.")

num_classes = math.comb(n + k - 1, k)
answer_b = str(num_classes)

# Part (c): Explanation
# For a matrix in M_n(F) where |F|=q, the number of similarity classes of diagonal matrices
# is the number of multisets of size n from q options. The formula is C(n + q - 1, n).
# For a fixed q, this expression is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
# Polynomial growth is not exponential growth.
answer_c = "No"
