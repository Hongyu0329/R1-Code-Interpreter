    """
    Solves the problem of finding the largest r for placing 5 points in a unit square
    under specific Ramsey Theory-like conditions.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum r such that 5 points can be placed
    in a unit square, where if we color the edge between two points red if their distance is < r
    and blue if it's >= r, there is no monochromatic triangle. For 5 points, this implies
    the graph of distances is a 5-cycle.

    The optimal configuration for maximizing r under these constraints is a regular pentagon.
    For a regular pentagon with side s and diagonal d, the condition becomes s < r <= d.
    To maximize r, we need to maximize d.

    The largest regular pentagon that can be inscribed in a unit square has a diagonal d=1.
    The side length of this pentagon is s = d / phi, where phi is the golden ratio.
    Therefore, the largest possible r is 1.
