    "To determine the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program for this task, let's break down the required variables and their sizes.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Requirements**: The core task is a case-insensitive comparison of two strings. Since the input provides two separate lines, we must read and store both strings before we can compare them.\n2.  **Identify Necessary Variables**:\n    *   We need a buffer (character array) to store the first string.\n    *   We need a second buffer for the second string.\n    *   To iterate through the strings and compare them character by character, we need a loop counter or index variable.\n3.  **Optimize for Memory**:\n    *   **String Buffers**: The maximum string length is 100. In C, strings are null-terminated, so we need a buffer of size 101 (`char array[101]`) for each string to be safe. `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   **Index Variable**: The loop counter only needs to go from 0 up to 99. The most memory-efficient integer type for this range is `signed char` or `unsigned char`, which both use only 1 byte.\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory**: Sum the sizes of all declared variables to find the total memory `m`.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total memory usage and explains each component.\n\n```python\n# Plan to calculate the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n# 1. Variables for the C program:\n#    - To read the two strings of max length 100, we need two character arrays.\n#    - In C, a string (char array) needs one extra byte for the null terminator ('\\0').\n#    - So, we need two arrays of size 101.\n#    - The data type 'char' in C uses 1 byte of memory.\nmem_string1_bytes = 101\n\n#    - The second string also needs a buffer of the same size.\nmem_string2_bytes = 101\n\n#    - To loop through the strings, we need an index variable. The index will go from 0 to 99.\n#    - The most memory-efficient data type that can hold this range is 'signed char' (or 'unsigned char'),\n#    - which uses 1 byte. An 'int' would typically use 4 bytes, so 'char' is better.\nmem_index_bytes = 1\n\n# 2. Calculate the total memory 'm'.\ntotal_memory = mem_string1_bytes + mem_string2_bytes + mem_index_bytes\n\n# 3. Print the breakdown and the final equation for 'm'.\nprint(\"To write a memory-efficient C program for this problem, we declare the following variables:\")\nprint(f\"1. First string buffer: char s1[101], which uses {mem_string1_bytes} bytes.\")\nprint(f\"2. Second string buffer: char s2[101], which uses {mem_string2_bytes} bytes.\")\nprint(f\"3. Loop counter: signed char i, which uses {mem_index_bytes} byte.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total memory 'm' is the sum of these variables.\")\nprint(f\"m = {mem_string1_bytes} + {mem_string2_bytes} + {mem_index_bytes}\")\nprint(f\"m = {total_memory} bytes\")\n```\n<<<203>>>"
