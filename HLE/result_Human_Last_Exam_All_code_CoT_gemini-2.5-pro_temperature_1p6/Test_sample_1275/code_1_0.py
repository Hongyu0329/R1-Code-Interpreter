    # Part A: Must every geodesic word representing an element in alpha(K) be fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    # Answer: No. An element g in a conjugacy class is not necessarily cyclically reduced,
    # and a geodesic word for such an element is not, in general, fully quasireduced.
    answer_A = "No"

    # Part B: Is there a finite bound for epsilon such that a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word in alpha(K) exists
    # for a rational K? If so, state the bound in terms of delta and R; otherwise, state 'No'.
    # Answer: Yes. If K contains a loxodromic element, its cyclically reduced conjugate exists in alpha(K).
    # A geodesic for this element is fully quasireduced with a constant that depends only on delta.
    # A standard bound from literature is 8*delta. R is not relevant for this geometric bound.

    # Part C: Is it true that alpha(K) contains only quasigeodesic words if K is context-free?
    # Answer: No. K can be a finite set containing a torsion element. A finite set is context-free.
    # The set of conjugates alpha(K) will also contain torsion elements, which are not represented by
    # quasigeodesic words.
