    """
    This function prints the correct option for the puzzle.
    
    The puzzle is decoded as follows:
    1.  The quote "He is a X with his own Y!" is a version of Winston Churchill's (Z) remark about John Foster Dulles (W). The idiom is "a bull in a China shop". Thus, Z=Churchill, W=Dulles, X=bull, Y=China shop.
    2.  Churchill's (Z) own nickname was the "British Bulldog" (XK), making the comment ironic.
    3.  The food (AK) punned from "bulldog" (XK) is "bulgogi".
    4.  Bulgogi is a famous dish from Korea (G).
    
    Option A is the only one that uses the correct idiom "China shop" and matches all other clues.
