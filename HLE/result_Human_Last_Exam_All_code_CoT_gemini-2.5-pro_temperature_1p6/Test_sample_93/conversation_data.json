    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the given equation. A direct brute-force approach with five nested loops would be too slow. A more efficient method is to use dynamic programming.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Let's define `C(k, n)` as the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \\dots + y_k^2 = n$. Our goal is to find `C(5, 2024)`.\n2.  **Base Case (k=1):** For one variable, the equation is $y_1^2 = n$. This equation has exactly one non-negative integer solution ($y_1 = \\sqrt{n}$) if `n` is a perfect square, and zero solutions otherwise. So, `C(1, n) = 1` if `n` is a perfect square, and `C(1, n) = 0` otherwise.\n3.  **Recursive Step:** For `k` variables, we can find the number of solutions by considering the possible values of the k-th variable, $y_k$. Let $y_k = i$. Since $y_k$ must be a non-negative integer and $i^2 \\le n$, `i` can range from $0$ to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$. For each choice of `i`, the equation for the first `k-1` variables becomes $y_1^2 + \\dots + y_{k-1}^2 = n - i^2$. The number of solutions for this is `C(k-1, n - i^2)`. By summing over all possible values of `i`, we get the recurrence relation:\n    $C(k, n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor} C(k-1, n - i^2)$\n4.  **Implementation:** I will implement this using an iterative approach. I'll use a 1D list (let's call it `dp`) of size 2025, where `dp[n]` stores `C(k, n)`. I will first initialize this list for `k=1`, and then loop from `k=2` to `5`, updating the `dp` list in each iteration according to the recurrence relation.\n5.  **Final Answer:** After the loops complete, the value `dp[2024]` will hold the final answer, `C(5, 2024)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to solve the problem efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The target sum of the equation\n    target = 2024\n    \n    # The number of variables in the sum\n    num_vars = 5\n    \n    # dp[n] will store the number of ways to write n as a sum of k squares.\n    # We update this list for k = 1, 2, ..., num_vars.\n    dp = [0] * (target + 1)\n    \n    # Base case: k = 1.\n    # The number of solutions to x_1^2 = n is 1 if n is a perfect square, and 0 otherwise.\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    for i in range(limit + 1):\n        dp[i * i] = 1\n        \n    # Iterate for k from 2 to num_vars, building up the solution\n    for k in range(2, num_vars + 1):\n        # Create a new list to store the results for the sum with k variables\n        new_dp = [0] * (target + 1)\n        for n in range(target + 1):\n            # Calculate dp[k][n] using the recurrence relation:\n            # C(k, n) = sum_{i=0 to sqrt(n)} C(k-1, n - i*i)\n            limit_i = int(math.sqrt(n))\n            for i in range(limit_i + 1):\n                # Summing up the solutions for k-1 variables for the remainder n - i^2\n                new_dp[n] += dp[n - i * i]\n        # Update dp to the newly calculated values for the next iteration\n        dp = new_dp\n        \n    # The final result is the number of solutions for 5 variables to sum to 2024\n    result = dp[target]\n    \n    # Print the result with the numbers from the final equation, as requested.\n    print(f\"The number of non-negative integer solutions for x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024 is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_sum_of_squares()\n```\n<<<154560>>>"
