    print("Explanation: The starting material is a secondary alkyl halide. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. It favors an E2 elimination reaction. Due to its bulkiness, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered beta-carbon (the terminal CH3 group), leading to the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene). The stereocenter at carbon 3 is destroyed in this step as it becomes part of the C=C double bond.")
