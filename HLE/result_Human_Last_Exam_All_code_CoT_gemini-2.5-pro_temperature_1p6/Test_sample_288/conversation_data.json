    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Fetch the C. elegans adult hermaphrodite connectome data, which contains information on chemical synapses, from a public online repository.\n2.  Use the `pandas` library in Python to load and parse this data.\n3.  Isolate all synaptic connections that originate from the pair of ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR).\n4.  Sum the number of synapses for each unique target neuron receiving projections from ASJ.\n5.  Identify the target neuron with the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n6.  Print the name of the target neuron, the total synapse count, and the individual contributions from ASJL and ASJR that make up the total.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_main_synaptic_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of a given source neuron pair in the C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL points to a CSV file of the adult C. elegans chemical synapse connectome.\n    url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connectome-synapse/c-elegans-connectome-data/main/data/N2U_neuron_connection.csv\"\n    \n    print(f\"Fetching connectome data from {url}...\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Download the data\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        # Raise an error if the download fails\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        csv_data = response.text\n        print(\"Data fetched successfully.\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not fetch data from the URL. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Load the data into a pandas DataFrame\n    # The columns are 'origin' (presynaptic), 'target' (postsynaptic), and 'number' (synapse count)\n    df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(csv_data))\n    \n    # The source neurons are the left/right pair of ASJ\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n    print(f\"\\nAnalyzing projections from source neurons: {', '.join(source_neurons)}\")\n\n    # Filter for all connections originating from ASJ neurons\n    asj_projections = df[df['origin'].isin(source_neurons)]\n\n    if asj_projections.empty:\n        print(\"No projections found for ASJ neurons in the dataset.\")\n        return\n\n    # Group connections by the target neuron and sum the synapse counts\n    synapse_counts_per_target = asj_projections.groupby('target')['number'].sum()\n\n    # Find the target neuron that receives the most synapses from ASJ\n    main_target_neuron = synapse_counts_per_target.idxmax()\n    max_synapses = synapse_counts_per_target.max()\n\n    # Get the individual synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR to the main target\n    synapses_from_asjl_series = asj_projections[(asj_projections['origin'] == 'ASJL') & (asj_projections['target'] == main_target_neuron)]['number']\n    synapses_from_asjl = synapses_from_asjl_series.sum() if not synapses_from_asjl_series.empty else 0\n    \n    synapses_from_asjr_series = asj_projections[(asj_projections['origin'] == 'ASJR') & (asj_projections['target'] == main_target_neuron)]['number']\n    synapses_from_asjr = synapses_from_asjr_series.sum() if not synapses_from_asjr_series.empty else 0\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the neuron '{main_target_neuron}'.\")\n    print(f\"It receives a total of {max_synapses} synapses from the ASJ pair.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {synapses_from_asjl} (from ASJL) + {synapses_from_asjr} (from ASJR) = {max_synapses}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_main_synaptic_target()\n```\n<<<AIY>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
