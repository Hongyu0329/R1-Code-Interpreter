    # Based on a detailed analysis of each statement, the following have been identified as correct.
    # A) Applying both nucleus and top-k sampling uses the intersection of both, which is the more restrictive set.
    # B) Beam search (b=1) and greedy search are algorithmically identical, but different tie-breaking implementations can lead to different results. Thus, they are only guaranteed to be equivalent if there are no ties.
    # C) Temperature > 1 flattens the probability distribution, often requiring more tokens to be included to reach the cumulative probability 'p' in nucleus sampling.
    # E) Renormalizing probabilities within a truncated set preserves the relative ratios of the tokens that remain.
    # G) In practice, sequential application of top-k and nucleus sampling is implemented as an intersection of the allowed token sets from each, which is a commutative operation.
    # M) With deterministic algorithms enabled, fixed seeds, and deterministic MoE routing, outputs can be made deterministic.
    # O) Different GPU architectures can have different low-level implementations for math operations, leading to floating-point differences that can alter beam search paths.
    # P) Small, non-deterministic variations in gate values can change which experts are pruned, altering the model's output distribution and the resulting nucleus sample set.
    # Q) Deterministic routing is not sufficient for full determinism; other components like attention must also be deterministic.
    # R) Different padding changes tensor shapes, which can trigger different, non-bit-identical CUDA kernels, causing non-determinism.
    # X) The order of summation in floating-point matrix multiplication is not guaranteed, and can change attention scores slightly, affecting beam search.
    # Y) Recomputing activations can introduce small numerical differences compared to the original computation, affecting the final output.
