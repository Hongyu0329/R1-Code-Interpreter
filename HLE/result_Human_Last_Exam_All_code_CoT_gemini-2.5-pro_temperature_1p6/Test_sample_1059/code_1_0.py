The problem asks which of the given sets are "necessarily closepact subsets of themselves".

A property called "closepact" is defined: A space is closepact if any cover of it by closures of open sets has a finite subcover.

For subsets of R or C, the standard (metric) topology is assumed. These are Hausdorff spaces. In Hausdorff spaces, a crucial theorem states that any compact set is also closepact (this property is also known as H-closed). We use this principle: if a set is compact, it is closepact.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. The set of real numbers (R): NO. Not compact. The cover by closed sets {[n, n+1] | n is an integer}, which are closures of the open sets (n, n+1), has no finite subcover.

B. The set of integers (Z): NO. This is an infinite discrete space, which is not compact and thus not closepact.

C. A finite subset of the complex numbers: YES. Any finite set is compact, and therefore necessarily closepact.

D. The set of all 1/n where n is a nonzero integer: NO. This is an infinite discrete space (its limit point 0 is not in the set), so it is not closepact.

E. The set containing a Cauchy sequence in the rationals: NO. A set of points from a sequence converging to an irrational number (e.g., sqrt(2)) is an infinite discrete space, which is not closepact.

F. The set containing a bounded monotonic sequence in the real numbers: NO. If the limit point is not included (e.g., {1 - 1/n}), the set is an infinite discrete space and not closepact.

G. The set containing a bounded monotonic sequence and its limit point in the real numbers: YES. A bounded monotonic sequence in R converges. The set including the sequence points and the limit is closed and bounded, hence compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. Thus, it is closepact.

H. The set containing a positive real sequence and its limit point: YES. Assuming the sequence is convergent (as "its limit point" suggests), the set is closed and bounded. Therefore, it is compact and closepact.

I. An open interval in the reals, (a,b): NO. It is not compact. The cover by closed sets {[a + 1/n, b - 1/n]} for n > 2/(b-a) has no finite subcover.

J. A closed interval in the reals, [a,b]: YES. It is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem, and therefore closepact.

K. A bounded measurable subset of the real numbers: NO. A counterexample is (0,1), which is bounded and measurable but not closepact.

L. A bounded non-measurable subset of the real numbers: NO. It's possible to construct a bounded non-measurable set that is not closepact (e.g., the union of a Vitali set and an open interval).

M. The Cantor Set: YES. The Cantor set is a closed and bounded subset of R, so it is compact. Therefore, it is closepact.

The letters corresponding to the sets that are necessarily closepact are C, G, H, J, and M.
