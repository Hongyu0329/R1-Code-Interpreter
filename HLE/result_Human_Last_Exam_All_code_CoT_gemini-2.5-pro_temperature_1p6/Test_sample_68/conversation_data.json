    "To find the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot, we need to calculate a knot invariant called the knot determinant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Explain Knot Coloring**: A knot diagram is colored by assigning an integer from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} to each arc. At each crossing, the colors must satisfy the rule `2 * b â‰¡ a + c (mod n)`, where `b` is the color of the over-passing strand, and `a` and `c` are the colors of the two under-passing strands.\n2.  **System of Equations**: For the figure-eight knot, which has 4 arcs and 4 crossings, this rule creates a system of 4 linear equations. We can represent this system with a `4x4` matrix, known as the coloring matrix.\n3.  **Knot Determinant**: A non-trivial coloring (one that uses at least two different colors) is possible if and only if the number of colors, `n`, divides the knot's determinant. The knot determinant is calculated by taking the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the `kxk` coloring matrix.\n4.  **Calculate the Determinant**: We will form the coloring matrix for the figure-eight knot, create a `3x3` submatrix, and compute its determinant.\n5.  **Find the Smallest `n`**: The result of the calculation, an integer value, is the knot determinant. The smallest number of colors `n` (where `n > 1`) must be the smallest prime factor of this determinant. This `n` will be the number of elements in the algebraic structure `Z_n`.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and explain each step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Explain the concept of knot coloring\nprint(\"To solve this, we will find the 'determinant' of the figure-eight knot.\")\nprint(\"Knot coloring involves assigning an integer (a color) from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} to each arc of a knot diagram.\")\nprint(\"For a valid coloring, at each crossing, the colors must satisfy the rule: 2 * b = a + c (mod n), where 'b' is the color of the over-strand and 'a' and 'c' are the colors of the under-strands.\")\nprint(\"\\nA non-trivial coloring (using more than one color) exists if and only if 'n' divides the knot determinant.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 2: Set up the coloring matrix for the figure-eight knot\n# This matrix corresponds to the system of linear equations derived from the 4 crossings.\ncoloring_matrix = np.array([\n    [ 2, -1,  0, -1],\n    [-1, -1,  2,  0],\n    [-1,  0, -1,  2],\n    [ 0,  2, -1, -1]\n])\nprint(\"For the figure-eight knot, the coloring rules lead to a system of linear equations represented by this 4x4 coloring matrix:\")\nprint(coloring_matrix)\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 3: Explain and create the submatrix\n# The knot determinant is the absolute value of the determinant of any (k-1)x(k-1) submatrix.\nsubmatrix = coloring_matrix[:-1, :-1]\nprint(\"To find the knot determinant, we calculate the determinant of a 3x3 submatrix.
