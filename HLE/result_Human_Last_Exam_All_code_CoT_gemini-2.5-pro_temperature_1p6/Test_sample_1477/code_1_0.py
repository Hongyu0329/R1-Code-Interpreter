    This function determines the largest upper bound M for the learning rate
    in gradient descent for the given logistic regression problem.

    The convergence of gradient descent for a convex and L-smooth function is
    guaranteed if the learning rate gamma satisfies 0 < gamma < 2/L, where L
    is the global smoothness constant.

    L: The uniform smoothness of the function R. It is the maximum curvature
       (supremum of the second derivative) of the function over its domain.
       This is the value that determines the safe step size for any
       initialization point.

    lambda: The smoothness of the function at the optimal point w_*. It
            represents the local curvature at the minimum. This value is not
            sufficient to guarantee convergence from an arbitrary starting point.

    The condition for guaranteed convergence from any initialization relies on the
    global constant L. The largest upper bound M for the learning rate gamma is
    therefore 2/L.
