# This script prints the solution string based on the reasoning provided above.

# A: Depends. It's Yes for H=P_1, No for H=K_2.
# B: Yes. A finite set of real numbers has a maximum.
# C: Depends. The set N has no maximum, but {-n | n in N} does.
# D: Yes. The class of such sets is empty, so the condition is vacuously true.
# E: No. An infinite ascending chain can be constructed (e.g., sequences of multiples of 2^k).
# F: No. For any sequence s, we can construct a sequence u that contains s as a proper subsequence.
