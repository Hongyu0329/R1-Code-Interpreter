    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Analyze the recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$. The behavior of $a_n$ for large $n$ is determined by the root of the characteristic equation with the largest absolute value.\n2.  The characteristic equation is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. We find its roots to identify the dominant root, let's call it $R$. The asymptotic behavior of the sequence is $a_n \\sim c \\cdot R^n$ for some constant $c$.\n3.  The expression for $s_n$ is a sum of terms involving the sequence $a_n$. We analyze the two summations in the definition of $s_n$. The limit $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$ suggests that $s_n$ grows exponentially with $n$. The base of this exponential growth will determine the limit.\n4.  Let's define $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$. We observe that due to the specific initial conditions ($a_0=1,~a_{1}=a_{2}=0,~a_{3}=88$), there's a crucial identity relating $T_k$ to a term in the sequence $a_n$.\n5.  By calculating the first few terms of the sequence ($a_4, a_5, \\ldots, a_{11}$) and the first few values of $T_k$ (for $k=5, 6$), we can discover this identity. The calculations suggest that $T_k=a_{2k-1}$ for $k \\ge 5$.\n6.  Using this identity, we can greatly simplify the expression for $s_n$. The two main summations will have significant cancellations.\n7.  The simplified expression for $s_n$ will be dominated by a term of the form $C \\cdot a_{n+100}$ for large $n$.\n8.  With the simplified form of $s_n$, we can calculate the limit $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$. This limit will be $\\ln(R)$, where $R$ is the dominant root of the characteristic equation.\n9.  Finally, we will compute the numerical value of $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(R)$ and find its integer part.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Characteristic Equation and Dominant Root**\nThe characteristic equation is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\nThis polynomial can be factored as $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$.\nThe roots of $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\nThe roots of $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\nThe absolute values of the roots are:\n$|2+\\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n$|2-\\sqrt{7}| = \\sqrt{7}-2 \\approx 0.646$\n$|-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4+15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\nThe dominant root is $R = 2+\\sqrt{7}$. For large $n$, $a_n$ behaves like $c(2+\\sqrt{7})^n$.\n\n**Step 3, 4, & 5: Simplifying $s_n$**\nLet's analyze $s_n$:\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}T_k$, where $T_k=a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\nWe need to calculate the first few terms of $a_n$ for $n>3$:\n$a_0=1, a_1=0, a_2=0, a_3=88$\n$a_4 = 88a_1+57a_0 = 57$\n$a_5 = 88a_2+57a_1 = 0$\n$a_6 = 88a_3+57a_2 = 88^2 = 7744$\n$a_7 = 88a_4+57a_3 = 88(57)+57(88) = 2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57 = 10032$\n$a_8 = 88a_5+57a_4 = 57^2 = 3249$\n$a_9 = 88a_6+57a_5 = 88^3 = 681472$\n$a_{10} = 88a_7+57a_6 = 88(2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57)+57(88^2) = 3 \\cdot 88^2 \\cdot 57 = 1323936$\n$a_{11} = 88a_8+57a_7 = 88(57^2)+57(2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57) = 3 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57^2 = 855360$\n\nLet's test the hypothesis $T_k=a_{2k-1}$ for $k=5, 6$.\nFor $k=5$:\n$T_5 = a_6a_3+a_7a_2+a_8a_1+57a_5a_0 = (88^2)(88)+a_7(0)+a_8(0)+57(0)(1) = 88^3$.\n$a_{2(5)-1}=a_9=88^3$. So $T_5=a_9$.\nFor $k=6$:\n$T_6 = a_7a_4+a_8a_3+a_9a_2+57a_6a_1 = (2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57)(57)+(57^2)(88)+a_9(0)+57a_6(0) = 2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57^2 + 88 \\cdot 57^2 = 3 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57^2$.\n$a_{2(6)-1}=a_{11}=3 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57^2$. So $T_6=a_{11}$.\nThe identity $T_k = a_{2k-1}$ holds for $k \\ge 5$.\n\n**Step 6 & 7: Final simplification of $s_n$**\nSubstitute $T_k=a_{2k-1}$ into the expression for $s_n$ for the summation range $k \\geq 6$:\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}a_{2k-1}$\nThe main parts of the sums are $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$ and $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$.\n$\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} = a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$\n$\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2(n-1)-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$\nTheir difference is $a_9$.\nSo, $s_n = a_9 + \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$.\n\n**Step 8 & 9: Calculating the limit**\nFor large $n$, the terms $a_n$ are positive and grow. The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$ is dominated by its last term, $2a_{n+100}$.\n$s_n \\approx 2a_{n+100} \\approx 2c(2+\\sqrt{7})^{n+100}$ for large $n$.\nNow we evaluate the limit:\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(2c(2+\\sqrt{7})^{n+100})}}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(2c)+(n+100)\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2c)}{n} + \\frac{n+100}{n}\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})\\right)$\nAs $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, $\\frac{\\ln(2c)}{n} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{n+100}{n} \\to 1$.\nThe limit is $\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\n**Step 10: Final numerical calculation**\nWe need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$. We can use python to calculate this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the sequence and its properties\na = {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 88}\nfor n in range(4, 12):\n    a[n] = 88 * a[n-3] + 57 * a[n-4]\n\ndef T(k, seq):\n    \"\"\"Calculates T_k based on the sequence `a`.\"\"\"\n    # To compute T_k, we might need a_{k-5}.
