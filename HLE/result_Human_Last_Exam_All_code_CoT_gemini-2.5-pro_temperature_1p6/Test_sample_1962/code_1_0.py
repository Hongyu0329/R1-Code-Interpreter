    Solves the mathematical problem about cardinal functions.

    The problem asks for min({X_f}), where X_f is the cardinality of the set
    of functions g: k^+ -> k such that f is bounded by g_bar. This is a
    known problem in combinatorial set theory. The answer is 2^kappa, where
    kappa is the infinite cardinal from the problem description.

    This script will print the components of the final equation that represents this answer.
