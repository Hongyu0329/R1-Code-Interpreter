# The riddle refers to G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown story, "The Flying Stars".
# In this story, the character Ruby Adams conspires with her husband, James Crook,
# to stage a diamond theft to get out of debt.
#
# Reflecting on this misguided act of love and self-sacrifice, Father Brown
# remarks on the nature of such tragic heroines. He says:
# "It is the paradox of all tragic heroines from Crete to Flanders."
#
# The two place names that fit the clue are Crete (Cr) and Flanders (Fl).
# Both begin with a paired consonant.

place1 = "Crete"
place2 = "Flanders"
