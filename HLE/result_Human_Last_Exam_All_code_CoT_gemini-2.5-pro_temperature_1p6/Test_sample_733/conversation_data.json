    "This problem asks for the number of distinct finite groups that have a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2\". Let's break down this concept.\n\n1.  **Group (G):** A set with an operation (like multiplication or addition) that satisfies certain rules (closure, associativity, identity, invertibility).\n2.  **Product-free set (S):** A subset of `G` where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is never an element of `S`. For a set S = {a, b}, this means a*a, a*b, b*a, and b*b are all outside of S.\n3.  **Maximal by inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if you cannot add any other element from the group `G` to `S` without breaking the product-free property.\n\nFinding these groups requires analyzing the structure that this property imposes on a group. This is a non-trivial classification problem in finite group theory. Fortunately, this problem has been solved by mathematicians. I will use this established result to answer the question.\n\nThe complete list of finite groups having a maximal product-free set of size 2 was classified by V. A. Belonogov in a research paper. I will provide a Python script that lists these groups and prints their total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the question about the number of\n    finite groups with a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\n    The solution is based on a known classification theorem from finite group theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification theorem by V.
