    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$:\n\n1.  **Find the Continued Fraction of 4/7**: First, we need to express the rational number 4/7 as a continued fraction. We will use the standard Euclidean algorithm for this. Let the result be $[0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$.\n\n2.  **Ensure Even Length**: The specific formula we will use for the generalized Markov number requires the sequence of coefficients $(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ to have an even number of terms. If the original continued fraction has an odd number of terms, we can find an equivalent representation with an even number of terms using the identity $[..., a_n] = [..., a_n-1, 1]$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Matrix**: The generalized Markov number is derived from the trace of a specific matrix constructed from the continued fraction coefficients. We define two matrices, $R = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $L = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Using the even-length sequence of coefficients $(a'_1, a'_2, \\dots, a'_{n'})$, we form the matrix product $M = R^{a'_1} L^{a'_2} R^{a'_3} \\dots L^{a'_{n'}}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Generalized Markov Number**: The generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is given by the formula $m_{p/q} = \\frac{\\text{tr}(M)}{3}$. We will calculate the trace of the resulting matrix $M$ and divide it by 3.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Continued Fraction**: The result of the previous step will be a rational number. We will then compute the continued fraction of this new number, $m_{4/7}$.\n\n6.  **Format the Output**: Finally, we will display the resulting generalized Markov number as an equation showing its continued fraction expansion, as requested.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is the Python code to perform the computation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef get_continued_fraction(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the continued fraction coefficients for p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    # We only care about the part after the integer part (the a_i for i>=1)\n    if p >= q:\n        p = p % q\n    \n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    \n    # This algorithm produces [a0, a1, ...] for p/q >= 1\n    # or [0, a1, a2, ...] for p/q < 1\n    # We strip the first element which is the integer part\n    # For 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3], it produces [0, 1, 1, 3].
