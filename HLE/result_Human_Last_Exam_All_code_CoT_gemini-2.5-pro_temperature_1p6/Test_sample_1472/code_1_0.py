    print(" - Ligand Name: 2,5-dithiahexane")
    print(" - Ligand Formula: CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3")
    print(" - Number of Ligands: 'bis' indicates two ligands.")
    print(" - Ligand Type: It's a bidentate ligand, meaning it binds to the metal at two points (the two Sulfur atoms).")

    print(f"\nStep 2: Determine coordination number and possible geometries.")
    print(f" - The coordination number of Copper is {coordination_number}.")
    print(" - For a 4-coordinate complex, the two most common idealized geometries are Tetrahedral and Square Planar.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the symmetry for each potential geometry
    print("\nStep 3: Analyze symmetry, considering the real ligand structure.")
    print("   The ligand CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3 is not a simple, symmetric molecule:")
    print("   a) The chelate ring formed (Cu-S-C-C-S) is puckered and not planar.")
    print("   b) The coordinated sulfur atoms become chiral centers.")
    print("   c) The presence of methyl (CH3) groups adds to the asymmetry.")
    print("   This means the ligand itself is chiral and lacks any mirror planes.")

    print("\n   Case A: Assuming a Square Planar geometry")
    print("   - In a square planar arrangement, the two bidentate ligands must be 'cis' to each other.")
    print("   - If the ligands were simple symmetric arcs, the point group of the [Cu(S)4] core would be C2v.")
    print("   - The C2v group contains a C2 axis and two mirror planes (sigma_v).")
    print("   - The C2 axis passes through the Cu atom and relates the two ligands. This element is preserved.")
    print("   - However, due to the puckered and chiral nature of the actual ligands, no plane can reflect the molecule onto itself. The mirror planes are lost.")
    print("   - Point group elements remaining: E (identity) and C2. This defines the C2 point group.")

    print("\n   Case B: Assuming a Tetrahedral geometry")
    print("   - In a tetrahedral arrangement, the two ligands span opposite edges of the tetrahedron.")
    print("   - If the ligands were simple symmetric arcs, this structure would have D2d symmetry.")
    print("   - A more realistic core without considering ligand details would be D2. This has three perpendicular C2 axes.")
    print("   - One C2 axis relates the two ligands to each other. This element is preserved.")
    print("   - The other two C2 axes would have to pass *through* the center of each ligand.")
    print("   - Since the ligands themselves are asymmetric and not C2-symmetric, these two C2 axes are lost.")
    print("   - All other D2d elements (like mirror planes and S4 axes) are also lost due to ligand chirality.")
    print("   - Point group elements remaining: E (identity) and C2. This also defines the C2 point group.")

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion
    print("\nStep 4: Conclude the point group.")
    print(" - Both plausible high-symmetry geometries (Square Planar and Tetrahedral) are reduced to the same point group when the real, asymmetric ligand structure is considered.")
    print(" - The only symmetry operation that the entire molecule retains (besides identity) is a single C2 rotational axis that swaps the positions of the two identical ligands.")
