# Parameters for the problem.
# d is the degree of the hypersurface in the complex projective space CP^n.
d = 5
n = 3

# According to a theorem by Berrick and Jambor on the third homotopy group pi_3(X)
# of a smooth complex projective hypersurface X, for the case n=3 and d=5 (which is odd),
# pi_3(X) is determined by a specific group extension.
#
# The extension sequence is: 0 -> Z -> pi_3(X) -> Z_m -> 0
# where Z is the group of integers and m is the order of the cyclic quotient group.
# For n=3 and d odd, m = 2*(d-1).
m = 2 * (d - 1)

# The specific extension is defined by the relation m*g = k*h, where k=2.
# So, the group pi_3(X) has the presentation G = <h, g | m*g = 2*h>.
k = 2

# To find the structure of this group, we can consider it as a quotient of the
# free abelian group Z^2 (with generators h and g) by the subgroup generated
# by the relation 2*h - m*g = 0.
# The group G is isomorphic to Z + Z_gcd(k, m).
torsion_order = math.gcd(k, m)

# The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the rank of its free part.
# The group pi_3(X) is isomorphic to Z + Z_{torsion_order}.
# The free part is Z, which has rank 1.
rank = 1

# We can also compute the rank as rank(Z^2) - rank(subgroup of relations).
# Since there is one non-trivial relation, the rank is 2 - 1 = 1.
rank_Z2 = 2
rank_relation_subgroup = 1
final_rank = rank_Z2 - rank_relation_subgroup
