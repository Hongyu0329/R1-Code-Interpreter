# Step 1: Calculate the number of edges for the internal hole.
# The cut at the center of the paper creates one hole. Due to the folding symmetry, this hole is formed by 4 connected cut segments.
num_center_holes = 1
edges_per_center_hole = 4
center_hole_edges = num_center_holes * edges_per_center_hole

# Step 2: Calculate the number of edges for the outer perimeter.
# The outer perimeter is composed of new edges from the cuts and the remaining segments of the original paper's edges.

# The cut at one of the original corners of the paper adds 1 new edge to the perimeter.
corner_cut_edges = 1

# The cuts corresponding to the midpoints of the paper's original four sides create V-shaped indentations.
# There are 4 such indentations, and each adds 2 edges to the perimeter.
num_mid_edge_indentations = 4
edges_per_mid_edge_indentation = 2
mid_edge_cut_edges = num_mid_edge_indentations * edges_per_mid_edge_indentation

# These cuts break the original 4 sides of the square into 8 remaining segments.
# For example, a cut at the midpoint of a side divides it into two segments. A side with a cut corner and a midpoint cut is also made of two segments.
# There are 8 such segments in total around the perimeter.
original_edge_segments = 8

# The total number of edges on the outer perimeter is the sum of all these parts.
outer_perimeter_edges = corner_cut_edges + mid_edge_cut_edges + original_edge_segments

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of edges for the entire shape.
# This is the sum of the edges from the internal hole and the outer perimeter.
total_edges = center_hole_edges + outer_perimeter_edges

# Final Output
# The equation shows the sum of edges from the central hole, the corner cut, the mid-edge cuts, and the remaining original edge segments.
