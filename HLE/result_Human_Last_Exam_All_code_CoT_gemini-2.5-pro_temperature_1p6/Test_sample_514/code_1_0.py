The problem asks for the number of path components of a specific topological space. Let's break down the reasoning.

Step 1: Understand the space X before identification.
The space is X = A U B, a subset of the unit square [0,1]x[0,1], where:
- K is the Cantor set in [0,1] x {0}.
- Q is the countable set of endpoints of the intervals from the construction of K.
- D is a countable dense subset of [0,1] with 1 in D.
- A = Q x D.
- B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D).

Step 2: Analyze paths in X.
A path in X is a continuous function gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t)) for t in [0,1]. Let's consider the projection of this path onto the x-axis, which is the function x(t). The x-coordinates of all points in X belong to the Cantor set K. Thus, x(t) is a continuous function from [0,1] to K.

A fundamental property of the Cantor set K is that it is totally disconnected. This means the only connected subsets of K are single points. Since the interval [0,1] is connected, its continuous image x([0,1]) must also be connected. Therefore, the image x([0,1]) must be a single point.

This implies that for any path in X, the x-coordinate must be constant. So, any path must be contained within a vertical line of the form {x_0} x [0,1] for some x_0 in K.

Step 3: Analyze path components of X.
Let's see what the path-connected components are on these vertical lines:
- If x_0 is in Q, the points of X on this line are {x_0} x D. Since D is a countable dense subset of [0,1], it contains no intervals and is totally path-disconnected.
- If x_0 is in K \ Q, the points of X on this line are {x_0} x ([0,1] \ D). The set of irrational numbers is also totally path-disconnected.

In both cases, the set of points of X on any vertical line is totally path-disconnected. This means the only possible continuous paths are constant paths (where y(t) is also constant).
Therefore, the path components of the space X, before identification, are its individual points.

Step 4: Analyze the quotient space Y.
The space Y is created by identifying all points of the set S = Q x {1} to a single point, let's call it p*.

The path components of Y are determined by which points can be connected.
- The points in S are now all one point, p*, so they form a single path component, {p*}.
- Can any other point [(x,y)] connect to p*? A path from [(x,y)] to p* would have to be composed of a path in X from (x,y) to some point in S. As we argued, such a path must lie on a vertical line, so it would have to connect (x,y) to (x,1). But this is not possible if y is not 1, because the set of y-coordinates along the path would need to form an interval contained entirely within D (if x is in Q) or within [0,1]\D (if x is in K\Q), which is impossible.
- Similarly, two distinct points not in S cannot be connected by a path.

So, the path components of Y are precisely:
1. The point p* itself.
2. Each individual point [(a)] for a in A \ S = Q x (D \ {1}).
3. Each individual point [(b)] for b in B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D).

Step 5: Count the number of components.
The total number of components is the sum of the counts from these three groups.
- Number of components from group 1: 1 (the component {p*}).
- Number of components from group 2: The cardinality of A \ S. Since Q and D are countable, |A \ S| = |Q| * |D \ {1}| is countably infinite.
- Number of components from group 3: The cardinality of B. K is uncountable (cardinality of the continuum, c) and Q is countable, so |K \ Q| = c. [0,1] is uncountable (c) and D is countable, so |[0,1] \ D| = c. Thus, |B| = c * c = c.

The total number of components is 1 + (countably infinite) + (uncountably infinite, c).
The sum is dominated by the largest cardinality.
