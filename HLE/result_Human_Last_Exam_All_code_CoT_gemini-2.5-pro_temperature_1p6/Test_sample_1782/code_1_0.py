    """
    This function explains the solution to the user's question about
    a specific type of tree in the Boolean algebra P(w1)/<w1.
    """

    print("--- Step 1: Understanding the Question ---")
    print("The question asks about the existence of a special kind of tree, T.")
    print("Let's break down its properties:")
    print(" - The tree has a height of omega_1 (the first uncountable ordinal).")
    print(" - It is built within the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1) / <omega_1.")
    print("   (This is the power set of omega_1, where sets differing by a countable number of elements are considered equal).")
    print(" - Each level of the tree (A_alpha) is a maximal antichain in B (a partition of the whole space).")
    print(" - The levels are refining: for alpha < beta, level A_beta is a finer partition than A_alpha.")
    print(" - The crucial property: There is NO common refinement for all the levels of the tree.")
    print(" - The size of each level is at most omega_1.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Reframing the Problem ---")
    print("The existence of the described tree is equivalent to a property of the Boolean algebra B.")
    print(" - The existence of a 'common refinement' for any sequence of omega_1 maximal antichains is known as the '(omega_1, omega_1)-distributivity' law for the algebra.")
    print(" - Therefore, the question 'Does a tree with NO common refinement exist?' is the same as asking:")
    print("   'Is the algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1' *provably not* (omega_1, omega_1)-distributive in ZFC?'\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Consulting Advanced Set Theory ---")
    print("The (omega_1, omega_1)-distributivity of B is a property whose truth is independent of the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC).")
    print(" - It is CONSISTENT with ZFC that the algebra B *is* (omega_1, omega_1)-distributive.")
    print("   (For example, this holds in models of ZFC that satisfy the Proper Forcing Axiom, or PFA).")
    print(" - In such models, EVERY sequence of omega_1 maximal antichains *does* have a common refinement.")
    print(" - This means that in these models, the tree the user described CANNOT exist.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: The Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The question asks 'Does there *always* exist...' a tree with these properties.")
    print(" - 'Always' in a mathematical context like this means 'is it provable from the axioms of ZFC'.")
    print(" - Since there are models of ZFC where the tree does NOT exist, its existence is NOT provable in ZFC.")
    print(" - Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No'.")
