    "Based on paleontological descriptions of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri*, the number of depressions within the lacrimal recess is a known anatomical feature. I will write a Python script to state this number.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a variable to hold the number of depressions found in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  Use a print statement to display this information in a clear, descriptive sentence, fulfilling the request.\n3.  Include a final line that explicitly shows the number as part of a simple equation.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# is known from scientific literature describing the skull anatomy.\n\n# The lacrimal recess contains two subsidiary depressions.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the answer in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n# As requested, here is the number in a final equation format.\nprint(f\"Final Answer = {number_of_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
