# This script is intended for execution in a SageMath environment.

# Step 1: Define the elliptic curve from its Weierstrass equation.
# The equation is y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10x - 20.
# The coefficients [a1, a2, a3, a4, a6] are [0, -1, 1, -10, -20].
E = EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -10, -20])

# Step 2: Calculate the rank of the Mordell-Weil group E(Q).
r = E.rank()

# Step 3: Define the two primitive cubic Dirichlet characters of conductor 7.
G = DirichletGroup(7)
# Filter for primitive characters of order 3.
cubic_characters = [chi for chi in G if chi.order() == 3 and chi.is_primitive()]
chi1 = cubic_characters[0]
chi2 = cubic_characters[1]

# Step 4: Calculate the leading coefficients 'a' and 'b' of the twisted L-functions at s=1.
# The method lseries().value(1) computes the leading Taylor coefficient L^(k)(1)/k!
# where k is the order of vanishing at s=1.
# The problem defines 'a' and 'b' as these coefficients.
a = E.lseries().twist(chi1).value(1)
b = E.lseries().twist(chi2).value(1)

# Step 5: Compute the sum r + a + b.
# Note that r is an integer, and a and b are complex conjugates.
result = r + a + b

# Step 6: Print the components of the sum and the final result.
# The user has requested that each number in the final equation be output.
print(f"The rank of the elliptic curve is r = {r}")
print(f"The leading coefficient 'a' is a = {a}")
print(f"The leading coefficient 'b' is b = {b}")

print("\nThe final equation is r + a + b, which numerically is:")
# We display the full precision values in the equation.
print(f"{r} + ({a}) + ({b}) = {result}")

# The result is a real number since a and b are conjugates. We round it to 4 decimal places.
final_answer = round(float(result), 4)

print(f"\nThe value of r + a + b rounded to four decimal places is {final_answer}.")
