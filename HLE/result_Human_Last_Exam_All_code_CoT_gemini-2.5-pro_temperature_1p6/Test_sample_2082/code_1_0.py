    explanation = """
The question asks for the mechanism by which magnesium supplementation can help lower blood pressure. This requires medical knowledge rather than calculation from the provided text.

Let's analyze the options:

A. Through direct vasodilation: This is the correct mechanism. Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. In vascular smooth muscle cells, the influx of calcium ions causes contraction, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Magnesium competes with calcium and inhibits its entry into these cells. This results in smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels), and consequently, a reduction in blood pressure.

B. By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition: While magnesium is involved in regulating calcium and may help prevent vascular calcification over the long term, this is not the primary, direct mechanism by which it lowers blood pressure.

C. By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain: Magnesium is essential for neurological health, but its effect on blood pressure is not mediated by an increase in brain matter.

D. By stimulating an inflammatory response: This is incorrect. Chronic inflammation can contribute to hypertension. Magnesium actually possesses anti-inflammatory properties.

E. It raises systemic blood calcium levels: This is incorrect. Magnesium and calcium have an antagonistic relationship in many physiological processes. Magnesium does not raise calcium levels.

Therefore, the most direct and accepted mechanism is through vasodilation.
