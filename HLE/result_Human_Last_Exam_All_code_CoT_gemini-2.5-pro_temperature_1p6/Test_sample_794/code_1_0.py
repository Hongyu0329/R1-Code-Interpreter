def solve_clustering_problem():
    """
    Solves the theoretical clustering problem based on logical deduction.

    The steps are:
    1. Define the given constant L.
    2. Determine the minimal integer k (denoted k_0) for which the local-max property can hold.
       Based on analysis of the constraints, the smallest plausible value for k_0 is 3.
    3. State the formula for the lower bound of w_C, which is L / (k_0 - 1).
    4. Calculate the final integer answer.
