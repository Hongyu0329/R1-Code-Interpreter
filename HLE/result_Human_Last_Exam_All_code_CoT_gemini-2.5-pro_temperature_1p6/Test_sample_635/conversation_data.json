    "To calculate a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, meaning the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Propose a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that when multiplied by $H(s)$, all the rational terms (denominators) are canceled out, resulting in a polynomial matrix $N(s)$.\n2.  Calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n3.  Verify that the resulting $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. We can do this by checking that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all $2 \\times 2$ minors of the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is a non-zero constant.\n4.  Provide a Python script that defines these matrices and verifies the factorization and coprimeness.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Finding D(s) and N(s)**\n\nThe transfer function is $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe denominators are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n\nWe need to find a $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$ such that $D(s)H(s)$ is polynomial.\nLet's consider the product row by row. For the first row of $N(s)$, we need $\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\end{bmatrix} H(s)$ to be polynomial.\nThis requires $\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)}{s+1} + \\frac{2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. This expression simplifies to $\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$.\nFor this to be a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by $s^2-1$. This implies the numerator must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n\nA simple choice that satisfies these conditions for the first row of $D(s)$ is $d_{11}(s)=1$ and $d_{12}(s)=s-1$. Let's check:\n-   $d_{12}(1) = 1-1 = 0$. (Correct)\n-   $4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4(1) + 2(-1-1) = 4 - 4 = 0$. (Correct)\n\nFor the second row, the conditions are the same. A simple choice is $d_{21}(s)=0$ and $d_{22}(s)=s^2-1$.\n-   $d_{22}(1) = 1-1=0$. (Correct)\n-   $4d_{21}(-1)+2d_{22}(-1) = 4(0) + 2((-1)^2-1) = 0$. (Correct)\n\nSo we choose $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$. This matrix is polynomial and its determinant is $s^2-1$, which is not identically zero.\n\nNow, we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{s^2-1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nSo, $N(s)$ is a polynomial matrix as required.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying Coprimeness**\n\nWe check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rank is 2 for all $s$ if there is at least one $2 \\times 2$ minor that is a non-zero constant.\nConsider the minor formed by the first and third columns: $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2$.\nSince this minor is a non-zero constant, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define the matrices and formally verify the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies a left coprime factorization for the given\n    transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The transfer function H(s) given in the problem\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Our calculated left coprime factorization matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # --- Output the Results ---\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    \n    # Pretty print the final D(s) matrix\n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(D)\n    print(f\"\\nD(s)[0,0] = {D[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(s)[0,1] = {D[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"D(s)[1,0] = {D[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(s)[1,1] = {D[1,1]}\")\n\n    # Pretty print the final N(s) matrix\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(N)\n    print(f\"\\nN(s)[0,0] = {N[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(s)[0,1] = {N[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"N(s)[1,0] = {N[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(s)[1,1] = {N[1,1]}\")\n\n    # --- Verification (Optional) ---\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- Verification Steps ---\")\n\n    # 1.
