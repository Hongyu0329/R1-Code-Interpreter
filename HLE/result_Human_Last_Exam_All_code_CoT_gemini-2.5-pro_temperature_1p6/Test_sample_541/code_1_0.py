    Calculates the maximum convex hull area for different cut symmetries.

    The problem is to find the shape of cuts with a total length of 1 meter
    that maximizes the area of the convex hull of the cuts.

    We model the cuts for regular polygons as 'n' radial spokes of length 'r'
    from the center.
    Total length L = n * r = 1, so r = 1/n.
    The area of the resulting convex hull (a regular n-gon) is given by:
    Area = (1/2) * n * r^2 * sin(2*pi/n)
    Substituting r = 1/n, we get: Area = (1 / (2*n)) * sin(2*pi/n)

    We also consider the case of a circular cut, which is a closed loop.
    For a perimeter L=1, the area is L^2 / (4*pi).
