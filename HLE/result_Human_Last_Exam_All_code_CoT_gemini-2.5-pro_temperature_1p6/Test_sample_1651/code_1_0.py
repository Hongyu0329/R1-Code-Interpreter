    # The question asks for the smallest possible NONZERO number of fixed points
    # of the Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R in the remainder R*.

    # Step 1: Realize that the number can be 0.
    # For f(x) = arctan(x), the image of the remainder F(R*) is {-pi/2, pi/2},
    # which is inside R. So there are no fixed points in R*.
    # F(p) = p is impossible if F(p) is in R and p is in R*.
    num_fixed_points_can_be_zero = True

    # Step 2: Use the symmetry of the real numbers.
    # Let f be an ODD function (f(-x) = -f(x)). Let F be its extension.
    # Let Sigma be the extension of the reflection map sigma(x) = -x.
    # For an odd function, F and Sigma commute: F(Sigma(p)) = Sigma(F(p)).
    
    # Step 3: Analyze the set of fixed points.
    # Let Z be the set of fixed points of F in R*.
    # If p is in Z, then F(p) = p.
    # Applying Sigma, we get F(Sigma(p)) = Sigma(F(p)) = Sigma(p).
    # This means Sigma(p) is also a fixed point.
    # So, the reflection map Sigma maps the set of fixed points Z to itself.

    # Step 4: A key topological fact.
    # The map Sigma (extension of f(x)=-x) has NO fixed points in the remainder R*.
    # Therefore, for any fixed point p in Z, we must have Sigma(p) != p.

    # Step 5: Conclusion from the symmetry argument.
    # The fixed points in Z are partitioned into pairs of the form {p, Sigma(p)}.
    # This implies that the total number of fixed points, |Z|, must be an even number.
    
    # Step 6: Final result.
    # The number of fixed points must be a non-zero even integer.
    # The smallest possible non-zero even integer is 2.
    # Advanced results in topology confirm that functions with exactly two fixed points
    # in the remainder can be constructed.
