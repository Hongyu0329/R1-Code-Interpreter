    The mathematics of quantum mechanics (QM) and the modal logic of Gödel's ontological proof operate in entirely different, incompatible domains.

    1.  **Quantum Mechanics:** Its mathematical framework (Hilbert spaces, linear operators, Schrödinger equation) is designed to model and predict the behavior of physical systems, energy, and matter at the subatomic level. It is a scientific theory grounded in empirical observation.

    2.  **Gödel's Ontological Proof:** This is an argument in formal (modal) logic. It does not make claims about the physical world but instead explores the logical consequences of a specific set of axioms and definitions concerning abstract properties like 'positivity' and 'necessary existence'.

    Therefore, one cannot use the mathematical tools of QM to prove or disprove a concept within formal logic, any more than one could use the rules of chess to bake a cake. The tools are not applicable to the task.
