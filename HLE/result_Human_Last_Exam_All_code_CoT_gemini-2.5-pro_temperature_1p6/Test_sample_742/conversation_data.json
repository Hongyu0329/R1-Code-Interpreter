    "My plan is to address the user's question by first explaining the fundamental disconnect between the two fields in question: quantum mechanics and formal logic. I will clarify that the mathematics of quantum mechanics (based on Hilbert spaces, operators, and probability) is designed to describe the physical universe, while Gödel's ontological proof is an exercise in modal logic, which deals with abstract concepts of possibility and necessity.\n\nSince a direct proof using QM math is not possible, I will instead provide a Python script that symbolically represents the structure of Gödel's logical argument. This will satisfy the user's request for code while illustrating what Gödel's proof actually is. The code will define Gödel's axioms and theorems as strings and print them in a structured way. This will also allow me to fulfill the unusual constraint to \"output each number in the final equation\" by numbering the axioms and theorems as I print them. The final conclusion will be that it's not possible to prove a concept from one domain using the tools of the other.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_godel_and_qm():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains Gödel's ontological proof in the context of quantum mechanics.\n    It clarifies that QM math cannot prove or disprove the logical argument,\n    and then symbolically outlines the argument's structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the fundamental difference between the domains.\n    print(\"### The Distinction Between Quantum Mechanics and Formal Logic ###\")\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The mathematics of quantum mechanics (QM) and the modal logic of Gödel's ontological proof operate in entirely different, incompatible domains.\n\n    1.  **Quantum Mechanics:** Its mathematical framework (Hilbert spaces, linear operators, Schrödinger equation) is designed to model and predict the behavior of physical systems, energy, and matter at the subatomic level. It is a scientific theory grounded in empirical observation.\n\n    2.  **Gödel's Ontological Proof:** This is an argument in formal (modal) logic. It does not make claims about the physical world but instead explores the logical consequences of a specific set of axioms and definitions concerning abstract properties like 'positivity' and 'necessary existence'.\n\n    Therefore, one cannot use the mathematical tools of QM to prove or disprove a concept within formal logic, any more than one could use the rules of chess to bake a cake.
