    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2, we need to check two conditions for each curve at all primes `p > 2`:\n1.  **Good Reduction**: The curve must be non-singular when its equation is considered over the finite field `F_p`. For a curve `y^2 = f(x)`, this means that the prime `p` must not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`.\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: The curve must be ordinary at `p`. A curve that is not ordinary is called supersingular. For a hyperelliptic curve of genus `g`, a standard test for ordinarity at a prime `p` is to check the coefficient of `x^{g(p-1)}` in the polynomial `f(x)^{(p-1)/2}`. If this coefficient is non-zero modulo `p`, the curve is ordinary.\n\nThe phrase \"above 2\" implies this must hold for all primes `p > 2`. However, as we will see, none of the curves have good reduction for all `p > 2`. This suggests we should select the curve that is not easily proven to be supersingular and is the most likely candidate. The intended method is likely a process of elimination.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  For each curve `y^2 = f(x)`, calculate the discriminant of `f(x)` to find the set of odd primes `S` where the curve has bad reduction.\n2.  Identify any curves with special properties, like Complex Multiplication (CM), which are known to be supersingular for a large set of primes.\n3.  For the remaining curves, pick the smallest prime `p > 2` where the curve has good reduction (i.e., `p` is not in `S`).\n4.  Test for ordinarity at that prime `p`.\n5.  Eliminate curves that are found to be supersingular. The one that remains is the answer.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve(label, f_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x) for good and ordinary reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = sympy.sympify(f_str)\n    deg = sympy.degree(f, x)\n    g = (deg - 1) // 2  # Genus of the hyperelliptic curve\n\n    print(f\"--- Analysis for Curve {label}: y^2 = {f} ---\")\n    print(f\"The degree of f(x) is {deg}, so the genus g is {g}.\")\n\n    # 1.
