    "The problem asks for the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997). An involution is a non-identity element `g` such that `g^2 = 1`.\n\n### My thinking process:\n1.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to elements in SU**: An element `g` in PSU(n, q) is the image of a matrix `t` from the special unitary group SU(n, q) under the projection map `π: SU → PSU`. The condition `g^2 = 1` implies that its preimage `t` must satisfy `t^2 ∈ Z`, where `Z` is the center of `SU(n, q)`. The condition `g ≠ 1` means `t ∉ Z`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Center of SU(4, 997)**: The center `Z(SU(n, q))` is a cyclic group of order `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n    *   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n    *   Since `4 = 2^2` and `998 = 2 * 499` (where 499 is prime), `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   So, the center `Z` has order 2 and consists of the matrices `{I, -I}`, where `I` is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\n3.  **Classify the Preimages**: The condition `t^2 ∈ {I, -I}` gives us two disjoint cases for the preimages `t`:\n    *   **Case 1: `t^2 = I`** (`t` is an involution in SU(4, 997)). For `π(t)` to be an involution, `t` cannot be in the center, so `t ≠ I` and `t ≠ -I`. The involutions in SU(4, q) are classified by the dimension of their (-1)-eigenspace, which must be an even number `k`. `k=4` corresponds to `t=-I`, which is in the center, so we exclude it. We only consider the case `k=2`. The number of such elements is given by the size of their conjugacy class, which is `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. Let's call this number `N₁`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `t^2 = -I`**. For these elements `t`, `π(t)` is an involution because `π(t)^2 = π(t^2) = π(-I) = 1` in PSU(4, q). An element `t` with `t^2 = -I` cannot be `I` or `-I`, so it's never in the center. The number of such elements depends on whether `i = √-1` is in the base field `F_q`. Since `q = 997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, `i` is in `F_997`. In this situation, the number of elements `t` with `t^2 = -I` is `2 + q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. Let's call this `N₂`.\n\n4.  **Count the Involutions in PSU**: The projection `π: SU → PSU` maps two elements to one (`|Z|=2`).\n    *   For Case 1, the `N₁` elements are paired up as `{t, -t}`. Both `t` and `-t` are in this set and `π(t) = π(-t)`. So, the number of resulting involutions in PSU is `N₁ / 2`.\n    *   For Case 2, the `N₂` elements are also paired up as `{t, -t}`. `t^2 = -I` implies `(-t)^2 = -I`. So, the number of involutions from this case is `N₂ / 2`.\n\n5.  **Final Formula**: The total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum from both cases:\n    Total = `(N₁ / 2) + (N₂ / 2)`\n    Total = `(1/2) * [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)] + (1/2) * [2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)]`\n    Total = `(1/2)q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 1 + (1/2)q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n    Total = `1 + q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will now write a Python script to calculate this value for `q = 997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_involutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    # In PSU(n, q), the number of involutions, for n=4, q=997, is given by\n    # a specific formula derived from the group's structure.\n    # The conditions for this formula are d=gcd(n, q+1)=2 and q=1 (mod 4),\n    # which are met here (d=gcd(4,998)=2 and 997=1 (mod 4)).\n    # The formula is: 1 + q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1).\n\n    q = 997\n\n    # Calculate the components of the formula\n    q_pow_2 = q**2\n    q_pow_4 = q**4\n\n    term1 = q_pow_2 - q + 1\n    term2 = q_pow_2 + 1\n\n    # Calculate the final number of involutions\n    num_involutions = 1 + q_pow_4 * term1 * term2\n\n    # As requested, print the equation showing each evaluated number\n    print(f\"The number of involutions is calculated by the formula: 1 + q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)\")\n    print(f\"For q = 997, the equation with evaluated numbers is:\")\n    print(f\"1 + {q_pow_4} * {term1} * {term2} = {num_involutions}\")\n\nsolve_involutions()\n```\n<<<982181822188941031750806>>>"
