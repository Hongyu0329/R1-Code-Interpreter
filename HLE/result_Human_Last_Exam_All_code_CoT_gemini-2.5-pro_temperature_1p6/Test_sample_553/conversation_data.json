    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to identify the song.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the musical question. The progression \"tonic to the minor fifth\" (I â†’ v) is a distinctive harmonic move. In a major key, the diatonic fifth chord is major (V). Making it minor (v) involves borrowing a chord from the parallel minor key, which creates a wistful or melancholic sound.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Set up a small \"database\" in Python using a dictionary. This database will list a few Beatles songs and a description of their opening chords.\n2.  Define the characteristic we are searching for, which is the \"Tonic to minor fifth\" progression.\n3.  Write a simple loop that searches through our database.\n4.  When the song with the matching characteristic is found, print its name and an explanation of the chord progression.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this search:\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches a small database of Beatles songs for one that starts\n    with a specific chord progression (Tonic to minor fifth).\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mini-database of Beatles songs and their opening chord characteristics.\n    beatles_song_database = {\n        \"A Hard Day's Night\": \"Starts with a famous, dissonant opening chord (G7sus4).\",\n        \"Yesterday\": \"Starts on the tonic (G) and moves to a B7, the dominant of the relative minor.\",\n        \"Help!\": \"Starts with an energetic progression in A major: I -> iii -> vi -> IV (A -> C#m -> F#m -> D).\",\n        \"Michelle\": \"Starts with a chord jump from the tonic (Fmaj7) to the minor fifth (Cm).\"\n    }\n\n    target_characteristic = \"Tonic to minor fifth\"\n    found_song = None\n\n    for song, description in beatles_song_database.items():\n        if target_characteristic.lower() in description.lower():\n            found_song = song\n            break\n\n    if found_song:\n        print(f\"The song found is: '{found_song}'\")\n        print(\"\\nMusical Analysis:\")\n        print(f\"The song '{found_song}' is in the key of F major.\")\n        print(\"The first chord is Fmaj7, which serves as the tonic (I).\")\n        print(\"The second chord is C minor (Cm). C is the fifth degree of F.\")\n        print(\"A C minor chord is the minor fifth (v) in the key of F.\")\n        print(\"\\nThe final equation of the progression is: I -> v (Fmaj7 -> Cm)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No song matching that description was found in the database.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
