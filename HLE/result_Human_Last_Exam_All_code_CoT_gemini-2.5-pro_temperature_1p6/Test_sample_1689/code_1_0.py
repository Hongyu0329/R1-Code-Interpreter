    # 1. The patient's history includes wearing new workout clothes.
    # 2. The rash is located on the posterior axillary folds, where clothing rubs,
    #    and spares the axillary vault, where deodorant is applied.
    # 3. These findings strongly suggest Allergic Contact Dermatitis from textiles.
    # 4. A topical steroid (C) is a treatment, not a diagnostic test.
    # 5. A KOH prep (B) would test for a fungal infection, which is less likely given the specific rash distribution.
    # 6. A skin biopsy (A) is generally reserved for when the diagnosis is unclear.
    # 7. The patch test (D) is the gold standard for identifying the specific allergen causing allergic contact dermatitis.
