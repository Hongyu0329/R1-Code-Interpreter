    "My plan is to implement Bresenham's line algorithm to generate all the integer coordinates of the pixels that lie on the line between the start point (1, 1) and the end point (11, 5).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Initialization**: Define the start (x1, y1) and end (x2, y2) coordinates.\n2.  **Calculate Deltas**: Compute the change in x (`dx = x2 - x1`) and the change in y (`dy = y2 - y1`).\n3.  **Decision Parameter**: Initialize the decision parameter `p`, which helps decide whether to increment the y-coordinate at each step. For a line with a slope between 0 and 1, the initial value is `p = 2 * dy - dx`.\n4.  **Iterate and Plot**: Starting from (x1, y1), I will loop `dx` times. In each iteration, I'll increment x by 1 and use the decision parameter `p` to determine if y should also be incremented. The coordinates of each pixel will be stored in a list.\n5.  **Find the Center**: Once all the pixels on the line are generated and stored, I will find the total number of pixels. The central pixel will be the one at the middle index of the list.\n6.  **Output**: Finally, the coordinates of this central pixel will be printed.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coordinates of the central pixel on a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate deltas\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Check for steep lines (slope > 1) or shallow lines (slope <= 1)\n    # This specific problem has a shallow slope (dy/dx = 4/10 < 1)\n    # The code below is simplified for this case where 0 < slope <= 1\n    \n    # List to store all pixels on the line\n    pixels = []\n    \n    # Initialize current coordinates and decision parameter\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    # Add the starting pixel\n    pixels.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Iterate from start x to end x\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            # y does not change\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # y increments\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n        \n    # Find the central pixel from the list\n    mid_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels[mid_index]\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"The line is between ({x1},{y1}) and ({x2},{y2}).\")\n    print(f\"The pixels on the line are: {pixels}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of pixels is: {len(pixels)}.\")\n    print(f\"The central pixel is the one at index {mid_index}.\")\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are: {central_pixel}\")\n\n# Define the start and end points of the line\nstart_x, start_y = 1, 1\nend_x, end_y = 11, 5\n\nfind_central_pixel_bresenham(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)\n<<<(6, 3)>>>\n```"
