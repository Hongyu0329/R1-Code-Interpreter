    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the Feynman diagram:** The diagram is described as having two vertices and four field contractions between them. This means we have two vertices connected by four identical lines (propagators).\n2.  **Determine the sources of symmetry:** In a Feynman diagram, the symmetry factor arises from permutations of its components that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. We have two sources of symmetry here:\n    *   **Permutations of identical vertices:** The two vertices are of the same type, so we can swap them without changing the diagram.\n    *   **Permutations of identical lines:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are indistinguishable, so we can permute them in any way.\n3.  **Calculate the number of permutations for each component:**\n    *   The number of ways to permute `n` identical items is `n!` (n-factorial).\n    *   For the two vertices, this is `2!`.\n    *   For the four lines, this is `4!`.\n4.  **Calculate the total symmetry factor:** The total symmetry factor, `S`, is the product of the number of permutations for each set of identical components.\n    *   `S = (permutations of vertices) * (permutations of lines) = 2! * 4!`.\n5.  **Write the code:** A Python script will be written to calculate the factorials, multiply them, and print the final equation showing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_lines = 4\n\n    # Calculate the number of permutations for vertices and lines\n    vertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n    line_permutations = math.factorial(num_lines)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these permutations\n    symmetry_factor = vertex_permutations * line_permutations\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(\"The symmetry factor (S) for a Feynman diagram is the number of ways its components can be interchanged without changing the diagram's structure.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis diagram consists of:\")\n    print(f\"- {num_vertices} identical vertices\")\n    print(f\"- {num_lines} identical lines (propagators) connecting the vertices\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation involves multiplying the factorials of the counts of these identical components.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    \n    # The final equation showing all the numbers involved\n    print(f\"S = ({num_vertices}!) * ({num_lines}!) = {vertex_permutations} * {line_permutations} = {symmetry_factor}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
