print(f"This value is nearly identical to the PS amplitude in alcohol-preferring rats ({ps_alcohol_pref} mV).")
print("Conclusion: This implies that alcohol-preferring rats have a similar neurobiological state, i.e., HIGHER extracellular GABA levels.\n")


print("Step 3: Analyze Tonic Inhibition.")
print("Tonic inhibition is caused by extracellular GABA. Since extracellular GABA is higher in alcohol-preferring rats, they will have INCREASED tonic inhibition compared to sucrose-preferring rats.\n")


print("Step 4: Evaluate Potential Pharmacological Treatments.")
print("The alcohol-preference phenotype is linked to a state of high extracellular GABA.")
print("To counteract this, a GABA receptor ANTAGONIST (which blocks the receptor) would be a logical therapeutic approach.")
print("A GABA agonist (which activates the receptor) would likely worsen the condition.")
print("Conclusion: GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol.\n")

GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol by alcohol-preferring rats. The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats. Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala...'")
