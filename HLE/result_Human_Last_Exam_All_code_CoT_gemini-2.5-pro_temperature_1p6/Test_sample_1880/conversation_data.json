    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I'll confirm that the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial's Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. I will use Eisenstein's criterion for this check.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant**: I will compute the discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial. Whether $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ determines if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Construct the Resolvent Cubic**: Next, I will find the resolvent cubic polynomial. The nature of its roots (whether they are rational or irrational) is key to identifying the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I will find the roots of the resolvent cubic to see if it's reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n5.  **Identify the Galois Group**: Based on the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic's reducibility, I'll identify the Galois group. For quartics, the possible groups are $S_4$, $A_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the cyclic group $C_4$, or the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n6.  **Determine the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known. For example, the order of $S_4$ is 24, $A_4$ is 12, and $D_4$ is 8.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, Rational, sqrt, factor\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the polynomial and its parameters for the depressed quartic form x^4 + px + q\n    x = symbols('x')\n    f_poly = x**4 + 8*x + 14\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = {f_poly}\")\n    \n    # Check for irreducibility using sympy (or manually by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2)\n    is_irred = Poly(f_poly, x, domain='QQ').is_irreducible()\n    if not is_irred:\n        print(\"The polynomial is reducible, the analysis for irreducible quartics doesn't apply directly.\")\n        return\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the quartic\n    # For x^4 + px + q, the discriminant is 256*q^3 - 27*p^4\n    discriminant = 256 * q**3 - 27 * p**4\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: The discriminant is calculated as 256*({q})^3 - 27*({p})^4 = {discriminant}\")\n    \n    # Check if the discriminant is a perfect square\n    sqrt_discriminant = sympy.integer_nthroot(discriminant, 2)\n    is_square = sqrt_discriminant[1]\n    \n    if is_square:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is a perfect square.
