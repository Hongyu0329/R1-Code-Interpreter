    # Step 1: Identify the correct tissue source and isolation method.
    # Fibroblasts in the cornea are derived from keratocytes, which reside in the stroma.
    # To isolate the stroma, the overlying epithelium and underlying endothelium must be removed (debrided).
    print("\nAnalysis Step 1: To get a fibroblast cell line, one must isolate stromal cells by debriding both the epithelium and the endothelium.")

    # Step 2: Identify the correct cell culture conditions and behavior.
    # In culture media containing serum (like FBS), stromal keratocytes proliferate and differentiate into fibroblasts/myofibroblasts.
    # These cells are adherent, meaning they stick to the culture flask.
    # Standard medium composition is typically 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.
    print("Analysis Step 2: The isolated stromal cells are grown in a medium containing serum (like FBS) to promote proliferation. Fibroblasts are adherent cells.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Option C based on the analysis.
    # Option C states: "Debrided epithelium and endothelium induced proliferation of the stromal cells to myofibroblasts
    # in the medium containing 10% of the FBS and 1% antibiotic, and they adhered to the bottom of the flask."
    # This aligns perfectly with our analysis.
    print("\nConclusion: Option C accurately describes a standard and correct protocol.")
    print(" - It correctly identifies the isolation method (debriding epithelium and endothelium).")
    print(" - It correctly describes the cell behavior (proliferation into myofibroblasts, adherence).")
    print(" - It provides standard concentrations for the culture medium components.")

    # Step 4: As requested, output the numbers from the final correct option.
