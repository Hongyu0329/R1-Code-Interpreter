    "This problem asks for the minimum sum of the number of vertices of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$. For $n=35$, we need to find this minimum value.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The problem is a classic one in extremal graph theory. We are asked for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i} |V(B_i)|$, where $\\{B_i\\}$ is a collection of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ such that their edge sets union to the entire edge set of $K_n$.\n2.  **Problem Simplification:**\n    *   It can be shown that an edge *covering* can be turned into an edge *partition* without increasing the sum of the number of vertices.\n    *   Similarly, any bipartite subgraph can be extended to a *complete bipartite subgraph* (a biclique) on the same vertex set.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a biclique partition of $K_n$, where the \"size\" is defined as the sum of the number of vertices in each biclique.\n3.  **The Optimal Decomposition:** It is a known result in graph theory that the minimum size is achieved by a specific construction called the **star decomposition**. This method partitions the edges of $K_n$ into $n-1$ star graphs (which are bicliques of the form $K_{1,k}$).\n4.  **Describing the Construction:** Let the vertices of $K_n$ be $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$.\n    *   First, we take all edges connected to vertex $v_1$. These form a star graph $B_1 = K_{\\{v_1\\}, \\{v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}}$. The number of vertices in this biclique is $1 + (n-1) = n$.\n    *   After removing these edges, we are left with a complete graph $K_{n-1}$ on the vertices $\\{v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$. We repeat the process with vertex $v_2$, forming a star $B_2 = K_{\\{v_2\\}, \\{v_3, \\dots, v_n\\}}$. This biclique has $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ vertices.\n    *   We continue this process until we are left with the final edge between $v_{n-1}$ and $v_n$, which forms the biclique $B_{n-1} = K_{\\{v_{n-1}\\}, \\{v_n\\}}$. This biclique has $1+1=2$ vertices.\n5.  **Deriving the Formula:** The total sum of the number of vertices is the sum of the sizes of these $n-1$ bicliques:\n    $n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\dots + 2$.\n    This is an arithmetic series which can be calculated as $(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i) - 1$, which simplifies to the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Minimum Vertices} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 $$\n    This result has been formally proven to be the minimum possible size for a biclique partition of $K_n$.\n6.  **Calculation:** We can now write a Python script to compute this value for $n=35$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The formula for the minimum sum of vertices is n * (n + 1) / 2 - 1.\n    # This is derived from the optimal \"star decomposition\" of K_n.\n    numerator = n * (n + 1)\n    denominator = 2\n    \n    # We perform the calculation step-by-step to show the process.\n    result_before_subtraction = numerator // denominator\n    final_result = result_before_subtraction - 1\n    \n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering the edges of K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"This is a known result in graph theory, and the minimum value is achieved by a star decomposition.\")\n    print(f\"The formula for this minimum is: n * (n + 1) / 2 - 1\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"({n} * ({n} + 1)) / {denominator} - 1\")\n    print(f\"= ({n} * {n + 1}) / {denominator} - 1\")\n    print(f\"= {numerator} / {denominator} - 1\")\n    print(f\"= {result_before_subtraction} - 1\")\n    print(f\"= {final_result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<629>>>"
