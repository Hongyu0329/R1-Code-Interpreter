    # Step 1: Analyze the first call, `a->foo()`
    # The compiler doesn't know the dynamic type of 'a'.
    # To call a virtual function, it must:

    # Step 2: Analyze the effect of `escape(a)`
    # The comment `// this can potentially modify dynamic type of a` is a directive
    # to the compiler. It means the object at the memory location of 'a' might have been
    # destroyed and replaced with a new object (e.g., via placement-new).
    # A perfect compiler must assume the worst and discard any cached information about '*a'`,
    # including its vptr.
    print("Call 2: escape(a)")
    print("- This opaque call can change the object's dynamic type.")
    print("- The compiler must invalidate its cache and cannot assume the vptr is the same.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the second call, `a->bar()`
    # Because `escape(a)` could have changed the object, the compiler cannot reuse the
    # vptr it loaded for the first call. It must perform a full virtual dispatch again.

    # Step 4: Analyze `std::launder(a)` and the third call, `b->foo()`
    # `std::launder` itself generates no code. It just tells the compiler that the pointer 'a'
    # is now safe to use for accessing the potentially new object.
    # Between `a->bar()` and `b->foo()`, nothing happens that could change the object's type again.
    # Therefore, a perfect compiler can optimize this. It can reuse the vptr that was just
    # loaded for `a->bar()`.
    # However, it is calling `foo()`, not `bar()`, so it must still load the function
    # pointer for `foo` from the vtable, as it's at a different offset.
    vfunc_loads += 1
    print("Call 4: b->foo() (after std::launder)")
    print("- No operations between `a->bar()` and `b->foo()` can change the object's type.")
    print(f"- The compiler can reuse the vptr loaded for `a->bar()`. (0 new vptr loads)")
    print(f"- However, it must load the function pointer for 'foo', which is different from 'bar'. (1 new vfunc load)")
