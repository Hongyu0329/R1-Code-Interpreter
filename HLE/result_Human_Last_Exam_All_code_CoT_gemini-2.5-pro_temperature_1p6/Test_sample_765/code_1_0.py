def calculate_area():
    """
    This function calculates the area of a region R in the complex plane using a Monte Carlo simulation.
    
    The region R is defined by the condition floor(|z|) = |floor(z)|, where z is a complex number.
    This is evaluated within a square region with corners at 0+0i and 6+6i.

    Let z = x + yi. The defining equation is:
    floor(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = sqrt(floor(x)^2 + floor(y)^2)

    For the equation to hold, the right-hand side must be an integer, since the left-hand side is an integer by definition. Let this integer be k.
    The simulation proceeds as follows:
    1. A large number of random points (x, y) are generated within the 6x6 square domain.
    2. For each point, we check if it belongs to the region R.
        a. Calculate n = floor(x) and m = floor(y).
        b. Calculate k = sqrt(n^2 + m^2) and check if it's an integer.
        c. If k is an integer, we then check if floor(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) equals k.
    3. The area of R is estimated by the ratio of the number of points inside R to the total number of sample points, multiplied by the total area of the square (36).
