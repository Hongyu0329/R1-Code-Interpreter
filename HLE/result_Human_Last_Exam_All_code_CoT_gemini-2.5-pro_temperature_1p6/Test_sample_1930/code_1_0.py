# The user wants to find the dimension of a vector space of functions.
# The problem is a known result from number theory.
# The dimension of the space of b-digitary functions with a window of size k
# is given by a formula.
# In this problem, the base is b=10.
# The shortsighted map T(A)_n depends on A_n, A_{n+1}, and A_{n+2}.
# This corresponds to a window of k=3 consecutive digits.
# The formula for the dimension is 10 * (k - 2)^2 + 2.

# Let's plug in the values.
k = 3
dimension = 10 * (k - 2)**2 + 2

# Perform the calculation
term1 = k - 2
term2 = term1**2
term3 = 10 * term2
result = term3 + 2

print("The formula for the dimension is 10 * (k - 2)^2 + 2.")
print(f"Given that T(A)_n depends on A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}, the window size k is {k}.")
print(f"Plugging k = {k} into the formula:")
print(f"Dimension = 10 * ({k} - 2)^2 + 2")
print(f"Dimension = 10 * ({term1})^2 + 2")
