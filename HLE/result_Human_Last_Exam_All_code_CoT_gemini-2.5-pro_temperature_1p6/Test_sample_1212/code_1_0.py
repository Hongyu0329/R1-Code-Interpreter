    """
    This function solves the given Go puzzle by identifying all killing moves for White.

    The board state is as follows:
    - Black stones: A2, B3, B4, C1, C2
    - White stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    - It is White's move.

    Analysis:
    The five black stones form a single connected group. To kill this group, White must
    eliminate all its liberties before Black can form two eyes.

    The liberties of the black group are the adjacent empty points:
    - A1 (next to A2)
    - A3 (next to B3)
    - A4 (next to B4)
    - B1 (next to C1)
    - B2 (next to A2, B3, B4, C2)

    Any move by White on one of these five liberties initiates a sequence that
    leads to the capture of the black group. The key is that the black group does not
    have enough space to form two separate, living eyes against White's attack.
    Therefore, all five liberties are valid first moves for a kill sequence.
