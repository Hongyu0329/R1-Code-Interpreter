    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the fundamental group of the specified 4-manifold and then find the minimal number of elements required to generate it. This involves several steps from advanced knot theory and topology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the manifold and its fundamental group**: The manifold is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere, denoted $M$, over a specific 2-knot: the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which we'll call $K_s$. We need to find $\\pi_1(M)$.\n2.  **Use a powerful theorem**: There's a theorem relating the fundamental group of the double branched cover of a twist-spun knot to the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the original knot. Specifically, for a twist-spun knot $\\tau_n(J)$, its double branched cover has a fundamental group that is a quotient of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the original knot $J$ in $S^3$.\n3.  **Analyze the base knot**: In our case, the original knot $J$ is the trefoil knot. Its double branched cover in $S^3$ is a well-known 3-manifold, the Lens space $L(3,1)$. The fundamental group of $L(3,1)$ is the cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n4.  **Constrain the group**: From the theorem in step 2, $\\pi_1(M)$ must be a quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. The only possible quotients of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ are $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ itself and the trivial group $\\{1\\}$.\n5.  **Rule out the trivial case**: To determine which quotient it is, we calculate the first homology group of the manifold, $H_1(M)$, which is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(M)$. If $H_1(M)$ is non-trivial, then $\\pi_1(M)$ must also be non-trivial. The order of $H_1(M)$ can be calculated using the Alexander polynomial of the 2-knot, $\\Delta_{K_s}(t)$. The formula states that $|H_1(M)| = |\\Delta_{K_s}(-1)|$.\n6.  **Calculate the value**: The Alexander polynomial of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is the same as that of the trefoil knot itself: $\\Delta_{K_s}(t) = \\Delta_T(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$. We will evaluate this at $t=-1$.\n7.  **Conclusion**: Based on the calculation, we will establish that $\\pi_1(M)$ is non-trivial and thus must be $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is 1.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation from step 6 and lay out the complete argument to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group in question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1-4: Theoretical background setup\n    print(\"Background:\")\n    print(\"Let M be the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, K_s.\")\n    print(\"Let G = pi_1(M) be the fundamental group of this manifold.\")\n    print(\"A theorem in knot theory states that G is a quotient of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the trefoil in S^3.\")\n    print(\"The double branched cover of the trefoil is the Lens space L(3,1), and its fundamental group is Z_3.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, G must be a quotient of Z_3.
