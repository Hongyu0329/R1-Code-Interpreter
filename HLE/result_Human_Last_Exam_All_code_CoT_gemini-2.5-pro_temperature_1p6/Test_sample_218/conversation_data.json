    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n2.  The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{i,j}}$, where the product is over all hook lengths $h_{i,j}$ of the cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n3.  The overall approach is to:\n    a. Generate every integer partition of 25.\n    b. For each partition, construct its Young diagram and calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the Hook Length Formula.\n    c. Count how many of these dimensions are strictly less than 500,000.\n4.  I will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will generate the partitions, compute the dimensions, and count those that meet the criterion. It will also print the qualifying partitions and their dimensions before showing the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef partitions_generator(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n in non-increasing order.\n    This is an implementation of Algorithm H from Knuth, TAOCP Vol 4A, Section 7.2.1.4.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [0] * (n + 1)\n    k = 1\n    a[0] = 0 # sentinal\n    a[1] = n\n    while k != 0:\n        x = a[k] - 1\n        y = a[k-1]\n        k -= 1\n        while x > y:\n            a[k+1] = x\n            k += 1\n            x -= y\n        a[k+1] = x + y\n        yield a[1:k+2]\n\ndef calculate_dimension(n, partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to the given partition using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so n! is fine for n=25\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n\n    product_of_hooks = 1\n    # Iterate over each box (i, j) in the Young diagram\n    for i in range(len(partition)): # row index i (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(partition[i]): # column index j (0-indexed)\n            # Calculate hook length for box (i, j)\n            # Number of boxes to the right in the same row\n            hooks_right = partition[i] - (j + 1)\n            # Number of boxes below in the same column\n            hooks_below = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    hooks_below += 1\n            \n            # Total hook length = hooks_right + hooks_below + 1 (for the box itself)\n            hook_length = hooks_right + hooks_below + 1\n            product_of_hooks *= hook_length\n\n    # Use integer division for precision\n    dimension = n_factorial // product_of_hooks\n    return dimension\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the irreps of S_25 with dimension < 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    limit = 500000\n    count = 0\n    \n    found_irreps = []\n\n    # Iterate through all partitions of n\n    for p in partitions_generator(n):\n        # For each partition, calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep\n        dim = calculate_dimension(n, p)\n        \n        # Check if the dimension is strictly less than the limit\n        if dim < limit:\n            found_irreps.append((p, dim))\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Sort results by dimension for cleaner output\n    found_irreps.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    print(f\"Found {count} irreducible representations of S_{n} with dimension strictly less than {limit}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    for p, dim in found_irreps:\n         print(f\"Partition: {str(p):<55} Dimension: {dim}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"Final Count: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\n<<<42>>>"
