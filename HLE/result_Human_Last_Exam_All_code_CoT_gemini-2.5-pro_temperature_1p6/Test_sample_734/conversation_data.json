    "My plan is to first understand the specific theological concepts mentioned: a framework for *changes* in natural law, not just suspensions of it, and its application to both the virgin birth and the Fall. This requires looking beyond standard discussions of miracles and focusing on more philosophical theologians who posited a dynamic or potential-filled view of nature. I will identify the key figure who developed a specific, named terminology for this concept.\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed a detailed framework with specialized terminology to account for such events is **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430 AD).\n\nHe developed the doctrine of ***rationes seminales***, or \"seminal reasons\" (sometimes translated as \"causal principles\"). This concept, which he adapted from Stoic philosophy, posits that God embedded the potential for all future developments into the initial creation.\n\n*   **Application to Miracles (like the Virgin Birth):** According to Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature or a change in its laws. Instead, it is the activation by God of a latent potential—a \"seminal reason\"—that was part of creation's design from the beginning. It is only \"contrary to the course of nature *as we know it*,\" not contrary to nature as God created it in its entirety. The law of nature wasn't broken; a deeper, hidden law was revealed.\n*   **Application to the Fall:** This framework can also be applied to understand changes in the natural world after the Fall of Man. Theologians following Augustine could argue that sin's entrance into the world corrupted or suppressed some of the original, good seminal reasons, or activated others that result in decay, thorns, and thistles, thereby altering the observable \"laws\" or regularities of nature.\n\nThus, Augustine's concept of *rationes seminales* provides the specialized terminology and philosophical framework to describe apparent changes in the laws of nature in a way that applies to both unique miraculous events and potential systemic shifts in the natural order.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
