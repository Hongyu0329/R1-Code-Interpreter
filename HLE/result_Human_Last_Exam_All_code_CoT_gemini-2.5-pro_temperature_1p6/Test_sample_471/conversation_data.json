    "To determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$), we can use a powerful tool from differential topology called Morse theory.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** Morse theory connects the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topological properties.\n2.  **Define Betti Numbers:** The key topological properties we need are the Betti numbers ($b_k$), which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in the manifold. For the 2-torus ($T^2$):\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. A torus is one single piece, so $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of 1-dimensional, non-bounding loops. A torus has two such loops (one around the tube, one through the hole), so $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of 2-dimensional voids. A torus encloses a single void, so $b_2 = 1$.\n3.  **Apply the Weak Morse Inequalities:** A fundamental result from Morse theory is that for any \"well-behaved\" (Morse) function, the number of critical points of a given type is at least the corresponding Betti number.\n    *   Number of minima ($c_0$) $\\ge b_0$\n    *   Number of saddle points ($c_1$) $\\ge b_1$\n    *   Number of maxima ($c_2$) $\\ge b_2$\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** By summing these lower bounds, we can find the minimal total number of critical points any smooth function on the torus must have. This result, originally for Morse functions, can be extended to all smooth functions. The calculation is therefore: Total critical points $\\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # The Betti numbers describe the topology of the space.\n    # b_0: number of connected components.\n    # b_1: number of 1-dimensional \"holes\" or \"tunnels\".\n    # b_2: number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    b0 = 1  # The torus is one connected component.\n    b1 = 2  # The torus has two independent circular loops.\n    b2 = 1  # The torus encloses one 2D void.\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the Weak Morse Inequalities.\n    # Morse theory states that the number of critical points of index k (c_k)\n    # is greater than or equal to the k-th Betti number (b_k).\n    # c_0 >= b_0 (minima)\n    # c_1 >= b_1 (saddles)\n    # c_2 >= b_2 (maxima)\n    # Therefore, the minimal number for each type equals the Betti number.\n    min_c0 = b0\n    min_c1 = b1\n    min_c2 = b2\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the minimal total number of critical points.\n    # This is the sum of the minimal numbers for each type of critical point.\n    minimal_total_points = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the result as a clear equation.\n    print(\"Based on Morse theory, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\")\n    print(\"on a 2-torus is determined by its Betti numbers (b_0, b_1, b_2).\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of minima (c_0) >= b_0 = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of saddles (c_1) >= b_1 = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of maxima (c_2) >= b_2 = {b2}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe minimal total number of critical points is the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {minimal_total_points}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
