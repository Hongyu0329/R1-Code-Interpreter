    "My plan is to first identify the correct Israeli statute. I will search legal and historical sources to find the first law in the modern State of Israel that explicitly incorporated the principle of \"good faith\" as a general legal duty. This principle, known as *tom lev* in Hebrew, was a major innovation in Israeli law, largely moving it away from its English common law roots towards a more civil law-oriented approach in this area. Once I have identified the statute, I will write a simple Python script to print its name, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the first statute in the\n# modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n# This law, particularly through its sections 12 and 39, made \"good faith\" a\n# foundational principle in Israeli contract law.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
