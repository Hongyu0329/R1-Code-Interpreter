    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to answer your question.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will first identify the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  I will locate the specific section within the poem that enumerates the names of the prophets.\n3.  I will determine the starting and ending bayt (verse) numbers for this section.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines these start and end numbers and prints a clear statement providing the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayts) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that mention the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The enumeration of the 25 prophets in the poem begins in bayt 30 and concludes in bayt 33.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    end_bayt = 33\n\n    # The introductory verse stating that 25 prophets will be detailed is bayt 29.\n    introductory_bayt = 29\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi:\")\n    print(f\"The introductory verse for the list of Prophets is bayt number: {introductory_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt number\")\n    print(f\"start: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(\"to\")\n    print(f\"end: {end_bayt}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information.\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
