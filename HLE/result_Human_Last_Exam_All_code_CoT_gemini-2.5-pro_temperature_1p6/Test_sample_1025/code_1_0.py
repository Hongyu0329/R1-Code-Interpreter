# --- Analysis Logic ---

# Step 1: Analyze Question 1 ("changed as a baby")
# Doc 1 specifies the change happens "at a few months old".
# Doc 2 specifies the change happens "As they reached puberty".
# The phrase "a few months old" is a better match for "as a baby" than "puberty".
# Therefore, Doc 1 is more relevant for Question 1.
rank_q1 = 1

# Step 2: Analyze Question 2 ("did not change as a baby")
# Both documents state "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour.", which is identical.
# However, Doc 1 provides a more relevant overall context for the "baby" timeframe due to the "few months old" detail.
# This makes it a slightly higher-quality document for the entire topic.
# Therefore, Doc 1 is ranked higher for Question 2 as well.
rank_q2 = 1

# Step 3: Determine the final answer
# The combined ranking is 1-1.
# This corresponds to answer choice 'A'.
final_answer_choice = 'A'
