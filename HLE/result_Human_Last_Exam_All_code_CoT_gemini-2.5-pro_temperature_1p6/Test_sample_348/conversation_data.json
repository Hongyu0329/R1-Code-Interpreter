    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to calculate the total welfare.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Mathematical Functions:** First, I will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** Market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price. I will find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`) by numerically solving the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Once `Q_e` is known, I can easily calculate the equilibrium price (`P_e`) by plugging `Q_e` into either function.\n3.  **Calculate Surpluses:**\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line. It's calculated with the integral: `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - P_e * Q_e`.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve. The supply curve is only defined when `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, so its domain starts at `Q = 2^(1/3)`. The formula is: `PS = P_e * Q_e - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** The total welfare is the sum of the consumer and producer surpluses: `Total Welfare = CS + PS`.\n5.  **Execute and Display:** I will use Python's `scipy` library for the numerical solver (`fsolve`) and integrator (`quad`). The code will calculate all the necessary values and print them in a clear, step-by-step format, showing the final equation with the calculated numbers.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand(q):\n    \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    q = np.asarray(q, dtype=float)\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\ndef supply(q):\n    \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    q = np.asarray(q, dtype=float)\n    # The logarithm is only defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0.\n    # We suppress errors for values outside this domain during solving.\n    with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'):\n        result = np.log(q**3 - 2)\n    return result\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n    \"\"\"Equation to solve for equilibrium: Supply(Q) - Demand(Q) = 0\"\"\"\n    return supply(q) - demand(q)\n\n# An initial guess for the solver, based on preliminary analysis.\ninitial_guess_q = 4.5\n# Use fsolve to find the root, which is the equilibrium quantity.\nequilibrium_quantity_result = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_q)\nQ_e = equilibrium_quantity_result[0]\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium price using the demand function\nP_e = demand(Q_e)\n\nprint(\"--- Market Equilibrium ---\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium quantity (Q_e) is: {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium price (P_e) is: {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus\n# The integral of the demand function from 0 to Q_e\narea_under_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_e)\nconsumer_surplus = area_under_demand - P_e * Q_e\n\n# The minimum quantity for which the supply function is defined (Q^3 - 2 > 0)\nq_min_supply = np.cbrt(2)\n# The integral of the supply function from its starting point to Q_e\narea_under_supply, _ = quad(supply, q_min_supply, Q_e)\nproducer_surplus = P_e * Q_e - area_under_supply\n\nprint(\"--- Surplus Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Consumer Surplus (CS) is calculated as: ∫D(Q)dQ - P_e*Q_e = {area_under_demand:.4f} - {P_e*Q_e:.4f} = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Producer Surplus (PS) is calculated as: P_e*Q_e - ∫S(Q)dQ = {P_e*Q_e:.4f} - {area_under_supply:.4f} = {producer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Total Welfare\ntotal_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\nprint(\"--- Total Welfare Calculation ---\")\nprint(\"Total Welfare is the sum of Consumer and Producer Surplus.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: Total Welfare = CS + PS\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The final Total Welfare is: {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n<<<22.3934>>>\n```"
