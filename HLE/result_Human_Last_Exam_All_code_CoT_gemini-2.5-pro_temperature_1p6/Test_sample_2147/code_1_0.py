# This script identifies what "X-Y" refers to in Pavel Milyukov's quote.

# Pavel Milyukov was a Russian politician and a critic of modern art movements
# at the turn of the 20th century. He saw these new forms of expression
# as a sign of cultural decay.

# The term he famously denounced as a 'stagnant swamp' was a specific art movement.
# We can represent the two parts of the term as X and Y.

x = "Post"
y = "Impressionists"

# Reconstructing the term from X and Y.
full_term = f"{x}-{y}"
