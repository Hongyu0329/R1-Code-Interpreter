    "My plan to answer this question involves a few steps.\n1. First, I need to locate the original quote by Paul Morand that Fernand Braudel references. The user's query provides key terms: \"Fernand Braudel,\" \"Paul Morand,\" \"nation,\" and \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n2. I will use these terms to find the specific passage in Braudel's work, likely \"The Perspective of the World,\" the third volume of his \"Civilization and Capitalism.\"\n3. By examining the context in which Braudel uses the quote, I can identify the \"conceptual entity\" he is discussing. The prompt indicates that this entity is often viewed through the narrow lens of a \"nation\" but should be seen within a larger \"sphere.\"\n4. The quote from Morand is, \"Every history should be inscribed within a sphere.\" Braudel uses this to support his argument that history should not be confined to the study of nation-states but should be analyzed within the broader context of a \"world-economy\" or \"world-system\" (the sphere).\n5. Therefore, the conceptual entity is \"history.\"\n6. I will write a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided quote.\n    \n    The user is asking about a \"conceptual entity\" from a quote by Paul Morand,\n    used by historian Fernand Braudel.\n    \n    1. The quote by Morand is: \"Every history should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    2. Braudel uses this to argue against limiting historical study to the nation-state.\n    3. He proposes that the proper frame for study (the \"sphere\") is a larger\n       \"world-economy\" or \"world-system\".\n    4. Thus, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within this sphere,\n       rather than just a nation, is history itself.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    conceptual_entity = \"history\"\n    \n    print(f\"The conceptual entity that Paul Morand, quoted by Fernand Braudel, argued should be inscribed within a sphere is: {conceptual_entity}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<history>>>"
