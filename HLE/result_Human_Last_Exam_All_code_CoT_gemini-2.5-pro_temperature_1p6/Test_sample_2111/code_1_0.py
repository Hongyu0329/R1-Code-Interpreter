    This function solves the riddle based on the provided quote.
    
    The user is asking about a "conceptual entity" from a quote by Paul Morand,
    used by historian Fernand Braudel.
    
    1. The quote by Morand is: "Every history should be inscribed within a sphere."
    2. Braudel uses this to argue against limiting historical study to the nation-state.
    3. He proposes that the proper frame for study (the "sphere") is a larger
       "world-economy" or "world-system".
    4. Thus, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within this sphere,
       rather than just a nation, is history itself.
