    "My plan to solve this problem is to use a combinatorial approach combined with computation. A brute-force search over all `C(25, 4)` placements is possible, but a more structured method will reveal the nature of the solution and naturally produce the \"final equation\" mentioned in the prompt.\n\nHere are the steps of my plan:\n1.  A placement of 4 non-attacking queens requires them to be in 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns.\n2.  First, I will calculate the number of ways to choose 4 rows out of 5 and 4 columns out of 5. This is calculated using the combination formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.\n3.  Next, for a fixed `4x4` subgrid (for instance, rows 0-3 and columns 0-3), I need to find the number of ways to place the 4 queens so that they don't attack each other via the toroidal diagonals of the main `5x5` board. A placement on this subgrid can be viewed as a permutation of the columns for the given rows.\n4.  I will write a script to iterate through all `4! = 24` permutations to find how many of them are valid. A permutation is valid if for all queen positions `(r, c)`, the values `(r - c) mod 5` are all unique, and the values `(r + c) mod 5` are also all unique. Due to the board's symmetry, this count will be the same for any choice of 4 rows and 4 columns.\n5.  The final answer is the product of these three numbers: (ways to choose 4 rows) * (ways to choose 4 columns) * (number of valid permutations on the subgrid).\n6.  The final python code will perform these calculations and print the components of the final product, fulfilling the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_queens_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5\n    toroidal chessboard using a combinatorial method.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # Board size\n    K = 4  # Number of queens\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose K rows and K columns.\n    # We use the math.comb function, which is equivalent to n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n    ways_to_choose_rows = math.comb(N, K)\n    ways_to_choose_cols = math.comb(N, K)\n\n    # Step 2: For a fixed KxK subgrid (e.g., rows/cols 0..K-1), count the\n    # number of valid queen placements (permutations) that satisfy the\n    # toroidal non-attacking conditions on the NxN board.\n    \n    # We use a representative set of rows and columns for the KxK subgrid.\n    subgrid_indices = range(K)\n    \n    valid_perms_count = 0\n    # Iterate through all permutations of column assignments for the rows.\n    for p in itertools.permutations(subgrid_indices):\n        # A permutation 'p' maps row `i` to column `p[i]`.\n        # Queens are at (0, p[0]), (1, p[1]), ..., (K-1, p[K-1]).\n        \n        # Check diagonal attack conditions using modulo N arithmetic.\n        # The values of (row - col) % N must be unique for all queens.\n        # The values of (row + col) % N must also be unique for all queens.\n        diffs = {(i - p[i]) % N for i in subgrid_indices}\n        sums = {(i + p[i]) % N for i in subgrid_indices}\n\n        # If the number of unique differences and sums equals K, the permutation is valid.\n        if len(diffs) == K and len(sums) == K:\n            valid_perms_count += 1\n\n    # Step 3: The total number of ways is the product of the three parts.\n    total_ways = ways_to_choose_rows * ways_to_choose_cols * valid_perms_count\n\n    # Print the final equation with each number, as requested.\n    print(f\"The total number of ways is the product of:\")\n    print(f\"- Ways to choose {K} rows from {N}: C({N},{K}) = {ways_to_choose_rows}\")\n    print(f\"- Ways to choose {K} columns from {N}: C({N},{K}) = {ways_to_choose_cols}\")\n    print(f\"- Valid non-attacking placements on a {K}x{K} subgrid: {valid_perms_count}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {ways_to_choose_rows} * {ways_to_choose_cols} * {valid_perms_count} = {total_ways}\")\n\n\nsolve_queens_problem()\n<<<50>>>\n```"
