    "No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. This holds true even for homopolynucleotides.\n\nAlthough both are biological polymers (large molecules made of repeating subunits called monomers), their fundamental structure is entirely different in three key ways:\n\n1.  **Monomer Units:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers of **monosaccharides** (simple sugars like glucose). The monomer is a carbohydrate.\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers of **nucleotides**. Each nucleotide is a more complex unit composed of three parts: a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n\n2.  **Chemical Bonds:**\n    *   The monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are linked by **glycosidic bonds**.\n    *   The nucleotides in a polynucleotide are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**, which form a characteristic sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\n3.  **Elemental Composition:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C, H, O).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but they also crucially contain **phosphorus** (in the phosphate groups) and **nitrogen** (in the nitrogenous bases).\n\nIn summary, they are distinct classes of macromolecules with different building blocks, different chemical linkages, and different elemental compositions.\n\n<<<No, polynucleotides are structurally and chemically distinct from polysaccharides.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
