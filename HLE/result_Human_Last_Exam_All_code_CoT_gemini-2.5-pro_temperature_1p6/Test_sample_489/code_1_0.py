    # Statement a: The quotient topology on Omega_g^rt / GL_g(Z) is Hausdorff.
    # Result: True. The action is proper, so the quotient is Hausdorff.
    answer_a = 'Y'

    # Statement b: The barycentric subdivision of the perfect cone decomposition of Omega_4^rt consists only of simplicial cones.
    # Note the number g=4.
    # Result: True. This is a general property of barycentric subdivisions.
    answer_b = 'Y'

    # Statement c: For any compact set K, there's a finite set of cones in the second Voronoi compactification covering K.
    # Result: True. This follows from the local finiteness of the cone decomposition.
    answer_c = 'Y'

    # Statement d: The number of orbits of maximal cones in the perfect cone decomposition of Omega_7^rt is 33.
    # Note the numbers g=7 and 33.
    # Result: True. This is a known computational result from the classification of perfect forms.
    answer_d = 'Y'

    # Statement e: The GL_g(Z)-stabilizer of a cone sigma in the central cone decomposition is finite if sigma intersects Omega_g.
    # Result: True. The stabilizer embeds into a finite permutation group.
    answer_e = 'Y'
    
    # Statement f: The number of orbits of cones in the Second Voronoi decomposition of Omega_5^rt is 222.
    # Note the numbers g=5 and 222.
    # Result: False. The number of orbits of maximal cones is 2. The total number is small, not 222.
    answer_f = 'N'

    # Statement g: Given cones tau, sigma with tau a face of sigma, Stab(tau) is a subset of Stab(sigma).
    # Result: False. The stabilizer of a face is not in general a subgroup of the stabilizer of the cone.
