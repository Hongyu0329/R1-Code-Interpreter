# This script solves the puzzle by deducing the patterns for shape, angle, and dots.

# 1. Determine the shape for cell 9.
# The pattern is three of each shape: Circle, Circle, Circle, Square, Square, Square, ...
# Cell 7 and 8 are Triangles, so Cell 9 is also a Triangle.
shape_9 = "Triangle"

# 2. Determine the angle progression for the Triangle group.
# Cell 7 starts at 0 degrees ("straight up").
# Cell 8 is at pi radians, which is 180 degrees.
# This means the angle increases by 180 degrees for each cell in the Triangle group.
angle_cell_8 = 180
angular_step = 180

# 3. Calculate the angle for cell 9.
# The angle of cell 9 is the angle of cell 8 plus the step.
angle_cell_9 = angle_cell_8 + angular_step

print(f"The calculation for the final angle is:")
print(f"{angle_cell_8} + {angular_step} = {angle_cell_9}")

# 4. Calculate the number of dots for cell 9.
# Across all cells, the number of dots is related to the angle by the rule: Dots = Angle / 60.
dots_cell_9 = angle_cell_9 / 60

print(f"The calculation for the final number of dots is:")
print(f"{angle_cell_9} / 60 = {int(dots_cell_9)}")

# 5. Format the final description.
# An angle of 360 degrees is equivalent to 0 degrees, which is "straight up".
# The rules state to use the text "Arrow is straight up" for this case.
arrow_description_9 = "Arrow is straight up"

# Combine the parts into the final text. We use int() to avoid printing "6.0".
final_answer = f"{shape_9}. {int(dots_cell_9)} dots. {arrow_description_9}"

print("\nThe final answer is:")
print(final_answer)
