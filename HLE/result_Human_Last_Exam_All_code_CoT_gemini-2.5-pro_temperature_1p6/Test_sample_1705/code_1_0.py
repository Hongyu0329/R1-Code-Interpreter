# The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S, where S is the set of initial points x_0
# for which the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values.
#
# Let f(x) = (2x + sin(2*pi*x))/3.
# The condition that the sequence {x_n} has exactly 7 distinct values means that the sequence is
# eventually periodic. For instance, x_0, x_1, ..., x_6 are distinct, and x_7 = f(x_6) is one of
# the previous values {x_0, x_1, ..., x_6}.
#
# This means that any x_0 in S must be a pre-periodic point for the map f.
# In the theory of dynamical systems, for a map like f (a C^1 function), the set of all
# pre-periodic points is a countable set.
#
# A fundamental property of the Lebesgue measure is that any countable set of points has a measure of 0.
# Since S is a subset of the set of all pre-periodic points, S must be a countable set itself.
# Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.
#
# A non-zero measure would imply that S contains an interval. If an interval J is a subset of S,
# then for all x in J, f^k(x) = f^l(x) for some k != l. This is a very strong condition that
# does not hold for the given function f.
#
# Thus, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.
