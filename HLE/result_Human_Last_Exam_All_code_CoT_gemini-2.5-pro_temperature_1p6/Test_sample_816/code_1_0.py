    # --- Analysis of each potential force ---

    # A. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Gradient)
    print("Choice A: Marangoni Force")
    print("  - Mechanism: Flow driven by gradients in surface tension on the liquid surface.")
    print("  - Surface tension (γ) changes with temperature (T). This is key.")
    print("  - In alloys like steel containing surface-active elements (e.g., sulfur, oxygen), the temperature coefficient of surface tension (dγ/dT) is positive.")
    print("  - This means surface tension is HIGHEST at the hottest part (the center) and lower at the cooler edges.")
    print("  - The fluid on the surface is pulled from the region of low surface tension (edge) to high surface tension (center).")
    print("  - Resulting Flow Direction: INWARD.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This matches the observation and is a well-known effect in steels.\n")

    # B. Arc drag Force
    print("Choice B: Arc drag Force")
    print("  - Mechanism: Shear force from the plasma jet flowing over the weld pool surface.")
    print("  - The plasma jet flows from the arc center radially outward.")
    print("  - Resulting Flow Direction: OUTWARD.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This contradicts the observation.\n")

    # C. Arc Pressure Force
    print("Choice C: Arc Pressure Force")
    print("  - Mechanism: A downward pressure exerted by the plasma jet.")
    print("  - This force primarily causes a depression in the weld pool surface, not a radial surface flow.")
    print("  - Resulting Flow Direction: DOWNWARD (not the primary radial flow mechanism).")
    print("  - Conclusion: This does not explain the inward surface flow.\n")

    # D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force
    print("Choice D: Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force")
    print("  - Mechanism: Interaction between the welding current (J) and its own magnetic field (B).")
    print("  - As current spreads out in the molten pool, it creates an inward and downward force ('electromagnetic stirring').")
    print("  - While it does have an inward component, the Marangoni effect is generally considered the dominant driver of the *surface* flow pattern (inward vs. outward) based on material composition.")
    print("  - Conclusion: A contributing factor, but the Marangoni force better explains the specific inward surface flow characteristic of steels.\n")

    # E. Buoyancy Force
    print("Choice E: Buoyancy Force")
    print("  - Mechanism: Hotter, less dense liquid rises, and cooler, denser liquid sinks due to gravity.")
    print("  - This creates a circulation pattern but is generally a much weaker force compared to the Marangoni and Lorentz forces in arc welding.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Not the dominant mechanism.\n")

    print("-" * 50)
    print("Final Determination:")
