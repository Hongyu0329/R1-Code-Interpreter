def solve_cardinality():
    """
    This function analyzes the properties of continuous functions f: R -> R
    satisfying the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x) and determines the cardinality
    of the set of such functions.

    The equation can be written as f(f(x)) = exp(1*x) + 0.

    1. Any such function f must be strictly monotonic.

    2. It can be shown that there are no strictly decreasing solutions.
       An assumption of a decreasing solution leads to the equation a = exp(a)
       for the limit 'a' of the function at infinity. This equation has 0 real solutions.

    3. Strictly increasing solutions exist. They can be constructed, and the
       construction allows for a high degree of freedom, equivalent to choosing
       an arbitrary real number from an interval and an arbitrary continuous
       monotonic function over a subinterval.

    4. The number of such increasing solutions is the cardinality of the
       continuum, denoted as 'c' (or |R|). This is the 'size' of the set
       of all real numbers. It is an uncountable infinity.

    Therefore, the cardinality of the set of all solutions is c.
