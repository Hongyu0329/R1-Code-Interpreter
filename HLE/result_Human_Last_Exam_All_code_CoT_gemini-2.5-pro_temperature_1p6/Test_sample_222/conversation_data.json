    "This problem requires us to find a 4-point DFT related to an 8-point sequence `y(n)`. The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Understand the relationship between the sequences.** The new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This means the even-indexed samples of `y(n)` form the sequence `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed samples form `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(2n) = x(n)`\n    *   `y(2n+1) = h(n)`\n\n2.  **Apply the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT algorithm.** This algorithm relates the DFT of a sequence to the DFTs of its even and odd parts. Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The DIT formulas are:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    where `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / N)`.\n\n3.  **Interpret the request.** The question asks for the \"4-point DFT for\" an 8-point sequence. Since a 4-point DFT is not defined for an 8-point sequence, a common interpretation for such a problem is to find the aliased version of `Y(k)`, which is obtained by taking every other sample of the 8-point DFT. This corresponds to the sequence `Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required values.** We will calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)` using the DIT formulas and the provided `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Y(4)` is found using the second formula with k=0: `Y(0+4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Y(6)` is found using the second formula with k=2: `Y(2+4) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\n5.  **Provide the code and calculations.** The python code will define the inputs, calculate the necessary twiddle factors (`W_8^0` and `W_8^2`), compute the four results, and print the step-by-step calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_complex(c):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to format complex numbers for clean output.\"\"\"\n    c = np.round(c, 10) # Clean up potential floating point inaccuracies\n    if c.imag == 0:\n        return f\"{c.real:.4g}\"\n    if c.real == 0:\n        if c.imag == 1:\n            return \"j\"\n        if c.imag == -1:\n            return \"-j\"\n        return f\"{c.imag:.4g}j\"\n    sign = \"+\" if c.imag > 0 else \"-\"\n    return f\"({c.real:.4g} {sign} {abs(c.imag):.4g}j)\"\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the 4-point DFT related to the interleaved sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j])\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the input 4-point DFTs.\")\n    print(f\"X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]\")\n    print(f\"H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: The new 8-point sequence y(n) is an interleaving of x(n) and h(n).\")\n    print(\"We can find its 8-point DFT, Y(k), using the Decimation-In-Time FFT formulas:\")\n    print(\"Y(k)     = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)  (for k=0,1,2,3)\")\n    print(\"Y(k+4)   = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)  (for k=0,1,2,3)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: The question 'Find 4-point DFT for...' is interpreted as finding the aliased sequence {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the required twiddle factors W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8).\")\n    # Twiddle factors\n    W8_0 = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * 0 / 8)\n    W8_2 = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * 2 / 8)\n    print(f\"W_8^0 = {format_complex(W8_0)}\")\n    print(f\"W_8^2 = exp(-j*pi/2) = {format_complex(W8_2)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Compute each term of the resulting 4-point sequence.\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate Y(0)\n    Y0 = X[0] + W8_0 * H[0]\n    print(f\"Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[0])} + {format_complex(W8_0)} * {format_complex(H[0])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[0])} + {format_complex(W8_0 * H[0])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(Y0)}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate Y(2)\n    Y2 = X[2] + W8_2 * H[2]\n    print(f\"Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[2])} + {format_complex(W8_2)} * {format_complex(H[2])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[2])} + {format_complex(W8_2 * H[2])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(Y2)}\\n\")\n    \n    # Calculate Y(4)\n    Y4 = X[0] - W8_0 * H[0]\n    print(f\"Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[0])} - {format_complex(W8_0)} * {format_complex(H[0])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[0])} - {format_complex(W8_0 * H[0])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(Y4)}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate Y(6)\n    Y6 = X[2] - W8_2 * H[2]\n    print(f\"Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[2])} - ({format_complex(W8_2)}) * {format_complex(H[2])}\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(X[2])} - ({format_complex(W8_2 * H[2])})\")\n    print(f\"     = {format_complex(Y6)}\\n\")\n    \n    final_result = [Y0, Y2, Y4, Y6]\n    print(\"The final 4-point sequence is [Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)]\")\n    print(\"Result: [\" + \", \".join([format_complex(c) for c in final_result]) + \"]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_dft()\n    <<<[1, (-1 - 1j), 1, (-1 + 1j)]>>>\n```"
