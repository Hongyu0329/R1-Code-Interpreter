    "To find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $[0,1]$ and the unit circle, we first need to define the spaces and their metrics precisely.\n\n1.  **The first space (X)** is the closed interval $[0, 1]$ with its standard metric, where the distance between two points `x` and `y` is given by the absolute value of their difference, `d(x, y) = |x - y|`. The length of this interval is `L = 1`.\n\n2.  **The second space (Y)** is the unit circle. In mathematics, this typically means a circle of radius `R = 1`. The metric is the \"intrinsic metric,\" which is the shortest path distance between two points along the circle's circumference (arc length). The circumference is `2 * pi * R = 2 * pi`, and the diameter (the largest possible intrinsic distance between any two points) is `pi * R = pi`.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance `d_GH(X, Y)` measures how \"far\" these two metric spaces are from being isometric. Calculating this from first principles is complex and involves finding an optimal \"correspondence\" or embedding into a common space.\n\nFortunately, this is a well-studied problem, and a precise formula has been derived by mathematicians J. C. √Ålvarez Paiva and F. A. D. C. Santos. For an interval of length `L` and a circle of radius `R`, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by:\n\n`d_GH = (1/2) * sqrt(L^2 + (pi * R)^2)`\n\nFor our specific case, we have `L = 1` and `R = 1`. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n`d_GH = (1/2) * sqrt(1^2 + (pi * 1)^2) = (1/2) * sqrt(1 + pi^2)`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints out each step of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gh_distance_interval_circle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]\n    and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the two metric spaces\n    # 1.
