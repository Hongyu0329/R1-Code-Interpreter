    "My plan is to determine the part of speech of the word \"Fat\" in the given sentence by analyzing its grammatical function.\n\n1.  I will first examine the sentence: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n2.  I will identify the word in question, which is the first word, \"Fat\".\n3.  I will look at the word immediately following \"Fat\", which is \"people\". \"People\" is a noun.\n4.  The word \"Fat\" is used here to describe a quality or characteristic of the \"people\".\n5.  A word that describes or modifies a noun is an adjective.\n6.  Therefore, \"Fat\" is an adjective in this context.\n7.  I will write a Python script that prints this step-by-step analysis and identifies the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_part_of_speech():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the sentence to determine the part of speech for the first word.\n    \"\"\"\n    sentence = \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n    word_in_question = \"Fat\"\n    following_word = \"people\"\n\n    print(f\"The sentence is: '{sentence}'\")\n    print(f\"The task is to identify the part of speech of the first word: '{word_in_question}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    \n    # The final \"equation\" part as requested.\n    print(f\"1.
