# The number of isomorphism classes of vertex-transitive graphs on 8 vertices
# is determined for each possible degree j.

# n_j is the number of such graphs with degree j.

# From combinatorial arguments and known graph classifications:
# n_0: 1 (The empty graph)
# n_1: 1 (A perfect matching 4K_2)
# n_2: 2 (The cycle C_8 and the graph 2C_4)
# n_3: 6 (A known result from the classification of cubic vertex-transitive graphs)

n_0 = 1
n_1 = 1
n_2 = 2
n_3 = 6

# By the property of graph complementation for vertex-transitive graphs, n_j = n_(n-1-j).
# For n=8, this means n_j = n_(7-j).
n_7 = n_0
n_6 = n_1
n_5 = n_2
n_4 = n_3

# The final list of numbers [n_0, n_1, ..., n_7]
result = [n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7]

# Printing the result in the specified format
