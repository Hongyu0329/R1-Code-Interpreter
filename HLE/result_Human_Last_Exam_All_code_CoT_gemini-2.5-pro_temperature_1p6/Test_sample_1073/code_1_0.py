# Step 1: Calculate K, the figure-eight knot's Jones polynomial at t=-1.
# The Jones polynomial V(t) for the figure-eight knot (4_1) is:
# V(t) = t^-2 - t^-1 + 1 - t + t^2
t = -1

# Let's calculate each term of V(-1):
term1 = t**2         # (-1)^2 = 1
term2 = -t           # -(-1) = 1
term3 = 1            # 1
term4 = -(t**-1)     # -(1/-1) = 1
term5 = t**-2        # 1/(-1)^2 = 1

# Sum the terms to find K
K = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5
