# Define the constants given in the problem
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1

# According to the derivation, the solution X_0(t) is a constant,
# given by the formula X_0(t) = A / (B + 1).
# This is because the integration constant C1 is found to be zero
# from the boundary condition X_0(0) - X_0(T) = 0.

# First, calculate B + 1
B_plus_1 = B + 1

# Now, calculate the value of X_0(t)
# This value is constant for all t, including t = 10^20.
result = A / B_plus_1

# Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
# The calculation shows how the parameters A and B determine the final answer.
print("The final equation for the value of X_0(10^20) is:")
print(f"X_0(10^20) = A / (B + 1) = {A} / (({B}) + 1) = {result}")
