    # The problem involves determining the cardinality of the set of colors required.
    # The available colors are White, Blue, and Orange.

    # Analysis shows that using 1 or 2 colors is not sufficient to create a pattern
    # that can expand infinitely to form a plane due to rule constraints.

    # 1. With only White, you cannot add a second White cube.
    # 2. With White and Blue, the structure quickly gets stuck.
    # 3. With White and Orange, you can only build a vertical pillar, not a plane.

    # A viable construction requires all three colors to overcome the limitations.
    # By using White, Orange, and Blue cubes strategically, we can create a configuration
    # that allows for continued expansion. An example starting sequence is:
    # - Start with White(0,0,0)
    # - Add Orange(0,0,1)
    # - Add Blue(1,0,0)
    # - This configuration enables placing a new White cube at (1,0,1), as it's
    #   adjacent to two different colors (Orange and Blue).

    # Therefore, all three colors are necessary.
    num_white = 1
    num_blue = 1
    num_orange = 1

    # The cardinality is the number of distinct color types required.
    total_color_types = num_white + num_blue + num_orange
