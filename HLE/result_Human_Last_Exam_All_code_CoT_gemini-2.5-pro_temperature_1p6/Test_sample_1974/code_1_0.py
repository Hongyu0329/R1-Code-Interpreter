    print("\n--- Step 1: Establish an Upper Bound for the Cardinality of S ---")
    print("The set S consists of Diophantine equations. A Diophantine equation is a polynomial with a finite number of terms, variables, and integer coefficients.")
    print("The set of all possible such equations can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (i.e., it is 'listable' or 'enumerable').")
    print("Therefore, the set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite.")
    print("Since S is a subset of a countably infinite set, its cardinality must be at most countably infinite.")
    print("In mathematical terms: max(|S|) <= ℵ₀ (Aleph-null).")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound by Constructing a Case ---")
    print("To show that the maximum cardinality is indeed countably infinite, we must show that it's possible to construct a scenario where S is countably infinite.")
    print("This requires a careful choice of the statement ψ.")
    print("We will use two key results from mathematical logic:")
    print("  1. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems: For any sufficiently strong, consistent theory like ZFC, there are statements that are true but unprovable within that theory.")
    print("  2. The MRDP (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam) Theorem: This theorem implies that any statement of the form 'a Turing machine with index e never halts' can be translated into an equivalent statement of the form 'a specific Diophantine equation D_e has no solutions in natural numbers'.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Creating an Infinite Sequence of Independent Equations ---")
    print("Let's define a sequence of increasingly strong theories and a corresponding sequence of Diophantine equations:")
    print("  - Let T₀ = ZFC.")
    print("  - Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem states that Con(ZFC) (the assertion that ZFC is consistent) is unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("  - Using the MRDP theorem, the statement Con(ZFC) can be encoded as 'Diophantine equation D₀ has no solutions'.")
    print("  - Thus, the unsolvability of D₀ is unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("\nNow, we iterate this:")
    print("  - Let T₁ = ZFC + Con(ZFC). This new theory T₁ can prove that D₀ has no solutions.")
    print("  - The consistency of T₁, Con(T₁), is unprovable in T₁. This can be encoded as a new equation D₁ having no solutions.")
    print("  - We can define T_{n+1} = T_n + Con(T_n), generating an infinite sequence of Diophantine equations D₀, D₁, D₂, ...")
    print("  - For each n, the unsolvability of D_n is unprovable in ZFC, because proving it would entail proving Con(ZFC), Con(T₁), ..., up to Con(T_{n-1}).")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Choosing ψ to Prove All These Equations' Unsolvability ---")
    print("The problem requires a single statement ψ such that ZFC + ψ proves the unsolvability of all these equations.")
    print("Let's choose ψ to be a statement that implies the consistency of all the theories T_n for n in ℕ.")
    print("A well-known statement with this property is the 'reflection principle for arithmetic', which can be stated as 'There exists a standard model of Peano Arithmetic' (let's call this Arith-True).")
    print("  - Arith-True is known to be independent of ZFC. The problem setup guarantees that we can have a model M where ¬ψ holds and a generic extension M[G] where ψ holds.")
    print("  - The theory ZFC + Arith-True is powerful enough to prove Con(T_n) for all n ∈ ℕ.")
    print("  - Therefore, ZFC + ψ (with ψ=Arith-True) proves that every equation in the infinite set {D₀, D₁, D₂, ...} has no solution.")
    
    print("\n--- Step 5: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("By choosing ψ = Arith-True, the set S contains the infinite collection of equations {D₀, D₁, D₂, ...}.")
    print("This demonstrates that S can be countably infinite.")
    print("So, the cardinality of S can be at least countably infinite: |S| >= ℵ₀.")
    print("Combining our bounds: |S| <= ℵ₀ and |S| >= ℵ₀.")
    
    # Python doesn't have a standard symbol for Aleph-null, so we represent it as text.
    aleph_null = "ℵ₀"
    
    print("\nTherefore, the maximum possible cardinality of S is countably infinite.")
    print("\nFinal Equation:")
    print(f"max(|S|) = {aleph_null}")
