    # Step 1: Decode Clue 1 to find Y1 and its digits.
    # The clue "byproduct fouling his salt wells" and "illuminated the path for future fortunes"
    # strongly points to the Hall-Héroult process for aluminum production, discovered in 1886.
    # The "Y1-Hall" reference reinforces this connection to Charles Martin Hall.
    Y1 = 1886
    X1, X2, X3, X4 = 1, 8, 8, 6

    # Step 2: Decode Clue 2 to find Y2, Y3, Y4.
    # The clue points to René Descartes ("the Frenchman") and his aphorism "Cogito, ergo sum".
    # Nikita Eliseev's literary joke replaces "Cogito" with "Coito" to fit "frivolous scenes",
    # by removing the letter 'г' (g) from the Cyrillic transliteration.
    # The aphorism was published in "Discourse on the Method" in 1637.
    
    # We hypothesize that the resulting numbers combine digits from Y1 (1886) and the year 1637.
    # Y3 = X3X4X8X6. The first two digits are X3X4 = 86 from Y1. The last two can be 37 from 1637.
    Y3 = 8637
    # From Y3 = X3X4X8X6, we get X8=3 and X6=7.
    X8, X6 = 3, 7
    
    # Now we determine the remaining X digits and Y values.
    # Let's use the remaining digits from 1637 ('1' and '6') for the unknowns in Y2.
    # Y2 = X5X6X2X7X6 -> Y2 = X5 7 8 X7 7
    # Let's set X5=1, X7=6.
    X5, X7 = 1, 6
    Y2 = 17867

    # For Y4 = X9X10X11, let's use the year 1637 in some way.
    # Let's construct a 3-digit number from it, for example, 137.
    Y4 = 137
    X9, X10, X11 = 1, 3, 7

    # Step 3: Identify reactants from Clue 3.
    # The original Heck reaction used an organomercuric halide and an alkene.
    # We'll use simple examples: Phenylmercuric chloride and Ethene.
    
    reactants = {
        "Ethene": ['C1', 'C2'], # Simplified graph: C-C
        "Phenylmercuric Chloride": ['Ph', 'Hg', 'Cl'] # Simplified graph: Ph-Hg-Cl
    }

    # Step 4: Define the "Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state index".
    # We interpret "Hall" as referring to the Wiener index (a foundational topological index).
    # We interpret "Y4 to the Y1" as a scaling factor: (Y4 / Y1).
    # Final Index = Wiener_Index * (Y4 / Y1)
