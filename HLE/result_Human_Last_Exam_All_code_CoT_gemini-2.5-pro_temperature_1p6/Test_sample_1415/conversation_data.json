    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Method and Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral we need to evaluate is `I = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This is a standard integral form. If we let `f(x) = F₃(x)`, then the integrand is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Antiderivative:** The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)|`. So, the antiderivative of our integrand is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we compute the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n    `I = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (Note: `x` is in radians)\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n6.  **Check the Sign of F₃(x):** For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is non-negative. This means `e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 1, and `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive on this interval, so we can drop the absolute value bars.\n\n7.  **Final Expression for the Integral (V):**\n    `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:** We will use Python's `math` library to compute the numerical value of `V`, then multiply by 10000 and round to the nearest integer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the value of F3(0)\n# F3(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nf3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the value of F3(1)\n# F3(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n# math.sin() takes the angle in radians, which is correct here.\nf3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the definite integral, V.\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\nv = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n# As requested, printing each number in the final equation for V\nprint(\"The definite integral V evaluates to ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\")\nprint(f\"The value for F3(1) is: {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value for F3(0) is: {f3_0}\")\nprint(f\"So, the value V = ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0}) is: {v}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 10000 * V and round to the closest integer.\nfinal_answer = round(10000 * v)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe value of 10000 * V is {10000 * v}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {final_answer}\")\n\nprint(f'<<<{final_answer}>>>')\n```"
