    "Answering this question requires knowledge of classical ballet terminology. I will analyze each step to determine if its standard execution results in the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  Define the movement for each of the five ballet steps provided in the answer choices.\n2.  For each step, compare the typical starting leg position (e.g., fifth position with the right foot in front) to the typical ending leg position.\n3.  A step where the feet have swapped (e.g., ending with the left foot in front) or have moved to a different named position (e.g., starting in fifth and ending in fourth) does not qualify.\n4.  The step where the starting and ending positions are identical is the correct answer. I will select the most definitively correct choice if there are multiple possibilities.\n5.  I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this logic, analyzes the choices, and prints the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find the one where the starting\n    and ending leg positions are identical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the characteristics of each ballet step from the choices.\n    # We represent each step with its name and whether it changes the\n    # leg position (True) or not (False) by default.\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Entrechat six', 'changes_position': False,\n              'reason': 'An entrechat with an even number (e.g., quatre, six) is a jump on the spot that, by definition, lands in the same fifth position from which it started.'},\n        'B': {'name': 'Échappé battu changé', 'changes_position': True,\n              'reason': \"The word 'changé' explicitly means 'changed', indicating the feet have swapped their front/back alignment from start to finish.\"},\n        'C': {'name': 'Assemblé', 'changes_position': True,\n              'reason': \"From a starting position, a standard assemblé brings the working foot to the front ('dessus') or back ('dessous'), changing the initial fifth position.\"},\n        'D': {'name': 'Glissade derrière', 'changes_position': False,\n              'reason': \"This gliding step, in its common non-changing form, returns to the original fifth position.
