# The problem is to find the largest p for which no L^p(R^3) function,
# other than the zero function, has a Fourier transform supported on
# the moment curve {(t, t^2, t^3): 0 <= t <= 1}.

# This is a problem of finding the critical exponent for a Fourier uniqueness property.
# A theorem in harmonic analysis provides the answer. For the moment curve
# in R^n, (t, t^2, ..., t^n), the Fourier transform is unique for any L^p function
# if p is greater than a critical value p_c.
# This critical value is given by the formula: p_c = n*(n+1)/(n-1).
# For p > p_c, uniqueness holds. For p <= p_c, it fails.
# The question for the "largest possible value of p" is interpreted as asking for this critical value, p_c.

# In this problem, we are in R^3, so the dimension n is 3.
n = 3

# Calculate the terms in the formula
n_plus_1 = n + 1
n_minus_1 = n - 1
numerator = n * n_plus_1
denominator = n_minus_1

# Calculate the critical exponent p
p_c = numerator / denominator

# Print the step-by-step calculation
print(f"The problem concerns a curve in R^n where n = {n}.")
print("The critical exponent p is given by the formula: p = n * (n + 1) / (n - 1)")
print(f"Substituting n = {n} into the formula:")
print(f"p = {n} * ({n} + 1) / ({n} - 1)")
print(f"p = {n} * {n_plus_1} / {n_minus_1}")
print(f"p = {numerator} / {denominator}")
# The result is an integer value, so we format it as such.
print(f"p = {int(p_c)}")
print(f"\nThe largest possible value of p (the critical exponent) is {int(p_c)}.")
