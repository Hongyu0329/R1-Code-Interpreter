# --- Problem Data ---
# Number of symbols in the Ching, which is the source of the encrypted message.
ching_symbols = 9999

# Number of unique characters in the Shu, which is the alphabet of the secret message.
shu_alphabet_size = 120

# The following data is considered irrelevant for solving the core problem.
# - The total number of characters in the Shu book (~3000)
# - The time to recognize a character (12 ms)
# - The computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns)

# --- Reasoning ---
# The problem asks for the maximum length of a secret message encrypted in the Ching.
# The most straightforward interpretation is that the sequence of 9999 symbols in the Ching
# is the encrypted message itself, where each symbol translates to one character.
# This is a classic substitution cipher model.

# For this to be possible, we only need to be able to map symbols to the characters
# of the message alphabet. Since there are 9999 symbols and only 120 possible characters,
# a mapping is easily achievable.

# In this interpretation, the length of the secret message is determined directly by the
# number of symbols available in the Ching.

max_message_length = ching_symbols

# --- Final Calculation ---
print("Based on the interpretation that each symbol in the Ching represents one character of the message:")
print("The final equation is a direct equivalence:")
print(f"Maximum Message Length = Number of Symbols in the Ching")
# Here we output the numbers in this final relationship.
print(f"Maximum Message Length = {max_message_length}")

<<<9999>>>
