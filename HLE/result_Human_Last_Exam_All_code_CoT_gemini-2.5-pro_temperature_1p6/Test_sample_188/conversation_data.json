  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the problem to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. The core of the problem is about the relationship between an encrypted text (the Ching's symbols) and a decrypted message (written in Shu's characters).\n\n1.  **Primary Interpretation:** I will interpret the problem as a substitution cipher. The most direct reading suggests that the book \"Ching\", with its 9999 symbols, is the ciphertext itself. In this scenario, each symbol in the book corresponds to one character in the final secret message.\n2.  **Identify Key Information:** The most crucial piece of information is the number of symbols in the Ching, which is `9999`. This number directly determines the length of the message.\n3.  **Discard Distractions:** The other numbers provided—such as the 120-character alphabet of the Shu, the computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns), and the approximate character count of the Shu book (~3000)—are likely extraneous details designed to make the problem appear more complex. The size of the Shu alphabet (120) is only relevant to confirm that it's possible to map the symbols to characters, as we have more than enough symbols.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Following this logic, if the 9999 symbols in the Ching make up the encrypted message, then the decrypted message will also have a length of 9999 characters.\n\nI will provide a Python script that formalizes this reasoning, declares the relevant variables, and prints the steps of the simple conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Problem Data ---\n# Number of symbols in the Ching, which is the source of the encrypted message.\nching_symbols = 9999\n\n# Number of unique characters in the Shu, which is the alphabet of the secret message.\nshu_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# The following data is considered irrelevant for solving the core problem.\n# - The total number of characters in the Shu book (~3000)\n# - The time to recognize a character (12 ms)\n# - The computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns)\n\n# --- Reasoning ---\n# The problem asks for the maximum length of a secret message encrypted in the Ching.\n# The most straightforward interpretation is that the sequence of 9999 symbols in the Ching\n# is the encrypted message itself, where each symbol translates to one character.\n# This is a classic substitution cipher model.\n\n# For this to be possible, we only need to be able to map symbols to the characters\n# of the message alphabet. Since there are 9999 symbols and only 120 possible characters,\n# a mapping is easily achievable.\n\n# In this interpretation, the length of the secret message is determined directly by the\n# number of symbols available in the Ching.\n\nmax_message_length = ching_symbols\n\n# --- Final Calculation ---\nprint(\"Based on the interpretation that each symbol in the Ching represents one character of the message:\")\nprint(\"The final equation is a direct equivalence:\")\nprint(f\"Maximum Message Length = Number of Symbols in the Ching\")\n# Here we output the numbers in this final relationship.\nprint(f\"Maximum Message Length = {max_message_length}\")\n\n<<<9999>>>\n```"
