    "I will solve this problem by simulating each Turing Machine and counting the number of steps until it reaches the halt state 'H'.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Rules:** I'll interpret the input string for each machine as a list of state transitions. The format `XYZ` means: if in the current state, go to state `X`, write symbol `Y`, and move the head in direction `Z` (`L` for Left, `R` for Right). The rules are given in pairs for each state from 'A' to 'E', corresponding to reading a '0' or a '1' from the tape.\n2.  **Set up the Simulation:**\n    *   **Tape:** I will use a dictionary in Python to represent the infinite tape, which will store non-zero values. This is efficient for a tape that is mostly empty (all zeros).\n    *   **State:** A variable will hold the current state, starting with 'A'.\n    *   **Head Position:** A variable will track the head's current position on the tape, starting at 0.\n    *   **Step Counter:** A counter will be initialized to 0 and incremented at each step.\n3.  **Run the Simulation:** For each of the three machines, I will:\n    a. Parse the rule string into a structured format for easy lookup.\n    b. Start the simulation from State 'A', at tape position 0, with an all-zero tape.\n    c. Loop through the steps: read the tape symbol, apply the corresponding rule (write new symbol, move head, change state), and increment the step counter.\n    d. The loop will continue until the state becomes 'H'. I'll also include a safety limit on the number of steps to prevent infinite execution in case a machine doesn't halt.\n4.  **Determine the Winner:** After simulating all three machines, I will compare the number of steps each took to halt. The machine with the highest step count is the answer. I will print the step counts for all machines for clarity, and then state the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a rule string and simulates the Turing Machine.\n\n    The rule string format is a space-separated list of transitions.\n    For states A, B, C, D, E, the transitions for reading 0 and 1\n    are listed in order.\n    Example Rule: B1L -> Next State: B, Write: 1, Move: L\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
