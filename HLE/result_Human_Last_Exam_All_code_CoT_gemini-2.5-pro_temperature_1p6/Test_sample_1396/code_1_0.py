    This script calculates the upper bound on the number of queries for a connected
    epsilon-envy-free cake-cutting allocation for four agents, based on the
    protocol described by Brânzei and Nisan (2022).

    The protocol proceeds as follows:
    1. Agents 1, 2, and 3 each make a single cut query to mark the point x_i
       where the value of the cake [0, x_i] is 1/4 of their total valuation.
    2. Agent 4 makes an evaluation query to determine its value for the piece
       defined by the median of these marks.
    3. Agent 4 makes a cut query to receive its piece, ensuring it gets at least
       1/4 of the total value according to its own valuation. This leaves a
       single connected piece of cake for the other three agents.
    4. The remaining 3 agents divide the rest of the cake using a simulated
       moving-knife procedure, which requires 4 queries for the 3-agent case.
