    # Part (a): True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N,
    # then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # Reasoning: A smooth covering preserves valencies, meaning ord(g) = ord(gN) for generators g=b,w.
    # This implies <g> intersect N = {1}.
    # The stabilizer of a vertex v is N_v = N intersect Stab_G(v).
    # Stab_G(v) is a conjugate of <w>, say h<w>h^{-1}.
    # N_v = N intersect h<w>h^{-1} = h(N intersect <w>)h^{-1} = h{1}h^{-1} = {1}.
    # The same logic applies to faces (with generator b).
    # An action where all point stabilizers are trivial is semi-regular. Thus, the statement is True.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering
    # of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    # Reasoning: The definition of a quasi-simple group is explicitly given in the prompt.
    # It includes the condition G = G', which is the definition of a perfect group.
    # Therefore, it is necessary by definition. The statement is True.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin
    # that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. Let D_N be the quotient dessin. Its group is G_N = G/N = <bN, wN>.
    # 2. D_N is unicellular -> It has 1 face -> |G_N : <bN>| = 1 -> G_N = <bN>.
    # 3. D_N is regular -> <wN> intersect <bN> = {1}.
    # 4. From (2) and (3), wN must be the identity of G_N, so w is in N.
    # 5. Smooth covering -> ord(b) = ord(bN) -> <b> intersect N = {1}.
    # 6. G = <b, w>. Since w is in N and N is normal, G = <b>N. With (5), G = N semidirect <b>.
    # 7. G is face-quasiprimitive, acting on faces F = G/<b>. F is in bijection with N.
    # 8. The action of G on F is equivalent to the affine action of G on N.
    # 9. A theorem on quasiprimitive groups states that if the action is affine, the socle (N) must be abelian.
    # 10. The type for a group with an abelian minimal normal subgroup N from the list is (HA) Holomorph Affine.
    answer_c = "[HA]"

    # Print the final combined answer.
    # No equation is present in the problem, so the instruction to output each number is disregarded.
