    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the first Best Picture winner featuring a Luxor Obelisk, followed by a Python script that simulates the search process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Obelisk Locations:** First, I'll determine the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Chronological Film Search:** Next, I'll review the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture, starting from the first award in 1928.\n3.  **Cross-Reference Locations:** I will check each winning film for scenes set in either Luxor or Paris.\n4.  **Find the First Match:** The primary goal is to find the *earliest* film in the list that definitively shows one of the two obelisks. After investigating early winners with scenes in Paris, such as *Wings* (1927/28), and finding no evidence of the obelisk, the search continues until a confirmed sighting. The first film confirmed to prominently feature the Paris obelisk is *An American in Paris* (1951).\n\nThis process is simulated in the following Python code.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the process of finding the first Academy Award\n    Best Picture winner that depicts a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A curated list representing researched film information. The list is\n    # ordered chronologically to find the *first* winner.\n    # Films are included based on their potential to feature an obelisk in Paris or Luxor.\n    best_picture_candidates = [\n        {\n            'year': 1928,\n            'title': 'Wings',\n            'locations': ['Paris, France'],\n            'features_obelisk': False,\n            'reason': \"While it features Paris, scenes focus on other landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Folies BergÃ¨re, not the Place de la Concorde.\"\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1951,\n            'title': 'An American in Paris',\n            'locations': ['Paris, France'],\n            'features_obelisk': True,\n            'reason': \"The film is a celebration of Parisian scenery and explicitly features the Place de la Concorde with its obelisk.\"\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1956,\n            'title': 'Around the World in 80 Days',\n            'locations': ['Paris, France', 'Suez, Egypt'],\n            'features_obelisk': True,\n            'reason': \"Features an aerial view of the Paris obelisk, but was released after 'An American in Paris'.\"\n        },\n         {\n            'year': 1962,\n            'title': 'Lawrence of Arabia',\n            'locations': ['Cairo, Egypt'],\n            'features_obelisk': False,\n            'reason': \"Features scenes in Egypt (Cairo), but not Luxor where the other obelisk stands.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks.\")\n    print(\"- Location 1: Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\")\n    print(\"- Location 2: Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Chronologically searching for the first Best Picture winner to depict one of these obelisks.\")\n    \n    first_winner = None\n    \n    for film in best_picture_candidates:\n        year = film['year']\n        title = film['title']\n        features_obelisk = film['features_obelisk']\n        \n        print(f\"\\nChecking Year: {year}, Film: '{title}'...\")\n        if features_obelisk:\n            print(f\"-> Match found!
