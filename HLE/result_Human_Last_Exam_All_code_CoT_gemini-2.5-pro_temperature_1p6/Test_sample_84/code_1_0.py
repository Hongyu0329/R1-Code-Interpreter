# The exponents of n for the lengths of the transformed intervals
# Length of the imaginary interval is proportional to n^a
a = 1
# Length of the real interval is proportional to n^b

# The degree of the polynomial in the transformed space (2*d_n)
# is proportional to the product of the lengths of the two intervals.
# So, the exponent for the degree is the sum of the exponents of the lengths.
