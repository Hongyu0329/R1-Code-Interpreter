    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Algebra and its Properties:** The problem concerns the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $q$ as a primitive 3rd root of unity (we can set the parameter $l=3$). This algebra is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, and for $l=3$, it is of **finite representation type**. This is a crucial property, as it means there is only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\n2.  **Count the Total Number of Indecomposable Representations:** The category of modules for this algebra, $C$, separates into blocks.\n    *   **The Trivial Block:** This block contains only one indecomposable module, the trivial representation $L(0)$. This module is simple (hence irreducible).\n    *   **The Principal Block:** For $l=3$, this block contains exactly four non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. These are:\n        *   The two simple (irreducible) modules, denoted $L(1)$ and $L(2)$.\n        *   The two projective covers of these simple modules, $P(1)$ and $P(2)$. These are indecomposable but are *not* simple (i.e., they are reducible).\n    *   Summing these up, the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations is $1$ (from the trivial block) + $4$ (from the principal block) = 5.\n\n3.  **Count the Number of Irreducible Representations:** The irreducible representations are, by definition, the simple modules. From the list above, these are:\n    *   $L(0)$\n    *   $L(1)$\n    *   $L(2)$\n    *   This gives a total of 3 irreducible representations.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Percentage:** The percentage of indecomposable representations that are irreducible is the ratio of the number of irreducible ones to the total number of indecomposable ones, multiplied by 100.\n    *   Percentage = (Number of Irreducible Modules / Total Number of Indecomposable Modules) * 100\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** A simple Python script can be written to perform this calculation and display the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_irreducible_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible objects in the category C\n    of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of u_q(sl_2)\n    for q a primitive third root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the representation theory for u_q(sl_2) at a 3rd root of unity (l=3):\n    # The algebra is of finite representation type.\n\n    # 1.
