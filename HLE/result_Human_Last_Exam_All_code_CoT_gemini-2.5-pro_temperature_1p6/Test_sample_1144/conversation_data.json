    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** We will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model of the atom.\n    *   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** This relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). The formula is `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   **Bohr Model:** This model describes the momentum of an electron in a specific orbit. The angular momentum (L) is quantized: `L = n * ħ`, where `n` is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so `L = ħ`. Since `L = p * r` (where `p` is momentum and `r` is the orbital radius), the momentum in the first Bohr orbit is `p = ħ / r₁`, where `r₁` is the radius of the first orbit, also known as the Bohr radius (`a₀`).\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the momentum itself (p), which is `Δp / p`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the formulas and simplify:**\n    *   Ratio = `(ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`\n    *   By canceling out the reduced Planck constant (`ħ`) from the numerator and the denominator, the formula simplifies significantly to:\n    *   Ratio = `a₀ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value:** We will use the known value for the Bohr radius (`a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m`) and the given uncertainty in position (`Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m`). We'll write a Python script to perform this calculation using precise constants.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of momentum to the momentum\n# of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\ndef solve_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum\n    for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants and given values\n    # Bohr radius (a0) in meters.
