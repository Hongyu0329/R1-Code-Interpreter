    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will execute a Python script that performs prime factorization.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The script will define a function to find the prime factors of a given number `n`.\n2.  The factorization process will begin by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 to handle the only even prime.\n3.  Next, it will iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining number. For each `i` that divides the number, it will be added to a list of factors, and the number will be divided by `i`.\n4.  If, after the loop, the number is still greater than 1, the remaining number itself is a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n5.  After collecting all prime factors, the script will check if the number is prime (i.e., has only one factor: itself).\n6.  Finally, it will print the complete prime factorization as an equation and then explicitly state the largest prime divisor found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of a number n, prints the factorization,\n    and then prints the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # First, handle the factor of 2, if any\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Next, handle odd factors. We only need to check up to the square root of the remaining n\n    i = 3\n    while i <= int(math.sqrt(n)):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # This condition handles the case where the remaining n after divisions is a prime number > 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Now, print the results in the required format\n    if not factors or len(factors) == 0:\n        print(f\"Could not find prime factors for {original_n}\")\n    elif len(factors) == 1:\n        # The number is prime\n        print(f\"{original_n} is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself.\")\n        largest_prime = original_n\n    else:\n        # The number is composite, print its factorization equation\n        equation = f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(equation)\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n\n# The number to be factored\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
