    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The main condition is that `m` white queens and `m` black queens must coexist on the board without any queen attacking another. This means we are placing a total of `2m` queens on the board, and no two queens can be on the same row, column, or diagonal, regardless of their color.\n2.  **Relate to a Known Problem**: This problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place on a 16x16 board. Let's call this maximum number `K`.\n3.  **Use a Mathematical Theorem**: There is a well-known result in combinatorics for the N-Queens problem. For any `N x N` chessboard where `N` is 1 or `N >= 4`, the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed is `N`.\n4.  **Apply to the Specific Case**: Our board is 16x16, so `N = 16`. Since `16 >= 4`, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens (`K`) is 16.\n5.  **Formulate and Solve the Equation**: The total number of queens is `2m`. To find the maximum possible value for `m`, we set `2m` equal to the maximum total number of queens, `K`. This gives us the equation `2m = 16`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Solving the equation `2m = 16` for `m` gives us `m = 8`.\n7.  **Write the Code**: I will create a Python script that implements this logic, performs the final calculation, and prints out the equation with all the numbers as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the answer:\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black\n    queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The size of the chessboard.\n    N = 16\n\n    # For an N x N board where N >= 4, the maximum number of non-attacking\n    # queens, K, that can be placed is equal to N.\n    max_total_queens = N\n\n    # The total number of queens on the board is m white queens + m black queens,\n    # which is 2 * m.
