    "This is a classic but complex geometry problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the minimum radius `R` of a large circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius `r=1`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  The problem of finding the densest packing of N circles is notoriously difficult. For N=14, the optimal arrangement was proven by F. Fodor in 2003.\n2.  This specific geometric arrangement leads to a situation where the radius `R` is not expressible with simple functions. However, `R` is a root of a known polynomial equation derived from the geometric constraints of the optimal packing.\n3.  The polynomial for the radius `R` of the large circle (when the small circles have radius `r=1`) is:\n    `R^12 - 24 R^10 + 204 R^8 - 784 R^6 + 1444 R^4 - 1104 R^2 + 256 = 0`\n4.  To solve this, I'll make a substitution `x = R^2`, which simplifies the equation to a 6th-degree polynomial:\n    `x^6 - 24x^5 + 204x^4 - 784x^3 + 1444x^2 - 1104x + 256 = 0`\n5.  I will use a Python script with the `numpy` library to find the roots of this polynomial for `x`.\n6.  Then, I'll calculate the possible values for `R` by taking the square root of the valid roots (`R = sqrt(x)`). The largest real root corresponds to the solution for this packing problem.\n7.  Finally, the script will print the result rounded to 4 significant digits.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle tightly packing fourteen circles of radius one.\n    The radius R is determined by finding the roots of a polynomial derived from the\n    geometry of the optimal packing configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The polynomial is for x = R^2, where R is the radius of the large circle.\n    # The coefficients of x^6 - 24x^5 + 204x^4 - 784x^3 + 1444x^2 - 1104x + 256 = 0\n    coeffs = [1, -24, 204, -784, 1444, -1104, 256]\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the radius R of a circle that can pack 14 unit circles.\")\n    print(\"The radius R is a root of a known polynomial equation.\")\n    print(\"Let x = R^2.
