    "Here is my plan to solve this question:\n1.  First, I will establish the known dietary habits and geographical distribution of the insect order Raphidioptera (snakeflies) from established entomological knowledge.\n2.  Next, I will analyze each answer choice individually.\n3.  For choices involving specific plants or insects (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara), I will check if their native regions overlap with the distribution of snakeflies. This is a crucial step, as a recorded feeding event requires the predator and prey to exist in the same location.\n4.  I will use a Python script to represent these facts and logical steps. The script will evaluate each option based on the established facts.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the step-by-step evaluation and determine the most accurate answer based on the evidence.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish known facts about adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies).\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the diet and distribution of adult Raphidioptera.\")\n    \n    # These are simplified facts based on general entomological knowledge.\n    facts = {\n        \"feeds_on_nectar\": True,\n        \"feeds_on_aphids\": True,\n        \"feeds_on_pollen\": True,\n        \"feeds_on_fungus\": False,\n        \"feeds_on_leaf_tissue\": False,\n        \"native_to_new_zealand\": False,\n        \"native_to_northern_hemisphere\": True\n    }\n    \n    # These are facts about the specific items in the answer choices.\n    item_facts = {\n        \"Māhoe\": \"A New Zealand plant\",\n        \"Karamū\": \"A New Zealand plant\",\n        \"Totara\": \"A New Zealand tree\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Fact 1: Adult Raphidiopterans are predatory, feeding on small, soft-bodied insects like aphids.\")\n    print(\"Fact 2: Adult Raphidiopterans are also known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\")\n    print(\"Fact 3: Raphidiopterans are primarily found in the Northern Hemisphere and are not native to New Zealand.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 2: Evaluate each choice based on the facts.\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the answer choices.\")\n    \n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    valid_A = facts[\"feeds_on_nectar\"]\n    print(f\"Analyzing A (Nectar): Snakeflies are recorded feeding on nectar.
