    "Of course, I can help with that. This question requires applying a significant result from the field of harmonic analysis, specifically from the work on decoupling inequalities by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth.\n\nHere is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  First, I will state the relevant mathematical theorem. The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a curve is determined by its dimension and whether it is \"non-degenerate\". The formula for this exponent is $p = d(d+1)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space.\n2.  Next, I need to verify that the given curve, $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$, is indeed non-degenerate in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A curve is non-degenerate if its first $d$ derivatives are linearly independent.\n3.  To perform this check, I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library. The script will:\n    a. Define the curve mathematically.\n    b. Compute its first three derivatives ($d=3$).\n    c. Construct a matrix from these derivative vectors.\n    d. Calculate the determinant of this matrix. If the determinant is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\n4.  Once the non-degeneracy is confirmed, the script will apply the formula $p = d(d+1)$ with $d=3$ to calculate the exponent.\n5.  Finally, the script will print out all the steps of the reasoning, including the derivatives, the determinant, and the final calculation, showing each number in the equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_decoupling_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for the curve\n    (cos t, sin t, t) in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the curve and the dimension of the space.\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n    gamma = sympy.Matrix([sympy.cos(t), sympy.sin(t), t])\n    d = len(gamma)\n\n    print(f\"The given curve is gamma(t) in R^d, where d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent is given by a theorem for non-degenerate curves.\")\n    print(\"First, we must verify that the curve is non-degenerate.\")\n    print(\"A curve in R^d is non-degenerate if its first d derivatives are linearly independent.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the first d derivatives of the curve.\n    derivatives = [gamma]\n    for i in range(d):\n        derivatives.append(sympy.diff(derivatives[-1], t))\n\n    # The vectors for the determinant are gamma', gamma'', gamma'''\n    vectors_for_det = derivatives[1:]\n\n    print(f\"The first d={d} derivatives are:\")\n    print(f\"gamma'(t)   = {vectors_for_det[0].T}\")\n    print(f\"gamma''(t)  = {vectors_for_det[1].T}\")\n    print(f\"gamma'''(t) = {vectors_for_det[2].T}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check for linear independence by computing the determinant.\n    M = sympy.Matrix.hstack(*vectors_for_det)\n    print(\"To check for linear independence, we compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\")\n\n    det_M = M.det()\n    det_M_simplified = sympy.simplify(det_M)\n    print(f\"The determinant is det(M) = {det_M_simplified}.\")\n\n    if det_M_simplified == 0:\n        print(\"The determinant is 0, so the curve is degenerate.
