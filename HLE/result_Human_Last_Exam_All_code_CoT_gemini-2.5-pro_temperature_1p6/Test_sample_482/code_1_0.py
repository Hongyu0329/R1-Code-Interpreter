# --- Parameters ---
# Number of neurons in each input layer (v and s).
# This is a typical value used in network models.
number_of_neurons_per_layer = 100

# Firing rate of the input neurons, derived from the inter-event interval of 150s.
# mu = 1 / 150 events per second.
mu = 1.0 / 150.0

# The problem states the inputs are rate-based. The variance of a rate estimated
# from a Poisson process depends on the time window used for estimation.
# We assume a plausible time window of 1 second.
# For a Poisson process, variance of the rate is mean_rate / time_window.
rate_estimation_window_s = 1.0
variance_of_input = mu / rate_estimation_window_s

# --- Calculation ---
# The critical amount of correlation is expressed as the covariance between
# the firing rates of a neuron in layer 's' and a neuron in layer 'v'.
# The theoretical derivation shows that for selectivity to emerge, the following
# condition must be met:
# Critical Covariance = Variance / Number of Neurons
critical_covariance = variance_of_input / number_of_neurons_per_layer

# --- Output ---
# Print the final equation with all the numerical values.
print("The 'critical amount of correlation' is the covariance (C_sv) required to balance potentiation and depression for selectivity.")
print("The relationship is given by the formula: C_sv = variance / N")
