    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic result in Fourier analysis. The statement is indeed true. The properties of Schwartz class functions are essential to the proof.\n\nHere is my plan to demonstrate the result:\n1.  I will outline a mathematical proof that shows why the statement is true. The proof relies heavily on the properties of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions.\n2.  The core idea is to translate the condition on the moments of the function $f(x)$ into a condition on its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n3.  We will see that the condition implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n4.  For a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform is analytic. An analytic function whose derivatives are all zero at a single point must be the zero function. Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero.\n5.  Finally, by the Fourier inversion theorem, if the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero.\n\nTo meet the requirements of the prompt, I will provide a Python script that explains this proof step-by-step. The script does not compute a numerical answer but uses code to present the logical argument that solves the problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the proof for the following problem:\n\n    Suppose f is a Schwartz class function from R to R such that the integral\n    of x^k * f(x) over R is 0 for all non-negative integers k.\n    Does it follow that f(x) = 0 for all x?\n\n    The answer is Yes.
