    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I will identify the core question, which is a historical/trivia question about an architectural feature in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\".\nSecond, I will research the history of the square to find out what significant feature was removed around the year 1950. Historical records and photographs show that tram lines ran directly through the piazza, right in front of the Pantheon. These were removed in the post-WWII period as the city's transportation system was updated.\nThird, as per the instructions, I will present this answer using a Python script. The script will simply store the answer in a variable and then print it out in a descriptive sentence. The instruction regarding equations does not apply to this type of knowledge-based question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical trivia question\n    about the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The feature in question is the tramway that passed through the square.\n    feature = \"The tram lines\"\n    year_removed = 1950\n    piazza_name = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n\n    # The tram tracks were a prominent feature of the square for decades\n    # before being removed during the post-war modernization of the city's\n    # transportation network.\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature in the '{piazza_name}' that was removed around the year {year_removed} was: {feature}.\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The tram lines>>>"
