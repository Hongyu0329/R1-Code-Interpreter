    "Of course, I can help you with this. The problem requires a multi-step analysis involving the properties of the recursive function, modular arithmetic, and number theory. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a,b,c)`**: The recurrence relation `f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)` with the base case `f(0,0,0)=1` suggests a connection to counting paths or combinations. We can find a closed-form expression for `f(a,b,c)` using generating functions. The result is that `f(a,b,c)` is a multinomial coefficient `(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)` if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3, and `0` otherwise.\n\n2.  **Analyze the arguments `α_p, β_p, γ_p`**: These are large numbers defined as sums. We will work modulo `p`. First, we need to check if `β_p` is even and `γ_p` is a multiple of 3, which they are. Let `A=α_p`, `B=β_p`, `C=γ_p`. We need to compute `f(A, B, C) mod p`. For this, we use Lucas's Theorem, which requires the base-`p` expansions of the arguments to the multinomial coefficient, which are `a=A`, `b=B/2`, and `c=C/3`.\n\n3.  **Base-`p` Expansion**: By expanding the expressions for `A`, `B/2`, and `C/3`, we can find their base-`p` representations. We find that `c = a` and the \"digits\" `a_k`, `b_k`, `c_k` follow a repeating pattern.\n    *   For `a_k=c_k`: The pattern is `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`\n    *   For `b_k`: The pattern is `(4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, ...)`\n\n4.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem**: Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states that `C(n; k_1, ... k_m) ≡ ∏ C(n_i; k_{1,i}, ..., k_{m,i}) (mod p)`, where `n_i` and `k_{j,i}` are the digits in base `p`. This means we need to compute the product of multinomial coefficients for each digit `k`. There are three cases for `k` (`3i`, `3i+1`, `3i+2`):\n    *   `C(1+4+1; 1, 4, 1) = C(6; 1,4,1) = 30`\n    *   `C(3+2+3; 3, 2, 3) = C(8; 3,2,3) = 560`\n    *   `C(4+2+4; 4, 2, 4) = C(10; 4,2,4) = 3150`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Product**: We determine how many times each of these values appears in the product. It turns out each appears `T = (3p+1)/2` times. The problem then becomes computing `(30 * 560 * 3150)^T mod p`.\n\n6.  **Simplify and Compute**: Let `X = 30 * 560 * 3150`. We need to compute `X^T mod p`. Using Fermat's Little Theorem and properties of the Legendre symbol, the expression `X^T = X^{(3p+1)/2} = X^{3(p-1)/2 + 2}` simplifies to `-X^2 (mod p)`. The final step is to compute this value.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_f_mod_p():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by calculating the final expression derived from the analysis.\n    The value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p simplifies to -(X^2) mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # p is the Mersenne prime 2^127 - 1\n    p = 2**127 - 1\n    \n    # The value X is the product of three multinomial coefficients derived\n    # from the base-p expansions of the arguments of the function f.\n    # C1 = C(6; 1, 4, 1)\n    # C2 = C(8; 3, 2, 3)\n    # C3 = C(10; 4, 2, 4)\n    C1 = 30\n    C2 = 560\n    C3 = 3150\n    \n    X = C1 * C2 * C3\n    \n    print(\"This problem is solved by calculating f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\")\n    print(\"The calculation simplifies to the expression: -(X^2) mod p\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in this final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"p = 2^127 - 1 = {p}\")\n    print(f\"C1 = 6! / (1! * 4! * 1!) = {C1}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = 8! / (3! * 2! * 3!) = {C2}\")\n    print(f\"C3 = 10! / (4! * 2! * 4!) = {C3}\")\n    print(f\"X = C1 * C2 * C3 = {X}\")\n    \n    # We need to compute -(X^2) mod p.\n    # pow(X, 2, p) computes (X^2) % p efficiently and correctly for large numbers.\n    x_squared_mod_p = pow(X, 2, p)\n    \n    # To handle the negative result, we compute p - (X^2 mod p).\n    # Since X^2 < p, this is simply p - X^2.\n    result = p - x_squared_mod_p\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe value of -(X^2) mod p is: {result}\")\n    \n    # Print the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\nFinal answer: {result}\")\n\n\nsolve_f_mod_p()\n```\n<<<170141183460469231703681997315884105727>>>"
