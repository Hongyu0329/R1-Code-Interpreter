    "To find the radical for the character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The character 謄 is composed of two parts, a left side and a right side.\n2.  **Identify the Radical:** The left part, 訁, is the radical. This is a common form (called a *hen* or *ben*) of the character 言, which means \"words\" or \"speech\". This radical often appears in characters related to language, speaking, or recording, which aligns with the meaning of 謄 (\"to copy, to transcribe\").\n3.  **Find the Japanese Name:** The Japanese name for the 訁 radical is ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Romanize the Name:** Using Hepburn romanization, ごんべん is written as \"Gonben\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the Hepburn-romanized name of the radical for the kanji '謄'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in question is 謄.\n    # The radical is the '言' component on the left, known as 訁.\n    # Its Japanese name is ごんべん.\n    # The Hepburn romanization is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
