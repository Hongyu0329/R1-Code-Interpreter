    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this sequence puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence:** The provided sequence is `ZXXCVYBN`.\n2.  **Identify the Primary Pattern:** I'll look for the most obvious pattern. The letters `Z, X, C, V, B, N` appear in the same order as the keys on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The full row is `Z, X, C, V, B, N, M`.\n3.  **Account for Other Letters:** The sequence contains an extra 'X' and a 'Y'. These appear to be inserted into the primary pattern.\n4.  **Determine the Next Letter:** The sequence ends with 'N', which is part of the primary QWERTY pattern. The most logical next step is to continue this primary pattern.\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the QWERTY bottom row pattern, identifies that the sequence ends with 'N', and then determines and prints the next letter in the pattern. To satisfy the prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will print out each letter of the resulting core sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by identifying the underlying pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary pattern is the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n    qwerty_pattern = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n    \n    # The given sequence from the user.\n    user_sequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n    \n    # The last letter of the given sequence is 'N'.\n    last_letter = user_sequence[-1]\n    \n    try:\n        # Find the position of 'N' in the keyboard pattern.\n        last_letter_index = qwerty_pattern.index(last_letter)\n        \n        # The next letter is the one that follows 'N' in the pattern.\n        if last_letter_index + 1 < len(qwerty_pattern):\n            next_letter = qwerty_pattern[last_letter_index + 1]\n            \n            # Extract the core pattern from the user's sequence for the final output.\n            core_pattern = []\n            for letter in qwerty_pattern:\n                if letter in user_sequence:\n                    core_pattern.append(letter)\n            \n            print(\"The underlying pattern is the QWERTY keyboard's bottom row.\")\n            print(\"The core sequence is:\")\n            # Print each letter of the core sequence, emulating an equation as requested.\n            equation_str = \" -> \".join(core_pattern)\n            print(f\"{equation_str} -> {next_letter}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The pattern is complete.\")\n            \n    except ValueError:\n        print(f\"Could not determine the next step based on the letter '{last_letter}'.\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<M>>>"
