    "This problem requires mapping colors from Newton's color circle to their corresponding musical notes. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** The question asks about a range between two colors.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of light and the spectrum, the color between yellow and blue is **Green**.\n    *   The second color is **Blue**.\n2.  **Recall Newton's Mapping:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum (ROYGBIV) with the seven notes of a musical diatonic scale. The mapping is as follows:\n    *   Red -> C (Do)\n    *   Orange -> D (Re)\n    *   Yellow -> E (Mi)\n    *   **Green -> F (Fa)**\n    *   **Blue -> G (So)**\n    *   Indigo -> A (La)\n    *   Violet -> B (Si)\n3.  **Determine the Note:** The question asks for the note that corresponds to the range *between* green and blue. This range starts with the color Green. Therefore, we need to find the musical note associated with Green.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines this mapping, identifies the correct color based on the puzzle's description, and prints the logical steps and the final color-to-note equation.\n\n```python\ndef newton_color_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle of finding the musical note corresponding to the\n    color between yellow and blue on Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes\n    color_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the primary color from the question\n    # The color produced by combining (or situated between) yellow and blue is Green.\n    start_color = \"Green\"\n    end_color = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding musical note for the starting color of the range\n    musical_note = color_note_map[start_color]\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer equation\n    print(\"This puzzle uses Isaac Newton's mapping of the color spectrum to a musical scale.\")\n    print(f\"The color located between yellow and blue in the spectrum is '{start_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"The specified range is from '{start_color}' to '{end_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"The musical note corresponding to the start of this range ('{start_color}') is sought.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{start_color} = {musical_note}\")\n\nnewton_color_music_puzzle()\n<<<F>>>\n```"
