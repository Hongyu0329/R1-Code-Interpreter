    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Flag's Geometry**: The flag of Tonga consists of three main regions:\n    *   A large red field.\n    *   A white rectangular area (the canton) in the top-left corner.\n    *   A red cross situated inside the white canton.\n\n2.  **Assign Matrix Values**: As per the problem, every red pixel gets a value `$a$` and every white pixel gets a value `$b$`. This means the red cross and the main red field share the same value `$a$`. The white area in the canton has the value `$b$`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rows of the Matrix**: The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. Let's classify the different types of rows we can find in the matrix representation of the flag.\n    *   **Type 1 (All-Red Row)**: Any row of the matrix that does not pass through the white part of the canton will consist entirely of red pixels. This includes all rows in the bottom part of the flag, below the canton. Additionally, any row that passes *through the horizontal bar* of the red cross will also be all-red, since it is on a red pixel within the canton and red pixels outside the canton. All these rows are identical, represented by a vector `V_red = [a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Mixed-Value Row)**: Any row that passes through the canton but *not* through the horizontal bar of the cross will cut through the white field (value `$b$`) and the vertical bar of the cross (value `$a$`). Outside the canton, the pixels are red (value `$a$`). Since the vertical bar of the cross is in a fixed position, all rows of this type will have the exact same pattern of `$a$`'s and `$b$`'s. Let's call this vector `V_mix`. For example, it would look like `[b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a]`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Rank**: The entire matrix is composed of rows that are either of type `V_red` or `V_mix`. The set of all rows in the matrix is a collection of these two distinct vectors. The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors.\n    *   The two vectors are `V_red = [a, a, ..., a]` and `V_mix`.\n    *   To maximize the rank, we should choose `$a$` and `$b$` to make these vectors linearly independent. If we choose `$a \\neq b$` (for instance, `$a=1, b=2$`), `V_red` and `V_mix` are not scalar multiples of each other and are therefore linearly independent.\n    *   Since the entire set of rows in the matrix is generated by these two linearly independent vectors, the dimension of the row space is 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2. This maximum is achieved as long as `$a \\neq b$`. If `$a=b$`, all pixels have the same value, and the rank would be 1.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by constructing a sample matrix for the Tongan flag and calculating its rank.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_tonga_flag_matrix(height, width, a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a matrix representation of the flag of Tonga.\n    \n    The flag is `height` x `width`.\n    Red pixels have value `a`, white pixels have value `b`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the entire flag as red (value 'a')\n    flag = np.full((height, width), a, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Define the canton (white rectangle)\n    # Let's say canton is 1/2 height and 1/3 width\n    canton_h = height // 2\n    canton_w = width // 3\n    flag[0:canton_h, 0:canton_w] = b\n    \n    # Define the red cross within the canton\n    # Make the cross proportional to the canton size\n    cross_h_start = canton_h // 4\n    cross_h_end = cross_h_start * 3\n    cross_w_start = canton_w // 4\n    cross_w_end = cross_w_start * 2 # a bit thinner vertically\n\n    # Horizontal bar of the cross\n    flag[cross_h_start:cross_h_end, 0:canton_w] = a\n    # Vertical bar of the cross\n    flag[0:canton_h, cross_w_start:cross_w_end] = a\n    \n    return flag\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the maximal rank of the Tonga flag matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # To find the maximal rank, we choose a and b to be distinct non-zero numbers.\n    a = 1.0\n    b = 2.0\n    \n    # Define flag dimensions (must be large enough to have all features)\n    height = 60\n    width = 90\n    \n    # Create the matrix\n    tonga_matrix = create_tonga_flag_matrix(height, width, a, b)\n    \n    # Calculate the rank\n    rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(tonga_matrix)\n    \n    print(f\"Assigning red pixels the value a={a} and white pixels the value b={b}.\")\n    print(\"The structure of the flag of Tonga results in a matrix with two types of unique rows.\")\n    print(\"1.
