# Step 1: Define physical constants and inputs with approximations
# for the Bagua architecture.
# These values are chosen to have small integer components suitable for the 'frac' type's 'n' field.
a = 1e11  # Pandora's orbital radius in meters
T = 7e7   # Pandora's orbital period in seconds (approx)
c = 3e8   # Speed of light in m/s (approx)
pi_squared = 10  # Approximation for pi^2
d_probe = 13000 # Pioneer's distance from event horizon in meters

# Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) for the black hole Pegasi.
# Rs = (8 * pi^2 * a^3) / (T^2 * c^2)
Rs_numerator = 8 * pi_squared * (a**3)
Rs_denominator = (T**2) * (c**2)
Rs = Rs_numerator / Rs_denominator

# Step 3: Calculate the gravitational time dilation factor (f)
# using the binomial approximation: f ≈ 1 + Rs / (2*d).
time_dilation_factor = 1 + Rs / (2 * d_probe)

# Step 4: Determine the memory usage (z) for the most memory-efficient C program.
# The program would use one 'int' for distance `d` and one 'frac' for the calculation.
# Bagua int size = 8 trits
# Bagua frac size = 8 trits
memory_usage_trits = 8 + 8

# Step 5: Print the equations with their numbers and the final answer.
