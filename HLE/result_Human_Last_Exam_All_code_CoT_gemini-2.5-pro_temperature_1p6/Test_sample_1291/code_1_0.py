    # Step 1: Recall the classification of points on the Berkovich projective line over C_p.
    # A point on the Berkovich line P^{1, Berk}_(C_p) corresponds to a semi-norm
    # on the polynomial ring C_p[T]. They are classified based on their geometric
    # representation as disks or limits of disks.
    #
    # - Type 1: Classical points. These correspond to points in the classical projective line P^1(C_p).
    #           Geometrically, they can be seen as disks D(a, r) with radius r = 0.
    #
    # - Type 2: Disk points. These correspond to non-degenerate closed disks D(a, r) defined by
    #           {x in C_p : |x-a|_p <= r}, where 'a' is in C_p and the radius 'r' is a positive real number (r > 0).
    #
    # - Type 3: Limit points. These correspond to nested sequences of disks whose intersection is empty.
    #           These points are not represented by a single disk. This is a feature of C_p not being spherically complete.

    # Step 2: Analyze the given equivalence relation.
    # The space is C_p^x * C_p, consisting of pairs (z_0, z).
    # The equivalence relation is (z_0, z) ~ (w_0, w) iff sup(|z_0 - w_0|_p, |z - w|_p)^2 / |z_0 * w_0|_p <= 1.

    # Step 3: Establish a map from equivalence classes to geometric objects (disks).
    # It's a known result in Berkovich geometry that an equivalence class [(z_0, z)] under this relation
    # can be mapped to a unique point on the Berkovich line. This point is the one associated with the
    # closed disk D(a, r) where:
    #   Center a = z / z_0
    #   Radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p
    #
    # To be a well-defined map, points in the same class must map to the same disk. This has been proven in the literature.
    # For instance, a key part of the proof is that if (z_0, z) ~ (w_0, w), then their radii must be equal, i.e., |z_0|_p = |w_0|_p.
    # Let's quickly verify this:
    # Assume |z_0|_p > |w_0|_p. Then |z_0 - w_0|_p = |z_0|_p. The equivalence condition is sup(|z_0|_p, |z-w|_p)^2 <= |z_0|_p * |w_0|_p.
    # This implies |z_0|_p^2 <= |z_0|_p * |w_0|_p, which simplifies to |z_0|_p <= |w_0|_p. This contradicts our assumption.
    # So, we must have |z_0|_p = |w_0|_p, and the radius r is indeed constant across an equivalence class.

    # Step 4: Determine the properties of the resulting disks.
    # The map is [(z_0, z)] -> D(z/z_0, 1/|z_0|_p).
    # The point (z_0, z) is taken from C_p^x * C_p.
    # The first component, z_0, is in C_p^x, which means z_0 is a non-zero element of C_p.
    # Therefore, its p-adic norm |z_0|_p must be strictly positive: |z_0|_p > 0.
    # The radius of the associated disk is r = 1 / |z_0|_p.
    # Since |z_0|_p > 0, the radius r must also be strictly positive (r > 0).
    # The center a = z / z_0 can be any element in C_p, as z is from C_p and z_0 from C_p^x.

    # Step 5: Match the properties of the disks to the Berkovich point types.
    # Our construction produces disks D(a, r) with any center 'a' in C_p and any radius 'r' > 0.
    #
    # - Does this include Type 1 points? No, because Type 1 points correspond to r = 0. Our construction requires r > 0.
    # - Does this include Type 2 points? Yes, because Type 2 points correspond to r > 0. Our construction covers all such points.
    # - Does this include Type 3 points? No, because Type 3 points are not represented by a single disk, but by a limit process.
    #
    # Conclusion: The subset of the Berkovich projective line described in the problem is precisely the set of all Type 2 points.
