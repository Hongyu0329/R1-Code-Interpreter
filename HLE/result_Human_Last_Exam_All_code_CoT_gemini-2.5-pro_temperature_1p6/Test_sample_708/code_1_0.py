    # The passage from the word-by-word reading study.
    passage = "Experience will be a decisive factor in this battle. The ships will outmaneuver the enemy fleet because the old man the boats."

    # Explanation of the reasoning:
    # The ambiguity is in the clause "the old man the boats."
    # A reader's initial parse is likely "[NP the old man]". This leads to a garden path.
    # The correct parse is "[NP the old] [V man] [NP the boats]".
    # The metonym "The ships" (meaning the crew) primes the reader for this correct parse.
    # However, even when successful, this parse is cognitively demanding.
    # The word "man" is the critical point. The reader must suppress the common noun
    # meaning of "man" and activate its much less frequent verb meaning.
    # This act of selecting the difficult but correct interpretation, even when primed,
    # is where the cognitive load and thus reading time would be elevated.

    # Identify the word based on the linguistic analysis.
    critical_word = "man"

    # The prompt asks for the answer as a single word in lowercase letters.
    print(critical_word)
