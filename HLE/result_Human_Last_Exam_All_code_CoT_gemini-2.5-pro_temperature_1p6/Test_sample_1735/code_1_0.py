def solve_dynamic_sequence(a):
    """
    Finds a near-optimal permutation of a sequence 'a' to minimize the
    maximum absolute cumulative sum.

    This function implements a greedy algorithm. At each step, it chooses
    the available number that minimizes the absolute value of the new
    cumulative sum.

    Note: This greedy strategy is a heuristic and does not guarantee the
    globally optimal solution for all possible inputs. However, it is
    a strong baseline and provides good solutions for many cases.
    
    Args:
        a (list of int or float): The input sequence of numbers.

    Returns:
        None. Prints the results directly.
