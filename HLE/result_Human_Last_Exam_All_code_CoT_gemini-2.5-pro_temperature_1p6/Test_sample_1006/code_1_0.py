# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with specific properties. This is a conceptual problem in topology, and the
# solution relies on identifying the space X from its properties.

# Let's analyze the properties of X:
# 1. X is a compact topological space containing a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, \omega_1).
#    This means X is a compactification of R.
# 2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
#    This is the universal mapping property that defines the Stone-Čech compactification.

# The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space Y, denoted as βY, is the unique
# compactification (up to homeomorphism) that satisfies this function extension property.
# The long ray R is a linearly ordered space, which is a Tychonoff space. Therefore,
# it has a unique Stone-Čech compactification, βR.

# The properties given for X are precisely the defining properties of βR.
# This implies that any such space X must be homeomorphic to βR.
# Since all spaces satisfying the conditions are homeomorphic to βR, they are all
# homeomorphic to each other.

# Therefore, they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.

# The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
# We can represent this solution as the result of a simple equation.
number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1
