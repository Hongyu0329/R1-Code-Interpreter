def solve_eigenvalue_problem():
    """
    Determines the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The stability operator is given by:
    L = (1/(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|)) * d/d(rho) * (<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|^(-1) * d/d(rho))
        + (1/<rho>^2) * Delta_S + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n)

    Here, <rho> = sqrt(rho^2 + 1).

    The solution proceeds as follows:
    1.  The problem is approached using separation of variables, which decomposes L
        into a family of radial Sturm-Liouville operators L_k.
    2.  The essential spectrum of each L_k is determined by the asymptotic
        behavior of its potential term as rho approaches infinity.
        The potential term is V_k(rho) = -k(k+n-2)/<rho>^2 + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n).
        As rho -> infinity, V_k(rho) -> 0.
    3.  Standard results from spectral theory for Sturm-Liouville operators state
        that the essential spectrum starts at the limit of the potential at
        infinity. Thus, the essential spectrum is [0, infinity).
    4.  An eigenvalue of L must correspond to an L^2 eigenfunction.
        -   Any discrete eigenvalues must lie outside the essential spectrum, so they must be negative.
        -   Eigenvalues embedded within the continuous spectrum are possible in general,
            but for the class of monotonically decaying potentials present in this problem,
            it is a well-known result that no such positive eigenvalues exist.
    5.  Therefore, there are no positive L^2 eigenvalues for the operator L.
