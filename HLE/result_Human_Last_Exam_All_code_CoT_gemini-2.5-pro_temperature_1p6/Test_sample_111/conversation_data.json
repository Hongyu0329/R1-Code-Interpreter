    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  I will then find Geoffrey Chaucer's known location and occupation during that specific year based on historical records.\n3.  The Python script will store these facts in variables.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a step-by-step logical conclusion based on these facts to answer the question. The code will explicitly print the key year involved, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died\n    by using established historical facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Historical facts stored as variables\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    person_who_died = \"Blanche of Lancaster\"\n    person_in_question = \"Geoffrey Chaucer\"\n    \n    # Chaucer's known location and status around the time of death\n    chaucers_location = \"England\"\n    chaucers_role = \"an esquire in the royal household of King Edward III\"\n    commemorative_work = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n    \n    # Print the logical deduction step-by-step\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the year of death for {person_who_died}.\")\n    # The 'final equation' will be represented by showing the key number.\n    print(f\"The year of death is = {year_of_death}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Determine the location of {person_in_question} in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(f\"Historical records show that in {year_of_death}, Chaucer was serving as {chaucers_role}.\")\n    print(f\"This service placed him firmly in {chaucers_location}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Corroborate with related works.\")\n    print(f\"Chaucer's first major work, '{commemorative_work}', was an elegy written for Blanche of Lancaster, strongly tying him to the English court at the time of her death.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"Based on the evidence, {person_in_question} was in {chaucers_location} when {person_who_died} died in {year_of_death}.\")\n\nsolve_historical_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
