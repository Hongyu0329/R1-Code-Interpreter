    "The user wants me to find the next number in a sequence and explain the logic using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Identify the primary pattern:** I will examine the relationship between consecutive numbers. I hypothesize a relationship of the form `next_term = 2 * current_term + C`, where `C` is a changing value.\n3.  **Find the pattern for `C`:**\n    *   Calculate `C` for each step in the sequence (starting from the third term, as the first two terms might be seeds).\n        *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n        *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n        *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n    *   This gives a new sequence for the added values `C = [1, 5, 17]`.\n4.  **Analyze the sequence `C`:** I will find the pattern within this new sequence by looking at the differences between its terms.\n    *   Difference 1: `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   Difference 2: `17 - 5 = 12`\n    *   The differences `[4, 12]` form a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n5.  **Predict the next terms:**\n    *   The next difference will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next term in the `C` sequence will be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** The next term in the original sequence will be `2 * 119 + 53`.\n7.  **Construct the Python script:** The script will perform and print these calculations step-by-step to explain the logic clearly, concluding with the final calculation for the missing term.\n\n```python\n# The given sequence\ns = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\nprint(\"Let's find the pattern in the sequence:\", s)\n\n# Step 1: Establish the primary relationship s(n) = 2*s(n-1) + C\nprint(\"\\nThe pattern appears to be s(n) = 2 * s(n-1) + C, where C is a changing number.\")\nprint(\"Let's determine the sequence of C by applying this rule (starting from the 3rd term):\")\n\nc1 = s[2] - 2 * s[1]\nprint(f\"{s[2]} = 2 * {s[1]} + {c1}\")\n\nc2 = s[3] - 2 * s[2]\nprint(f\"{s[3]} = 2 * {s[2]} + {c2}\")\n\nc3 = s[4] - 2 * s[3]\nprint(f\"{s[4]} = 2 * {s[3]} + {c3}\")\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the sequence C\nc_sequence = [c1, c2, c3]\nprint(\"\\nThis gives us a new sequence for C:\", c_sequence)\nprint(\"Now, let's find the pattern in this new sequence by looking at the differences between its terms.\")\n\nd1 = c_sequence[1] - c_sequence[0]\nprint(f\"The first difference is {c_sequence[1]} - {c_sequence[0]} = {d1}\")\n\nd2 = c_sequence[2] - c_sequence[1]\nprint(f\"The second difference is {c_sequence[2]} - {c_sequence[1]} = {d2}\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the pattern in the differences and predict the next C\nprint(\"\\nThe differences [4, 12] form a geometric progression with a ratio of 3 (12 / 4 = 3).\")\nnext_d = d2 * 3\nprint(f\"The next difference in this progression is {d2} * 3 = {next_d}.\")\n\nnext_c = c_sequence[2] + next_d\nprint(f\"Therefore, the next term in the C sequence is {c_sequence[2]} + {next_d} = {next_c}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final missing term in the original sequence\nlast_term = s[4]\nresult = 2 * last_term + next_c\nprint(f\"\\nFinally, we can find the missing term in the original sequence:\")\nprint(f\"Next Term = 2 * {last_term} + {next_c} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
