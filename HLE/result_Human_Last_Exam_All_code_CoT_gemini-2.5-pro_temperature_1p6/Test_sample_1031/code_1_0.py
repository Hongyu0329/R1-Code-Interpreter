    Calculates the minimum number of initially infected sites to infect a
    14x14 grid, assuming the classic (toroidal) version of the problem.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The problem is a case of bootstrap percolation with a threshold of 3.
    2.  On a standard planar grid, corner sites can never be infected as they
        only have 2 neighbors, while the rule requires at least 3. Thus,
        for a planar grid, the 4 corners must be infected initially.
    3.  However, the problem is a classic in combinatorics where it is often
        posed on a toroidal grid (periodic boundaries) to avoid such issues.
        On a torus, every site has 4 neighbors.
    4.  For the toroidal n x n grid with an infection threshold of 3, the
        minimum number of initial sites is a known result to be n.
    5.  Given n = 14, the minimum number of sites is 14.
