Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options:

The premise of the question is that ECDSA is an "existentially forgeable" scheme. This is technically incorrect based on standard definitions (ECDSA is existentially unforgeable), but we can interpret it in the context of ECDSA's known malleability.

*   **Understanding ECDSA Malleability:** For a standard ECDSA signature `sig = (r, s)`, another valid signature for the same message `m` is `sig' = (r, -s mod n)`. An attacker, given `(m, sig)`, can easily compute `sig'` without the secret key. This creates a new, valid signature for the same message, which can be considered a form of existential forgery.

Let's evaluate the choices based on this understanding:

*   **A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   This is **FALSE**. Due to the malleability described above, an adversary can create a new signature `sig' = (r, -s mod n)` with a probability of 1 (which is not negligible).

*   **B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   This is **TRUE**. The malleability of an ECDSA signature does not reveal the secret key. The security of the secret key is based on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is considered computationally infeasible for a computationally bounded adversary. Therefore, the probability of recovering the key is negligible.

*   **C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.**
    *   This is **TRUE**. This statement describes a vulnerability called "selective forgery". While a secure scheme like ECDSA is resistant to this, the statement refers to "*some*" schemes within the "existentially forgeable" class. Trivial or broken signature schemes exist where this is possible (e.g., a scheme where the signature is just a hash of the message). Such schemes are by definition existentially forgeable. Therefore, a class of schemes with this property exists.

*   **D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   This is **FALSE**. Message concealment is not a required property of a digital signature. In fact, the verification function `Verify(pk, m, sig)` takes the message `m` as an input, assuming it is known. The claim that this holds for "*all*" such schemes is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
Since both statements B and C are true, the correct option is E.
