# The problem requires us to compute the value of the following expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15
# From the derivation, we have found that ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 )

# First, let's define the components of the final equation based on the derivation.

# The term from the sum of the series is pi^2/6 - 1.
# This will be the denominator in our final calculation.
denominator = (math.pi**2 / 6) - 1

# The numerator is 2 * ||alpha||^2.
# Since ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * denominator, the numerator is 2 * 0.5 * denominator, which is just the denominator.
numerator = 2 * (0.5 * denominator)

# The constant term to be added at the end.
constant_term = 10**15

# Now we assemble the final equation with these numbers and compute the result.
# The calculation is: (numerator / denominator) + constant_term
final_result = numerator / denominator + constant_term

print(f"Denominator (pi^2/6 - 1): {denominator}")
