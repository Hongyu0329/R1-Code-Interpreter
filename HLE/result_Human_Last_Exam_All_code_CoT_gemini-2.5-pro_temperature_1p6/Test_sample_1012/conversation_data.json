    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the required symmetric key length for post-quantum security.\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Threat:** The primary algorithm that quantum computers can use to attack symmetric-key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Understand Grover's Algorithm's Impact:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. For a key of length 'n', there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer needs, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to find the key (a complexity of O(2^n)). Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) attempts. This effectively halves the bit-strength of the key.\n3.  **Establish a Security Benchmark:** The current standard for strong, long-term security against classical computers is 128 bits of security (e.g., AES-128). This means a classical attacker would need to perform on the order of 2^128 computations, which is considered infeasible.\n4.  **Calculate the Post-Quantum Key Length:** To maintain this same 128-bit level of security against a quantum computer, we need a key of length 'k' such that a quantum attack would take 2^128 operations. Using the formula from Grover's algorithm, the effort is 2^(k/2).\n5.  **Set up and Solve the Equation:** We need to find 'k' such that 2^(k/2) = 2^128. This simplifies to k/2 = 128, which means k = 256. Therefore, a 256-bit symmetric key is needed to provide a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetric key length required to be secure against a\n    quantum computer attack using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the desired security level in bits.\n    # 128 bits is the widely accepted standard for long-term security.\n    target_security_level_bits = 128\n    print(f\"Goal: Achieve a security level equivalent to {target_security_level_bits} bits against classical computers.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the effect of Grover's algorithm.\n    # It provides a quadratic speedup, meaning it effectively halves the bit strength of the key.\n    # A key of length 'k' has k/2 bits of security against a quantum computer.\n    print(\"Quantum Threat: Grover's algorithm can find a key of length 'k' in roughly 2^(k/2) operations.\")\n    print(\"This means the effective security is halved.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Set up the equation.\n    # We need to find a key length 'k' where the quantum security (k/2)\n    # equals our target classical security level (128).\n    # Equation: k / 2 = target_security_level\n    print(\"\\nTo find the required key length 'k', we set up the equation:\")\n    print(\"k / 2 = target_security_level\")\n\n    # Step 4: Solve for 'k'.\n    required_key_length_bits = target_security_level_bits * 2\n    \n    print(f\"\\nPlugging in the value for the target security level: k / 2 = {target_security_level_bits}\")\n    print(f\"Solving for k: k = {target_security_level_bits} * 2\")\n    print(f\"Result: k = {required_key_length_bits} bits.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Check:\")\n    print(f\"A {required_key_length_bits}-bit key provides {required_key_length_bits}/2 = {target_security_level_bits} bits of security against a quantum computer.\")\n    print(f\"This matches our target security level.
