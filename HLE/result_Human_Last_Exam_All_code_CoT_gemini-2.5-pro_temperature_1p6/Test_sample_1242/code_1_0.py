    # Step 1: Define core criteria for strong predictors of *word* complexity.
    # - Word Frequency/Familiarity: How often a word is encountered. Higher frequency means lower complexity.
    # - Word Length: Longer words (in letters or syllables) are generally more complex.
    # - Semantic Richness: How concrete or imageable a word is. Concrete words are easier to process than abstract words.
    # - Feature must be a property of a single word, not a collection of words (a text).
    print("Step 1: Establishing criteria for strong predictors of word complexity.")
    print("Strong predictors are typically properties of individual words and include measures of length, frequency, and semantic content (like concreteness).\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze features that are less ideal or incorrect in this context.
    # 'number of unique words' is a measure of lexical diversity in a *text*, not a property of an individual word.
    # This makes choices containing it (A and C) incorrect for predicting the complexity of *words*.
    print("Step 2: Evaluating choices based on the criteria.")
    print("Analyzing feature 'number of unique words'...")
    print("This feature measures lexical diversity of a text, not the complexity of a single word. Therefore, choices A and C are unsuitable.")

    # 'number of word categories' is a less direct and weaker predictor compared to core features like length or frequency.
    # This makes choices B and E less likely than a choice composed solely of strong predictors.
    print("\nAnalyzing feature 'number of word categories'...")
    print("This is a less direct predictor of word complexity compared to more established metrics. Therefore, choices B and E are less likely to be the *most* contributive group.")

    # Step 3: Identify the best choice.
    # Choice D includes 'word length', 'word familiarity rating', 'syllable count', and 'concreteness rating'.
    # - 'word familiarity rating' maps to Frequency.
    # - 'word length' and 'syllable count' are both strong measures of Length.
    # - 'concreteness rating' maps to Semantic Richness.
    # This set contains the most fundamental, well-established, and highly correlated predictors of word complexity.
