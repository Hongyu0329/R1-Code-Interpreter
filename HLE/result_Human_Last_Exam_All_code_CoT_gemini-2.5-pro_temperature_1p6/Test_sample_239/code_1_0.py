# Answer to Q1: Number of lines with compiler errors.
# Based on analysis, lines 3, 4, and 9 have errors.
q1_errors = 3

# Answer to Q2: Total memory (in D) used for variables.
# unsigned long n (12D) + unsigned long m (12D) + unsigned int a (6D)
q2_memory_d = 12 + 12 + 6

# Answer to Q3: Can the problem be solved without branching?
# Yes, using the formula (n + a - 1) / a.
q3_no_branching = 'Y'

# Answer to Q4: Calculation for specific inputs.
# The inputs are n = 4*10^9, m = 4*10^9, a = 1
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# Calculate the number of flagstones for n and m dimensions.
# Using integer arithmetic to get the ceiling of the division.
# Python's // is integer division.
na = (n + a - 1) // a
ma = (m + a - 1) // a

# Calculate the total number of flagstones.
# Note: Python's integers handle arbitrarily large numbers, so overflow is not an issue here.
q4_result = na * ma

# Print the final combined answer in the format x:y:z:t
