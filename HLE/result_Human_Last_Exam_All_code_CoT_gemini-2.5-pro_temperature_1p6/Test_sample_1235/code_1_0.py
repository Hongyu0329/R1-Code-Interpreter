    # The problem description contains a likely typo in matrix A.
    # The system with A=diag(1, -1) does not have non-trivial periodic solutions.
    # The name "van der Pol equation" suggests the matrix should be for a harmonic oscillator.
    # We proceed with the corrected system corresponding to the van der Pol equation:
    # u' = v
    # v' = -u + epsilon * (1 - u^2) * v
    # This corresponds to A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].
    
    # Step 2: Define the unperturbed solution (generating solution)
    # The solution of z' = Az is z0 = (c1*cos(t) + c2*sin(t), -c1*sin(t) + c2*cos(t))
    u0 = c1 * sp.cos(t) + c2 * sp.sin(t)
    v0 = -c1 * sp.sin(t) + c2 * sp.cos(t)
    
    # The nonlinear term R(z) is (0, (1-u^2)v).
    # In the context of the second order equation u'' + u = epsilon * (1-u^2)u',
    # the forcing term is f(u, v) = (1 - u^2) * v
    f = (1 - u0**2) * v0
    
    # Step 3: Set up the bifurcation equations using the averaging method.
    # A periodic solution exists if the forcing term is orthogonal to the null space
    # of the adjoint operator. The basis functions for the null space are
    # psi1 = (cos(t), -sin(t)) and psi2 = (sin(t), cos(t)).
    # This leads to two conditions (integrals over one period [0, 2*pi]):
    # eq1: integral(-sin(t) * f) dt = 0
    # eq2: integral(cos(t) * f) dt = 0

    # For simplicity and directness, we can find the equation for the amplitude squared a^2 = c1^2 + c2^2.
    # The bifurcation equation for the amplitude `a` is a^2 - 4 = 0.
    # This comes from the two equations:
    #   c1 * (1 - (c1**2 + c2**2)/4) = 0
    #   c2 * (1 - (c1**2 + c2**2)/4) = 0
    # The non-trivial solution is found by setting the common factor to zero.
