    This script provides a step-by-step solution to determine the number of

    # Step 1: Analyze the metric
    # The metric is defined as:
    # d(f, g) = ||f - g|| if f and g are on the same line through the origin (f = tg).
    # d(f, g) = ||f|| + ||g|| otherwise.
    # ||.|| is the supremum norm in C[0,1].
    # This is a "star-shaped" or "French railroad" metric. To travel between points
    # on different lines (1D subspaces), the shortest path is through the origin (0).
    # The length of such a path is d(f, 0) + d(0, g) = ||f|| + ||g||.

    # Step 2: Characterize the geodesics
    # A geodesic is an isometric image of the real line R.
    # It has been shown that geodesics in this space must pass through the origin.
    # They are of two types:
    # 1. Straight Geodesics: These are lines passing through the origin. A line can be
    #    represented as R*u = {t*u | t in R} for a function u in C[0,1] with ||u||=1.
    #    This corresponds to a union of two opposite rays: R(>=0)u U R(>=0)(-u).
    # 2. Bent Geodesics: These are formed by the union of two distinct, non-opposite rays
    #    starting from the origin. Such a geodesic can be represented as
    #    R(>=0)u U R(>=0)v, where ||u||=||v||=1 and v is not equal to u or -u.
    #
    # Any geodesic can thus be represented by a set of two direction vectors {u, v},
    # where the geodesic is the set of points R(>=0)u U R(>=0)v.
    # If v = -u, it's a line. Otherwise, it's a bent geodesic.

    # Step 3: Analyze the intersections
    # Let G_A and G_B be two geodesics, with direction vector sets D_A = {a1, a2} and
    # D_B = {b1, b2}. The intersection I = G_A intersect G_B is the union of the rays
    # common to both geodesics. An intersection of two rays R(>=0)u and R(>=0)v is
    # the ray itself if u=v, and just the origin {0} if u != v.
    # Therefore, the intersection is the union of rays whose directions are in D_A intersect D_B.
    # I = Union_{u in (D_A intersect D_B)} R(>=0)u.

    # Step 4: Classify the intersections by the number of common direction vectors
    # Let k = |D_A intersect D_B|. k can be 0, 1, or 2.
    #
    # Case k = 0: The intersection of direction sets is empty. The intersection
    # of the geodesics is just the origin {0}.
    # Homeomorphism class 1: A single point.
    #
    # Case k = 1: The intersection of direction sets has one vector, say {u}.
    # The intersection of the geodesics is the ray R(>=0)u.
    # Homeomorphism class 2: A ray, homeomorphic to [0, infinity).
    #
    # Case k = 2: The direction sets are identical, D_A = D_B. The geodesics are identical,
    # and the intersection is the geodesic itself.
    # The topological structure depends on whether the geodesic is straight or bent.
    #   Subcase A: The geodesic is a line, G_A = R*u = R(>=0)u U R(>=0)(-u).
    #   Homeomorphism class 3: A line, homeomorphic to R.
    #   Subcase B: The geodesic is bent, G_A = R(>=0)u U R(>=0)v with v != -u.
    #   Homeomorphism class 4: A "Y" shape.

    # Step 5: Distinguish the homeomorphism classes
    # We use the concept of a "cut-point". A point is a cut-point if its removal
    # disconnects the space. The set of non-cut-points is a topological invariant.
    #
    # 1. Point: A single point space. Cardinality is 1. No cut-points.
    # 2. Ray ([0, infinity)): The endpoint (origin) is not a cut-point. All other
    #    points are cut-points. The set of non-cut-points has size 1.
    # 3. Line (R): Every point is a cut-point. The set of non-cut-points is empty.
    # 4. Y-shape: The branch point (origin) is a cut-point. Any other point on the
    #    two rays is not a cut-point. The set of non-cut-points is infinite.
    #
    # The four classes are topologically distinct.

    # Step 6: Count the classes
    # There are four distinct homeomorphism classes for the intersections.
