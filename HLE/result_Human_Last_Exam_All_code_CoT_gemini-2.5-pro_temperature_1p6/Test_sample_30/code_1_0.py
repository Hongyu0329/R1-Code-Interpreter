# The user wants me to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# I will analyze each statement based on my knowledge of complexity theory.

# A: Incorrect. Defines NP, not IP. Interactive proofs require interaction.
# B: Incorrect. Graph Non-Isomorphism is the canonical example of the power of IP.
# C: Incorrect. MIP* = RE shows entanglement is extremely powerful for verification.
# D: Correct. This describes the fundamental asymmetry in the IP model: a polynomial-time
#    (efficient) verifier and a computationally unbounded (all-powerful) prover.
# E: Incorrect. The claim about the significance of exact values is false due to amplification.
# F: Incorrect. Two provers are more powerful than one (MIP=NEXP vs. IP=PSPACE).
# G: Incorrect. IP=PSPACE shows these systems can solve problems much harder than NP.
# H: Incorrect. Standard alphabet is {0, 1}, not {0, 1, 2}.
# I: Incorrect. The soundness condition is defined incorrectly.
# J: Incorrect. This is a very specific technical definition, not a general statement about the concept.

# The most accurate statement is D.
# Printing the final answer.

print("It accurately describes the computational requirements for the prover and verifier in an interactive proof system.")
print("Prover: Computationally unbounded (can be considered as having exponential power).")
