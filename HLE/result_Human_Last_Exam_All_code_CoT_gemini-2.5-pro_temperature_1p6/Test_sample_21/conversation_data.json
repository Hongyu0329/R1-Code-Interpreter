    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The user wants to find the natural density of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible modulo `p`.\n\n2.  **Connecting to Galois Theory and Chebotarev's Density Theorem:** The behavior of a polynomial's factorization modulo a prime `p` is governed by its Galois group, `G`. The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes `p` for which the Frobenius element `Frob_p` belongs to a conjugacy class `C` of `G` is equal to `|C| / |G|`.\n    For an irreducible polynomial of degree `n`, being irreducible modulo `p` means its factorization consists of a single factor of degree `n`. This corresponds to the Frobenius element `Frob_p` acting as a single cycle of length `n` (an n-cycle) on the roots of the polynomial.\n    In our case, `n=7`, so we are looking for the density of primes where `Frob_p` is a 7-cycle. The density is the total number of 7-cycles in `G` divided by the order of `G`.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Galois Group (G):** The crucial step is to determine the Galois group of $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   This specific polynomial is not trivial to analyze from first principles. Standard methods like checking the discriminant or factoring modulo primes are needed.\n    *   Using computational algebra systems (like SageMath, Magma, or PARI/GP), one can find that the Galois group of $f(x)$ is the Affine General Linear Group of degree 1 over the field with 7 elements, denoted as $AGL(1, 7)$.\n    *   The group $AGL(1, 7)$ consists of all affine transformations on the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. These are maps of the form $x \\mapsto ax + b$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^*$ (the non-zero elements of $\\mathbb{F}_7$) and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Order of the Galois Group:**\n    *   The number of choices for `a` is $|\\mathbb{F}_7^*| = 7 - 1 = 6$.\n    *   The number of choices for `b` is $|\\mathbb{F}_7| = 7$.\n    *   The order of the group `G = AGL(1, 7)` is the total number of such transformations, which is $|G| = 6 \\times 7 = 42$.\n\n5.  **Counting the 7-cycles in the Galois Group:** We need to find how many elements in $G = AGL(1, 7)$ act as a single 7-cycle on the roots (which are identified with the 7 elements of $\\mathbb{F}_7$).\n    *   A permutation is a 7-cycle if and only if it is of order 7 and has no fixed points.\n    *   Let's check for fixed points for an element $g(x) = ax + b$. A fixed point is a solution to $x = ax + b$, which can be rewritten as $(1-a)x = b$.\n    *   Case 1: $a \\neq 1$. In this case, $(1-a)$ is a non-zero element in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, so it has a multiplicative inverse. There is a unique fixed point $x = b \\cdot (1-a)^{-1}$. Since there is a fixed point, the permutation cannot be a 7-cycle.\n    *   Case 2: $a = 1$. The transformation becomes $x \\mapsto x + b$.\n        *   If $b=0$, this is the identity map, which consists of 7 fixed points (not a 7-cycle).\n        *   If $b \\neq 0$, the transformation is a translation. The sequence $x, x+b, x+2b, \\dots, x+6b$ covers all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_7$ before repeating with $x+7b=x$. This permutation has no fixed points and is a single cycle of length 7.\n    *   Since $b$ can be any of the 6 non-zero values in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ (i.e., $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$), there are exactly **6** elements in `G` that are 7-cycles.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Density:** The desired natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n    *   Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 42.\n    *   Simplifying this fraction gives 1/7.\n\n7.  **Planning the Code:** The Python code will not derive the Galois group, as that is a highly complex task. Instead, it will implement the final calculation based on the group-theoretic facts established above. The code will define the order of the group and the number of 7-cycles, calculate their ratio, and print the result clearly, showing the numbers involved in the final fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_polynomial_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n\n    This problem is solved using the Chebotarev Density Theorem.
