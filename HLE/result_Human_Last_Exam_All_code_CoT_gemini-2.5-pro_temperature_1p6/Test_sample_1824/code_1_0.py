    # Step 1: Model the original German semantic feature space for musty odors.
    # The German language has high granularity with words like 'muffig' (stuffy), 'stickig' (stale air), and 'moderig' (mouldy/rotting).
    # We also have the contexts 'cellar' and 'fabric'.
    # Let's define a minimal set of features to capture these distinctions:
    # f1: A core 'musty' component, common to all.
    # f2: A 'stale air' component, for 'muffig' and 'stickig'.
    # f3: A 'decay' component, specific to 'moderig' (mouldy).
    # f4: An 'earthen/mineral' component, for the 'cellar' context.
    # f5: A 'textile/fiber' component, for the 'fabric' context.

    # Step 3: Determine the minimum number of features that must be retained in the English mapping.
    # To keep the concepts distinct after mapping, we must retain at least one feature 
    # that is not common to both concepts. These are the features in their symmetric difference.
