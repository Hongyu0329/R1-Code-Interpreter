    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Next, determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any bishop attacking another. To do this, we can analyze the problem for white squares and black squares separately, as bishops on different colored squares can never attack each other.\n3.  The edge of the board contains an equal number of white and black squares. We will find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops for one color (e.g., white squares).\n4.  By symmetry, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares will be the same.\n5.  The total number of bishops that can be placed is the sum of the maximums for the white and black squares.\n6.  Finally, subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many edge squares lack bishops. The code will show this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_side = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\n    # An n x n board has 4 sides of n squares, but the 4 corners are counted\n    # twice, so the formula is 4 * n - 4.\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * board_side - 4\n    print(f\"A standard {board_side}x{board_side} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: 4 * {board_side} - 4 = {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # We can analyze the white and black squares separately.\n    # There are 28 / 2 = 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n    white_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n    black_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    print(f\"To place the maximum number of bishops, they cannot attack each other.\")\n    print(f\"Since bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, we can analyze the {white_edge_squares} white squares and {black_edge_squares} black squares independently.\")\n    \n    # By analyzing the diagonal attack patterns of the 14 white edge squares,\n    # it can be shown that a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed.\n    # A valid placement is on squares b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, and g8.\n    max_bishops_on_white = 7\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the {white_edge_squares} white edge squares is {max_bishops_on_white}.\")\n\n    # By symmetry, the same logic applies to the black squares.\n    max_bishops_on_black = 7\n    print(f\"By symmetry, the maximum number on the {black_edge_squares} black edge squares is also {max_bishops_on_black}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of placed bishops.\n    total_bishops_placed = max_bishops_on_white + max_bishops_on_black\n    print(\"The total number of bishops successfully placed is the sum of the two:\")\n    print(f\"Total bishops = {max_bishops_on_white} (white) + {max_bishops_on_black} (black) = {total_bishops_placed}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\n    print(\"The number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the bishops we placed.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {total_edge_squares} - {total_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n    \n    return empty_edge_squares\n\n# Run the function to display the steps and get the answer.\nfinal_answer = solve_bishops_problem()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
