    "The man described is Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and statesman. His story, including his romance with Concepción Argüello and his lonely death in Siberia, was famously immortalized in the Soviet rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" for which Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto. Voznesensky's poem refers to Rezanov's lost grave, which was rediscovered in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1980s.\n\nHere is a Python script that converts his last name to numbers based on their position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.) and calculates the sum, displaying the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates a numerical value for the name \"Rezanov\"\n    by summing the alphabetical positions of its letters (A=1, B=2, ...).\n    It then prints the full equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = \"Rezanov\"\n    name_upper = name.upper()\n    \n    numbers = []\n    # Loop through each character in the name\n    for char in name_upper:\n        # Check if the character is an alphabet letter\n        if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            # Calculate the position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.)\n            # ord(char) gets the ASCII value of the character.\n            # ord('A') is the ASCII value of 'A'.\n            # The difference + 1 gives the alphabetical position.\n            value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1\n            numbers.append(value)\n            \n    # Calculate the sum of all numbers\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    \n    # Create the string representation of the equation\n    equation_parts = [str(n) for n in numbers]\n    equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # Print the final result in the format: 18 + 5 + ... = 101\n    print(f\"{equation} = {total}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
