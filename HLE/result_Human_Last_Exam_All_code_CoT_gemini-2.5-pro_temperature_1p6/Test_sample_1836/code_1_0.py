    print("The problem asks for the number of ordinals 'alpha' such that the order type of a set Y is at least 'alpha'.")
    print("Let's break down the solution into steps.\n")

    print("Step 1: Determine the set Y")
    print("----------------------------")
    print("We are given kappa_0 = kappa, and kappa_n is the set of successor ordinals in kappa_{n-1} for n >= 1.")
    print(" - kappa_1, the set of successors in kappa, consists of ordinals of the form 'beta + 1'. So, kappa_1 = {alpha + 1 | alpha + 1 < kappa}.")
    print(" - kappa_2, the set of successors in kappa_1, consists of ordinals 'gamma' in kappa_1 whose predecessor is also in kappa_1.")
    print("   This means gamma = (beta + 1) + 1 = beta + 2. So, kappa_2 = {alpha + 2 | alpha + 2 < kappa}.")
    print(" - By induction, we find that for n >= 1, kappa_n = {alpha + n | alpha + n < kappa}.")
    print("\nThe set Y is the intersection of kappa_n for all n < omega.")
    print("An ordinal 'beta' belongs to Y if and only if 'beta' belongs to kappa_n for all n >= 1.")
    print("If beta is in kappa_n, then beta must be at least n. For this to hold for all n >= 1, beta must be an infinite ordinal (beta >= omega).")
    print("Conversely, any infinite ordinal beta < kappa can be written as (beta - n) + n, so it belongs to kappa_n for all n >= 1.")
    print("Thus, Y = {beta | omega <= beta < kappa}.\n")

    print("Step 2: Find the order type of Y")
    print("---------------------------------")
    print("The set Y is the ordinal interval [omega, kappa).")
    print("The order type of an interval [a, b) of ordinals is given by ordinal subtraction, b - a.")
    print("So, the order type of Y, ot(Y), is kappa - omega.")
    print("This is the unique ordinal 'gamma' that satisfies the equation: omega + gamma = kappa.")
    print("Because kappa is a measurable cardinal, it is a regular cardinal, and kappa > omega.")
    print("For any ordinal gamma < kappa, the sum omega + gamma is also less than kappa.")
    print("The supremum of the set {omega + gamma | gamma < kappa} is kappa itself. Therefore, omega + kappa = kappa.")
    print("This means the unique 'gamma' solving the equation is kappa.")
    print("So, the order type of Y is kappa: ot(Y) = kappa.\n")

    print("Step 3: Count the number of ordinals alpha")
    print("--------------------------------------------")
    print("We need to find the number of ordinals 'alpha' for which ot(Y) >= alpha.")
    print("Since ot(Y) = kappa, we are counting the ordinals 'alpha' such that kappa >= alpha.")
    print("This is the set of all ordinals less than or equal to kappa, which is {alpha | alpha <= kappa}.")
    print("This set is equivalent to the ordinal kappa + 1.")
    print("The number of such ordinals is the cardinality of this set: |kappa + 1|.\n")
    
    print("Final Equation and Answer")
    print("---------------------------")
    print("For any infinite cardinal number like kappa, the cardinality of kappa + 1 is kappa itself.")
    print("The final calculation is presented as an equation. We will print each component of the expression representing the answer.")
    print("number_of_ordinals", "=", "|", "kappa", "+", "1", "|", "=", "kappa")
    print("\nTherefore, the number of ordinals alpha for which the order type of Y is at least alpha is kappa.")
