    "In order to answer your question, I will first research the specific 1933 self-portrait by the German artist Curt Querner. My goal is to identify the object he depicted himself holding, which is widely interpreted as a symbol of his defiance following his arrest. I will then use a Python script to print the answer clearly, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the symbolic object in\n    Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbolic_object = \"a thistle\"\n    \n    # The painting is titled \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\".\n    # The prickly, resilient thistle is seen as a symbol of his resistance.\n    \n    print(f\"In {year}, after he had {event}, the artist {artist} painted a self-portrait.\")\n    print(f\"In his hand, he holds {symbolic_object} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a thistle>>>"
