    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection (epimorphism) for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Determine the connectivity of the source space, $L = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the target space, $R = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  Compare their homotopy groups dimension by dimension, starting from the first non-trivial one. For this, I will need some known values of the homotopy groups of spheres.\n3.  Identify the first dimension, $k$, where the map on homotopy groups, $\\phi_*: \\pi_k(L) \\to \\pi_k(R)$, is no longer an isomorphism.\n4.  Determine if $\\phi_*: \\pi_k(L) \\to \\pi_k(R)$ is a surjection. If it is, and the maps on lower-dimensional homotopy groups are isomorphisms, then the connectivity is $k$.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in algebraic topology and requires knowledge of homotopy groups. I will use a Python script to print the steps of my reasoning, using known mathematical results.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step reasoning to find the connectivity\n    of the map phi: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    It prints the logical flow and the values used at each step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    p = 4\n    q = 6\n\n    print(\"Let L be the source space Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) and R be the target space Omega(S^p wedge S^q).\")\n    print(f\"Here, p = {p}, q = {q}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the spaces\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces.\")\n\n    conn_Omega_Sp = p - 2\n    conn_Omega_Sq = q - 2\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{p} is ({p}-2)-connected, so Omega S^4 is {conn_Omega_Sp}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{q} is ({q}-2)-connected, so Omega S^6 is {conn_Omega_Sq}-connected.\")\n    \n    conn_smash_Omega = conn_Omega_Sp + conn_Omega_Sq + 1\n    print(f\"For simply connected spaces A and B, conn(A wedge B) >= conn(A) + conn(B) + 1.\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6 is {conn_Omega_Sp} + {conn_Omega_Sq} + 1 = {conn_smash_Omega}.\")\n    \n    conn_L = conn_smash_Omega + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the source L = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is {conn_smash_Omega} + 1 = {conn_L}.\")\n\n    conn_smash_S = p + q - 1\n    print(f\"The space S^p wedge S^q = S^{p+q} is ({p+q}-1)-connected.\")\n    print(f\"So S^4 wedge S^6 = S^10 is ({p+q-1})-connected, which is 9-connected.\")\n    \n    conn_R = conn_smash_S - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the target R = Omega(S^10) is 9 - 1 = {conn_R}.\")\n\n    initial_conn = min(conn_L, conn_R)\n    print(f\"Both spaces are {initial_conn}-connected.
