# The user is asking for the value of the critical exponent nu (ν) in a
# "G₄-theoretical framework". This is interpreted as the φ⁴ (phi-four) theory,
# a standard model for critical phenomena.
# For this theory, at or above the upper critical dimension (d ≥ 4),
# the critical exponents take on their mean-field values.
# The mean-field value for the correlation length exponent ν is 1/2.
# This script calculates and displays this value.

# In mean-field theory, the exponent ν can be derived from the Gaussian
# part of the action, which determines the propagator. The value 1/2
# is a fundamental result of this approximation. We represent this
# as a simple division.
numerator = 1
denominator = 2

# Perform the calculation
nu_value = numerator / denominator

# Display the result in an equation format, showing each number involved.
