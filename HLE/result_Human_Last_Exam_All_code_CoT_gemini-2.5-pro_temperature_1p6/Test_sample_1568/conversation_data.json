    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product Term:** I'll first analyze the general term of the infinite product, which is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. This expression can be factored using the difference of cubes formula and properties of complex roots of unity. The roots of $x^3 = z^3$ are $z$, $z\\omega$, and $z\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. This allows factoring the term into a product of three simpler terms involving these roots.\n\n2.  **Relate to a Known Mathematical Identity:** The resulting infinite product is related to a well-known identity involving the Euler Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$. The specific identity is a generalization of the sine product formula and expresses the infinite product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$ in terms of a product of three Gamma functions. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjust the Starting Index of the Product:** The problem specifies the product starts from $n=3$, whereas the standard identity starts from $n=1$. To get the desired result, I will take the expression for the product starting from $n=1$ and divide out the initial terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Final Expression:** By combining the identity and the adjustment for the starting index, I will construct the final closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints this final mathematical expression in a human-readable format. The code itself will not perform a numerical calculation but will present the symbolic solution, fulfilling the prompt's requirements to use coding skills and output the result via a `print` statement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n    Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3)\n\n    The solution is derived using the Weierstrass product representation for the\n    Gamma function generalized for k-th roots of unity.\n    \n    1. The identity for the product starting from n=1 is:\n       Product_{n=1 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3) = 1 / (Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2))\n       where w = exp(i*2*pi/3).\n\n    2. To get the product from n=3, we divide the expression above by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n       Term n=1: (1 - z^3/1^3)\n       Term n=2: (1 - z^3/2^3)\n\n    3. This script will print the resulting final expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation is of the form: Product = Expression.\n    # The prompt provides the LHS, so we only need to provide the RHS.\n    # The final expression below contains all the numbers of the final equation,\n    # such as 1, 3, 8, 2, 4, etc., as requested.\n    \n    final_expression = \"1 / ((1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3 / 8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*I/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*I/3)))\"\n    \n    print(final_expression)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3 / 8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*I/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*I/3)))>>>"
