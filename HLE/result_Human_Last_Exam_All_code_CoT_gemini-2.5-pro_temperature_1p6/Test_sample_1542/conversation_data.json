    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables can be written as $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\nTwo forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. Such a transformation is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$ whose determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. If we apply the transformation $(x, y) \\to (px+qy, rx+sy)$ to a form $Q(x,y)$, we get a new form $Q'(x, y) = Q(px+qy, rx+sy)$.\n\nThe plan is to use a computational approach to partition the 512 forms into equivalence classes:\n1.  **Generate all forms**: We represent each form by a tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`.\n2.  **Generate all transformations**: We generate all $2 \\times 2$ invertible matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **Group and count**: We can think of the forms as nodes in a graph. An edge connects two forms if a transformation links them. The problem then becomes counting the number of connected components in this graph. We will implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We will iterate through all 512 forms. If a form hasn't been visited yet, we start a new class, increment our class counter, and perform a BFS starting from this form to find all other forms in its equivalence class, marking them all as visited.\n4.  **Final Equation**: As part of the output, we will also calculate the size of each equivalence class (the size of its orbit) and display their sum, which must equal the total number of forms (512). This provides a \"final equation\" as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_quadratic_forms_z8():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring R = Z/8Z.\n\n    A quadratic form Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 is represented by a tuple (a, b, c).\n    Two forms are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by an\n    invertible linear transformation of variables.\n\n    This script iterates through all 512 possible forms, and for each unclassified\n    form, it explores its entire equivalence class (orbit) using BFS.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # A list to keep track of visited forms, indexed by mapping (a,b,c) to\n    # an integer key: a*N^2 + b*N + c.\n    visited = [False] * (N * N * N)\n\n    # First, generate all invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z.\n    # A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit in Z/8Z {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n    invertible_matrices = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q_mat in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    determinant = (p * s - q_mat * r) % N\n                    if determinant in units:\n                        invertible_matrices.append(((p, q_mat), (r, s)))\n\n    num_classes = 0\n    orbit_sizes = []\n\n    # Iterate through all possible forms (a, b, c).\n    for a_start in range(N):\n        for b_start in range(N):\n            for c_start in range(N):\n                start_idx = a_start * N * N + b_start * N + c_start\n                \n                # If this form has not been visited, it's a new class.\n                if not visited[start_idx]:\n                    num_classes += 1\n                    \n                    # Begin BFS to find all forms in the class (the orbit).\n                    q = collections.deque([(a_start, b_start, c_start)])\n                    visited[start_idx] = True\n                    current_orbit_size = 1\n                    \n                    while q:\n                        a, b, c = q.popleft()\n\n                        # Apply all transformations to the current form.\n                        for p, r, s, q_mat in [(mat[0][0], mat[1][0], mat[1][1], mat[0][1]) for mat in invertible_matrices]:\n                            # New coefficients (a', b', c') after transformation\n                            a_new = (a*p*p + b*p*r + c*r*r) % N\n                            b_new = (2*a*p*q_mat + b*(p*s + q_mat*r) + 2*c*r*s) % N\n                            c_new = (a*q_mat*q_mat + b*q_mat*s + c*s*s) % N\n                            \n                            new_idx = a_new * N * N + b_new * N + c_new\n                            \n                            if not visited[new_idx]:\n                                visited[new_idx] = True\n                                q.append((a_new, b_new, c_new))\n                                current_orbit_size += 1\n                    \n                    orbit_sizes.append(current_orbit_size)\n\n    print(f\"The total number of equivalence classes is: {num_classes}\")\n    orbit_sizes.sort()\n    print(f\"The sizes of the orbits are: {orbit_sizes}\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, orbit_sizes))\n    print(f\"The sum of the orbit sizes is: {equation_str} = {sum(orbit_sizes)}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_quadratic_forms_z8()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
