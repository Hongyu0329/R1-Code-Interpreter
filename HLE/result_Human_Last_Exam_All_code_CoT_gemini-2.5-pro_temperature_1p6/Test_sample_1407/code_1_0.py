    Solves for the sum of all positive integer temporal fixed points less than 100.
    
    A temporal fixed point k is defined by the condition: |k + k| = |k - k|.
    This simplifies to |2k| = 0, which means k = 0.
    
    The problem also introduces a "necessarily true" constant for the universe,
    the temporal horizon h(T) = 48. This is interpreted as another given temporal fixed point.
    
    So, the set of temporal fixed points is {0, 48}.
    
    The task is to find the sum of all POSITIVE integer fixed points LESS THAN 100.
