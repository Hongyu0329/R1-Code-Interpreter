    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional box. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Recall the Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a given quantum state 'n' is:\n    ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density**: The probability of finding the particle at a specific position 'x' is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψn(x)|².\n    P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\n3.  **Calculate Probability over an Interval**: The probability of finding the particle in an interval from x₁ to x₂ is the definite integral of the probability density function over that interval.\n    P(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[x₁, x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral**: We can solve this integral analytically. The antiderivative of (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) is `x/a - (1/(2nπ)) * sin(2nπx/a)`. We will evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] for n = 2.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: A Python script will be used to perform the numerical calculation using the derived formula. The script will substitute the given values (n=2, x₁=0.495a, x₂=0.505a) and print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval for n=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    n = 2\n    x1_norm = 0.495  # x1/a\n    x2_norm = 0.505  # x2/a\n\n    # The probability is the definite integral of the probability density:\n    # P = Integral from x1 to x2 of (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a) dx\n    # The antiderivative (evaluated in terms of x/a) is:\n    # F(x/a) = (x/a) - (1 / (2*n*pi)) * sin(2*n*pi*x/a)\n    # The definite integral is F(x2/a) - F(x1/a).\n\n    # Let's calculate the terms of the final equation:\n    # P = (x2/a - x1/a) - (1/(2*n*pi)) * [sin(2*n*pi*x2/a) - sin(2*n*pi*x1/a)]\n    \n    term1 = x2_norm - x1_norm\n    \n    factor = 1 / (2 * n * math.pi)\n    \n    arg1 = 2 * n * math.pi * x1_norm\n    sin_term1 = math.sin(arg1)\n    \n    arg2 = 2 * n * math.pi * x2_norm\n    sin_term2 = math.sin(arg2)\n    \n    sin_diff = sin_term2 - sin_term1\n    \n    term2 = factor * sin_diff\n\n    probability = term1 - term2\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"The probability P for n=2 in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is given by the equation:\")\n    print(\"P = (x2/a - x1/a) - (1/(2*n*pi)) * (sin(2*n*pi*x2/a) - sin(2*n*pi*x1/a))\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values:\")\n    \n    # We show the numeric components of the equation\n    # P = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/(4*pi)) * (sin(4*pi*0.505) - sin(4*pi*0.495))\n    # Note: 4*pi*0.505 = 2.02*pi and 4*pi*0.495 = 1.98*pi\n    print(f\"P = ({x2_norm} - {x1_norm}) - (1/({2*n}*pi)) * (sin({2*n}*pi*{x2_norm}) - sin({2*n}*pi*{x1_norm}))\")\n    print(f\"P = {term1} - {factor:.6f} * ({sin_term2:.6f} - ({sin_term1:.6f}))\")\n    print(f\"P = {term1} - {factor:.6f} * ({sin_diff:.6f})\")\n    print(f\"P = {term1} - {term2:.9f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Probability: {probability}\")\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_probability()\n<<<6.579544552216591e-06>>>\n```"
