        'A': "Correct. Augustine's later works on grace and predestination have led many, including Calvin himself, to see his thought as a precursor to Calvinism. The argument that his view is 'Calvinist in nature' is a common one in theological history.",
        'B': "Incorrect. R. A. Markus is a renowned Augustine scholar. To claim he *ignored* Augustine's thoughts on predestination and grace is a misrepresentation of his work. Scholars of his stature integrate, analyze, and interpret such central concepts, they do not ignore them. Markus's analysis of freedom is nuanced and deeply connected to the rest of Augustine's theology, including grace.",
        'C': "Correct. Augustine, in works like 'On Free Will' ('De Libero Arbitrio'), develops the concept of 'voluntas' (will) as a faculty of the soul/psyche. The influence of classical philosophers like the Stoic Seneca on his thought is well-documented.",
        'D': "Correct. This is a foundational principle of Augustinian thought. For Augustine, faith and reason, or theology and philosophy, are inextricably linked ('credo ut intelligam' - I believe so that I may understand). Philosophical questions are explored within a theological framework.",
        'E': "Correct. Ã‰tienne Gilson, a major historian of philosophy, correctly identified that while Augustine's concept of grace is powerful, it should be distinguished from the more rigid and deterministic form of 'irresistible grace' later articulated by the Jansenists.",
        'F': "Correct. In 'On Free Will,' Augustine's dialogue with Evodius serves to establish that God is not the cause of evil; rather, evil stems from the misuse of the will ('voluntas') by created beings, who are therefore responsible for their actions."
