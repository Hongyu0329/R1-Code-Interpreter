    "The user wants me to find the general solution of the following differential equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Rearrange the equation.**\n    Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n    $x^{2} y^{2} - 9x^2 = y^{2} p^{2} + x^{3} y p + x y p$\n\n2.  **Factor and group terms.**\n    Factor out common terms on both sides:\n    $x^2(y^2 - 9) = (yp)^2 + (x^3+x)yp$\n    where $yp = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n3.  **Complete the square (or use clever factorization).**\n    This equation looks like a quadratic in terms of $yp$. Let's move all terms to one side:\n    $(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)yp - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n    Instead of solving the quadratic, which leads to a complicated radical, we can perform a clever algebraic manipulation. Let's add and subtract $x^4$ to the equation:\n    $(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)yp + x^4 - x^4 - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n4.  **Factor the rearranged expression.**\n    Now, group the terms to factor them:\n    $[(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)yp + x^4] - [x^4 + x^2(y^2-9)] = 0$\n    The first bracket factors as $(yp + x)(yp + x^3)$.\n    The second bracket simplifies to $x^4 + x^2y^2 - 9x^2 = x^2(x^2 + y^2 - 9)$.\n    So the equation becomes:\n    $(y \\frac{dy}{dx} + x)(y \\frac{dy}{dx} + x^3) - x^2(x^2 + y^2 - 9) = 0$\n\n5.  **Identify possible solutions.**\n    The equation is satisfied if different parts of the expression are zero. This leads to two distinct sets of solutions:\n    \n    a) If $x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0$ and $(y \\frac{dy}{dx} + x) = 0$.\n    From $x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0$, we differentiate with respect to $x$:\n    $2x + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\implies x + y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\n    This satisfies the condition $(y \\frac{dy}{dx} + x) = 0$.\n    Substituting these into the rearranged equation gives $0 \\cdot (y\\frac{dy}{dx}+x^3) - x^2 \\cdot 0 = 0$, which is true.\n    Thus, $x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0$ is a solution.\n\n    b) If $y^2 - 9 = 0$.\n    This implies $y = \\pm 3$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\n    So, $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\n    Let's substitute $y^2=9$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ into the rearranged equation:\n    $(0 + x)(0 + x^3) - x^2(x^2 + 9 - 9) = 0$\n    $x^4 - x^2(x^2) = 0 \\implies x^4 - x^4 = 0$.\n    This is also true. Thus, $y^2 - 9 = 0$ represents solutions.\n\n6.  **Combine the solutions.**\n    The full set of solutions consists of the union of the solutions found in step 5. We can express this as a single algebraic equation:\n    $(y^2 - 9)(x^2 + y^2 - 9) = 0$\n\n    Expanding this gives:\n    $y^4 + x^2y^2 - 18y^2 - 9x^2 + 81 = 0$.\n    The factored form is more elegant and directly shows the component solutions: the lines $y = \\pm 3$ and the circle $x^2+y^2=9$. These are all the possible solutions for the given non-linear equation, and it does not possess a general solution with an arbitrary constant in the typical sense.\n\nThe final answer is the implicit equation that combines these solutions. The python code below will print this equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n# The two factors of the solution\nfactor1 = y**2 - 9\nfactor2 = x**2 + y**2 - 9\n\n# The general solution is the product of these factors set to zero\ngeneral_solution = factor1 * factor2\n\n# We want to output the equation in a readable format\n# The factored form is (y**2 - 9)*(x**2 + y**2 - 9) = 0\n# The expanded form is y**4 + x**2*y**2 - 9*x**2 - 18*y**2 + 81 = 0\n\n# Print the final equation in factored form with each number.\nprint(f\"(y**2 - {9}) * (x**2 + y**2 - {9}) = {0}\")\n```\n<<<\n(y**2 - 9) * (x**2 + y**2 - 9) = 0\n>>>"
