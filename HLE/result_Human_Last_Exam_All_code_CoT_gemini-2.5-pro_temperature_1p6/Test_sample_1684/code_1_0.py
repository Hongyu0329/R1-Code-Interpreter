# The problem asks for the smallest value of k such that for any smooth
# Riemannian metric g on the 2-sphere S^2 with a total area of 4*pi,
# the second nonzero eigenvalue lambda_2(g) is always less than k.
# This value k is the supremum of lambda_2 over all such metrics.

# A major result in spectral geometry, established by G. Matthiesen and R. Petrides,
# states that the supremum of the scale-invariant product of the second nonzero
# eigenvalue and the area, for any metric on S^2, is 16*pi.
# The theorem states: sup(lambda_2(g) * Area(g)) = 16 * pi.
# The supremum is not attained by a smooth metric but is approached by a
# sequence of metrics that degenerate into two identical round spheres.

# The given area is:
area_val = 4 * math.pi
area_coeff = 4

# The supremum of the product lambda_2 * Area is:
sup_product_val = 16 * math.pi
sup_product_coeff = 16

# We can find the supremum of lambda_2 for the fixed area by rearranging the formula:
# sup(lambda_2) = sup(lambda_2 * Area) / Area
# This sup(lambda_2) will be our k.

k = sup_product_val / area_val

# The code below will print the explanation and the final calculation.
