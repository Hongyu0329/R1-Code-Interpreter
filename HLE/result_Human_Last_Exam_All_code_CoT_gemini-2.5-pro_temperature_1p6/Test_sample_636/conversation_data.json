    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system, represented by the matrix `A_cl = A + BF`, are located at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The characteristic polynomial of a system is defined by its eigenvalues. For the desired eigenvalues `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`, the characteristic polynomial `p(s)` is:\n    `p(s) = (s - λ₁)(s - λ₂)`\n    `p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n    `p(s) = (s + 1)² - j² = s² + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n    `p(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Polynomial:** The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl` is given by `det(sI - A_cl) = 0`. Let's define the gain matrix `F` as `[[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`. The resulting matrix `A_cl` will be:\n    `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n    `A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n    The characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `s² - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`. This results in a polynomial with coefficients in terms of `f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`.\n\n4.  **Simplify and Solve for F:** We need to match the coefficients of our formulated polynomial with the desired one (`s² + 2s + 2`). This gives us two equations, but we have four unknowns in `F`. This means the solution is not unique. We can find a valid solution by simplifying the problem, for instance, by setting the second row of `F` to zero (`f₃ = 0`, `f₄ = 0`).\n    With this assumption, `F = [[f₁, f₂], [0, 0]]`, and the closed-loop matrix becomes:\n    `A_cl = [[-1 + f₁, 1 + f₂], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n    The characteristic polynomial is `s² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)s + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂)`.\n\n5.  **Equate Coefficients:** Now, we compare the coefficients with `s² + 2s + 2`:\n    *   Coefficient of `s¹`: `1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2  =>  f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n    *   Coefficient of `s⁰`: `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2  =>  f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n    Solving this system of two linear equations yields `f₁ = 1` and `f₂ = -2`.\n\n6.  **Construct and Verify F:** Based on the solution, a possible gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`. The following Python code will be used to define this matrix and verify that `A + BF` has the correct eigenvalues.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=5, suppress=True)\n\n# Define the system matrices A and B\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [1, 0]\n])\n\nB = np.array([\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 0]\n])\n\n# Define the desired eigenvalues (poles)\ndesired_poles = np.array([-1 + 1j, -1 - 1j])\n\nprint(\"System Matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nInput Matrix B:\")\nprint(B)\nprint(\"\\nDesired eigenvalues (poles):\")\nprint(desired_poles)\n\n# From our manual calculation, we found a possible F by assuming its second row is zero.\n# f11 = 1, f12 = -2, f21 = 0, f22 = 0\nF = np.array([\n    [1.0, -2.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0]\n])\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculated State Feedback Gain Matrix F:\")\nprint(F)\n\n# Calculate the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + BF\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\nprint(\"\\nClosed-loop system matrix A + BF:\")\nprint(A_cl)\n\n# Calculate the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system to verify our solution\neigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system A + BF:\")\nprint(eigenvalues)\n\n# Final verification\n# The real parts should be close to -1 and imaginary parts close to +/- 1.\nif np.allclose(np.sort(np.real(eigenvalues)), np.sort(np.real(desired_poles))) and \\\n   np.allclose(np.sort(np.abs(np.imag(eigenvalues))), np.sort(np.abs(np.imag(desired_poles)))):\n    print(\"\\nVerification successful: The calculated eigenvalues match the desired eigenvalues.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nVerification failed: The eigenvalues do not match.\")\n\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
