# The final answer is determined by the three parts of the puzzle.
# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School",
# and the faked tracks were made by a horse. This corresponds to option 7.
part_a = 7

# Part C: The Nabokov work that most involved "intricate back-referencing"
# was his monumental annotated translation of "Eugene Onegin". This corresponds to option 7.
part_c = 7

# Part B: The puzzle states the sum of the three numbers is a multiple of 8.
# a + b + c = multiple of 8
# 7 + b + 7 = multiple of 8
# 14 + b = multiple of 8
# The next multiple of 8 after 14 is 16. So, b must be 2.
# The theme for option 2 is "reflection and duality", a major theme in "Pale Fire".
