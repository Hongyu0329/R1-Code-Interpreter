    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of a piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nSince the definition of the function changes at $x=3$, we must split the integral into two parts:\n1.  The integral of the first expression from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n2.  The integral of the second expression from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe total integral will be the sum of the results from these two parts.\n\n$\\int_0^4 p(x) dx = \\int_0^3 \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\nI will use Python with the SciPy library to perform the numerical integration for each part and then sum the results to get the final answer. The code will print out the value of each part of the integral and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef part1(x):\n  \"\"\"Defines the function for 0 <= x <= 3\"\"\"\n  # This simplifies to x**3 / 4\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8.0\n\ndef part2(x):\n  \"\"\"Defines the function for 3 < x <= 5\"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# --- Explanation of the method ---\nprint(\"To find the integral of the piecewise function from x=0 to x=4, we split the integral at x=3.\")\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of two integrals:\")\nprint(\"1.
