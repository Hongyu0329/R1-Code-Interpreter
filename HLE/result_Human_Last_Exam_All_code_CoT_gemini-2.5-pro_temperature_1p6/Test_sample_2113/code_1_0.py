# Plan:
# 1. Based on the physical properties of the specific Gross-Pitaevskii equation provided,
#    we simplify the particle trajectories z(t) and z1(t) to classical harmonic oscillator paths.
#    This is a key insight for this specific problem setup. z(t) = z(0)*cos(t) assuming v(0)=0.
# 2. We use the derived classical trajectory z(t) to find the form of the entanglement echo y(t)
#    by solving the provided integral equation.
# 3. We then evaluate z1(t) and y(t) at the specific time t = pi/8.
# 4. Finally, we compute the required quantity (z1(pi/8) / y(pi/8))^2 and print the components of the final equation.

# Define the specified time t
t_val = math.pi / 8

# Step 1 & 2: Define trajectories and the resulting echo function
# The trajectory z1(t) is given by z1(t) = z1(0)*cos(t) = 1*cos(t).
# The solution to the integral equation with z(t)=sqrt(2)*cos(t) is y(t) = sin(2t) / (cos(2t))^(3/2).

# Step 3: Evaluate z1(t) and y(t) at t = pi/8
# Calculate z1 at t = pi/8
z1_at_t = math.cos(t_val)

# To calculate y(t), we first need the argument 2*t
two_t_val = 2 * t_val # This is pi/4

# Calculate y at t = pi/8
y_at_t = math.sin(two_t_val) / (math.cos(two_t_val)**(1.5))

# Step 4: Compute and print the final result
# The quantity to find is (z1_at_t / y_at_t)^2
final_result = (z1_at_t / y_at_t)**2
