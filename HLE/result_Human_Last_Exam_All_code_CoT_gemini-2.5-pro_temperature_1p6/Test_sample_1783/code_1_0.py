# The analytical solution to the integral is (108 * pi) / 35.
# Here we define the numbers from this final equation.
numerator = 108
denominator = 35
pi = math.pi

# Calculate the final result
result = (numerator * pi) / denominator

# As requested, output each number in the final equation,
# along with the final result.
