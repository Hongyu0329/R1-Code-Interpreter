    This function determines the minimum curvature cost for the NGD update.

    The problem describes a fully connected layer with a d x d weight matrix.
    The number of parameters is d^2.
    The Fisher Information Matrix (F) is therefore d^2 x d^2.

    1. Naive Inversion Cost:
       Inverting the d^2 x d^2 matrix (F + alpha*I) directly costs O((d^2)^3) = O(d^6).

    2. Empirical Fisher Cost (using Woodbury Identity):
       With n < d samples, the empirical Fisher F_emp has rank at most n*d.
       Using the Woodbury identity, we can invert a smaller n*d x n*d matrix instead.
       The inversion costs O((n*d)^3). However, forming this matrix (J*J^T) costs O(n^2 * d^4).
       Since n < d, the dominant cost is O(n^2 * d^4). This is better than O(d^6), but not the minimum.

    3. Kronecker-Factored (K-FAC) Approximation Cost:
       For neural network layers, the Fisher matrix F can be approximated as a Kronecker
       product of two smaller matrices: F ≈ A ⊗ G, where A and G are d x d.
       Inverting this approximated structure requires inverting the two d x d matrices,
       A and G. The cost of inverting a d x d matrix is O(d^3).
       Therefore, the total cost for the inversion operation using K-FAC is O(d^3).

    Comparing the complexities O(d^6), O(n^2 * d^4), and O(d^3), the minimum
    achievable cost is O(d^3).

    The final equation for the complexity can be written as Cost = C * d^p,
    where C is a constant and p is the exponent. We need to output the value of p.
