WHEN HE WAS PENSIONED FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE HE BUILT IT IN CYPHER. THIS METHOD OF COMMUNICATION HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS FATHER, WHO HAD LEARNED IT DURING HIS YEARS AS A CODEBREAKER IN THE WAR. THE CYPHER WAS COMPLEX, A SERIES OF SHIFTING LETTERS AND SYMBOLS THAT SEEMED RANDOM TO THE UNTRAINED EYE BUT WERE A MASTERPIECE OF LOGIC AND STRUCTURE TO THOSE WHO KNEW THE SYSTEM. HE WOULD SPEND HOURS METICULOUSLY ENCODING EACH MESSAGE, CAREFULLY CRAFTING HIS WORDS TO FIT WITHIN THE ENCRYPTED LANGUAGE.
