# Based on the analysis, the solution to the likely intended differential equation
# T'(t) = 2sinh(2t) - 2sinh(2t)T(t)^2 with T(0)=0 is T(t) = tanh(cosh(2t) - 1).
# We need to evaluate this at t = arccosh(2)/2.
# At this time t, cosh(2t) = cosh(2 * arccosh(2)/2) = cosh(arccosh(2)) = 2.

# The final equation for the temperature T is:
# T = tanh(cosh(2t) - 1)
# Substituting cosh(2t) = 2, we get:
# T = tanh(2 - 1)
val_cosh_2t = 2
val_minus = 1

# The expression for T is tanh(val_cosh_2t - val_minus)
