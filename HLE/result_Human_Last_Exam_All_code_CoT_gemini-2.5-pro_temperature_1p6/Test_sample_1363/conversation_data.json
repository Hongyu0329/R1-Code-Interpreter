    "My plan is to analyze the technical requirements of the \"reverse turn\" in each of the listed ballroom dances. I will contrast the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, etc.) with the unique characteristics of the Tango. The key difference lies in how rotation is generated and whether the technique allows for modification in the amount of turn. Based on this technical analysis, I will write a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical principles of ballroom dances to determine where\n    overturning a reverse turn is fundamentally against the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrot',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    print(\"### Analyzing the Possibility of Overturning a Reverse Turn ###\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    analysis_swing = \"\"\"\n    In the 'swing' dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), the technique is based on principles of CBM (Contrary Body Movement), body swing, and sway. These elements provide a great deal of rotational freedom. While figures have a standard amount of turn, it is common and technically permissible in advanced choreography to 'overturn' or 'underturn' them to create different effects or to navigate the dance floor. This flexibility is part of the dance's character.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    analysis_tango = \"\"\"\n    The European Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique has no body swing, no sway, and no rise and fall. The movement is staccato, sharp, and grounded. A critical technical aspect is 'No Foot Turn' on many steps, where rotation is generated from the body over the feet. To overturn a Reverse Turn in Tango, a dancer would be forced to introduce sway or pivot on a foot in a way that is not allowed, thereby breaking the core, established technique of the dance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"1.
