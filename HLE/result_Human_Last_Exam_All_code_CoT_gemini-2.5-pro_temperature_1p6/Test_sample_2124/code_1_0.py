    """
    Calculates the ratio R for the given Yukawa theory.

    The ratio is defined as:
    R = delta_Zx / (delta_Zg + delta_Z_mx)

    Steps:
    1. Define the dimensionless coefficients for each counter-term based on
       one-loop calculations in the MS-bar scheme.
    2. We assume the expression for R should be dimensionally consistent,
       implying a typo. We use R = delta_Zx / (delta_Zg + delta_Z_mx / M_x).
    3. The common factor C = g^2 / (16 * pi^2 * epsilon) will cancel out.
    """

    # Let C be the common factor g^2 / (16 * pi^2 * epsilon).
    # All counter-terms are proportional to C.

    # 1. delta_Zx calculation
    # From the fermion self-energy diagram, the p-slash dependent divergence
    # determines delta_Zx.
    # Sigma_div = -C * (1/2 * p_slash + M_x)
    # The counter-term delta_Zx * p_slash must cancel the p_slash part of Sigma_div.
    # So, delta_Zx = -C/2.
    dzx_coeff = sympy.Rational(-1, 2)

    # 2. delta_Z_mx calculation
    # The mass counter-term from the problem's Lagrangian is -delta_Z_mx * F-bar * F.
    # This must cancel the constant part of Sigma_div.
    # -delta_Z_mx = -C * M_x  =>  delta_Z_mx = C * M_x
    # For our dimensionally consistent ratio, we need delta_Z_mx / M_x.
    dzmx_over_M_coeff = sympy.Rational(1, 1)

    # 3. delta_Zg calculation
    # The relation is delta_Zg = delta_Z1 - delta_Zx - 1/2 * delta_Z_phi,
    # where delta_Z1 is from the vertex correction.
    # The vertex correction divergence is delta_Z1 = C * 1.
    dz1_coeff = sympy.Rational(1, 1)
    # The problem states that delta_Z_phi = 0 at one loop.
    dzphi_coeff = 0
    # So, delta_Zg = delta_Z1 - delta_Zx
    dzg_coeff = dz1_coeff - dzx_coeff

    # 4. Compute the ratio R
    # R = dzx_coeff / (dzg_coeff + dzmx_over_M_coeff)
    numerator = dzx_coeff
    denominator = dzg_coeff + dzmx_over_M_coeff
    R = numerator / denominator
