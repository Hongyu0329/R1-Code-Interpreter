    This function determines the product of the described reaction and prints its IUPAC name.
    
    The reaction is an Aza-Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.
    1. The starting material is N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide.
    2. LiHMDS deprotonates the propionamide at the alpha-carbon to form a (Z)-enolate. The N-((S)-1-phenylethyl) group acts as a chiral auxiliary.
    3. Heating induces a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This is stereospecific. The N-allyl bond cleaves, and a new C-C bond forms between the alpha-carbon of the propionyl part and the C2 carbon of the cyclopentene ring.
    4. The reaction involves allylic inversion. The original allyl group, `–CH2–(C1_ring=C2_ring)–`, becomes a new substituent attached at the original C2 position, with an exocyclic double bond: `–(C2_ring)–(C1_ring=CH2)`.
    5. The chiral auxiliary `(S)-1-phenylethyl` directs the formation of the new stereocenter at the alpha-carbon of the acid to be (R).
    6. The existing stereocenter `(S)-5-methyl` on the cyclopentene ring directs the C-C bond formation, resulting in an (S) configuration at the new stereocenter on the ring (the attachment point).
    7. The final product, after an implicit acidic workup, is a carboxylic acid.
    
    Based on this analysis, the IUPAC name is constructed.
