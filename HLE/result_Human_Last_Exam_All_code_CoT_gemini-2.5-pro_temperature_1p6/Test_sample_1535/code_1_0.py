    # Clinical Analysis:
    # The patient exhibits a constellation of symptoms including systemic issues like fatigue,
    # myalgia (muscle pain), and muscle weakness, alongside a specific skin finding: "periorbital erythema".
    # This combination is highly suggestive of Dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy.
    
    # Identifying the Key Sign:
    # The "periorbital erythema" is the most specific diagnostic clue. This term describes redness
    # around the eyes. In the context of Dermatomyositis, this is known as a "heliotrope rash".
    
    # Locating the Rash:
    # A heliotrope rash is a violaceous (purplish) or erythematous (red) rash that appears on and around the eyelids.
    # It is considered a pathognomonic (i.e., specifically characteristic) sign for Dermatomyositis.
