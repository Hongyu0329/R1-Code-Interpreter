# Define symbolic variables for the formula's components
mu_0 = "μ₀"
h = "h"
d = "d"
pi = "π"

# The expression for the change in mutual inductance per unit length is Δm = M₁ - M₂.
# Based on the physical analysis:
# M₁ (bare circuits) = (μ₀ * h²) / (2 * π * d²) in the limit d >> h.
# M₂ (with concentrators) = 0, because the concentrators act as perfect magnetic shields.
# Thus, the change Δm = M₁.

# Define the numerical constants that appear in the formula
coefficient_in_denominator = 2
exponent_for_variables = 2

# Construct and print the final expression for the change in mutual inductance per unit length
# We are printing each component of the formula, including the numbers.
