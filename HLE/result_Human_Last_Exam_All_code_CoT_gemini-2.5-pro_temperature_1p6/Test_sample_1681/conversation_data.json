    "In quantum game theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma can be resolved, meaning the players can achieve a Pareto optimal outcome that is also a Nash Equilibrium. This is not possible in the classical version of the game. This resolution is achieved by starting the game in a maximally entangled quantum state and allowing players to use a broader set of \"quantum\" strategies.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Setup the Quantum Game**: We'll define the payoff matrix, the initial state `|00>`, and the key operators:\n    *   **Entangling Operator (`J`)**: This operator creates maximal entanglement between the players' qubits from the initial state `|00>`.\n    *   **Strategies (`U`)**: Players' strategies are represented by unitary matrices. We'll define the classical strategies `C` (Cooperate) and `D` (Defect), and the special quantum strategy `Q` that enables escaping the dilemma.\n2.  **Calculate Payoffs**: A function will be created to calculate the outcome of a game given the strategies of Player A and Player B. It works by:\n    a. Applying the players' strategy operators (`U_A ⊗ U_B`) to the entangled state.\n    b. Applying a disentangling operator (`J†`, the conjugate transpose of `J`) to return to a classical basis.\n    c. Calculating the probabilities of the four outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD) from the final state vector.\n    d. Computing the expected payoff for each player by multiplying these probabilities with their corresponding values from the payoff matrix.\n3.  **Identify and Verify the Equilibrium**:\n    a. We will first calculate the payoffs for the strategy pair `(Q, Q)`, where both players choose the quantum strategy. This is the proposed equilibrium point.\n    b. To prove it's a Nash Equilibrium, we will show that a player has no incentive to change their strategy if the other player is playing `Q`. We will calculate the payoffs if Player B unilaterally deviates to `C` or `D` while Player A stays with `Q`.\n    c. The final output will display the full equations for the payoff calculations, demonstrating that `(Q, Q)` yields the best possible outcome `(5, 5)` and is a stable equilibrium.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
