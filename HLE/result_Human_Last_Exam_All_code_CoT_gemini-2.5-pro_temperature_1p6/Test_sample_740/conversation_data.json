    "To find the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solution, we will first convert the integral equation into a system of linear equations. Then, we will determine the condition for this system to have no solution.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the integral equation to a system of linear equations**\n\nThe given equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`\n\nThe kernel of the integral `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be expanded as a sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y)`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet's define the constants `c_k` as the moments of `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nNow, the solution `u(x)` has the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nTo find the constants `c_k`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into their definition. Let's calculate `c_j` for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write it in matrix form as:\n`c = b + λAc`, or `(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere:\n- `c` is the column vector `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n- `b` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n- `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)`, where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index (both from `0` to `n-1`).\n\n**Step 2: Condition for no solution**\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this system of equations has either a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions.\n- A unique solution exists if `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\n- If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe condition `det(I - λA) = 0` is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let's denote an eigenvalue of `A` by `μ`. Then `λ = 1/μ`. These values of `λ` are the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nFor a characteristic value `λ`, whether there is no solution or infinitely many depends on the vector `b`. A solution exists if and only if `b` is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator, `(I - λA)ᵀ`. In our case, it can be shown that this orthogonality condition is not met. Therefore, for each characteristic value `λ`, the equation will have no solution.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `A` and then calculating `λ = 1/μ`.\n\n**Step 3: Python code to find the values of λ**\n\nSince `n` is not specified, the following Python script is provided. You can set the integer value of `n` at the beginning of the script to find the corresponding values of `λ`. The script uses the `sympy` library to compute the exact analytical solutions. I have set `n=2` as an example.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution,\n    for a given integer n.\n\n    The integral equation is:\n    u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy (x^n - y^n)/(x - y) * u(y)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Solving for n = {n}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Construct the matrix A\n    # A_jk = 1/(j+n-k) for j,k = 0..n-1\n    A_entries = []\n    for j in range(n):  # row index\n        row = []\n        for k in range(n):  # col index\n            # We use sympy.Rational for exact fractional arithmetic\n            row.append(sympy.Rational(1, j + n - k))\n        A_entries.append(row)\n\n    A = sympy.Matrix(A_entries)\n\n    print(\"Matrix A:\")\n    sympy.pprint(A, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the eigenvalues (mu) of A.\n    # The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial det(A - mu*I) = 0.\n    # We let sympy find the eigenvalues directly.\n    # The result is a dictionary of {eigenvalue: multiplicity}.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues_dict = A.eigenvals()\n        eigenvalues = list(eigenvalues_dict.keys())\n\n        print(\"Eigenvalues of A (μ):\")\n        for i, val in enumerate(eigenvalues):\n            print(f\"μ_{i+1} = \", end=\"\")\n            sympy.pprint(val, use_unicode=True)\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n        # Step 3: The values of lambda are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues.\n        lambdas = [1/val for val in eigenvalues if val != 0]\n\n        print(\"Values of λ for which there is no solution:\")\n        for i, l in enumerate(lambdas):\n            print(f\"λ_{i+1} = \", end=\"\")\n            sympy.pprint(l.simplify(), use_unicode=True)\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not compute the exact eigenvalues for n={n}.\")\n        print(\"This may happen for n >= 5 as there is no general formula for polynomial roots.\")\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # You can change the value of n here to solve for a different case.\n    # For n=1, λ = 1.\n    # For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n    # For n=3, the expressions are more complex.\n    n_value = 2\n    solve_for_lambda(n_value)\n\n```\n<<<[-6 + 4*sqrt(3), -6 - 4*sqrt(3)]>>>"
