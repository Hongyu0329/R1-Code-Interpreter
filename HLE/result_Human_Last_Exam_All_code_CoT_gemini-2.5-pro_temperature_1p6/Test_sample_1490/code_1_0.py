    Calculates the number of curves a Rangoli master must draw to restore a pattern.

    The solution is based on the following logic:
    1. The problem states there is a base pattern with 360 total curves.
    2. It also gives a condition that 90 curves remain unchanged.
    3. The number of curves that need to be drawn is the difference between the total
       original curves and the number of curves that were not disturbed.
    4. Other numerical information, like the 'three-eighths' fraction, is inconsistent
       with the absolute numbers provided and is therefore disregarded in favor of a
       logically sound model. The information about the golden ratio and curve types
       (parabolic, etc.) describes the nature of the replacement curves but does not
       change the quantity that must be drawn.
