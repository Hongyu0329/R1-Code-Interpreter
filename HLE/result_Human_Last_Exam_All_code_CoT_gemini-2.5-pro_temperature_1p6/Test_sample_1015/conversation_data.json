    "My plan is to analyze the technical differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods concerning the execution of a cambré derrière (a bend of the body backwards). I will evaluate each multiple-choice option to determine the most accurate and fundamental distinction.\n\n1.  **Analyze Vaganova Cambré Derrière:** This method emphasizes precise, academic technique. A key rule is maintaining a stable and \"square\" pelvis. During a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep both hips facing directly forward, initiating the bend from the upper and middle back. This ensures the integrity of the turnout and classical alignment.\n\n2.  **Analyze Balanchine Cambré Derrière:** This method, developed for a neo-classical aesthetic, often prioritizes speed, length of line, and dynamic shapes. In a Balanchine-style cambré derrière, it is common and often encouraged for the dancer to allow the hip of the working leg to lift and open. This creates a more dramatic, sweeping line, even though it breaks the rule of keeping the hips square.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A. Arm placement: While there are stylistic differences in arm placement, it's not the defining structural difference.\n    *   B. Placement of hip: This is the core difference. Vaganova insists on square hips; Balanchine allows the hip to open.\n    *   C. Speed: Speed is a general characteristic of Balanchine's style but not the technical rule that defines the cambré movement itself.\n    *   D. Degree of backbend: This is more about a dancer's individual flexibility than a strict methodological difference.\n    *   E. Placement of head: Head placement is a crucial detail in both, but it follows the main action of the torso and hips. The hip placement is a more foundational distinction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The most significant difference is the placement of the hips. I will create a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the key difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière.\n    \"\"\"\n    vaganova_technique = \"In the Vaganova method, maintaining square hips is a strict rule. During a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep the pelvis stable and facing forward, with the bend originating from the upper spine.\"\n    \n    balanchine_technique = \"In the Balanchine method, the aesthetic often prioritizes creating long, dynamic lines. For a cambré derrière, the dancer is often encouraged to let the hip of the gesturing leg lift and open up. This creates a visually larger shape, sacrificing the 'squareness' of the Vaganova method.\"\n    \n    conclusion = \"Therefore, the most fundamental technical difference between the two methods for this step is the 'Placement of hip'.\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the Vaganova and Balanchine methods for cambré derrière:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Vaganova:\", vaganova_technique)\n    print(\"\\nBalanchine:\", balanchine_technique)\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\", conclusion)\n    print(\"\\nThe correct option is B.\")\n\nexplain_ballet_difference()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
