    # Analysis of each statement
    # Statement I: Incorrect. Vaping is not considered "ok" for adolescents. Goal is cessation.
    # Statement II: Correct. NRT is a valid treatment consideration for adolescent nicotine dependence.
    # Statement III: Correct. The core message that risks are unknown in adolescents and they should not vape is accurate.
    # Statement IV: Incorrect. The concept of "clear benefits" over cigarettes is a harm reduction model for adult smokers, not a valid argument for adolescent use.
    # Statement V: Plausible, but less of a primary counseling point than II and III. Varenicline is generally not for minors.
