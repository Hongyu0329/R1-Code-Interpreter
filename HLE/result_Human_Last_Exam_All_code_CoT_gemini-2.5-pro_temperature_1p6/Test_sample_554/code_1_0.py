# Step 1: Define the chemical formula of a known nanocar molecule.
# We will base our hypothetical molecule on the nanocar with the formula C44H42.
carbon_atoms = 44
hydrogen_atoms = 42

print(f"The chemical formula for a standard nanocar is C{carbon_atoms}H{hydrogen_atoms}.")

# Step 2: Understand the "perfluoro-" prefix.
# "Perfluoro-" means all hydrogen atoms (H) are replaced by fluorine atoms (F).
print("The prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")

# Step 3: Determine the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar.
# The number of fluorine atoms will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.
fluorine_atoms = hydrogen_atoms

# Step 4: Display the final result and the new chemical formula.
print(f"Therefore, the resulting 'perfluoronanocar' would have the formula C{carbon_atoms}F{fluorine_atoms}.")
print("\nThe final calculation is:")
print(f"Number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar = {hydrogen_atoms}")
print(f"Number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar = {fluorine_atoms}")
