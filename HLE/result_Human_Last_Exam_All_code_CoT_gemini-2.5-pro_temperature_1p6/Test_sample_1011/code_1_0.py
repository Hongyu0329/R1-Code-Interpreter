    # The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points
    # for a sequence of ultrafilters {u_1, u_2, ...} in the Stone-Cech remainder N*,
    # where each u_i contains a specific set P_i from a partition P of N.

    # Step 1: Determine the lower bound for the number of accumulation points.
    # The set of ultrafilters U = {u_1, u_2, ...} is an infinite set of distinct points.
    # The reason they are distinct is that for any i != j, the sets P_i and P_j are disjoint.
    # An ultrafilter cannot contain two disjoint sets. Thus, if u_i contains P_i, it cannot
    # be equal to u_j, which contains P_j.
    # The space N* (the Stone-Cech remainder) is a compact topological space.
    # A fundamental theorem in topology states that any infinite subset of a compact space
    # must have at least one accumulation point.
    # Therefore, the number of accumulation points must be at least 1.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 2: Show that this lower bound can be achieved.
    # We can show it's possible to construct a sequence {u_i} that converges to a
    # single ultrafilter v. A convergent sequence of distinct points has exactly
    # one accumulation point: its limit.

    # The construction proceeds as follows:
    # 1. Choose an arbitrary non-principal ultrafilter v in N* to be our target limit point.
    #
    # 2. Rely on a known (non-trivial) theorem in ultrafilter theory: It is possible to
    #    partition the set of natural numbers N into a countably infinite collection of
    #    infinite sets P = {P_1, P_2, ...} such that every set P_i is "v-large".
    #    A set X is defined as "v-large" if its intersection with every member of the ultrafilter v
    #    (i.e., every A in v) is an infinite set.
    #
    # 3. For each i, construct the ultrafilter u_i. We want P_i to be in u_i and we want u_i
    #    to be "guided" by v. This is done by defining u_i as any ultrafilter that extends
    #    the filter generated by the base {A_intersect_Pi | A is in v}.
    #    Because P_i is v-large, every set in this base is infinite, ensuring u_i is non-principal.
    #
    # 4. This construction ensures that for any set A that belongs to the target ultrafilter v,
    #    the set A also belongs to every ultrafilter u_i in our sequence.
    #
    # 5. The condition "for any A in v, A is in u_i for all i" means that for any neighborhood
    #    of v, all points of the sequence {u_i} are inside that neighborhood. This is the
    #    definition of sequence convergence. So, the sequence {u_i} converges to v.

    # Step 3: Conclusion.
    # Since the number of accumulation points is at least 1, and we have shown a
    # construction where it is exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1.
