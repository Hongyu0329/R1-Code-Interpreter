Step-by-Step Explanation:

1.  **The Nature of Ammonia Tunneling:**
    The ammonia molecule (NH3) has a trigonal pyramidal shape. The phenomenon known as 'tunneling' or 'inversion' refers to the ability of the nitrogen atom to pass quantum mechanically through the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms, inverting the pyramid. This is possible because the molecule's potential energy surface has a 'double well' shape, with two energy minima (one for each pyramidal configuration) separated by a finite energy barrier. Quantum mechanics predicts that for such a potential, the ground state energy level will be split into two very close levels: a symmetric state and an anti-symmetric state. It is the transition between these two levels that is observed as tunneling.

2.  **Properties of Normal vs. Exotic Hydrogen:**
    -   **Normal Hydrogen:** Its nucleus (a proton) has a nuclear spin of 1/2. Particles with half-integer spin are called **fermions**.
    -   **Exotic Hydrogen:** The problem defines this as having a nuclear spin of 0. Particles with integer spin are called **bosons**.

3.  **The Pauli Exclusion Principle and Symmetry:**
    This fundamental principle states that the total wavefunction of a system of identical particles must have a specific symmetry when any two particles are exchanged.
    -   For a system of identical **fermions** (like in normal NH3), the total wavefunction must be **anti-symmetric**.
    -   For a system of identical **bosons** (like in exotic N(H_exotic)3), the total wavefunction must be **symmetric**.

4.  **Analysis and Conclusion:**
    The crucial point is that the potential energy surface, and thus the double-well shape that allows for tunneling, is determined by the molecule's electronic structure and the electrostatic forces between the nuclei. These factors **do not depend on nuclear spin**. Therefore, the exotic ammonia molecule would have the same double-well potential as normal ammonia, and the physical mechanism for tunneling would still be present.

    The Pauli principle does not forbid tunneling; it acts as a selection rule that determines which combinations of vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin states are physically allowed.

    -   For exotic ammonia, the three spin-0 hydrogen nuclei are bosons. The total wavefunction must be symmetric.
    -   The nuclear spin part of the wavefunction for three spin-0 particles is inherently symmetric.
    -   Therefore, the combined rotational-vibrational part of the wavefunction must also be symmetric to satisfy the Pauli principle.
    -   The tunneling itself creates both a symmetric and an anti-symmetric vibrational state. Rotational states of various symmetries also exist. It is possible to form allowed total wavefunctions by combining the symmetric vibrational state with symmetric rotational states, and the anti-symmetric vibrational state with anti-symmetric rotational states.

    Since both levels of the tunneling doublet can participate in forming allowed quantum states, the energy splitting due to tunneling will exist and be observable. The primary effect of changing the hydrogens from fermions to bosons would be on the statistical weights of different rotational levels, which would alter the appearance of its spectrum, but it would not eliminate the tunneling itself.

    Therefore, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.
