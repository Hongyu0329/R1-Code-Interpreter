    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Analyze the Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its constituent characters $\\chi_i$. Thus, we need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that each $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its corresponding prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$ and $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_r)) = k$.\n3.  **Count the Characters**: For each prime power $p^a$ in the factorization of $d$, we determine the number of primitive characters with orders that can contribute to the final LCM of $k=6$.\n4.  **Combine using Inclusion-Exclusion**: We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of combinations of characters that result in an LCM of exactly 6. The formula for the number of characters of order $k=p_1 \\cdot p_2=6$ is $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$, where $N(m)$ is the number of combinations of characters where the LCM of their orders divides $m$.\n\n**Applying the plan to this problem:**\n\n*   **Conductor**: $d = 53599$. Its prime factorization is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since all prime factors appear with power 1, a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (which has conductor 1).\n*   **Order**: We need the order to be $k=6$.\n*   **Counting Characters for each prime factor**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.\n    *   For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, the value $p_i - 1$ is a multiple of 6. This means for each prime factor, there exist non-principal characters of orders 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   The number of characters of a specific order $m$ (where $m | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$.\n*   **Inclusion-Exclusion Calculation**:\n    *   Let $N(m)$ be the number of character tuples where the LCM of orders divides $m$. This is the product over all prime factors of the number of available characters with order dividing $m$.\n    *   Number of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing 6 is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. Total combinations for $N(6)$ is $5^4 = 625$.\n    *   Number of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$. Total combinations for $N(3)$ is $2^4=16$.\n    *   Number of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. Total combinations for $N(2)$ is $1^4=1$.\n    *   Number of non-principal characters with order dividing 1 is 0. Total combinations for $N(1)$ is $0$.\n    *   The final count is $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1) = 625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    temp_n = n\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            temp_n //= d\n        else:\n            d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n       factors.append(temp_n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The required order is k = {k}.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of the conductor d\n    factors_d = prime_factors(d)\n    r = len(factors_d)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The prime factorization of d is {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors_d))}.\")\n    print(\"A primitive character of conductor d is a product of r non-principal characters, one for each prime factor.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: We need to find the number of tuples of non-principal characters (chi_1, ..., chi_r) such that\")\n    print(f\"lcm(ord(chi_1), ..., ord(chi_r)) = {k}.\")\n    print(\"This will be solved using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The number of characters is N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1), where N(m) is the number of combinations\")\n    print(f\"of characters where the lcm of their orders divides m.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the terms for the formula\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculating N(m) for m = 6, 3, 2, 1.\")\n    \n    # N(6)\n    num_choices_6 = sum(phi(j) for j in [2, 3, 6])\n    term_N6 = num_choices_6 ** r\n    print(f\"The number of non-principal characters mod p_i whose order divides 6 is phi(2)+phi(3)+phi(6) = {phi(2)}+{phi(3)}+{phi(6)} = {num_choices_6}.\")\n    print(f\"With r={r} prime factors, N(6) = {num_choices_6}^{r} = {term_N6}.\")\n\n    # N(3)\n    num_choices_3 = phi(3)\n    term_N3 = num_choices_3 ** r\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of non-principal characters mod p_i whose order divides 3 is phi(3) = {phi(3)} = {num_choices_3}.\")\n    print(f\"N(3) = {num_choices_3}^{r} = {term_N3}.\")\n    \n    # N(2)\n    num_choices_2 = phi(2)\n    term_N2 = num_choices_2 ** r\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of non-principal characters mod p_i whose order divides 2 is phi(2) = {phi(2)} = {num_choices_2}.\")\n    print(f\"N(2) = {num_choices_2}^{r} = {term_N2}.\")\n\n    # N(1)\n    term_N1 = 0\n    print(\"\\nThe number of non-principal characters whose order divides 1 is 0.
