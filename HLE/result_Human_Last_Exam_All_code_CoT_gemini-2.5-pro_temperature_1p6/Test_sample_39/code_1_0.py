    # Step 1: Interpret the statements
    print("1. System S is ZFC + 'there exists an inaccessible cardinal κ'.")
    print("2. Statement P asserts 'there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j: V -> M', which is a formal definition for the existence of a measurable cardinal.")
    print("   The question is: What is the relationship between the existence of an inaccessible cardinal and a measurable cardinal?")

    # Step 2: Relate the large cardinal axioms
    print("\nRelationship in Large Cardinal Hierarchy:")
    print("   - A measurable cardinal is a much 'larger' or 'stronger' type of cardinal than an inaccessible cardinal.")
    print("   - A key theorem states that every measurable cardinal is also an inaccessible cardinal.")

    # Step 3: Check if P is provable in S
    print("\nIs P provable in S? (Option A)")
    print("   - This would mean 'inaccessible' => 'measurable'. This is known to be false.")
    print("   - For example, in Gödel's constructible universe L, there can be inaccessible cardinals, but it is a theorem (by Scott) that there can be no measurable cardinals.")
    print("   - Since there is a model of S where P is false, S cannot prove P.")

    # Step 4: Check if the negation of P is provable in S
    print("\nIs ¬P provable in S? (Option B)")
    print("   - This would mean 'inaccessible' => 'NOT measurable'. This is also false.")
    print("   - If we assume a measurable cardinal exists, it is also inaccessible. Such a universe is a model of S where P is true.")
    print("   - Since there is a model of S where P is true, S cannot prove ¬P.")

    # Step 5: Draw the final conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("   - Since S can neither prove P nor disprove ¬P, the statement P is independent of the system S.")
    print("   - This corresponds to option C.")
