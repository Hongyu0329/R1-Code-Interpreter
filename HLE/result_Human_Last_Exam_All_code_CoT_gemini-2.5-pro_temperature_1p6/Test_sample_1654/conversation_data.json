    "To determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat as a symbol of his shifting mentality in \"The Chameleon\", we will count each instance where an action involving the coat is mentioned. This excludes the initial description of him wearing it, but includes every time he puts it on, takes it off, or wraps it around himself as a reaction to the changing situation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify each instance in the story where Otchumyelov directs an action related to his coat.\n2.  Count the number of times he takes the coat *off*.\n3.  Count the number of times he puts the coat *on*.\n4.  Count the final action where he wraps the coat around himself.\n5.  Sum these counts to get the total number of symbolic descriptions.\n6.  The Python code will represent this summation and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Count the symbolic actions related to Otchumyelov's coat.\n# The story describes Otchumyelov's vacillating authority through his\n# interaction with his greatcoat. We count each time he orders it on or off,\n# plus the final action of him wrapping it around himself.\n\n# 1. Count the number of times the coat is taken OFF as his opinion shifts.\n#    - When he thinks the dog belongs to the General.\n#    - When he thinks the dog might be the General's after all.\n#    - When he learns the dog belongs to the General's brother.\ntimes_coat_taken_off = 3\n\n# 2. Count the number of times the coat is put ON.\n#    - When he believes the dog is a stray.\n#    - After Prokhor denies the dog is the General's.\ntimes_coat_put_on = 2\n\n# 3. Count the final action involving the coat.\n#    - As he leaves, he wraps himself in his greatcoat, his final \"state\".\nfinal_coat_action = 1\n\n# 4. Calculate the total number of descriptions.\ntotal_descriptions = times_coat_taken_off + times_coat_put_on + final_coat_action\n\n# 5. Print the equation and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The number of times the coat was taken off: {times_coat_taken_off}\")\nprint(f\"The number of times the coat was put on: {times_coat_put_on}\")\nprint(f\"The final action involving the coat: {final_coat_action}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of symbolic descriptions is the sum of these actions:\")\nprint(f\"{times_coat_taken_off} + {times_coat_put_on} + {final_coat_action} = {total_descriptions}\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"
