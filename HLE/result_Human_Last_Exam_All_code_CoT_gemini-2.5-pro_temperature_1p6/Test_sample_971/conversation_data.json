    "While Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri is legendary, the specific turn sequence you're asking about is a common point of confusion. The iconic set of 32 whip-like turns, known as fouettés, famously takes place in the Coda of the Act III Grand Pas de Deux, not in the Act I variation. The variation in Act I features other brilliant turns, like piqué turns on a diagonal, but not a long sequence of pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\nThe number of turns that made this role an icon is 32, typically counted in four sets of eight. Here is a Python script to calculate that total.\n\n```python\n# The famous turning sequence in Don Quixote is typically counted in sets.\n# While the question specifies Act I, the iconic 32 fouetté turns are in Act III.\n# We will calculate this famous number.\n\n# The turns are musically phrased in sets of 8.\nturns_per_set = 8\n\n# There are 4 sets in the full sequence.\nsets_of_turns = 4\n\n# Calculate the total number of turns.\ntotal_turns = sets_of_turns * turns_per_set\n\nprint(\"The most famous sequence of turns performed by Kitri consists of 4 sets of 8.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: {sets_of_turns} * {turns_per_set} = {total_turns}\")\n```\n<<<32>>>"
