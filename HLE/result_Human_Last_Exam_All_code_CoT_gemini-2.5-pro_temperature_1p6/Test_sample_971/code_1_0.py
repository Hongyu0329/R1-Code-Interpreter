# The famous turning sequence in Don Quixote is typically counted in sets.
# While the question specifies Act I, the iconic 32 fouett√© turns are in Act III.
# We will calculate this famous number.

# The turns are musically phrased in sets of 8.
turns_per_set = 8

# There are 4 sets in the full sequence.
sets_of_turns = 4

# Calculate the total number of turns.
total_turns = sets_of_turns * turns_per_set
