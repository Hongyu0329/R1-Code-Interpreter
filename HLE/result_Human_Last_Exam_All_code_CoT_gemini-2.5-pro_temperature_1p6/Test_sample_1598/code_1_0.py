# The problem reduces to finding the maximum value in a set of 100 positive
# integers {x_1, ..., x_100} such that no element is a sum of a subset of
# the others, and this maximum value is minimized.
# The optimal strategy is a greedy construction which yields the sequence
# x_i = 2^(i-1).
# We need to find the 100th term of this sequence.

# The final equation is: result = base ^ exponent
base = 2
exponent = 100 - 1  # For the 100th term, i=100, the exponent is 100-1=99

# Calculate the result
global_labeling_number = base ** exponent

# Print the components of the equation and the final result
print(f"The calculation is for the equation: k = base ^ exponent")
