# This script calculates the result of a simple mathematical equation
# and prints the full equation as the output.

# Assign numbers to variables
num1 = 25
num2 = 4
num3 = 100

# Perform the calculation
result = (num1 * num2) + num3

# Print the final equation with the result
# The task requires showing each number in the final equation.
print(f"The result of the calculation is:")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} + {num3} = {result}")
