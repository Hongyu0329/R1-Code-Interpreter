    # Population 1 has a high frequency of allele 'A'

    q1 = 1 - p1 # Frequency of allele 'a' in Pop 1
    N1 = 1000 # Number of individuals in Pop 1

    # Population 2 has a high frequency of allele 'a'

    q2 = 1 - p2 # Frequency of allele 'a' in Pop 2

    # --- Step 3: Calculate Observed vs. Expected Heterozygosity (Wahlund Effect) ---

    # Observed Heterozygosity (Ho): The actual proportion of heterozygotes.
    # We assume the parent populations were in HWE, so Ho in Pop1 is 2*p1*q1.
    # The total number of heterozygotes is the sum from each source population.

    # Expected Heterozygosity (He): The proportion of heterozygotes expected
    # if the mixed gene pool were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
    He_hybrid = 2 * p_hybrid * q_hybrid

    # --- Step 4: Calculate Fis and print the explanation ---
    # Fis measures the heterozygote deficit.
