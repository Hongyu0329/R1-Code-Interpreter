Let K be the field in question. The properties of K are:
1.  K is a complete discretely valued field (CDVF).
2.  char(K) = 2.
3.  The residue field of K, let's call it k, is a local field of characteristic 2.

A local field of characteristic 2 is a field of formal Laurent series over a finite field of characteristic 2, like k = F_q((t)) where q is a power of 2.
So, K is a CDVF with residue field k=F_q((t)). This means K is a 2-dimensional local field, for example, K could be F_q((t))((u)).

The problem asks for the smallest natural number N such that every N-dimensional anisotropic quadratic form Q over K is surjective (i.e., the map x -> Q(x) has K as its image).

Let's analyze this property.
An anisotropic quadratic form Q is one where Q(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0.
The question can be satisfied for a given N if the set of N-dimensional anisotropic quadratic forms over K is empty.
The maximum dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form over a field K is called the u-invariant of K, denoted u(K).
For any N > u(K), there are no N-dimensional anisotropic forms, so the condition in the problem is vacuously satisfied.
The smallest N that is greater than u(K) is u(K) + 1.

The u-invariant of a 2-dimensional local field K of characteristic 2, such as F_q((t))((u)), is a known result in the theory of quadratic forms.
The u-invariant is u(K) = 8.
This implies that for N = 9, there are no 9-dimensional anisotropic quadratic forms over K. The condition is therefore true for N=9.

Now, we must check if the condition can hold for any N <= 8.
Let's use the theory of quadratic forms for a CDVF. Let u be a uniformizer for K. Any anisotropic quadratic form Q over K can be written as a direct sum of two forms Q_1 and u*Q_2, where Q_1 and Q_2 are anisotropic quadratic forms over the residue field k. This is based on Springer's theorem.
A key result (the char-2 version of Springer's theorem on value sets) states that Q is surjective over K if and only if both Q_1 and Q_2 are surjective over k.

The u-invariant of the residue field k = F_q((t)) is also a known result: u(k) = 4.

Let's test N=8.
Let Q be an 8-dimensional anisotropic form over K. We can decompose it as Q is equivalent to Q_1 + u*Q_2, where Q_1 and Q_2 are anisotropic over k.
The dimension of Q is dim(Q_1) + dim(Q_2) = 8.
Since Q_1 and Q_2 are anisotropic over k, their dimensions cannot exceed u(k) = 4.
This forces dim(Q_1) = 4 and dim(Q_2) = 4.
So, any 8-dimensional anisotropic form over K arises from a pair of 4-dimensional anisotropic forms over k.
For Q to be surjective, both Q_1 and Q_2 must be surjective over k.
Therefore, the property for N=8 holds if and only if *every* 4-dimensional anisotropic form over k is surjective.

However, there exist 4-dimensional anisotropic quadratic forms over k = F_q((t)) which are NOT surjective.
For example, the reduced norm form of a quaternion division algebra over k is a 4-dimensional anisotropic form. Its set of values is a proper subgroup of the multiplicative group k^*, and thus it is not surjective.
Let's call such a non-surjective 4-dimensional form Phi. We can then construct an 8-dimensional anisotropic form Q over K as Q = Phi + u*Phi.
This form Q is not surjective because its component form Phi is not surjective.
This shows that the property fails for N=8.

Let's test N < 8.
For any N < 8, say N=5, we need to check if all 5-dim anisotropic forms are surjective. A 5-dim form Q decomposes as Q_1 + u*Q_2 with dim(Q_1)+dim(Q_2)=5 (e.g., 1 and 4). We can choose Q_1 to be a 1-dimensional form, like Q_1(x) = ax^2. The value set of Q_1 is a*k^2, which is not all of k since [k:k^2]=2. Thus Q_1 is not surjective. This implies that Q is not surjective. We can find an anisotropic 4-dim form Q_2 over k since u(k)=4. So, we can construct a non-surjective anisotropic form for any dimension N between 1 and 8.

Therefore, the condition fails for all N <= 8. The smallest N for which the property holds is 9.
