    "To find the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will first identify the major real-world rivers referenced in the text. Then, I will find their approximate modern lengths. Finally, I will write a Python script to sort these rivers by length and print the top three.\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** The main real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, Danube, Euphrates, Rhine, Po, and Tiber.\n2.  **Gather Length Data:** I will use the approximate lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n    *   Nile: 6650 km\n    *   Danube: 2850 km\n    *   Euphrates: 2800 km\n    *   Rhine: 1230 km\n    *   Po: 652 km\n    *   Tiber: 406 km\n3.  **Create Python Script:** The script will store this data, sort it to find the three longest, and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Rhine': 1230,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The `sorted` function returns a list of tuples (key, value).\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {river}: {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
