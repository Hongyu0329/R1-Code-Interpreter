    "This is a linguistic question that requires historical and etymological analysis rather than a computational solution. I will explain the reasoning to find the modern French equivalent.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized form of a Gaulish or, more likely, a Frankish (Germanic) name from Late Antiquity. To find its French equivalent, we can break it down:\n\n1.  **\"Odo-\"**: This first part comes from the Germanic root *aud*, meaning \"wealth\" or \"prosperity\". This element is common in many ancient names. In French, this Germanic root evolved into \"Eudes\". A famous example is the king Odo of West Francia, who is known as *Eudes* in modern French.\n\n2.  **\"-beccus\"**: This is a Latinized suffix. Its exact Germanic origin in this context is less clear and it does not have a standard, direct equivalent that carried over into modern French naming conventions.\n\nTherefore, while the entire name \"Odobeccus\" doesn't have a one-to-one translation, the core and most significant part of the name, \"Odo-\", has a clear and well-established equivalent in French.\n\nThe French equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" is **Eudes**.\n\n<<<Eudes>>>"
