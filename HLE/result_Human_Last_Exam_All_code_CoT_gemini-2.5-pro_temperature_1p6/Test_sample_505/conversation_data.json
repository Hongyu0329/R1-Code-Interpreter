    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits, we need to apply the formula for surface codes with boundaries (holes).\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  A single patch of surface code on a plane with `b` boundaries (or holes) can encode `k = b - 1` logical qubits.\n2.  In this case, each patch has `b = 2` holes. So, each patch can encode `k = 2 - 1 = 1` logical qubit.\n3.  Since there are two separate, identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in\n    two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes (boundaries) in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a single planar surface code with 'b' boundaries (holes),\n    # the number of logical qubits it can encode is k = b - 1.\n    # We calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch first.\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch - 1\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each\n    # independent patch. Since the patches are identical, we can multiply.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation as requested\n    print(\"Calculation for the number of logical qubits:\")\n    print(f\"1. Logical qubits per patch = (Number of holes per patch) - 1\")\n    print(f\"   Logical qubits per patch = {num_holes_per_patch} - 1 = {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"2. Total logical qubits = (Number of patches) * (Logical qubits per patch)\")\n    print(f\"   Total logical qubits = {num_patches} * {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, two patches of surface code with two holes each can encode at most {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits.\")\n\nsolve_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
