    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$. That is, $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p^a}$.\n3.  **Order of a Character**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_2^{a_2}}), \\dots)$. We need this order to be 6.\n4.  **Counting Primitive Characters**: For each prime power factor $p^a$, we need to count the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides 6. Let's call this count $C_{p^a}$.\n    *   To do this, we first identify the structure of the group of characters modulo $p^a$.\n    *   Then, we determine which character orders correspond to primitive characters.\n    *   From this set of primitive character orders, we select those that are divisors of 6.\n    *   The number of characters of a specific order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $M$ (if $k|M$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. We sum these counts for all valid orders.\n5.  **Combining the Counts**: The total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ with an order that divides 6 is the product of the individual counts: $\\prod C_{p^a}$.\n6.  **Final Verification**: We must verify that any character constructed this way has an order of exactly 6, not a proper divisor of 6 (like 2 or 3). We check if the lcm of the component orders is always 6. This involves checking if the set of possible orders for the components always includes one divisible by 2 and one divisible by 3.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_prime_factorization_str(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a formatted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    \n    return \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{a}\" if a > 1 else str(p) for p, a in sorted(factors.items())])\n\n# Problem parameters\nN = 36036\norder = 6\n\nprint(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {order}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 1: Prime factorization of N\nN_factored_str = get_prime_factorization_str(N)\nprint(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of N is {N} = {N_factored_str}.\")\n# N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\nprime_powers = [4, 9, 7, 11, 13]\nprint(f\"The conductor N can be factored into primitive conductors for the prime powers: {prime_powers}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Analyze the number of suitable primitive characters for each prime power conductor.\")\nprint(\"A character is 'suitable' if it is primitive and its order divides the target order of 6.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\ncounts = {}\n\n# Conductor 4 (2^2)\npa = 4\nprint(f\"Analyzing conductor p^a = {pa}:\")\nprint(\"The group of characters mod 4 is cyclic of order phi(4)=2, so it is isomorphic to C_2.\")\nprint(\"There is 1 primitive character mod 4, and its order is 2.\")\nprint(\"Since 2 divides 6, this character is suitable.\")\nnum_chars_4 = 1\ncounts[pa] = num_chars_4\nprint(f\"Number of suitable primitive characters for conductor {pa}: {num_chars_4}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 10)\n\n# Conductor 9 (3^2)\npa = 9\nprint(f\"Analyzing conductor p^a = {pa}:\")\nprint(\"The group of characters mod 9 is cyclic of order phi(9)=6, so it is isomorphic to C_6.\")\nprint(\"Primitive characters mod 9 have orders that do not divide phi(3)=2.
