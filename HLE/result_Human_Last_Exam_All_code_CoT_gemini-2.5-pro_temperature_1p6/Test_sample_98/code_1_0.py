    # Step 2: When the tank is 'half-filled', the volume of the water is half the

    # pass through the icosahedron's center of symmetry.

    # Step 3: The tank is 'standing on one of its faces'. This means the base is a
    # horizontal triangle. The water surface is also a horizontal plane.
    # So, the shape of the water surface is the horizontal cross-section
    # passing through the center of the icosahedron.
    explanation_3 = "The tank stands on a face, so the water surface is the horizontal cross-section through the center."

    # Step 4: For an icosahedron oriented on one of its faces, the central
    # cross-section parallel to that face is a regular hexagon. This is because
    # the plane cuts the 6 edges that are situated around the 'equator' of the icosahedron
    # relative to this orientation.
