# From the analysis of the nonlinear boundary value problem, we determined that the
# initial values (x0, y0, z0) of the generating solution must lie on a specific sphere
# for a solution to exist.

# The equation for the sphere is x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2.
# Based on the problem's conditions, the squared radius R^2 is derived from:
# 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) = 10^25
# So, R^2 = 10^25 / 2.

# We define the constants involved in the final calculation.
four = 4
two = 2
exponent = 25
final_coefficient = int(four / two)

# The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# We substitute our value for R^2 to find the area.
