    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will consult established microRNA databases and literature to identify the distinct members of the human let-7 family. The let-7 family is defined by a conserved seed sequence, but individual members have slight variations.\n2.  I will create a list of these identified members. This list will include the canonical let-7 miRNAs (let-7a, -7b, etc.) as well as other miRNAs like miR-98, which shares the same seed sequence and is considered part of the family.\n3.  Using a Python script, I will iterate through this list to display each member.\n4.  The script will then construct and print an equation to visually represent the counting of these members, summing them up to get the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the members of the let-7 microRNA family in humans.\n\n    The information is based on consensus from microRNA databases like miRBase\n    and the scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The human let-7 family consists of several members with distinct mature sequences.\n    # The list below includes the canonical members and miR-98, which is structurally\n    # and functionally part of the family.\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The distinct members of the let-7 family identified in humans are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n    count = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    # To show the final calculation, we can represent it as a sum.\n    # Each '1' in the equation represents one unique family member.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in let7_family_members]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number is the sum of each identified member:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_let7_family_members()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
