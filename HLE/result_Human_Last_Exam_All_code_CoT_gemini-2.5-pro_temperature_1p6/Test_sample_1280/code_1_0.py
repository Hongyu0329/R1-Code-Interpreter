# Step 1: Define the possible number of "zero mode" solutions for H_0.
# A zero mode is a state annihilated by L, leading to an unpaired energy level for H_0.
# This is a first-order ODE, so it can have either 0 or 1 solution satisfying the boundary conditions.
num_zero_modes_H0 = [0, 1]

# Step 2: Define the possible number of "zero mode" solutions for H_1.
# A zero mode is a state annihilated by L+, leading to an unpaired energy level for H_1.
# This is also a first-order ODE, having 0 or 1 solution.
num_zero_modes_H1 = [0, 1]

# Step 3: The total number of differing energy levels is the absolute difference 
# between the number of zero modes for each Hamiltonian. We want to find the maximum possible value.
max_difference = 0

# We can find the maximum by considering all possible combinations.
# The most illustrative case is when one Hamiltonian has a zero mode and the other does not.
n0_case = 1
n1_case = 0

# Step 4: Calculate the maximum difference based on this case.
# The equation for the number of differing levels is |n0 - n1|.
max_difference = abs(n0_case - n1_case)

# Final Output
