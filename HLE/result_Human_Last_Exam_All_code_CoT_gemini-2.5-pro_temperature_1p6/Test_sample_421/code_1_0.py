# Plan:
# The problem reduces to counting the number of paths from one intersection point (A)
# to the other (B) within the given space.
# The constraint "finitely many self-intersections" means that each of the three
# connections (1 line segment, 2 arcs) between A and B can be used at most once per path.
# A path from A to B must take an odd number of steps between A and B.

# Number of available edges between points A and B.
n_edges = 3

# Case 1: Paths of length 1 (A -> B).
# We choose 1 edge out of the 3 available.
# This is a permutation of 3 items taken 1 at a time.
paths_len_1 = math.perm(n_edges, 1)

# Case 2: Paths of length 3 (A -> B -> A -> B).
# We must use 3 distinct edges in a specific order.
# This is a permutation of 3 items taken 3 at a time.
paths_len_3 = math.perm(n_edges, 3)

# Case 3: Paths of length 5 or more are impossible as we only have 3 edges.
# The number of such paths is 0.

# The total number of paths is the sum of possibilities.
total_paths = paths_len_1 + paths_len_3
