# Step 1: Fix k_Yuk
# The Yukawa interaction term in N=4 SYM containing the N=1 gaugino is:
# L_N4_Yuk_lambda = k_Yuk * f_abc * (phi_i^a + phi_i*^a) * psi^bi * lambda^c + c.c.
# (after decomposing phi_{i4} into complex scalar components phi_i)
# The corresponding term from the N=1 theory is given as:
# L_N1_Yuk = sqrt(2) * f_abc * phi_i*^a * psi^bi * lambda^c + c.c.
# In the N=1 description, an underlying U(1)_R symmetry must be respected.
# The term proportional to phi_i^a is charged under this U(1)_R, while the term
# with phi_i*^a is neutral. Therefore, only the phi_i*^a term can appear.
# Matching the coefficients of the allowed term:
# k_Yuk * f_abc * phi_i*^a * psi^bi * lambda^c = sqrt(2) * f_abc * phi_i*^a * psi^bi * lambda^c
k_Yuk = sympy.sqrt(2)
print(f"The constant k_Yuk is fixed by comparing the Yukawa terms involving the gaugino.")
print(f"The decomposed N=4 term provides a coefficient of k_Yuk for the term f_abc * phi_i*^a * psi^bi * lambda^c.")
print(f"The given N=1 Yukawa term has a coefficient of sqrt(2).")
print(f"Matching these coefficients gives: k_Yuk = sqrt(2)")
print(f"So, k_Yuk = {k_Yuk}")

# Step 2: Fix k_D+F
# The D-term potential in the N=1 theory is given as L_D = 1/2 * (f_abc * phi_i*^b * phi_i^c)^2.
# This must be matched to the corresponding part of the N=4 scalar potential L_{F+D}.
# The N=4 potential includes contributions from both F-terms and D-terms.
# The D-term part of the N=4 potential is known to have a specific structure which, when matched
# with the N=1 D-term potential, determines the coefficient.
# In many standard normalizations compatible with the kinetic terms provided,
# the coefficient k_{D+F} for the full scalar potential corresponds to a coefficient
# of 1/2 for the pure D-term squared part of the potential.
# The expression L_D is precisely half the square of the D-term.
# Therefore, we match L_D to the D-term part of L_{F+D}.
