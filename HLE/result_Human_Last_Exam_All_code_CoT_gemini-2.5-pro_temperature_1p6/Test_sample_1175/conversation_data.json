    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will solve the given first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) to find the function $x_3(t)$. The standard method for this type of equation is using an integrating factor. After finding the general solution, I'll use the initial condition $x_3(0) = 5$ to find the particular solution.\n\nNext, I will substitute the particular solution into the expression $(10^{5} + 10^{-5})x_{3}(\\ln10^{5}) + \\frac{3}{4}10^{\\frac{-20}{3}}$. I'll show that a significant simplification occurs. Let $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$. We can notice that $10^5 + 10^{-5} = e^{t_0} + e^{-t_0} = 2\\cosh(t_0)$. This will cancel with the $\\cosh(t_0)$ term in the denominator of the solution $x_3(t_0)$, greatly simplifying the expression.\n\nAfter simplification, the problem reduces to calculating the value of the expression $\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10^{10/3} + \\frac{37}{4}$.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script that calculates this simplified expression, printing out each component of the calculation as requested before displaying the final numerical answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the final calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem simplifies to the evaluation of the expression:\n# (3/2) * 10^(10/3) + 37/4\n# Let's break this down into parts and calculate the final value.\n\n# Define the constants from the simplified expression\na = 3/2\nb = 10\nexp_val = 10/3\nc = 37/4\n\n# Calculate the value of each term in the expression\nfirst_term = a * (b ** exp_val)\nsecond_term = c\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_term + second_term\n\nprint(\"The problem simplifies to the following expression:\")\nprint(f\"({a}) * ({b}^({round(exp_val, 2)}...)) + ({c})\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's calculate each number in this final equation:\")\nprint(f\"The value of the first term, ({a}) * ({b}^(10/3)), is: {first_term}\")\nprint(f\"The value of the second term, (37/4), is: {second_term}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final result is the sum of these two terms:\")\nprint(f\"{first_term} + {second_term}\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal calculated value:\")\nprint(result)\n```\n<<<3240.902035046274>>>"
