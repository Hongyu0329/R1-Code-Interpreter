# The problem simplifies to the evaluation of the expression:
# (3/2) * 10^(10/3) + 37/4
# Let's break this down into parts and calculate the final value.

# Define the constants from the simplified expression
a = 3/2
b = 10
exp_val = 10/3
c = 37/4

# Calculate the value of each term in the expression
first_term = a * (b ** exp_val)
second_term = c

# Calculate the final result
result = first_term + second_term
