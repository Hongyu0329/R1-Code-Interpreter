    "My plan is to first explain the core concepts involved and then demonstrate how one logically leads to a contradiction with the other.\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level Views:** I will explain that in these views, a life is only considered a positive addition to a population if its welfare level (`w`) is above a certain positive \"critical level\" (`c`). The value contributed by that life is `w - c`.\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Condition:** I will explain this condition, which states that for any small population of very happy people, there exists some large number of people with a low (but still positive) level of welfare that would constitute a better overall population.\n3.  **Demonstrate the Violation:** I will use a concrete numerical example. I'll set a critical level `c` (e.g., 10) and then choose a positive welfare level `w` that is below `c` (e.g., 5). I'll show that adding any number of people at this welfare level `w` always results in a negative total value, making it impossible to ever be considered better than a small, high-welfare population. This directly violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n4.  **Final Output:** The Python script will print this step-by-step explanation, including the specific numbers used in the example, and conclude with the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains which condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem\n    is violated by critical-level views in population ethics.\n    It does so by defining the terms and showing the logical contradiction\n    with a numerical example.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing Critical-Level Views vs. Arrhenius's Theorem\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Define Critical-Level Views\n    print(\"\\n[1] Defining Critical-Level Views:\")\n    print(\"A critical-level view posits that the value of adding a person to a population is their welfare level (w) minus a fixed 'critical level' (c).\")\n    print(\"The equation for the value contributed by one person is: Value = w - c.\")\n    print(\"A life is only considered a positive addition if w > c.
