# The provided code foo(n) is computationally infeasible to run directly.
# Analysis reveals that foo(n) counts the number of binary operations on the set {1, ..., n}
# that satisfy the axioms of a group.

# The problem is therefore to find the number of distinct group structures on a labeled set of size 7.

# Step 1: Identify the groups of order 7.
# A group of prime order p is always cyclic and isomorphic to C_p.
# Since 7 is a prime number, there is only one group structure of order 7 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C_7.

# Step 2: Count the number of ways to label this group.
# For a given group G of order n, the number of distinct multiplication tables on a labeled set
# of n elements is given by the formula: n! / |Aut(G)|, where |Aut(G)| is the size of the
# automorphism group of G.

# Step 3: Calculate the size of the automorphism group of C_7.
# The size of the automorphism group of the cyclic group C_n is given by Euler's totient function, phi(n).
# For a prime number p, phi(p) = p - 1.
n = 7
aut_g_size = n - 1  # phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6

# Step 4: Calculate n!
n_factorial = math.factorial(n)

# Step 5: Compute the final result.
result = n_factorial // aut_g_size

# Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
print(f"The number of group structures is n! / |Aut(C_n)|")
print(f"For n=7, this is 7! / phi(7)")
print(f"{n_factorial} / {aut_g_size} = {result}")
