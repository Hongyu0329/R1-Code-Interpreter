    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** First, I will determine the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A barbell graph is formed by connecting two identical complete graphs with a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\" edge. For 10 total nodes, this means we have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (`K_5`).\n2.  **Understand the Gossiping Process:** I will model the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" process. In this process, a node `i` is selected uniformly at random from the total `N` nodes, and then it selects one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random. The edge `(i, j)` is thus \"sampled\".\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The probability of an edge being sampled depends on the degrees of its endpoint nodes. I will calculate the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Each of these nodes is connected to 4 other nodes within its own `K_5` and 1 node (the other end of the bottleneck) in the other `K_5`, giving them a degree of 5.\n4.  **Formulate the Probability:** The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is the sum of two mutually exclusive events:\n    *   Node `u` is chosen (with probability `1/N`), and it then chooses neighbor `v` (with probability `1/degree(u)`).\n    *   Node `v` is chosen (with probability `1/N`), and it then chooses neighbor `u` (with probability `1/degree(v)`).\n    The total probability is `P(u, v) = (1/N) * (1/d(u)) + (1/N) * (1/d(v))`.\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer:** I will write a Python script that plugs the calculated values (`N=10`, `d(u)=5`, `d(v)=5`) into the formula to compute the final probability. The script will print the steps of the calculation and the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the total number of nodes in the barbell graph.\ntotal_nodes = 10\n\n# A barbell graph with 10 nodes is constructed from two identical complete graphs (K_k)\n# connected by a single edge.
