# Define the total number of nodes in the barbell graph.
total_nodes = 10

# A barbell graph with 10 nodes is constructed from two identical complete graphs (K_k)
# connected by a single edge. The total number of nodes is 2*k.
# For N=10, we have 2*k = 10, which means k=5.
# So, the graph consists of two K_5 graphs.
k = total_nodes // 2

# Let the bottleneck edge be (u, v), where 'u' is in the first K_5 and 'v' is in the second K_5.
# We need to calculate the degrees of these two nodes.

# In a complete graph K_k, any node is connected to all other k-1 nodes.
# So, within its own K_5, node 'u' is connected to k-1 = 4 nodes.
degree_within_complete_graph = k - 1

# The total degree of node 'u' is its connections within its K_5 plus the single
# connection across the bottleneck edge to node 'v'.
degree_u = degree_within_complete_graph + 1
degree_v = degree_within_complete_graph + 1

# The probability of sampling a specific edge (i, j) during one round of randomized uniform
# gossiping is P(i,j) = P(pick i) * P(i picks j) + P(pick j) * P(j picks i).
# Since nodes are picked uniformly, P(pick node) = 1 / total_nodes.
# Since neighbors are picked uniformly, P(node i picks j) = 1 / degree(i).

# So, P(bottleneck) = (1/N) * (1/d(u)) + (1/N) * (1/d(v))
prob_bottleneck = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u) + (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)
