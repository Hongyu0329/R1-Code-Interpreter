    # Explanation of the answer based on theoretical group and dessin theory:
    # (a) A group G acting quasiprimitively on a set F implies its socle N is transitive on F.
    #     The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F. Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit.
    #     Thus, D_N has one face and is unicellular.
    # (b) Groups of all three types (HA, TW, AS) are known to be generatable by two elements
    #     and can be automorphism groups of regular dessins. The smooth covering property imposes
    #     further constraints, but examples exist for all three types where these are met.
    # (c) The statement implies that for ALL T and l <= 5, a smooth covering is impossible.
    #     A counterexample proves this false. For G = PSL(2,17) wr Z_5, the Schur multiplier
    #     of PSL(2,17) is trivial, which is a sufficient condition for a smooth covering to exist.
