  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

    "Of course, I can help with this. The task has two parts: providing a script to solve the sum rearrangement problem and analyzing the memory usage of an optimal C program for the same task.\n\nFirst, I will explain the plan for designing the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage, `m`. Then, I will provide a Python script that you can execute to solve the sum rearrangement problem itself.\n\n### C Program Memory Efficiency Analysis\n\nTo create the most memory-efficient C program, the key is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory. A better approach is to process the input character by character.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Input Processing:** Read the input one character at a time using the `getchar()` function. This avoids allocating a large buffer (e.g., `char s[1001]`).\n2.  **Sorting:** Since the numbers are only from a small set (1, 2, 3, 4), the most efficient sorting method is Counting Sort. We don't need to store the numbers at all. Instead, we can simply maintain a count for each number encountered.\n3.  **Output Generation:** After counting all the numbers from the input stream, we can loop through our counts (first for '1's, then '2's, etc.) and print the sorted sum. A simple flag can be used to ensure '+' is only printed between numbers.\n\n**Variable Memory Calculation (`m`):**\nTo implement this plan, the C program would need the following variables:\n*   **Four integer counters:** To store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (e.g., `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`). Assuming an `int` is 4 bytes, this is `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n*   **One integer for `getchar()`:** The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the end-of-file (EOF) marker. This variable takes `1 * 4 = 4` bytes.\n*   **One integer for a flag:** A flag variable is needed to handle the logic of printing the '+' symbol correctly (i.e., not before the first number). This is `1 * 4 = 4` bytes.\n*   **One integer for loops:** A single loop counter variable can be reused for printing the numbers. This is `1 * 4 = 4` bytes.\n\nTotal memory `m` = (counters) + (getchar variable) + (flag) + (loop counter) = `16 + 4 + 4 + 4` = `28` bytes.\n\n### Python Solution\n\nHere is a simple and effective Python script to solve Xenia's sum problem as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum like \"1+3+2\", sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the sum from standard input\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # The sum contains numbers separated by '+'. We extract them.\n    summands = s.split('+')\n    \n    # Sort the numbers in non-decreasing order.\n    # Since they are single digits, lexicographical sort is equivalent to numerical sort.\n    summands.sort()\n    \n    # Join the sorted numbers back together with '+' to form the new sum.\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(summands)\n    \n    # Print the final rearranged sum. The problem states to output each number\n    # in the final equation.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
