# Given values
alpha = 10**16
# R is given as ln(100/99)
R = math.log(100/99)

# According to the solvability analysis, t0 is derived from the relation
# t0 * (exp(R) - 1) = alpha
# Therefore, t0 = alpha / (exp(R) - 1)

# Calculate exp(R)
exp_R = math.exp(R)

# Calculate the denominator (exp(R) - 1)
denominator = exp_R - 1

# Calculate t0
t0 = alpha / denominator

# The final equation is t0 = alpha / (e^R - 1)
# We can print the values used in the equation
print(f"The equation for t0 is: t0 = alpha / (exp(R) - 1)")
