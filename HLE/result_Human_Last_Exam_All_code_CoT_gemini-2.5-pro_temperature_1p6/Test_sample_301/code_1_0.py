def print_relationship():

    This function prints the derived relationship between [F] and [B].
    The relationship is derived by following the most direct metabolic path:
    [B] -> Malonyl-CoA -> Acetyl-CoA -> Pyruvate -> [F]
    The rate constants for this path are k2, k3, k4, and k5.
    Therefore, [F] is proportional to [B] * k2 * k3 * k4 * k5.
