# The problem asks to determine how many of a list of seven properties must always be true for a set S,
# derived from a function f with specific characteristics.

# Step 1: Analyze the function f and the set S.
# The function f: R^n -> R^m has the property that for every point x, it preserves distances from x in a small neighborhood around x.
# This means for any x in R^n, there exists an epsilon > 0 such that for all y with ||x-y|| < epsilon, we have ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||x-y||.
# This property is known as being a "local radial isometry" at every point.
#
# The set S is defined as the set of points x for which f acts as a true isometry on a neighborhood of x.
# That is, for an x in S, there exists an epsilon > 0 such that for all y and z with ||x-y|| < epsilon and ||x-z|| < epsilon, we have ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||y-z||.

# Step 2: Deduce the form of the function f.
# A key mathematical result (related to the Mazur-Ulam theorem) is that a map on a convex subset of R^n (like an open ball)
# that preserves distances must be an affine isometry. The property of f implies that for each x, the map g(h) = f(x+h) - f(x)
# is a radial isometry from the origin on a small ball. This in turn implies g(h) is a linear isometry, meaning g(h) = U_x * h
# for some orthogonal matrix U_x.
# This means that f is differentiable at every x, and its derivative Df_x is the orthogonal matrix U_x.
#
# Next, we can show that the map x -> Df_x is locally constant. For two nearby points x_0 and x_1, the neighborhoods where f
# is an isometry (and thus has a constant derivative) must overlap, forcing their derivatives to be identical, i.e., Df_{x_0} = Df_{x_1}.
# Since R^n is a connected space, a function defined on it that is locally constant must be globally constant.
# Therefore, Df_x = U for all x in R^n for some fixed orthogonal matrix U.
# Integrating this constant derivative shows that f must be a global affine isometry of the form f(x) = Ux + b, where b is a constant vector.

# Step 3: Identify the set S.
# If f is a global isometry, then for any x in R^n, the condition for belonging to S is satisfied.
# For any x, we can choose any epsilon > 0, and for all y, z in the ball B(x, epsilon), we will have ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||U(y-z)|| = ||y-z||.
# Thus, every point in R^n belongs to S. The set S is the entire space, S = R^n.

# Step 4: Evaluate the seven properties for S = R^n.
# The question is how many properties "must always be true", which means they must hold for any valid dimension n >= 0.
