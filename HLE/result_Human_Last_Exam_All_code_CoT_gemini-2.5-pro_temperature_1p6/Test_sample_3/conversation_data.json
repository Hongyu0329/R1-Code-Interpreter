    "To solve this problem, we need to consult the classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. The field in question is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is a quadratic field with discriminant $d = -3$.\n\nA key result in this area, largely due to the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and Najman, provides a complete list of all possible torsion subgroup structures that can occur over any quadratic field. A non-cyclic torsion subgroup has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_2 > 1$ and $n_1 | n_2$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure containing the known possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields. For each group, we'll store its structure, its total order, and the specific quadratic fields (identified by the discriminant $d$ of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$) where it is known to occur. Some groups can occur over many fields, while others are restricted to only one or a few.\n2.  Define our target field by its discriminant, $d = -3$.\n3.  Iterate through the list of known torsion groups.\n4.  For each group, check if it can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n5.  Keep track of the maximum order found among all groups possible over our target field.\n6.  Once the maximum order is found, print the group structure and the calculation of its order.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the largest order.\n\n```python\ndef solve_elliptic_curve_torsion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    This is based on the known classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data from the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\n    # We list non-cyclic groups, their structure (n1, n2), their order, and\n    # the discriminants 'd' of the fields Q(sqrt(d)) where they can occur.\n    # 'many' indicates the group can occur for Q(sqrt(-3)).
