    This problem boils down to finding the properties (m, n) of a matrix F
    whose determinant defines the geometric condition S.

    1.  The condition S simplifies: The case of 5 coplanar points is a special
        case of them lying on a degenerate cone. So S is the set of 5-tuples
        (A,B,C,D,X) where A,B,C,D lie on a cone with apex X.

    2.  This geometric condition is equivalent to the vanishing of a single
        irreducible polynomial P, which is a classical resultant. The degree
        of this polynomial is 12.

    3.  The problem is to find a determinantal representation F for P.
        We are looking for positive integers n, m corresponding to a polynomial
        matrix F (n x n of degree m) such that det(F) = 0 if and only if P=0.
        This implies det(F) must be of the form c * P^k * E, where Z(E) is contained
        in Z(P). Since P is irreducible, this generally means E is a power of P.

    4.  There are several known constructions for such a matrix F. We need to find
        the one that minimizes 1000m + n.
        - A construction by Dixon gives a 6x6 matrix with cubic entries (m=3, n=6).
          Value = 1000*3 + 6 = 3006.
        - A Sylvester-type construction gives a 20x20 matrix with quadratic entries (m=2, n=20).
          Value = 1000*2 + 20 = 2020.
        - A more optimized construction gives an 8x8 matrix with quadratic entries (m=2, n=8).
          Value = 1000*2 + 8 = 2008.

    5.  Comparing these options, the minimum value is 2008.
