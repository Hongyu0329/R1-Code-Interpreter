    "My plan is to identify the correct character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* based on the provided question.\n\n1.  I will analyze the main characters and their personalities as portrayed in the film.\n2.  I will recall or research specific scenes and dialogue related to Earth, nostalgia, and nature.\n3.  The opening scene of the film is critical, as it establishes the protagonist Kris Kelvin's connection to the natural world on Earth before he departs for the Solaris station.\n4.  Later in the film, while on the sterile space station, Kris has conversations where he reflects on his memories of Earth. He specifically expresses a feeling of shame for having forgotten or taken for granted simple sensory experiences, such as the rustling of leaves.\n5.  Based on this, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the correct character.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the character from the 1972 film 'Solaris' who misses the sound of rustling leaves.\n# This sentiment is expressed by the main character, psychologist Kris Kelvin.\n# The film contrasts his memories of Earth's lush nature with the cold, artificial environment of the space station.\n# In a moment of vulnerability and nostalgia, Kris confesses his shame at having forgotten such a fundamental sound from his home.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Kris\"\n\n# Printing the final answer.\nprint(f\"The character from the 1972 film Solaris who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is {character_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
