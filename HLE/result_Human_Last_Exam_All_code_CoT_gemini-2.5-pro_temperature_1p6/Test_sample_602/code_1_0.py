    This function calculates the exact value of ell(n) based on the definitions provided.
    
    The plan is implemented as follows:
    1. The matrix P_n is analyzed. Its inverse Q = f^(3)(P_n) is found to be a simple tridiagonal matrix: Q_ii = 2, Q_{i,iÂ±1} = 1.
    2. The projection X = f_M^(2)(Q) is expressed as Q - M_n * D, where D is a diagonal matrix with entries d_j = [M_n^T Q]_jj.
    3. The function ell(n) = f^(1)(X) sums the first and last rows of X. This simplifies to f^(1)(Q) - f^(1)(M_n D).
    4. f^(1)(Q) evaluates to (Q_11+Q_12) + (Q_n,n-1 + Q_nn) = (2+1)+(1+2) = 6.
    5. f^(1)(M_n D) evaluates to 2 * S_MD, where S_MD is a helper sum depending on n.
    6. The final simplified formula for ell(n) is computed.
