    print(f"1. Control Systemic Conditions: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c = {hba1c}%), which severely compromises healing and increases infection risk. A medical consultation is essential to manage blood glucose.")
    print(f"2. Address Delayed Presentation ({delay_hours} hours): The significant delay increases infection risk. The wounds must be thoroughly cleaned. Prophylactic antibiotics are likely required due to the patient's diabetes.")
    print(f"3. Manage Skeletal Prognathism: An SNB angle of {snb_angle}Â° indicates a prognathic mandible (skeletal Class III). This affects the bite (occlusion) and is a critical factor for any future prosthetic design.")

    print("\n--- CELLS OF INTEREST IN HEALING ---")
    print("The healing process in the traumatized tooth sockets involves a complex interplay of various cells:")
    print("- Inflammatory Cells: Neutrophils and Macrophages clean the site of debris and bacteria.")
    print("- Fibroblasts: Produce collagen to form granulation tissue, the scaffold for new tissue.")
    print("- Osteoblasts: Bone-forming cells that rebuild the alveolar bone in the socket.")
    print("- Osteoclasts: Bone-resorbing cells that remodel the socket during healing.")
    print("\n*Note: The patient's high blood sugar negatively impacts the function of all these cells, leading to delayed and compromised healing.*")

    print("\n--- PHASE 2: PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT (DENTURE OPTION) ---")

    print("\nRecommended Initial Option: Removable Partial Denture (RPD)")

    print("- Denture Type & Material: Initially, a temporary acrylic RPD can be used. For a long-term solution, a cast metal framework (Chrome-Cobalt) with acrylic teeth and saddles is recommended. It is more hygienic, rigid, and supportive than a flexible plastic denture.")
