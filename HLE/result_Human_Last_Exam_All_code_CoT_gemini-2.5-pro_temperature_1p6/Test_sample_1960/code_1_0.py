    # f(w) is a tensor product of clauses, one for each bin k and each possible starting sum i.

    # The goal formula C states that if we start with m empty bins (each with sum 0),
    # we can, by applying the transformations from all f(w) resources,
    # end up with m full bins. Since a full bin has sum b, which is 0 mod b,
    # the start and end configurations are the same.
