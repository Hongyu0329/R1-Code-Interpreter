    # A key theorem by D. P. Bellamy (1992) states that for any indecomposable
    # continuum X and any point x in X, the Stone-Cech remainder,
    # Î²(X \ {x}) \ (X \ {x}), has at most two connected components.

    # To prove that 2 is the maximum, we need to show that there exists at least
    # one case where the number of components is exactly 2.
    # We use the pseudo-arc, a classic example of a HIMC, for this.
    # The pseudo-arc is known to have 'cut points' - points whose removal
    # disconnects the space.

    # From Step 1, we know N <= 2.
    # From Step 2, we know a case exists where N >= 2.
