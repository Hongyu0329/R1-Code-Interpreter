    "This problem is a question in the field of point-set topology, specifically dealing with the properties of continua and their compactifications. To solve this, we will follow a logical deduction based on established theorems rather than a direct computation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** We will use a known theorem from the mathematical literature that provides an upper limit on the number of components for the Stone-Cech remainder in this specific scenario.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound (Achievability):** We will show that this upper bound can be reached. To do this, we'll use a specific example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum (the pseudo-arc) and a specific choice of point within it.\n3.  **Conclusion:** By showing that the number of components is less than or equal to a certain number `N`, and that `N` is achievable, we can conclude that `N` is the maximum possible number.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the logical steps to determine the maximum\n    possible number of components of the Stone-Cech remainder of a\n    hereditary indecomposable metric continuum (HIMC) with one point removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the maximum number of components (or 'composants') of the Stone-Cech remainder of X \\\\ {x}, where X is a HIMC.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish an upper bound on the number of components.\n    # A key theorem by D.
