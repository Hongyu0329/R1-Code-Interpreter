    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework:**\n    *   First, I will establish the connection between the rank of a quantum channel's complementary channel and the rank of its Choi matrix. The Stinespring factorization theorem tells us that these two ranks are equal.\n    *   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional qudit system is defined by the action of generalized Pauli operators $U_{ij} = X^i Z^j$ with probabilities $p_{ij}$, where $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} U_{ij} \\rho U_{ij}^\\dagger$.\n    *   The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ is given by $(id \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\phi^+\\rangle \\langle \\phi^+|)$, where $|\\phi^+\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state. Its rank depends on the probabilities $p_{ij}$.\n    *   To find the *maximal* rank, we need to choose the probabilities $p_{ij}$ to include as many linearly independent terms as possible. This corresponds to the case where all $p_{ij} > 0$. The problem then reduces to finding the number of linearly independent vectors that form the Choi matrix.\n    *   These vectors are of the form $|\\psi_{ij}\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle \\otimes U_{ij}|k\\rangle$. I have shown through theoretical analysis that these $d^2$ vectors are mutually orthogonal, and therefore linearly independent. The maximal rank is thus $d^2$.\n\n2.  **Computational Verification:**\n    *   To verify this result using code, I will write a Python script that numerically constructs these $d^2$ vectors, $|\\psi_{ij}\\rangle$, for a qudit of a specific dimension `d`.\n    *   I will then form a matrix where each column is one of these vectors. The size of this matrix will be $d^2 \\times d^2$.\n    *   Finally, I will compute the rank of this matrix using `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`.\n    *   The expected result is $d^2$, which will confirm the theoretical derivation. I will use `d=4` as a non-trivial example.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the verification.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a d-dimensional\n    Pauli channel by constructing the relevant vector space and finding its dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's choose a dimension 'd' for the qudit system as an example.\n    # The result holds for any integer d >= 2. We'll use d=4.\n    d = 4\n\n    # The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is d^2.\n    # This is because the Choi matrix of a generic Pauli channel (with all non-zero\n    # probabilities) is supported on a space spanned by d^2 orthogonal vectors.\n    # These vectors are the generalized Bell basis states.\n    \n    # We will now numerically verify this by constructing these d^2 vectors\n    # and computing the rank of the matrix formed by them.\n    \n    # Define the primitive d-th root of unity\n    omega = np.exp(2j * np.pi / d)\n    \n    # The vectors that span the support of the Choi matrix are of the form:\n    # |psi_ij> = sum_{k=0}^{d-1} omega^(j*k) |k> |(k+i) mod d>\n    \n    # Let's construct these d*d vectors. Each vector has d*d components.\n    psi_vectors = []\n    for i in range(d):\n        for j in range(d):\n            # Initialize a zero vector in the d*d dimensional space\n            psi_ij = np.zeros(d*d, dtype=np.complex128)\n            for k in range(d):\n                # The basis state |k> |m> corresponds to index k*d + m\n                # Here, m = (k+i) mod d\n                index = k * d + (k + i) % d\n                psi_ij[index] = omega**(j * k)\n            psi_vectors.append(psi_ij)\n            \n    # Create a matrix M where the columns are the vectors |psi_ij>\n    # The .T is because numpy treats list of lists as rows by default.\n    M = np.array(psi_vectors).T\n\n    # The number of linearly independent vectors is the rank of matrix M.\n    maximal_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)\n    \n    # The final equation is Maximal Rank = d^2\n    d_squared = d**2\n\n    # Print out the results and the final equation\n    print(f\"For a qudit system of dimension d = {d}:\")\n    print(f\"The maximal rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the space spanned by the {d*d} generalized Bell basis vectors.\")\n    print(f\"We construct these vectors and compute the rank of the matrix they form.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The rank computed from the matrix is: {maximal_rank}\")\n    print(f\"The theoretical value is d^2 = {d_squared}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"Maximal Rank = d * d = {d_squared}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_pauli_channel_rank()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
