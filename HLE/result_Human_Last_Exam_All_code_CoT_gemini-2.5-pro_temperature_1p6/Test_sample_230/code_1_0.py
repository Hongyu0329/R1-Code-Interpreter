    # --- Step 1: Understand the Properties ---
    # The magma M has the base properties:
    # P1: Idempotent: x*x = x
    # P2: Commutative: x*y = y*x
    # P3: Left Self-Distributive (LSD): x*(y*z) = (x*y)*(x*z)
    #
    # The question is about two other properties:
    # R_n: n-cancellable: a^n * b = b => a = b
    # Q: Medial: (w*x)*(y*z) = (w*y)*(x*z)
    #
    # We want to find for which n > 0 does (P1, P2, P3, and R_n) => Q.

    # --- Step 2: Logical Deduction ---
    # There is an established theorem in the study of groupoids which states that
    # the base properties alone are sufficient to imply the medial property.
    # Theorem: Any idempotent, commutative, and left self-distributive magma is medial.
    # In our notation: (P1 AND P2 AND P3) => Q.
    #
    # If this theorem is true, then by a fundamental rule of logic, adding another premise
    # does not falsify the implication. If P implies Q, then (P AND R) must also imply Q.
    # Therefore, (P1, P2, P3, and R_n) => Q for ALL positive integers n.
    # The condition of n-cancellability is superfluous.

    # --- Step 3: Computational Verification ---
    # To be confident in this theorem, we can write a program to search for a
    # counterexample among small finite magmas. A counterexample would be a magma
    # that has properties P1, P2, and P3, but not Q.
