    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\nMy plan is to use the principles of statistical mechanics for a Bose gas (photons) to derive the equilibrium mean energy and entropy. The connection to large deviation theory, as mentioned in the prompt, is that the equilibrium state found by maximizing entropy is the most probable macroscopic state. This is conceptually equivalent to minimizing the large deviation rate function, which in statistical mechanics is proportional to the negative of the entropy.\n\n1.  **Define the System**: I will model the photons using the Bose-Einstein distribution, which is appropriate for bosons. Since photon number is not conserved, their chemical potential is zero. I will also use the standard formula for the density of states `g(e)` for electromagnetic waves in a 3D cavity.\n2.  **Calculate Mean Energy `<E>`**: I will set up the integral for the mean energy, which is defined as `<E> = âˆ« e * n(e) * g(e) de`, where `n(e)` is the Bose-Einstein distribution. The python code will use the `sympy` library to represent these physical expressions symbolically.\n3.  **Solve for `<E>`**: The code will demonstrate how this integral is solved. It simplifies to a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, ultimately resulting in the famous Stefan-Boltzmann energy law.\n4.  **Calculate Entropy `S`**: To find the entropy, I will use the established thermodynamic relationship for a photon gas, `S = (4/3) * <E> / T`. This avoids a more complex direct integration of the statistical entropy formula and follows from the fundamental thermodynamic relations derived from the system's partition function.\n5.  **Output the Equations**: The final script will print the step-by-step derivation and the final, simplified equations for both the mean energy `<E>` and the entropy `S`. As requested, it will explicitly detail the numerical constants and powers present in the final formulas.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy of a photon gas\n    using principles of statistical mechanics, as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants and variables as symbols for symbolic manipulation\n    V, T, k_B, h, c = sympy.symbols('V T k_B h c', positive=True, real=True)\n    e, x = sympy.symbols('e x', positive=True, real=True)\n\n    # In statistical mechanics, beta is a convenient shorthand for 1/(k_B*T)\n    beta = 1 / (k_B * T)\n\n    # --- Part 1: Derivation of Equilibrium Mean Energy <E> ---\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Mean Energy <E>\")\n    print(\"=\" * 45)\n    print(\"The equilibrium state maximizes entropy, which corresponds to the Bose-Einstein distribution.\")\n    \n    # The density of states g(e) for photons in a 3D cavity of volume V\n    g_e = (8 * sympy.pi * V / (h**3 * c**3)) * e**2\n    print(\"\\n1.
