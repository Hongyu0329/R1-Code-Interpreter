# Step 1: Deconstruct the Original Recipe
original_total_sauce_ml = 750
eggs = 6
original_displacement_per_egg_ml = 45
original_total_displacement_ml = eggs * original_displacement_per_egg_ml
original_base_sauce_ml = original_total_sauce_ml - original_total_displacement_ml

# Step 2: Calculate New Egg Displacement
egg_size_increase_factor = 1.12  # 12% larger
new_displacement_per_egg_ml = original_displacement_per_egg_ml * egg_size_increase_factor
new_total_displacement_ml = eggs * new_displacement_per_egg_ml

# Step 3: Identify the Baseline
# The problem states 180ml is the baseline for the new calculation.
baseline_ml = 180

# Step 4: Calculate the Sauce Adjustment
# Viscosity increases by 3/7, leading to a reduction in required volume.
# This corresponds to a logarithmic factor related to ln(1 + 3/7) = ln(10/7).
viscosity_factor = 1 + 3/7

# Surface tension decreases by 2/9, requiring an increase in volume for support.
# The effect is related to the inverse of the change, ln(1 / (1 - 2/9)) = ln(9/7).
tension_effect_factor = 1 / (1 - 2/9)

# The problem states a logarithmic relationship. The net adjustment factor
# in the log domain is ln(tension_effect_factor) - ln(viscosity_factor) = ln(tension_effect_factor / viscosity_factor).
# This gives ln((9/7)/(10/7)) = ln(9/10)
net_log_adjustment_factor = math.log(tension_effect_factor / viscosity_factor)

# This adjustment is applied to the original base sauce volume.
sauce_adjustment_ml = original_base_sauce_ml * net_log_adjustment_factor

# Step 5: Calculate the Final Volume
# The final volume is the baseline + new displacement + sauce adjustment.
final_sauce_volume_ml = baseline_ml + new_total_displacement_ml + sauce_adjustment_ml

# Output the equation with each number, as requested.
