    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1. This information is based on the comprehensive data provided by Eckard Specht on his \"Packomania\" website, which is a widely recognized and authoritative resource for the best-known circle packings.\n\nOn the webpage \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\", a table lists the properties of these packings for a large number of circles (N). For each N, the table provides details such as the radius of the circles, the packing density, and the symmetry group of the arrangement in Schoenflies notation. For N = 1135, the corresponding entry for the symmetry group is empty. According to the legend on the website, if the symmetry group field is empty, it signifies a C_1 symmetry. A C_1 symmetry group means that the arrangement has no rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
