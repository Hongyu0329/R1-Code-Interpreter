    "## Double Branched Cover of a Twist-Spun Trefoil: Unraveling Its Fundamental Group\n\n**The minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is two.**\n\nThis result is derived from an analysis of the algebraic structure of the knot and its corresponding branched cover. The process involves determining the fundamental group of the knot's complement in the 4-sphere and then taking a specific quotient of this group to find the fundamental group of the double branched cover.\n\nThe 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a 2-dimensional knot embedded in the 4-dimensional sphere. Its fundamental group, which is the fundamental group of the complement of the knot in S⁴, can be described by a presentation related to the trefoil knot group. The trefoil knot group is given by the presentation `<a, b | aba = bab>`. For the 5-twist-spun version, a third generator, 't', is introduced, which relates to the twisting operation. The fundamental group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil's complement is given by `<a, b, t | aba = bab, t⁵ = a>`.\n\nIn the study of 2-knots, the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the knot is obtained by taking the knot group and factoring by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element. A meridian for the twist-spun trefoil corresponds to the generator 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the double branched cover, which we can call Γ, is given by the presentation:\n\nΓ = `<a, b, t | aba = bab, t⁵ = a, a² = 1>`\n\nThis presentation can be simplified. Since `a = t⁵`, we can substitute 'a' in the other relations. The relation `a² = 1` implies `(t⁵)² = 1`, which means `t¹⁰ = 1`. The relation `aba = bab` becomes `(t⁵)b(t⁵) = b(t⁵)b`. With these substitutions, the generator 'a' becomes redundant, and the group Γ can be described with just two generators, 'b' and 't':\n\nΓ = `<b, t | (t⁵)b(t⁵) = b(t⁵)b, t¹⁰ = 1>`\n\nThis shows that the group can be generated by at most two elements. To determine if this is the minimal number of generators, we must check if the group can be generated by a single element. A group generated by a single element is, by definition, a cyclic group, and all cyclic groups are abelian (their elements commute).\n\nWe can test if Γ is abelian. If 'b' and 't' were to commute, the primary relation `(t⁵)b(t⁵) = b(t⁵)b` would simplify to `t¹⁰b = t⁵b²`. Given that `t¹⁰ = 1`, this would imply `b = t⁵b²`, and further `t⁵b = 1`, leading to `b = t⁻⁵ = t⁵`. If 'b' is a power of 't', the entire group would be generated by 't' alone. However, the relation `(t⁵)b(t⁵) = b(t⁵)b` does not, in general, force 'b' and 't' to commute.\n\nIn fact, the group Γ is non-abelian. It is possible to construct a homomorphism from Γ to the symmetric group on three elements, S₃, which is a non-abelian group. This demonstrates that Γ itself cannot be abelian. As a non-abelian group, Γ cannot be cyclic and therefore cannot be generated by a single element.\n\nSince the fundamental group Γ can be generated by two elements, and it cannot be generated by one, the minimal number of generators is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
