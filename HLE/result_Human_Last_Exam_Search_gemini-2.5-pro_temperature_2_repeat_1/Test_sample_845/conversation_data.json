    "The value computed as the time between successive heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is most commonly called the **interbeat interval (IBI)** or **R-R interval**.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   **Interbeat interval (IBI)** is the general term for the time period between consecutive heartbeats.\n*   **R-R interval** refers to the time elapsed between two successive R-waves, which are the prominent peaks on an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. This is considered a gold standard for HRV measurement.\n*   When derived from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, the time between pulses is also referred to as the inter-beat interval (IBI) or sometimes as the P-P interval.\n\nThese intervals, measured in milliseconds, are not constant and the variation in their duration is what constitutes Heart Rate Variability.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI) or R-R interval>>>"
