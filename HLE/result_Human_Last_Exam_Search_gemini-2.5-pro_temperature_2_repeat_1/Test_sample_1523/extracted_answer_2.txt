The inner product (ϕ,D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is given by the kinetic and mass part of the Euclidean action. Explicitly, it is ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x)(-∂_E² + m²)ϕ(x), where ∂_E² is the Euclidean Laplacian, m is the mass of the scalar field, and the integration is over the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime with the time dimension being compactified with period β = 1/T.
