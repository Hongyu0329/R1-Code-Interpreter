    "The structure of the molecule is `1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene`. This molecule possesses a three-fold (C3) axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large substituents chemically equivalent. Consequently, the ¹H NMR signals from each of the three identical \"arms\" will overlap perfectly. To determine the number of peaks, we only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons on the central ring and within one of the substituent arms.\n\nThe analysis of distinct proton environments is as follows:\n\n**1. Central Aromatic Core:**\n*   **Aromatic Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. This results in a single signal for these nine protons. (1 Peak)\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (-CH₂-):** The three methylene groups connect the central ring to each of the chiral indazole substituents. The two protons within each methylene group are adjacent to a chiral system and are therefore diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. This gives two separate signals for the six methylene protons. (2 Peaks)\n\n**2. One Substituent Arm:** The substituent is a `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` group, which is a chiral and rigid structure derived from camphor.\n*   **Indazole Ring Proton:** There is a single proton on the pyrazole portion of the indazole ring system (at position C3). (1 Peak)\n*   **Camphor Framework Protons:**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H):** There is one proton at the C4 bridgehead position. (1 Peak)\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C5-H₂):** The two protons at the C5 position are diastereotopic (endo and exo) in the rigid bicyclic system. (2 Peaks)\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C6-H₂):** Similarly, the two protons at the C6 position are diastereotopic. (2 Peaks)\n    *   **C7-Methyl Group:** There is one methyl group attached to the C7 chiral center. (1 Peak)\n    *   **C8-gem-Dimethyl Groups:** The two methyl groups at the C8 position are geminal and are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the molecule. (2 Peaks)\n\n**Total Number of Peaks:**\nSumming up the signals from all the non-equivalent protons:\n1 (Ar-CH₃) + 2 (Ar-CH₂-N) + 1 (Indazole-H) + 1 (C4-H) + 2 (C5-H₂) + 2 (C6-H₂) + 1 (C7-CH₃) + 2 (C8-Me₂) = **12 peaks**.\n\n<<<H>>>"
