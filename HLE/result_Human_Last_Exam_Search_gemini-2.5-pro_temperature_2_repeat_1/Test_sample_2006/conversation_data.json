    "The haiku \"The Bays\" provides a series of clues that, when deciphered, reveal a specific narrative from which the answer can be drawn. The key to unraveling this riddle lies in identifying the biblical story of Samson.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the haiku's connection to the story of Samson found in the Book of Judges, chapter 14:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This line metaphorically refers to the destructive and powerful nature of Samson, whose birth was foretold by an angel and who was empowered by a \"divine\" spirit.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This points to the thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes that Samson wagered with thirty Philistine companions at his wedding feast. This wager set in motion a series of transformative and violent events.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This references the yielding of Samson's wife to the pressure of the Philistine companions. She coaxed the answer to Samson's riddle from him, which he had declared would be impossible to solve otherwise. He famously retorted, \"If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle”.\n\nThe title \"The Bays\" is a pun for \"The B's\". The answer to the riddle lies in the two central elements of Samson's own riddle: bees and a lion. The alphabetical answer, therefore, is derived from the subjects of Samson's famous riddle.\n\n<<<Bees, Lion>>>"
