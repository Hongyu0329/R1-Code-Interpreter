The number of Tverberg partitions of X is given by the combinatorial formula for partitioning a set of n elements into r unlabeled subsets of sizes `a_1, ..., a_r`. Let `{s_1, ..., s_k}` be the distinct values among the partition sizes `{a_1, ..., a_r}`, and let `m_j` be the number of times the size `s_j` appears in the partition. The number of Tverberg partitions is given by the formula: `n! / ( (Π_{i=1 to r} a_i!) * (Π_{j=1 to k} m_j!) )`
