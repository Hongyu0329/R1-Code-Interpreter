The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a single value and varies depending on the reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a higher nickel content, typically in the range of 7% to 12.5% (molar or weight percent), is generally favorable. For water splitting, the optimal ratio depends on the specific half-reaction; for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), higher Ni/Ce ratios of 1 and 3 have shown enhanced activity, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and overall water splitting, a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 has been identified as optimal in some studies.
