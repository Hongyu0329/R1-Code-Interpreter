    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles exhibit promising catalytic properties for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), with the ideal Ni/Ce ratio being crucial for maximizing performance. The optimal ratio, however, is not a single value but rather depends on the specific reaction, the presence of other dopants, and the synthesis method of the catalyst.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, a general trend shows that a higher nickel content tends to enhance catalytic activity. Studies on Ni/CeO₂-Al₂O₃ catalysts have shown that increasing the nickel loading from 1% to 8% by weight (w/w) leads to improved performance. Similarly, in another study focusing on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts, a 12.5 wt % Ni loading demonstrated the highest CO conversion at 400 °C, outperforming catalysts with 5 and 10 wt % Ni.\n\nIn the context of the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction, which is closely related, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been identified for Ni/La-doped CeO₂ catalysts. Furthermore, a study on Ni-W-Ce mixed oxide catalysts found that a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 0.28, displayed the highest catalytic activity. This suggests that while higher Ni content is generally beneficial, the presence of other elements can influence the optimal ratio.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is also not a single fixed value and can differ between the two half-reactions: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\nFor the **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)**, which is a critical part of water splitting, research on NiᵧCe₁₀₀₋ᵧOₓ electrocatalysts indicated that compositions of Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ (corresponding to Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, respectively) exhibit superior OER activities. This is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies and a larger electrochemically active surface area.\n\nFor the **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)** and overall water splitting, a study on Ni₃N-CeO₂ heterostructures identified that a sample with a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (Ni/Ce = 0.5) showed the best HER performance. When used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, this catalyst achieved a low cell voltage. Another study on Ni and Fe co-doped ceria for overall water splitting found excellent HER and OER activities with a high doping level of 20 mol% (with a 1:1 Ni:Fe ratio), which implies a Ni content of 10 mol% relative to the total cations.\n\nIn summary, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target application:\n*   For the **WGS reaction**, a higher nickel loading, in the range of 7% to 12.5% (molar or weight), generally appears to maximize catalytic performance.\n*   For **water splitting**, the ideal ratio varies. High Ni content (Ni/Ce ratios of 1 to 3) is beneficial for OER, whereas a more balanced ratio, such as a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5, has been found to be optimal for HER and overall water splitting.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a single value and varies depending on the reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a higher nickel content, typically in the range of 7% to 12.5% (molar or weight percent), is generally favorable. For water splitting, the optimal ratio depends on the specific half-reaction; for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), higher Ni/Ce ratios of 1 and 3 have shown enhanced activity, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and overall water splitting, a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 has been identified as optimal in some studies.>>>"
