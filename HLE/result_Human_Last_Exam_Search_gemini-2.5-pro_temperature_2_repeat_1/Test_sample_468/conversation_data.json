    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bees\". This name is widely used in both scientific and common contexts. Another common name for this genus is \"miner bees\".\n\nThe exact year the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not definitively documented in the search results. However, the term appears in scientific literature from at least 1958, in P.H. Timberlake's descriptions of species such as the \"six-spotted fairy bee (*Perdita sexmaculata*)\". Specific species are also referred to with this common name, for instance, the \"Precious Fairy Bee (*Perdita pretiosa*)\", \"Ainslie's Fairy Bee (*Perdita ainsliei*)\", and the \"Sandbar Willow Fairy Bee (*Perdita maculigera maculipennis*)\".\n\n<<<fairy bees, 1958>>>"
