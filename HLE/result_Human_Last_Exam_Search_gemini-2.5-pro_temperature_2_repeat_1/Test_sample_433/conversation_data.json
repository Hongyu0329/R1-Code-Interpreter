    "According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period of time. This means there is no established Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule once it has been opened, even within a sterile environment like an ISO Class 5 or cleaner primary engineering control.\n\nThe guidance for single-dose ampules is distinct from that for single-dose vials. While a single-dose vial that has been entered or punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, this does not apply to ampules. Once an ampule is opened, its contents must be used for a single patient in a single procedure, and any remaining portion must be discarded immediately.\n\nThis strict regulation for ampules is due to the fact that once opened, they cannot be resealed, which increases the risk of microbial contamination.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and may not be stored for any period.>>>"
