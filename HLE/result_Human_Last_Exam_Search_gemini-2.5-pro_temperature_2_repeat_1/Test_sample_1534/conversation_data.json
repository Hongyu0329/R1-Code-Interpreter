    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass (PSM), a collection of brain structures situated at the rear of the subesophageal mass. This region of the brain controls various motor actions in the more posterior part of the cuttlefish's body.\n\nThe posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) of the mantle, while the fin lobes control the movement of the fins. Given their location within the same posterior subesophageal mass and their roles in controlling adjacent body parts, these lobes are situated near the palliovisceral lobe, which itself is involved in escape movements and inking.\n\nA three-dimensional brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish visually confirms the close proximity of these lobes in a posterior view. The palliovisceral (or visceral) ganglion in *Sepia* species is described as consisting of a central palliovisceral lobe, a pair of lobes for the fins, and a pair of posterior chromatophore lobes, among others. This anatomical grouping places them adjacent to one another in the posterior region of the brain."
