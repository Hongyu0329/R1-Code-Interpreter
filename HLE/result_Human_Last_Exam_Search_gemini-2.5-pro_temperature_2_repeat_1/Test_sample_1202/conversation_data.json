    "After a gene duplication event, the two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is free to accumulate mutations without harming the organism. Several outcomes are possible for these duplicated genes.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization (B):** This is a very common fate, where one copy of the gene accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene\". While this represents a form of sequence divergence, it doesn't lead to the retention of two *functional* genes with different roles.\n*   **Gene conversion (A):** This is a recombination process where one sequence replaces another, making the two gene copies more similar. This mechanism works against divergence and promotes homogenization of the sequences.\n*   **Neofunctionalization (C):** In this process, one of the duplicated genes retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. Both genes are then preserved by natural selection because they perform different, important roles.\n*   **Subfunctionalization (D):** This occurs when the ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each gene copy specializes by losing different subfunctions through degenerative mutations. As a result, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. A well-known model for this is the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model.\n*   **Adaptive radiation (E):** This is a macroevolutionary process concerning the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for such an event, it is not a mechanism that operates on individual genes within a genome.\n\nComparing the valid mechanisms for both retention and divergence (neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization), subfunctionalization provides a compelling explanation for the high frequency of duplicate gene retention in genomes. The subfunctionalization (DDC) model proposes that retention can occur through neutral, complementary loss-of-function mutations, which are much more common than the rare, beneficial mutations required for a gene to acquire a completely new function (neofunctionalization). For this reason, subfunctionalization is considered a highly likely mechanism that secures the initial preservation of both gene copies, facilitating their long-term divergence. Some models even suggest subfunctionalization can be a transitional state that paves the way for later neofunctionalization. Therefore, it is a key mechanism responsible for both retaining duplicate genes and allowing them to diverge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
