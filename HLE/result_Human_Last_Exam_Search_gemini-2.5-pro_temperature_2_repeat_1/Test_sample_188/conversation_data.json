  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the most efficient way to encode the message. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the alphabet of the encrypted and decrypted messages.**\n    *   The decrypted secret message is written in the characters from the *Shu*. The problem states this alphabet consists of the 120 most common Chinese characters of that time.\n    *   The encrypted message is written in the symbols from the *Ching*. These are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbols. The yinyang-wuxing system is based on the combination of Yin and Yang (2 states) and the Five Elements (Wuxing: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). This creates 2 × 5 = 10 unique symbols (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire).\n\n2.  **Determine the encoding scheme.**\n    *   The problem is to find the maximum length of the secret message. To maximize the message's length (in characters), we need to use the minimum number of symbols from the *Ching* to represent each character of the *Shu*.\n    *   We have an alphabet of 120 characters to encode, using a system of 10 unique symbols. We need to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of unique sequences of `n` symbols is at least 120.\n    *   With `n` symbols, each of which can be one of 10 types, the number of possible unique combinations is 10ⁿ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum number of symbols per character.**\n    *   We must find the smallest `n` that satisfies the condition: 10ⁿ ≥ 120.\n    *   If n=1, we can represent 10¹ = 10 characters. This is less than 120.\n    *   If n=2, we can represent 10² = 100 characters. This is also less than 120.\n    *   If n=3, we can represent 10³ = 1000 characters. This is greater than 120, so it is sufficient.\n    *   Therefore, a minimum of 3 yinyang-wuxing symbols are required to uniquely encode each of the 120 Chinese characters.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum message length.**\n    *   The *Ching* contains a total of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the secret message requires 3 of these symbols for its encoding.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols available divided by the number of symbols needed per character.\n    *   Maximum message length = `floor(9999 / 3)` = 3333 characters.\n\nThe other information provided in the prompt—such as the total number of characters in the *Shu* (around 3000), the character recognition time (12 ms), and the computation time for operations (10 ns and 30 ns)—is extraneous data not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
