    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to create a deadbeat observer. The structure of such an observer is given by:\n\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C x̂(k))\n\nwhere x̂(k) is the estimated state, and L is the observer gain matrix we need to find.\n\nThe observation error is defined as e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k), and its dynamic behavior is described by the equation:\n\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor the error to be eliminated in the shortest possible time, all eigenvalues of the matrix (A - LC) must be placed at the origin (z=0) of the z-plane. This makes the matrix (A - LC) nilpotent. The shortest number of steps for the error to become zero is determined by the observability index (ν) of the system pair (A, C).\n\nFirst, let's determine the observability of the system and its observability index. The observability matrix is constructed as:\nO = [C; CA; CA^2; ...]\n\nThe system matrices are:\nA =\n[[-1, 0, 0,  1],\n [ 1, 0, 0,  2],\n [ 0, 1, 0, -1],\n [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\n\nB = [0; 1; -1; 1]\n\nC =\n[,\n]\n\nThe state vector is of dimension n=4. The system is observable if the rank of the observability matrix O_n = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3] is equal to n=4.\n\nLet's compute the necessary sub-matrices:\nC = [,] (rank = 2)\n\nCA = [[ -1, 0, 0, 1], [ -2, 0, 1, 0]]\nThe matrix [C; CA] has rank 3. This means the observability index is greater than 2.\n\nCA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]\nBy selecting rows from C, CA, and CA^2, we can form a 4x4 matrix and check its rank. For example, the matrix formed by the two rows of C, the second row of CA, and the second row of CA^2 is:\nM = [,, [-2, 0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0, -3]]\nThe determinant of this matrix is -1, which means it is full rank (rank 4). Since we needed matrices up to CA^2 to achieve rank 4, the observability index is ν=3. This confirms the system is observable and the error can be brought to zero in 3 steps.\n\nTo design the deadbeat observer, we must find a gain matrix L such that the characteristic polynomial of (A - LC) is z^4 = 0.\n\nAn alternative, more intuitive method is to use the fact that the outputs provide direct measurements of certain state combinations.\ny1(k) = x1(k)\ny2(k) = x1(k) + x4(k)\n\nFrom these measurements, we can determine x1 and x4 directly at each step:\nx1(k) = y1(k)\nx4(k) = y2(k) - y1(k)\n\nThe observer should be designed to make the error components for these states, e1 and e4, zero in one step. The error dynamics for e1 and e4 are:\ne1(k+1) = -e1(k) + e4(k) - (L(1,1)+L(1,2))e1(k) - L(1,2)e4(k)\ne4(k+1) = -e1(k) + e3(k) - e4(k) - (L(4,1)+L(4,2))e1(k) - L(4,2)e4(k)\n\nTo make e1(k+1) and e4(k+1) identically zero for any e(k), their coefficients must be zero. This gives us:\nFor e1(k+1):\n-1 - (L(1,1)+L(1,2)) = 0  => L(1,1)+L(1,2) = -1\n1 - L(1,2) = 0             => L(1,2) = 1\nFrom which L(1,1) = -2.\n\nFor e4(k+1):\n-1 - (L(4,1)+L(4,2)) = 0  => L(4,1)+L(4,2) = -1\n-1 - L(4,2) = 0            => L(4,2) = -1\nFrom which L(4,1) = 0.\n\nWith these values, the error dynamics matrix A_e = A - LC becomes:\nA_e =\n[[0,          0,         0,           0        ],\n [1-(L(2,1)+L(2,2)),  0,         0,           2-L(2,2) ],\n [-(L(3,1)+L(3,2)),  1,         0,           -1-L(3,2)],\n [0,          0,         1,           0        ]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is det(zI - A_e) = z^4 + (L(3,2)+1)z^2 + (L(2,2)-2)z.\nFor this polynomial to be z^4, the coefficients of the lower order terms must be zero:\nL(3,2) + 1 = 0  => L(3,2) = -1\nL(2,2) - 2 = 0  => L(2,2) = 2\n\nThe values for L(2,1) and L(3,1) can be chosen freely, as they do not affect the characteristic polynomial. A common choice is to set them to zero for a minimal gain solution.\nL(2,1) = 0\nL(3,1) = 0\n\nCombining all the calculated values, the observer gain matrix L is:\nL =\n[[-2,  1],\n [ 0,  2],\n [ 0, -1],\n [ 0, -1]]\n\n<<<\n[[-2, 1],, [0, -1], [0, -1]]\n>>>"
