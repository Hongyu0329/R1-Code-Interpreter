    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency, we need to minimize the amount of data stored in variables. The core of the problem is to compare two strings, which are provided on separate input lines. Since we can't read from both lines at the same time, we must store at least one of the strings in memory to perform the character-by-character comparison.\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach is to:\n1.  Read the first string from the input and store it in a character array.\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time from the input.\n3.  As each character of the second string is read, immediately compare it (case-insensitively) to the corresponding character in the stored first string.\n4.  Print the result and exit as soon as the first differing character is found. If all characters are compared and are equal, then the strings are identical.\n\nThis method avoids allocating memory for the second string. To further optimize, we can use the smallest possible data types for any helper variables, such as loop counters.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Buffer for the first string. Max length 100 + 1 for a terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Variable to hold a character from input. Must be int to handle EOF.\n    int c;\n\n    // Index for the string. An unsigned char is sufficient as length is at most 100.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        s1[i++] = (char)c;\n    }\n    \n    // Reset index for comparison.\n    i = 0;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character and compare on-the-fly.\n    // The problem guarantees the strings are the same length.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // Get the lowercase versions of the characters for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char char1_lower = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n        char char2_lower = tolower((unsigned char)c);\n\n        if (char1_lower < char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (char1_lower > char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++; // Move to the next character.\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming a standard 32-bit or 64-bit system commonly used in competitive programming:\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: This is a character array to store the first string. The maximum string length is 100, and we need one extra space if we were to add a null terminator. `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes.\n*   **`int c`**: This variable is used to store the return value of `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate all possible character values as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value. `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = 4 bytes.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: This variable serves as an index for the string. Since the string length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (which can hold values from 0 to 255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int`. `sizeof(unsigned char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 1 byte.\n*   **`char char1_lower`**, **`char char2_lower`**: These variables store the lowercase characters for comparison. `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte each. They exist within the loop's scope.\n    *   Memory = 1 + 1 = 2 bytes.\n\nThe total memory usage `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables:\nm = 101 (for `s1`) + 4 (for `c`) + 1 (for `i`) + 2 (for `char1_lower` and `char2_lower`) = 108 bytes.\n\nNote: Optimizing compilers might reuse stack space for `char1_lower` and `char2_lower` or even optimize them away by keeping values in registers. However, calculating based on declared variables gives us this result. For the absolute minimum, the `tolower` calls can be nested directly in the `if` statements, removing the need for `char1_lower` and `char2_lower`:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s1[101];\n    int c;\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        s1[i++] = (char)c;\n    }\n    \n    i = 0;\n\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this stricter version, the memory usage is:\nm = 101 (for `s1`) + 4 (for `c`) + 1 (for `i`) = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
