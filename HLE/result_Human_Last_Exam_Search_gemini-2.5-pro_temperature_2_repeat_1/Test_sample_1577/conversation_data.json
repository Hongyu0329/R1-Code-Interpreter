    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a surface of genus `g` without any boundaries (a closed surface), the ground state degeneracy is `4^g = 2^(2g)`. This is because for each of the `g` \"handles\" of the surface, there are two independent non-contractible loops, each contributing a factor of 2 to the degeneracy, resulting in `2g` logical qubits.\n\nWhen holes are introduced into the surface, they create boundaries. There are two primary types of gapped boundaries for the toric code: smooth and rough. These boundaries are distinguished by the types of quasiparticle excitations (anyons) that can condense, or terminate, on them. At a rough boundary, electric charges (`e`-anyons) can terminate, while at a smooth boundary, magnetic fluxes (`m`-anyons) can terminate.\n\nEach hole introduced into the toric code on a plane (which is topologically equivalent to a sphere with one puncture) adds a new logical qubit to the system. This means that for each hole, there is a corresponding degree of freedom in the ground state, leading to a twofold degeneracy associated with that hole. A key result from the literature states that for a Z2 topological order (like the toric code) on a surface with `k` holes, the ground state has a `2^k` fold degeneracy. Each hole, regardless of its boundary type (smooth or rough), contributes one logical qubit.\n\nThe logical operators for these qubits are defined in relation to the hole boundaries. For a hole with a rough boundary, there is a corresponding logical `Z` operator that forms a closed loop around the hole. Similarly, a hole with a smooth boundary has a logical `X` operator that loops around it. These operators, along with string operators that can run between holes of the same type, form the algebra of the `m+n` logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, for a toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes on a surface that is otherwise topologically trivial (like a plane or a sphere), the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the number of holes, `k = m + n`. The ground state degeneracy is then `2^k`.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is `2^(m+n)`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
