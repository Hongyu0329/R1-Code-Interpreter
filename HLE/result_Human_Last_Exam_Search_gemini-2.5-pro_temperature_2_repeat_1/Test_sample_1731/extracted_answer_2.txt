**Mean Energy (U):**
The equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
`U = (8π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4`
where `V` is the volume, `T` is the temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is Planck's constant, and `c` is the speed of light. The mean energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.

**Entropy (S):**
The equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is:
`S = (32π^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^3`
The entropy is proportional to the third power of the temperature.
