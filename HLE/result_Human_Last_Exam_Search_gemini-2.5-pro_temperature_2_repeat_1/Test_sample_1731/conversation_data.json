    "In the framework of large deviation theory, the equilibrium properties of a system are determined by finding the most probable macroscopic state. This is achieved by minimizing a \"rate function\" that quantifies the probability of fluctuations away from the typical behavior. For the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas), the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy can be determined using the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems.\n\n**Conceptual Framework**\n\nA photon gas consists of non-interacting, indistinguishable bosons. A crucial feature of a photon gas in a cavity in thermal equilibrium is that the number of photons is not conserved; they can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container. This leads to the chemical potential of the photon gas being zero.\n\n### Derivation Using Large Deviation Theorems\n\n**1. Equilibrium Distribution via the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the probability of the empirical distribution of a sequence of random variables. It states that the probability of an empirical distribution `p` being close to a given distribution `q` is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence), D(p||q).\n\nFor a system of bosons distributed among various energy levels, the equilibrium state is the most probable distribution of particles. According to the large deviation principle, this is the distribution that minimizes the rate function, which is the relative entropy. This minimization is subject to the physical constraints of the system. In statistical mechanics, this is equivalent to the principle of maximum entropy.\n\nFor a Bose gas, the entropy (which is related to the negative of the rate function) is given by the standard formula for Bose-Einstein statistics. The equilibrium distribution `n_i` (the average number of photons in energy state `ε_i`) is found by maximizing the entropy `S` subject to the constraint that the total mean energy `U` is constant:\n\n*   **Entropy**: `S = k_B * Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i - 1) * ln(n_i + g_i - 1) - n_i * ln(n_i) - (g_i - 1) * ln(g_i - 1) ]`\n    where `g_i` is the number of states with energy `ε_i`.\n*   **Constraint on Mean Energy**: `U = Σ_i n_i * ε_i`\n\nMaximizing the entropy using the method of Lagrange multipliers yields the **Bose-Einstein distribution**:\n\n`n(ε) = 1 / (exp(β*ε + α) - 1)`\n\nHere, `β` and `α` are the Lagrange multipliers. `β` is identified with `1/(k_B*T)`, where `T` is the temperature and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. `α` is related to the chemical potential `μ` by `α = -μ/(k_B*T)`. As mentioned, for a photon gas, the particle number is not conserved, so `μ = 0`, which means `α = 0`.\n\nThus, the equilibrium distribution of photons is given by **Planck's distribution law**, a specific case of the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n\n`n(ε) = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n\nThis result is directly obtained by applying the principles embodied in the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem: finding the most probable distribution, which minimizes the large deviation rate function (relative entropy).\n\n**2. Mean Energy via the Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem provides the rate function for the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The total energy of the photon gas can be seen as the sum of the energies of the individual photons, which are treated as random variables drawn from the distribution derived above. The theorem helps in understanding the fluctuations of the mean energy and confirming its equilibrium value. The expected value of the total energy is what we define as the mean energy of the system.\n\nTo find the **mean energy `U`**, we integrate the energy of the photons over all possible frequencies, weighted by the number of photons at each frequency and the density of states `g(ν)`. The density of states for photons in a volume `V` is given by:\n\n`g(ν)dν = (8πV / c^3) * ν^2 dν`\n\nThe energy of a photon of frequency `ν` is `hν`. Thus, the mean energy is:\n\n`U = ∫[0 to ∞] n(hν) * g(ν) * hν dν = ∫[0 to ∞] (1 / (exp(hν / (k_B*T)) - 1)) * (8πV / c^3) * ν^2 * hν dν`\n\nEvaluating this integral gives the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy:\n\n`U = (8π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4`\n\nThis shows that the mean energy `U` of a photon gas is proportional to `T^4`.\n\n**3. Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nHaving determined the equilibrium distribution and the mean energy, we can now calculate the **entropy `S`** of the photon gas at equilibrium. The general thermodynamic relation for a system with zero chemical potential is `U = TS - PV`. For a photon gas, it can be shown that `PV = U/3`. Therefore:\n\n`U = TS - U/3`\n`=> S = (4U) / (3T)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `U`:\n\n`S = (4 / (3T)) * [ (8π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4 ]`\n`S = (32π^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^3`\n\nThe entropy `S` of a photon gas is proportional to `T^3`.\n\n**Equilibrium Values**\n\nIn summary, using the principles of large deviation theory as formulated by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, we arrive at the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**: `U = a * V * T^4`\n    where `a = (8π^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)` is the radiation constant.\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S)**: `S = (4/3) * a * V * T^3`\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`U = (8π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4`\nwhere `V` is the volume, `T` is the temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is Planck's constant, and `c` is the speed of light. The mean energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n**Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is:\n`S = (32π^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^3`\nThe entropy is proportional to the third power of the temperature.\n>>>"
