    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency in C, the optimal approach is to avoid storing the entire input string in a large buffer. Instead, the program should read the input character by character, process it on the fly, and then generate the output. A counting sort algorithm is perfectly suited for this task since the numbers are limited to '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n\nThe most memory-efficient strategy is as follows:\n1.  Read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a large array (e.g., `char s[1001]`) to hold the input string.\n2.  Use a small array to count the occurrences of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n3.  The maximum length of the input string is 1000 characters. In the most frequent case, one number can appear up to 500 times (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\"). A `char` (1 byte, 0-255 range) is insufficient to hold this count, so a `short` (2 bytes, -32768 to 32767 range) is the most memory-efficient choice for the counters.\n4.  After counting, loop from 1 to 4 and print the numbers and the `'+'` separators based on the counts. This generates the final sorted sum directly without creating an intermediate output string.\n5.  Variables should be chosen carefully. Loop counters can often be reused, and flags can be of type `char`.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This C program solves the \"Xenia and Sum\" problem with a focus on minimizing\n * the memory used by variables. It reads the input stream character by character,\n * counts the occurrences of each number, and then prints the sorted sum directly.\n */\nint main() {\n    /* VARIABLE DECLARATIONS & MEMORY ANALYSIS */\n\n    // 1. 'counts' array: Stores the frequency of numbers '1' through '4'.\n    // The maximum count for any number can be 500. 'unsigned char' (0-255) is\n    // too small. 'short' (2 bytes) is the most efficient standard type that can\n    // hold this value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(short) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8 bytes.\n    short counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // 2. 'c' variable: Reads characters from standard input. getchar() returns\n    // an 'int' to handle the EOF value. This variable is later reused as a\n    // loop counter.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes. (On typical competitive programming platforms)\n    int c;\n\n    // 3. 'first' flag: A flag to manage printing the '+' separator. A 'char'\n    // is the smallest addressable type (1 byte) and is sufficient.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char first = 1;\n\n    // Read the input sum and count the numbers\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the rearranged sum. 'c' is reused as the loop counter.\n    for (c = 0; c < 4; c++) {\n        while (counts[c] > 0) {\n            if (!first) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar(c + '1'); // Print the digit '1', '2', '3', or '4'\n            first = 0;\n            counts[c]--;\n        }\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of `m`\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of each declared variable. The sizes are based on common standards for C compilers like GCC on 64-bit systems, which are typical in competitive programming.\n\n*   `short counts[4]`: The size is `4 * sizeof(short)`. `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes. Total: **8 bytes**.\n*   `int c`: The size of an `int` is typically 4 bytes on these platforms. Total: **4 bytes**.\n*   `char first`: The size of a `char` is by definition 1 byte. Total: **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 bytes.\n\n<<<13>>>"
