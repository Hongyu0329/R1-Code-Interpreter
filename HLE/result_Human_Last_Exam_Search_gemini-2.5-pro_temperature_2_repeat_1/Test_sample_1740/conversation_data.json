    "To date, a total of 10 mature members of the let-7 microRNA family have been identified in humans. These members include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nThe let-7 family is a group of small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. These mature let-7 miRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes located on different chromosomes. The let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and was one of the first microRNAs to be discovered.\n\nWhile most sources point to 10 mature let-7 members, it's worth noting that research in this area is ongoing, and a few studies have mentioned a slightly different number, ranging from 11 to 13, when considering precursor genes or closely related sequences. However, the most commonly accepted and specifically listed number of distinct mature let-7 miRNAs is ten.\n\n<<<10>>>"
