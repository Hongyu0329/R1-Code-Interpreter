    "The connectivity of the map `f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)` is 8.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of this connectivity.\n\n### 1. Identify and Simplify the Spaces\nFirst, we identify the homotopy types of the source and target spaces.\n\n*   **Target Space:** The target space is `Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. Due to the property of the smash product of spheres, `S^m ∧ S^n ≃ S^{m+n}`, we have `S⁴ ∧ S⁶ ≃ S¹⁰`. Therefore, the target space is homotopy equivalent to `ΩS¹⁰`.\n\n*   **Source Space:** The source space is `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`. This involves the suspension of a smash product of two loop spaces.\n\n### 2. Determine the Connectivity of the Target Space\nThe connectivity of a space `X` is the largest integer `n` such that all homotopy groups `πᵢ(X)` are trivial for `i ≤ n`.\n\n*   The sphere `S¹⁰` is `(10-1) = 9`-connected, meaning `πᵢ(S¹⁰) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`. The first non-trivial homotopy group is `π₁₀(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n*   The loop space functor `Ω` reduces the connectivity of a simply connected space by one. Therefore, `ΩS¹⁰` is `(9-1) = 8`-connected.\n*   This means `πᵢ(ΩS¹⁰) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`. The first non-trivial homotopy group is `π₉(ΩS¹⁰) ≅ π₁₀(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Connectivity of the Source Space\nTo find the connectivity of `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`, we first need the connectivity of the space being suspended.\n\n*   **Connectivity of `ΩS⁴`**: The sphere `S⁴` is `(4-1) = 3`-connected. Thus, the loop space `ΩS⁴` is `(3-1) = 2`-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of `ΩS⁶`**: The sphere `S⁶` is `(6-1) = 5`-connected. Thus, the loop space `ΩS⁶` is `(5-1) = 4`-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the Smash Product `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶`**: For connected CW complexes `X` and `Y` that are `m`- and `n`-connected respectively, their smash product `X ∧ Y` is `(m+n+1)`-connected. In our case, `m=2` and `n=4`. So, `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` is `(2+4+1) = 7`-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the Suspension `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`**: The suspension functor `Σ` increases the connectivity of a space by one. Since `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` is 7-connected, the source space `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)` is `(7+1) = 8`-connected.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Map's Connectivity\n\nA map `f: A → B` is defined as being `k`-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, `f_*: πᵢ(A) → πᵢ(B)`, is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of `f` being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\nLet's examine the maps induced by `f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}` on the homotopy groups.\n\n*   For `i < 8`:\n    *   `πᵢ(Source) = 0` (since the source is 8-connected).\n    *   `πᵢ(Target) = 0` (since the target is 8-connected).\n    The induced map `f_*: 0 → 0` is an isomorphism.\n\n*   For `i = 8`:\n    *   `π₈(Source) = 0`.\n    *   `π₈(Target) = 0`.\n    The induced map `f_*: 0 → 0` is an isomorphism. This means the condition for `i<k` is satisfied for `k` up to 9.\n\n*   For `i = 9`:\n    *   `π₉(Source) = 0` (since the source is 8-connected).\n    *   `π₉(Target) = π₉(ΩS¹⁰) ≅ π₁₀(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n    The induced map is `f_*: π₉(Source) → π₉(Target)`, which is the zero map `0 → ℤ`.\n\nFor the map `f` to be 9-connected, `f_*` must be an isomorphism for `i<9` and a surjection for `i=9`. The map on `π₉`, `0 → ℤ`, is not surjective. Therefore, the map is not 9-connected.\n\nLet's check for `k=8`. The map `f_*` must be an isomorphism for `i < 8` and a surjection for `i = 8`. Both of these conditions are met, as the induced map is `0 → 0` in both cases, which is both an isomorphism and a surjection.\n\nThus, the highest integer `k` for which the map is `k`-connected is 8.\n\nThe \"map induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" description refers to constructions like the Samelson or Whitehead products. In this case, the map `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)` is related to the Whitehead product `[id_{S⁴}, id_{S⁶}]`, which is an element in `π₉(S⁴ ∨ S⁶)`. While this construction confirms that the map is non-trivial at this level, the differing connectivity of the source and target spaces is sufficient to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n<<<8>>>"
