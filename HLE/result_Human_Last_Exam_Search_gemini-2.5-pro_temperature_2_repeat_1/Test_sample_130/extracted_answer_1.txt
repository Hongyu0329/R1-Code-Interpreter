When the local median function is applied iteratively to a binary image, the edges undergo a process equivalent to motion by mean curvature. This means that sharp corners are rounded, and jagged edges are smoothed out. The edges move with a velocity proportional to their curvature, a process which acts to minimize the total perimeter of the regions. As the number of iterations approaches infinity, the image will converge to a "root signal," which is invariant to further filtering. In this final state, small or complex regions will disappear, and the remaining boundaries will be smooth curves. For a finite image, closed boundaries will typically shrink and vanish, often leading to a final image of a single, solid color.
