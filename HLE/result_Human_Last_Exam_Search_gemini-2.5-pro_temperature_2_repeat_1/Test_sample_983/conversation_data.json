    "An analysis of the provided sequence of numbers reveals a distinct mathematical pattern. Every number in the sequence is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if it meets two conditions: it must be an even number (divisible by 2), and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. A quick check confirms that all numbers in the sequence are even.\n\nLet's examine the sum of the digits for each number in the sequence:\n*   1014: 1+0+1+4 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1020: 1+0+2+0 = 3 (divisible by 3)\n*   1032: 1+0+3+2 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1050: 1+0+5+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1104: 1+1+0+4 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1224: 1+2+2+4 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   1230: 1+2+3+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1290: 1+2+9+0 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   1410: 1+4+1+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1440: 1+4+4+0 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   1452: 1+4+5+2 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   1482: 1+4+8+2 = 15 (divisible by 3)\n*   1500: 1+5+0+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1512: 1+5+1+2 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   1560: 1+5+6+0 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   1584: 1+5+8+4 = 18 (divisible by 3)\n*   1602: 1+6+0+2 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   1734: 1+7+3+4 = 15 (divisible by 3)\n*   1812: 1+8+1+2 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   1890: 1+8+9+0 = 18 (divisible by 3)\n*   1902: 1+9+0+2 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   1932: 1+9+3+2 = 15 (divisible by 3)\n*   1974: 1+9+7+4 = 21 (divisible by 3)\n*   2004: 2+0+0+4 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   2040: 2+0+4+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   2064: 2+0+6+4 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n*   2070: 2+0+7+0 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   2130: 2+1+3+0 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   2142: 2+1+4+2 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   2274: 2+2+7+4 = 15 (divisible by 3)\n*   2340: 2+3+4+0 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n*   2352: 2+3+5+2 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n\nThe sequence of the sums of the digits is: 6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 12, 6, 9, 12, 15, 6, 9, 12, 18, 9, 15, 12, 18, 12, 15, 21, 6, 6, 12, 9, 6, 9, 15, 9, 12.\n\nWhile the pattern in the sums of the digits is not a simple arithmetic progression, it is composed of multiples of 3. The last two sums are 9 and 12. A logical continuation of this sub-pattern would be 15.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence must be a multiple of 6, and the sum of its digits should be 15.\n\nThe last number in the given sequence is 2352. The next multiples of 6 are:\n*   2358 (sum of digits = 18)\n*   2364 (sum of digits = 15)\n\nThe number 2364 fits the established pattern.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
