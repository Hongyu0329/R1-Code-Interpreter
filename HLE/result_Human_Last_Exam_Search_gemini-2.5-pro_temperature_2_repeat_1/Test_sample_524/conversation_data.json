    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. A complete classification of the non-degenerate (containing more than one point) cases was achieved in 2014, solving a long-standing problem in topology.\n\nThe homeomorphism classes are:\n\n1.  **The Point**: This is the simplest, \"degenerate\" example of a homogeneous continuum.\n2.  **The Circle**: For a long time, it was conjectured that the circle (or simple closed curve) was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc**: In 1948, R. H. Bing showed that the pseudo-arc is another example of a homogeneous planar continuum. It is a snake-like, hereditarily indecomposable continuum, meaning it contains no decomposable subcontinua.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**: Discovered by Bing and F. B. Jones in 1959, this continuum is constructed by mapping a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs onto a circle.\n\nA landmark result by Logan C. Hoehn and Lex G. Oversteegen in 2014 proved that the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs are the only three non-degenerate homogeneous continua that can be embedded in a plane. When including the degenerate case of a single point, the total number of homeomorphism classes is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
