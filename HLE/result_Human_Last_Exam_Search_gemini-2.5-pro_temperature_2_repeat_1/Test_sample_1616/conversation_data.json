    "Trisyllabic laxing is a rule in English phonology where a tense vowel (a long vowel or diphthong) becomes a lax vowel (a short vowel) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. To determine which of the provided words has not undergone this sound change, each word's development is analyzed.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word derives from \"south\". In Old English, \"south\" (*sūþ*) had a long vowel /uː/, which later became the diphthong /aʊ/ during the Great Vowel Shift. The related Old English word *sūþerne* was pronounced with three syllables (/suːðernə/). This structure caused the long /uː/ to shorten to a lax /u/, which eventually became the modern /ʌ/ sound in \"southern\" (/ˈsʌðərn/). This change from the tense vowel in \"south\" to the lax vowel in \"southern\" is an example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word is related to \"derive\" (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a tense diphthong /aɪ/. In \"derivative\" (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the vowel shortens to a lax /ɪ/. The syllable in question is followed by two more syllables (`-ative`). This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: Derived from \"serene\" (/səˈriːn/), which features a tense vowel /iː/. When the suffix \"-ity\" is added to form \"serenity\" (/səˈrɛnɪti/), the vowel sound changes to the lax /ɛ/. The vowel is in the third syllable from the end, followed by two syllables. This is a classic case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is related to \"grateful\" (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), where the first syllable has a tense diphthong /eɪ/. In \"gratitude\" (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), this vowel becomes the lax /æ/. The syllable is followed by two more (`-itude`), demonstrating trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word is derived from \"shade\" (/ʃeɪd/), which has a tense diphthong /eɪ/. In \"shadow\" (/ˈʃædoʊ/), the vowel becomes lax /æ/. However, the laxing vowel is followed by only one syllable. This process is known as **disyllabic laxing**, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This is a two-syllable word (/ˈplɛzənt/) borrowed from Old French *plaisant*. The vowel in its first syllable is already lax, and it doesn't have a common English root with a tense vowel that was shortened by the addition of suffixes creating a trisyllabic word. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth \"shadow\" and \"pleasant\" have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, \"shadow\" is the textbook example of a different but related process called disyllabic laxing. Since the question specifically asks about trisyllabic laxing, the word that underwent a different type of laxing is a direct and precise answer.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
