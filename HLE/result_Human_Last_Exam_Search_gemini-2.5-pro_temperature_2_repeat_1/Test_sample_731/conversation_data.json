    "The user is asking for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\nBased on the initial search:\n- A power subgroup H of a group G is defined as H = <g^m : g ∈ G> for some non-negative integer m.\n- The semidihedral group of order 2^n is denoted SD_2^n. In this case, the order is 512 = 2^9, so we are looking at SD_512, which means n=9.\n- The presentation of the semidihedral group SD_2^n is <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>. For SD_512, this is <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(127)>.\n- Power subgroups are characteristic and therefore normal subgroups.\n- A paper discusses the number of power subgroups, ps(G), for certain groups. It states that \"The power subgroups of G are G1=G , Gp , Gp2,…,Gpm , where pm is the exponent of G.\" for a specific type of group. This might be a useful avenue for p-groups. Since SD_512 is a 2-group, this might be very relevant.\n\nLet's break down the problem for SD_512, which is a 2-group (a group of prime power order). Let G = SD_512. The subgroups G^m = <g^m | g ∈ G> are the power subgroups. We need to find how many distinct subgroups arise from this definition for different values of m.\n\nFor a finite group G, the sequence of power subgroups G^m stabilizes. Also, G^m only depends on m modulo the exponent of the group. The exponent of SD_2^n needs to be determined.\n\nThe elements of SD_2^n are {r^i, r^i * s | 0 <= i < 2^(n-1)}.\nFor SD_512 (n=9), the elements are {r^i, r^i * s | 0 <= i < 256}.\nThe order of r is 256.\nLet's find the order of r^i * s.\n(r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (s * r^i * s^-1) = r^i * (srs)^i = r^i * (r^(2^(n-2)-1))^i = r^i * r^((2^(n-2)-1)*i) = r^(i * (1 + 2^(n-2) - 1)) = r^(i * 2^(n-2)).\nFor SD_512 (n=9), this is r^(i * 2^7) = r^(128i).\nIf i is even, i=2k, then (r^(2k)s)^2 = r^(256k) = e. So the order is 2.\nIf i is odd, i=2k+1, then (r^((2k+1))s)^2 = r^(128(2k+1)) = r^(256k + 128) = r^128. So the order is 4. ( (r^((2k+1))s)^4 = (r^128)^2 = r^256 = e).\n\nThe orders of elements in SD_512 are:\n- 1 (for e)\n- Powers of 2 up to 256 (for powers of r)\n- 2 (for r^i * s where i is even)\n- 4 (for r^i * s where i is odd)\n\nThe exponent of the group is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements.\nThe maximum order is 256. So the exponent of SD_512 is 256.\n\nWe need to consider the power subgroups G^m for m from 0 up to 255.\nG^0 = <g^0 | g ∈ G> = <e> which is the trivial subgroup.\nG^1 = <g^1 | g ∈ G> = G itself.\nWhat about G^m for other m?\nSince the orders of all elements are powers of 2, if m is odd, g -> g^m is a permutation of G. So G^m = G. This is because for any y in G, we can find x in G such that x^m = y. The map x -> x^m is an automorphism for abelian groups if m is coprime to the order of the group, but here the group is not abelian. However, since all element orders are powers of 2, if m is odd, the map x -> x^m is a bijection on every cyclic subgroup, so G^m will contain all elements, hence G^m = G.\n\nSo we only need to consider G^(2^k) for k >= 1.\n\nLet's analyze G^2.\nG^2 = <g^2 | g in G>.\nThe squares of elements are:\n- (r^i)^2 = r^(2i)\n- ((r^i)s)^2 = r^(128i)\n\nSo G^2 is generated by {r^2, r^4, ..., r^254, r^0, r^128}.\nThis is the subgroup generated by r^2, as r^128 = (r^2)^64.\nSo G^2 = <r^2>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n\nNow let's analyze G^4.\nG^4 = <g^4 | g in G>.\nThe 4th powers of elements are:\n- (r^i)^4 = r^(4i)\n- ((r^i)s)^4 = (r^(128i))^2 = r^(256i) = e\n\nSo G^4 is generated by {r^4, r^8, ..., e}.\nThis is the subgroup generated by r^4.\nG^4 = <r^4>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n\nIt seems that G^(2^k) = <r^(2^k)> for k >= 1. Let's verify.\nLet's consider g^(2^k).\n- (r^i)^(2^k) = r^(i*2^k)\n- ((r^i)s)^(2^k) = ((r^i*s)^2)^(2^(k-1)) = (r^(i*128))^(2^(k-1)) = r^(i * 128 * 2^(k-1)) = r^(i * 2^7 * 2^(k-1)) = r^(i * 2^(k+6))\nSo G^(2^k) is generated by <r^(2^k), r^(2^(k+6))>.\nSince r^(2^(k+6)) is a power of r^(2^k), G^(2^k) = <r^(2^k)>.\n\nLet's check the condition again.\ng in G, g=r^i or g=r^i*s.\nG^m = < (r^i)^m, ((r^i)s)^m > for all i.\n((r^i)s)^2 = r^(128i).\nIf m = 2j is even:\n(r^i)^m = r^(im).\n((r^i)s)^m = ( ((r^i)s)^2 )^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij).\nSo G^m = G^(2j) is generated by {r^(2ij), r^(128ij)} for all i. This is just <r^(2j), r^(128j)>. As long as 128 is a multiple of 2, this simplifies to <r^(2j)>.\nThe generator is r^gcd(2j, 128j) if we consider all i, but we only need the set of generators.\nThe set of generators is {r^(2j), r^(2*2j), ..., r^(255*2j), r^(128j), r^(2*128j), ...}.\nThis simplifies to <r^(gcd(2j, 128j))> = <r^(2j)>.\n\nSo, for m = 2, G^2 = <r^2> (order 128)\nFor m = 4, G^4 = <r^4> (order 64)\nFor m = 8, G^8 = <r^8> (order 32)\nFor m = 16, G^16 = <r^16> (order 16)\nFor m = 32, G^32 = <r^32> (order 8)\nFor m = 64, G^64 = <r^64> (order 4)\nFor m = 128, G^128 = <r^128> (order 2)\nFor m = 256, G^256 = <r^256> = <e> (order 1). But wait, we need to check the second type of elements.\ng = (r^i)s. g^256 = e. So G^256 = <e>.\nWhat about m > 256? Let m = 256+k. G^m will be the same as G^k. No, this is modulo the exponent. The exponent is 256.\n\nSo the power subgroups are:\n1. G^m for odd m: G^m = G. (1 subgroup)\n2. G^m for m=2j, where j is odd (e.g. m=2, 6, 10, ...). G^m = G^2 = <r^2>. (1 subgroup)\n   Let m = 2*j, j odd. G^m = <g^m> = < (r^i)^m, ((r^i)s)^m > = <r^(im), r^(128ij)>. Since j is odd, r^(128j) is not e. It is r^128.\n   The generated subgroup is <r^m, r^(128j)>. m=2j. The subgroup is <r^(2j), r^(128j)>. Since j is odd, gcd(2j, 128j) = 2*gcd(j, 64j) = 2j. So G^(2j) = <r^(2j)>. Hmm. Let j be odd. gcd(j, 64)=1. No.\n   Let m=2j, j is odd. G^m is generated by <r^(2j)> and ((r^i)s)^(2j) = (r^(128i))^j. The set of these for all i is <r^(128j)>. So G^(2j) = <r^(2j), r^(128j)>. Since j is odd, 128j = 128 (mod 256). So it is <r^(2j), r^128>. 128 is a multiple of 2, but is r^128 in <r^(2j)>? r^128 = (r^(2j))^(64/j). This only works if j divides 64. Not all odd j divide 64. But this is not true for any odd j>1. Wait, no. (r^(2j))^k = r^128 means 2jk = 128 mod 256. jk = 64 mod 128. If j is odd, it has an inverse mod 128. So k = 64*j_inv mod 128. This equation has a solution for k. So r^128 is in <r^(2j)>.\n   So, for any odd j, G^(2j) = <r^(2j)>.\n   How many distinct subgroups <r^(2j)> are there for odd j?\n   Let j and k be odd. <r^(2j)> = <r^(2k)>. This means that <r^2>^j = <r^2>^k. This holds if and only if gcd(j, |<r^2>|) = gcd(k, |<r^2>|). The order of <r^2> is 128. gcd(j, 128)=1 and gcd(k, 128)=1 since j, k are odd. So <r^(2j)> = <r^2> for any odd j. So for any m = 2*(odd number), we get the subgroup <r^2>. (1 subgroup)\n\n3. G^m for m=4j, j is odd. G^m = <r^(4j), r^(128j)> = <r^(4j)>. As before, r^128 is in <r^(4j)>. 128 = 4j * k (mod 256) -> 32 = jk (mod 64). Since j is odd, it is invertible mod 64. So yes, r^128 is in <r^(4j)>.\n   So for any m = 4*(odd number), we get <r^4>. (1 subgroup).\n\nIt seems the pattern is:\nFor m = 2^k * j, with j odd: G^m = <r^(2^k)>.\n\nLet's verify this.\nG^m = < (r^i)^m, ((r^i)s)^m > = <r^(im), r^(128i * m/2)>. This is for even m only.\nm = 2^k * j (j odd, k>=1).\n((r^i)s)^m = (((r^i)s)^2)^(m/2) = (r^(128i))^(m/2) = r^(128i * 2^(k-1) * j) = r^(i * 2^7 * 2^(k-1) * j) = r^(i * j * 2^(k+6)).\nSo G^m is generated by <r^m, r^(j*2^(k+6))>.\nm = j*2^k.\nSo we need the subgroup generated by <r^(j*2^k), r^(j*2^(k+6))>.\nThe second generator is a power of the first. So G^m = <r^(j*2^k)>.\nSince j is odd, <r^(j*2^k)> = <(r^(2^k))^j>. The order of r^(2^k) is 256/2^k = 2^(8-k). Since j is odd, it is coprime to the order. So <(r^(2^k))^j> = <r^(2^k)>.\n\nSo the distinct power subgroups are:\n- G^m for odd m (k=0): G = SD_512.\n- G^m for m = 2j, j odd (k=1): <r^2>.\n- G^m for m = 4j, j odd (k=2): <r^4>.\n- G^m for m = 8j, j odd (k=3): <r^8>.\n- G^m for m = 16j, j odd (k=4): <r^16>.\n- G^m for m = 32j, j odd (k=5): <r^32>.\n- G^m for m = 64j, j odd (k=6): <r^64>.\n- G^m for m = 128j, j odd (k=7): <r^128>.\n- G^m for m = 256j, j odd (k=8): <r^256> = <e>.\n\nWhat about G^0? G^0 = <e>. So m=256 gives the same as m=0. The question asks for power subgroups. So we should list the distinct subgroups we've found.\nThe list is:\n1. G = SD_512\n2. <r^2>\n3. <r^4>\n4. <r^8>\n5. <r^16>\n6. <r^32>\n7. <r^64>\n8. <r^128>\n9. <e>\n\nAre there any others? The exponent is 256. Any m can be written as m = 2^k * j with j odd.\nSo these should be all of them.\n\nThere are 9 distinct power subgroups.\nLet's double-check everything.\n\nGroup G = SD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>. Note that 127 = 2^(7)-1. Oops, the formula from Wikipedia is srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1).\nFor n=9, this is srs = r^(2^7 - 1) = r^127. But in another source it is srs=r^(2^(n-2)+1). This needs clarification. Let's check Groupprops or a reliable source for SD_2^n definition.\nGroupprops: SD_2^n is C_2^(n-1) semidirect C_2 where the action is x -> x^(2^(n-2)-1). This seems to match. Let's see an example for a smaller SD group.\nSD_16 (n=4): <r, s | r^8=s^2=1, srs = r^(2^2-1) = r^3>. This is what Groupprops says. So the formula srs=r^(2^(n-2)-1) is incorrect. The other action must be the right one.\nThe presentation from Dummit and Foote is usually srs = r^(-1 + 2^(n-2)). My initial calculation srs = r^(127) corresponds to srs = r^(-1 + 128) = r^(-1 + 2^(n-2)).\nWait wait... My first calculation for (r^i*s)^2 was: (r^i s)^2 = r^i (s r^i s^-1) = r^i (srs)^i = r^i (r^(-1+2^(n-2)))^i = r^i * r^(-i + i*2^(n-2)) = r^(i*2^(n-2)). This seems correct. For n=9, this is r^(i*2^7) = r^(128i). This calculation does not depend on the sign of the -1. It could be r^(1+2^(n-2)) or r^(-1+2^(n-2)). Let me check that.\nLet x = r^k. sxs^-1 = s r^k s^-1 = (srs)^k.\nIf srs = r^a. (r^i s)^2 = r^i * s r^i s = r^i * (s r s)^i * s^2 = r^i * (r^a)^i = r^(i(1+a)).\nWith a = -1 + 2^(n-2), then 1+a = 2^(n-2). (r^i s)^2 = r^(i * 2^(n-2)). So my initial calculation stands. Order of r^(i)s is 2 if i is even, 4 if i is odd. Exponent is 2^(n-1) = 256.\n\nWhat if the definition of the group is different?\nWikipedia says `srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)`. For n=9, srs=r^127. Let's re-verify the element orders with this relation.\ns r s = r^127 implies s r = r^127 s.\nElements are r^i and r^i * s.\nOrder of r^k is 256 / gcd(k, 256).\nOrder of r^k * s:\n(r^k * s)^2 = r^k * s * r^k * s = r^k * (s r^k s) = r^k * (srs)^k = r^k * (r^127)^k = r^(128k).\nIf k is even, k=2j: r^(128*2j) = r^(256j) = e. Order is 2.\nIf k is odd, k=2j+1: r^(128*(2j+1)) = r^(256j + 128) = r^128. This element has order 2, so (r^k*s)^2 has order 2, meaning r^k*s has order 4.\nThe orders are the same. So the exponent is 256.\n\nThe set of power subgroups H_m = {g^m | g in G}. No, it's the subgroup generated by this set.\nH_m = < {g^m | g in G} >.\nGenerators for H_m are (r^k)^m = r^(km) and (r^k * s)^m.\nIf m is even, m=2j: (r^k * s)^(2j) = ((r^k * s)^2)^j = (r^(128k))^j = r^(128kj).\nSo for m=2j, H_m = < {r^(k*2j)}, {r^(128kj)} > for k=0...255.\nThis simplifies to <r^(2j), r^(128j)>.\ngcd(2j, 128j) = 2j * gcd(1, 64) = 2j. This assumes we are taking gcd over all k. Let's be more precise.\nThe set of generators is {r^(2j), r^(2*2j), ...} union {r^(128j), r^(2*128j), ...}.\nThe subgroup generated by the first set is <r^(2j)>.\nThe subgroup generated by the second set is <r^(128j)>.\nSo H_m = <r^(2j), r^(128j)>.\nSince r^(128j) = (r^(2j))^(64), r^(128j) is always in <r^(2j)>.\nSo H_m = <r^(2j)> for m=2j.\n\nIf m is odd, m=2j+1.\n(r^k)^m = r^(km).\nWhat is (r^k * s)^m?\n(r^k * s)^m = r^k * s * r^k * s * ... * r^k * s (m times).\n(r^k s) (r^k s) = r^k (s r^k s) = r^k (r^127 k) = r^(128k)\n(r^k s) (r^k s) (r^k s) = r^(128k) r^k s = r^((128k+k)) s = r^(129k) s.\n(r^k s)^4 = r^(129k) s r^(129k) s = r^(129k) s r^k s = r^(129k) r^(127k) = r^(256k)=e if k is even. Hmm, wait.\ns r^(129k) s = (srs)^129k = r^(127*129k).\n(r^(129k)s)^2 = r^(129k(1+127)) = r^(129k * 128). So my formula for squares seems general.\n((A)s)^2 = A * sAs = A * (sAs^-1)\n(r^k s)^1 = r^k s\n(r^k s)^2 = r^(128k)\n(r^k s)^3 = r^(128k) r^k s = r^(129k) s\n(r^k s)^4 = (r^(128k))^2 = e\n(r^k s)^5 = e * r^k s = r^k s. The pattern of powers is {r^k s, r^(128k), r^(129k) s, e}.\n\nSo for m odd, what is (r^k * s)^m ?\nIf m = 1 (mod 4), (r^k s)^m = r^(...k) s\nIf m = 3 (mod 4), (r^k s)^m = r^(...k) s\nLet's just take one element of the second type, e.g., s. s^m = s.\nr^m is in H_m. So H_m contains r^m and s. The subgroup <r^m, s>\nIf m is odd, gcd(m, 256) = 1, so <r^m> = <r>. Thus, <r^m, s> = <r,s> = G.\nSo for any odd m, H_m = G. This confirms my earlier finding.\n\nSo the distinct subgroups are G, and <r^(2j)> for various j.\nLet m=2j. H_m = <r^(2j)>.\nLet m = 2, H_2 = <r^2>.\nLet m = 4, H_4 = <r^4>.\nLet m = 6, H_6 = <r^6>.\nLet m = 8, H_8 = <r^8>.\nH_(2j) = <r^(2j)>.\nThe subgroup <r^a> is distinct for each divisor 'a' of 256.\nThe order of <r^(2j)> is 256 / gcd(256, 2j) = 128 / gcd(128, j).\nLet j=1, order is 128. H_2 = <r^2>.\nLet j=2, m=4. order is 128 / gcd(128,2) = 64. H_4 = <r^4>.\nLet j=3, m=6. H_6 = <r^6>. order is 128 / gcd(128, 3) = 128. But <r^6> is generated by r^gcd(6, 256) = r^2.\nSo H_6 = <r^2>.\nLet H_m = <r^m>. The subgroup only depends on gcd(m, 256). Let d = gcd(m, 256). Then <r^m> = <r^d>.\nThe possible values for d are the divisors of 256, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nSo the subgroups are <r>, <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^128>, <r^256>=<e>.\nWe need to see which of these can be generated as power subgroups.\nH_m = <g^m | g in G>\n\nCase 1: m is odd. gcd(m, 256) = 1.\nThen H_m = G. So we have one power subgroup G, which corresponds to <r^1> = <r> in terms of the cyclic part, but H_m is not just <r^m>, it also contains the s-elements. For odd m, H_m = G. So this accounts for the divisor 1.\n\nCase 2: m is even. m = 2j. H_m = <r^(2j)>.\nCan we generate <r^d> for any divisor d>1 of 256?\nLet d be a divisor of 256, d > 1. Can we find an m such that H_m = <r^d>?\nFrom my analysis, H_m for m even is of the form <r^m>. But this is not entirely correct.\nIt's H_m = <r^(gcd(m, 256))>. Let d = gcd(m, 256). Then H_m = <r^d>.\nSo we need to find which d = gcd(m, 256) can be obtained from m such that H_m = <r^d>.\nThe set of generators is <{r^(im)}, {(r^is)^m}>.\nIf m is even, m=2j. Then (r^is)^m = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij).\nSo H_m is generated by r^m and r^(128j). m=2j.\nH_m = <r^(2j), r^(128j)>.\nLet m = d*k, where d is a divisor of 256.\nLet d = 2^a. m can be any multiple of d. Let's just use m=d.\nSo we test the subgroups H_(2^a) for a=0 to 8.\na=0, m=1 (odd). H_1 = G. (1)\na=1, m=2. H_2 = <r^2, r^128>. r^128 = (r^2)^64. So H_2 = <r^2>. (2)\na=2, m=4. H_4 = <r^4, r^(128*2)>. r^256=e. So H_4=<r^4>. (3)\na=3, m=8. H_8 = <r^8, r^(128*4)>. e. H_8=<r^8>. (4)\n...\na=7, m=128. H_128 = <r^128, r^(128*64)>. e. H_128 = <r^128>. (8)\na=8, m=256. H_256 = <r^256, r^(128*128)>. e. H_256 = <e>. (9)\n\nThis seems to produce 9 subgroups: G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <e>.\n\nAre there any other power subgroups?\nLet m be any integer. m = 2^k * j, with j odd and k >= 0.\nIf k=0, m is odd. H_m = G.\nIf k>=1, m is even.\nH_m = <r^m, r^(128*m/2)> = <r^(j*2^k), r^(128 * j*2^(k-1))> = <r^(j*2^k), r^(j*2^(k+6))>.\nSince r^(j*2^(k+6)) = (r^(j*2^k))^(2^6), this simplifies to H_m = <r^(j*2^k)>.\nSince j is odd, it is coprime to 256. Thus <r^(j*2^k)> = <(r^(2^k))^j> = <r^(2^k)>.\nThis means that the power subgroup H_m only depends on the largest power of 2 that divides m.\nLet v2(m) be the 2-adic valuation of m.\nIf v2(m) = 0 (m is odd), H_m = G.\nIf v2(m) = 1 (m=2,6,10,...), H_m = <r^2>.\nIf v2(m) = 2 (m=4,12,20,...), H_m = <r^4>.\nIf v2(m) = 3 (m=8,24,40,...), H_m = <r^8>.\nIf v2(m) = 4, H_m = <r^16>.\nIf v2(m) = 5, H_m = <r^32>.\nIf v2(m) = 6, H_m = <r^64>.\nIf v2(m) = 7, H_m = <r^128>.\nIf v2(m) >= 8 (m is a multiple of 256), H_m = <r^256> = <e>.\n\nSo the set of distinct power subgroups is:\n{ G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <e> }\nThis is a total of 9 subgroups.\n\nThis seems correct and consistent. The logic holds at each step.\nThe definition of a power subgroup is clear.\nThe structure of the semidihedral group of order 512 is well-defined, although there can be confusion with presentations, but the properties used (order of elements) seem to be standard.\nThe calculation of the exponent of the group is correct.\nThe calculation of the generators for G^m for even and odd m appears solid.\nThe simplification of these sets of generators into a single cyclic generator (for even m) seems correct as well.\nThe final counting of the distinct subgroups arising from this process is straightforward.\nI should re-verify the fact that for j odd, <r^(j*2^k)> = <r^(2^k)>.\nThis is true because the order of r^(2^k) is 256/2^k = 2^(8-k). For j to be a generator of Z_N, gcd(j, N) must be 1. Here, j is odd, and N is a power of 2, so gcd(j, N)=1. Therefore, j is a generator of the group of units of Z_N, and thus raising the generator of the cyclic group <r^(2^k)> to the power j gives another generator of the same group. Correct.\n\nSo there is one power subgroup for each 2-adic valuation of m from 0 to 7, plus one for all m with valuation 8 or more.\nv2(m)=0 -> G\nv2(m)=1 -> <r^2>\n...\nv2(m)=7 -> <r^128>\nv2(m)>=8 -> <e>\n\nThis is 9 distinct subgroups. The logic seems very sound. I do not think more searches will provide a direct answer. I have to rely on this derivation. The definitions were found and confirmed through the searches. Properties of semidihedral groups were also confirmed. It's time to construct the final answer based on this derivation.\n\nFinal check of the argument.\nLet G = SD_512.\nPower subgroups are H_m = <g^m | g in G>.\nExponent of G is 256. So we need to check m from 0 to 255.\nH_0 = <e>.\nIf m is odd, g -> g^m is a bijection on G, so H_m = G. All odd m give G. (1 subgroup)\nIf m = 2k. H_m is generated by {(r^i)^(2k), ((r^i)s)^(2k) | i=0..255}.\n(r^i)^(2k) = r^(2ik).\n((r^i)s)^(2k) = (((r^i)s)^2)^k = (r^(128i))^k = r^(128ik).\nSo H_m is generated by the set {r^(2ik), r^(128ik) | i=0..255}.\nThis set generates the subgroup <r^(gcd(2k, 128k))>. Wait, no.\nThe subgroup is generated by the set of all r^(2ik) and all r^(128ik).\nThe subgroup generated by {r^(2ik)} is <r^(2k)>.\nThe subgroup generated by {r^(128ik)} is <r^(128k)>.\nSo H_m = <r^(2k), r^(128k)>.\nLet's analyze v2(m).\nm = 2^a * j, j is odd, a>0. So k = 2^(a-1)*j.\nH_m = <r^(2*2^(a-1)*j), r^(128*2^(a-1)*j)> = <r^(2^a * j), r^(2^7 * 2^(a-1) * j)> = <r^(j*2^a), r^(j*2^(a+6))>.\nThis simplifies to <r^(j*2^a)> as seen before.\nSince j is odd, <r^(j*2^a)> = <r^(2^a)>.\nSo for a=1, m has v2(m)=1, H_m = <r^2>.\nFor a=2, m has v2(m)=2, H_m = <r^4>.\n...\nFor a=8, m has v2(m)=8 (e.g. m=256), H_m = <r^256> = <e>.\nWe must also consider m=0. H_0=<e>. H_256 also gives <e>.\nWhat about m > 256? Let m=257. It's odd, so H_257=G. This doesn't add new subgroups.\nThe exponent of the group is Exp(G)=256. Any power subgroup H_m is equal to H_gcd(m, Exp(G)).\nLet's check this theorem. This seems plausible. If so, we only need to check the divisors of 256.\nThe divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nm=1: H_1=G.\nm=2: H_2=<r^2>.\nm=4: H_4=<r^4>.\n...\nm=128: H_128=<r^128>.\nm=256: H_256=<e>.\nThis gives 9 subgroups.\nThis confirms my previous result. The argument holds.I have already performed a detailed analysis of the power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512. The initial search provided the definition of a power subgroup and the presentation of a semidihedral group. My derivation proceeded as follows:\n\n1.  I identified the semidihedral group of order 512 as SD_512, which has the presentation G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(127)>.\n2.  I determined that the exponent of this group is 256.\n3.  I defined a power subgroup H_m as the subgroup generated by the m-th powers of all elements in G, i.e., H_m = <g^m | g ∈ G>.\n4.  I analyzed H_m based on the 2-adic valuation of m (the largest power of 2 that divides m).\n5.  For odd m (v2(m)=0), I found that H_m = G.\n6.  For even m, where m = 2^k * j with j being odd and k ≥ 1, I deduced that H_m is generated by <r^(m)> and <r^(128 * m/2)>. This simplified to H_m = <r^(2^k)>.\n7.  This shows that the distinct power subgroups are determined by the 2-adic valuation of m.\n8.  The distinct power subgroups are:\n    *   v2(m) = 0: G\n    *   v2(m) = 1: <r^2>\n    *   v2(m) = 2: <r^4>\n    *   v2(m) = 3: <r^8>\n    *   v2(m) = 4: <r^16>\n    *   v2(m) = 5: <r^32>\n    *   v2(m) = 6: <r^64>\n    *   v2(m) = 7: <r^128>\n    *   v2(m) ≥ 8: <e> (the trivial subgroup)\n9.  Counting these distinct subgroups gives a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe performed searches have confirmed the definition of the semidihedral group and its properties as a 2-group, which supports my derivation. I am confident in the result.\n\n<<<9>>>"
