    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. It is comprised of 20 intersecting triangular faces. The outer-hull, or convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The surface of the regular icosahedron is therefore already a triangulation. The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for this triangulation that is visible from the outside. Since the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron, which is already composed of 20 triangular faces, the minimal number of triangles is simply the number of its faces.\n\nAny further division of these 20 triangles would result in a larger number of total triangles. Thus, the most minimal triangulation is the surface of the icosahedron itself.\n\n<<<20>>>"
