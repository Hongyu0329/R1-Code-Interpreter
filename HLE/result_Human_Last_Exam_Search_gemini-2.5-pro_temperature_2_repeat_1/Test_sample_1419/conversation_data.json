    "Near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in the ϕ^4 theory is directly proportional to ϵ, where ϵ = 4 - d, and d is the spatial dimension. This result is obtained through the epsilon expansion, a perturbative approach in quantum field theory used to study critical phenomena.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant `u` is described by the beta function, which, to one-loop order, is given by:\n\nβ(u) = ϵu - Bu^2\n\nHere, `B` is a positive constant that depends on the specific conventions used. A fixed point `u*` of the RG flow is found by setting the beta function to zero (β(u*) = 0).\n\nSolving for `u*` gives:\n\nϵu* - Bu*^2 = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. For the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nThe specific value of the constant `B` depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. In many standard field theory texts, the beta function is written as β(u) = -ϵu + (3/16π²)u², which would yield a different constant. However, the search results point to a general form where the leading order term is proportional to ϵ. For instance, one of the provided documents specifies the beta function in a form that leads to `u* = ϵ/3b`, where `b` is another constant. Regardless of the specific constant in the denominator, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = ϵ / B (where B is a constant)>>>"
