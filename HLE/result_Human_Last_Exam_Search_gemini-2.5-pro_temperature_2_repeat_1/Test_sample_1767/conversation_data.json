    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are brought into lateral contact with a negligible tunneling barrier, the topological properties of the junction are determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\nThe number of topologically protected chiral edge states that form at the interface between two regions with different topological invariants is given by the absolute difference of their Chern numbers. In this specific case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number (C) of 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is:\n|C_1 - C_2| = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nSince the number of chiral edge states at the junction is zero, the junction itself is considered topologically trivial. A system's Chern number corresponds to the number of its chiral edge states. Consequently, the Chern number of this junction is 0.\n\nIt is important to note that while the individual bulk materials on either side of the junction are topologically non-trivial (C=1), the interface between them does not host any topologically protected conducting channels.\n\n<<<0>>>"
