    "The provided algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`, converts a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. To determine its computational time complexity, we analyze the number of fundamental operations performed as a function of the input size.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;`\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_0 := x - qc;`\n    This step involves a few assignments, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Assuming these are elementary operations that take constant time, this step has a time complexity of O(1).\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Inside the loop, the value of `q` is repeatedly updated by dividing the previous `x` (which was the old `q`) by the base `c`.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q`. In each iteration `k`, the value of `q` is approximately `n / c^k`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^i` becomes less than 1.\n    *   Mathematically, the loop runs as long as `c^i ≤ n`. By taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides, we get `i ≤ log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of times the loop executes is proportional to `log_c(n)`. This is because with each iteration, we are essentially determining one digit of the number `n` in base `c`, and the total number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n\n3.  **Operations within the loop (Step 2.1):**\n    *   `i := i + 1;` (1 operation)\n    *   `x := q;` (1 operation)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division)\n    *   `a_i := x - qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction)\n    Each iteration consists of a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations. Therefore, the work done inside the loop is constant, or O(1), for each iteration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe total computational time complexity of the algorithm is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop.\n\n*   **Number of iterations:** O(log_c(n))\n*   **Complexity per iteration:** O(1)\n\nThus, the total time complexity is `O(1) * O(log_c(n)) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\nAccording to the change of base rule for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (an integer `≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are omitted. Therefore, the complexity can be expressed as O(log n).\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
