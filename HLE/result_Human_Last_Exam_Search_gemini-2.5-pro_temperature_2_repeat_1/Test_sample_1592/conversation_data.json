    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is **Ontario**.\n\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish, situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Northern Quebec. The traditional territory of the Cree people in this region extends across the provincial border into what is now northern Ontario.\n\nThe close proximity is evident as the distance to the Ontario community of Moose Factory is approximately 133 kilometers to the west. While there isn't a direct road connecting the two communities across James Bay, their geographical nearness highlights that Ontario is the closest province. The other provinces bordering Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, are located significantly farther to the east and southeast. The territory of Nunavut lies to the north, across the waters of James and Hudson Bay.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
