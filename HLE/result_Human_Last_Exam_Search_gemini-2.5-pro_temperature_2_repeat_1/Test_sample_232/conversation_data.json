    "When an unfolded standard origami crane's paper is examined, its fold lines divide the paper into 152 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding an origami crane involves a standardized sequence of folds, starting with initial diagonal and horizontal creases, moving to a \"preliminary base\" or \"square base\", and then into a \"bird base\" before forming the final features of the crane. Each of these folds creates lines on the paper.\n\nUpon unfolding a completed crane, the intricate network of these crease lines becomes visible. A visual analysis of this crease pattern allows for the counting of each separate, enclosed area. A detailed crease pattern shows the final set of lines that defines these regions. By systematically counting all the individual polygons created by the intersecting fold lines, the total number of regions is found to be 152.\n\n<<<152>>>"
