    "There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\" as a new name. \"Azikiwe\" has always been a part of his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nHowever, the use and emphasis of his middle name \"Azikiwe\" became a subject of public discussion and some controversy around 2010. During his presidential declaration in September of that year, he reportedly used different variations of his name, including \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" and \"Dr. Goodluck Azikiwe Ebele Jonathan\". This led to speculation and criticism that he was strategically using the name to gain political favor with the Igbo ethnic group, from which the prominent Nigerian figure Nnamdi Azikiwe hailed.\n\nSome accounts suggest that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\n<<<There is no specific year in which Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan first publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe,\" as it has always been a part of his given name. However, his use of the name in public political discourse became more prominent and a point of public discussion in 2010.>>>"
