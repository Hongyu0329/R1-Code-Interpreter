    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a hitter wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in three specific statistical categories in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\nHistorically, there have been 10 players who have won the Triple Crown 12 times in the American or National Leagues. The most recent winner was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, which was the first time the feat had been accomplished in 45 years.\n\nHowever, in 2020, MLB officially recognized the statistics of several Negro Leagues as major league records. This decision added to the total number of Triple Crown winners. When including the Negro Leagues, there are a total of 27 players who have won the Triple Crown.\n\nHere is a list of the MLB Triple Crown winners from the American and National Leagues:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878)\n\nIncluding the winners from the Negro Leagues:\n*   **Ted Strong** (1942)\n*   **Lennie Pearson** (1942)\n*   **Josh Gibson** (1936, 1937)\n*   **Willie Wells** (1930)\n*   **Mule Suttles** (1926)\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (1921, 1924, 1925)\n*   **Heavy Johnson** (1923)\n\n<<<17>>>"
