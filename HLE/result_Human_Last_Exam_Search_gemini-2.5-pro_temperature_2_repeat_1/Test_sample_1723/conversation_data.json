    "Contrary to the premise of the question, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While a number of fungi are blue in color, their spore prints are of different hues.\n\nSpore prints are a crucial tool for mushroom identification, and their colors are generally in the range of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, and black. Some unusual spore colors like orange and green exist, but blue is not among them.\n\nSeveral well-known blue-colored mushrooms illustrate this point:\n*   The genus *Lactarius*, specifically the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*), is a vibrant blue but produces a cream-colored spore print.\n*   The genus *Entoloma* contains the strikingly blue species *Entoloma hochstetteri*, also known as the sky-blue mushroom, which has a pink spore print.\n*   Species in the genus *Stropharia*, such as the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*), have a purple-black to purple-brown spore print.\n*   The Wood Blewit (*Clitocybe nuda*) can have a bluish hue but has pale pink spores.\n\nTherefore, the assertion of a mushroom genus with a blue spore print is not supported by current mycological knowledge.\n\n<<<There is no mushroom genus known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
