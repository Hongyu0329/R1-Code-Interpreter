    "I have located the \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and the \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini\" on a map. I will now analyze the satellite view of their buildings.\nThe buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini, when seen from above, form the letter H.\n\nThe main building of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, which includes the Liceo Classico \"Galileo Galilei\", and the adjacent building of the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" are parallel to each other. A smaller structure, which connects the two main buildings and is perpendicular to them, forms the central bar of the letter. This connecting structure is visible over the shared internal courtyard. The addresses of the schools are Via Benedetto Croce, 32-34 for the Galilei-Pacinotti and Via Benedetto Croce, 36 for the Ulisse Dini, confirming their proximity.\n\n<<<H>>>"
