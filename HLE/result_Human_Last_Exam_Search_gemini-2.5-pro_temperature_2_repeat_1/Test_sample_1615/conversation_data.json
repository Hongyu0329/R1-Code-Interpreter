    "According to Brooks's theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $\\Delta(G)$, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the graph $G$:\n*   It has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n*   It has a maximum degree of $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nA general upper bound for the chromatic number of any graph is $\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1$. The maximum degree of a graph with 12345 vertices cannot exceed $12345 - 1 = 12344$. Thus, $\\Delta(G) \\leq 12344$. This implies that the chromatic number is at most $\\chi(G) \\leq 12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n\nThe chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is equal to the number of vertices $n$ if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph $K_n$. Since the problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than 12345. This means the maximum number of colours is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if 12344 is achievable, we need to find a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n*   This graph $G$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   This graph is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n    *   The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n    *   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have found a graph that satisfies the given conditions and requires 12344 colours, and we have established that no such graph can require more than 12344 colours, the maximum number of colours needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
