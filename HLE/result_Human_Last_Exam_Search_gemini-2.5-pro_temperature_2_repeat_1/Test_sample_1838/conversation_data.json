    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that make up the line. Here are the steps and calculations:\n\n### 1. Calculate Initial Values\n\nFirst, we determine the change in x and y (delta x and delta y) to understand the slope of the line.\n\n*   **Endpoint 1 (x1, y1):** (1, 1)\n*   **Endpoint 2 (x2, y2):** (11, 5)\n*   **dx (Δx):** x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   **dy (Δy):** y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n### 2. Determine the Decision Parameter\n\nBresenham's algorithm uses a decision parameter to determine the next pixel to plot, using only integer arithmetic.\n\nThe initial decision parameter (p) is calculated as:\n*   p = 2 * dy - dx\n*   p = 2 * 4 - 10\n*   p = 8 - 10 = -2\n\n### 3. Plotting the Pixels\n\nWe start at the first point (1, 1) and iterate along the x-axis, deciding the y-coordinate for each step.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plotting of the pixels:\n\n*   **Pixel 1:** (1, 1). The initial decision parameter is -2.\n*   **Pixel 2:** Since p is negative, the next pixel is (x+1, y), which is (2, 1). We update the decision parameter: p = p + 2 * dy = -2 + 8 = 6.\n*   **Pixel 3:** Since p is positive, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), which is (3, 2). The decision parameter is updated: p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n*   **Pixel 4:** With a negative p, the next pixel is (x+1, y), resulting in (4, 2). The decision parameter becomes: p = p + 2 * dy = -6 + 8 = 2.\n*   **Pixel 5:** With a positive p, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), which is (5, 3). The new decision parameter is: p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n*   **Pixel 6:** As p is negative, the next pixel is (x+1, y), resulting in (6, 3). We update the decision parameter: p = p + 2 * dy = -10 + 8 = -2.\n*   **Pixel 7:** With a negative p, the next pixel is (x+1, y), which is (7, 3). The decision parameter becomes: p = p + 2 * dy = -2 + 8 = 6.\n*   **Pixel 8:** Since p is positive, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), which is (8, 4). The new decision parameter is: p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n*   **Pixel 9:** As p is negative, the next pixel is (x+1, y), resulting in (9, 4). We update the decision parameter: p = p + 2 * dy = -6 + 8 = 2.\n*   **Pixel 10:** With a positive p, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), which is (10, 5). The decision parameter becomes: p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n*   **Pixel 11:** With a negative p, the next pixel is (x+1, y), our endpoint (11, 5).\n\nThe complete list of pixels for the line is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are 11 pixels in total. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
