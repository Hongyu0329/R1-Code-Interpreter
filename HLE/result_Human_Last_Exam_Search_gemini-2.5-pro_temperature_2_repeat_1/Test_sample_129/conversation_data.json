    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we will systematically enumerate all possible valid structures and then count the number of assignments of T (True) and F (False) that result in a true expression. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |. Parentheses are used to override this precedence. An expression is considered \"written\" as a specific string of 5 symbols.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the valid 5-symbol structures and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n### 1. Simple Parenthesized Expressions: `(v op v)`\nThis structure uses 5 symbols: `(`, a variable `v`, an operator `op`, another variable `v`, and `)`. The variables can be T or F, and the operator can be `&` or `|`.\n\n*   `(T & T)`: This is true. (1)\n*   Expressions with `|`: An OR expression is true unless both operands are false.\n    *   `(T | T)`: True (1)\n    *   `(T | F)`: True (1)\n    *   `(F | T)`: True (1)\n*   Total for this structure: **4**\n\n### 2. Three-Variable Expressions: `v op v op v`\nThese expressions have the form of three variables and two operators, for a total of 5 symbols. Associativity is handled by the precedence rules.\n\n*   `v | v | v`: An expression with only ORs is true if at least one variable is T. Out of the 2Â³ = 8 possible assignments of T/F, only `F|F|F` is false. So, there are **7** true expressions.\n*   `v & v & v`: An expression with only ANDs is true only if all variables are T. Only `T&T&T` is true. This gives **1** true expression.\n*   `v | v & v`: Precedence rules parse this as `v | (v & v)`. This expression is true if the first variable is T, or if the second two form a true `&` expression.\n    *   If the first `v` is `T`: There are 4 combinations for the other two variables (`T&T`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`), all resulting in a true expression (e.g., `T|T&F`). (4)\n    *   If the first `v` is `F`: The `v&v` part must be true, which only happens for `T&T`. This gives `F|T&T`. (1)\n    *   Total: **5** true expressions.\n*   `v & v | v`: Precedence rules parse this as `(v & v) | v`. This is symmetric to the previous case and also has **5** true expressions.\n\n### 3. Expressions with the NOT Operator `!`\n\n*   `!v op !v`: These are 5-symbol strings like `!T|!F`.\n    *   `!v | !v`: `(!v)|(!v)`. This is true unless both `!v` are false (i.e., both `v` are T). The false case is `!T|!T`. The true cases are `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`. Total: **3** true expressions.\n    *   `!v & !v`: `(!v)&(!v)`. This is true only if both `!v` are true (i.e., both `v` are F). The only true case is `!F&!F`. Total: **1** true expression.\n\n*   `!!v op v`: These are 5-symbol strings like `!!T|F`, parsed as `(!(!v)) op v`, which simplifies to `v op v`.\n    *   `!!v | v` (`v|v`): True unless both variables are F (`!!F|F`). The 3 true expressions are `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. Total: **3**.\n    *   `!!v & v` (`v&v`): True only for `T&T`. The expression is `!!T&T`. Total: **1**.\n*   `v op !!v`: Symmetric to the above.\n    *   `v | !!v`: **3** true expressions (`T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`).\n    *   `v & !!v`: **1** true expression (`T&!!T`).\n\n### 4. Special Parenthesized Structures\n\n*   `!(!v)`: Written as `!, (, !, v, )`, this has 5 symbols. The expression `!(!T)` evaluates to `!(F)`, which is `T`. The expression `!(!F)` evaluates to `!(T)`, which is `F`. So, there is **1** true expression: `!(!T)`.\n*   `!!(v)`: Written as `!, !, (, v, )`, this has 5 symbols. The expression `!!(T)` parses as `!(!(T))`, which is `!F` or `T`. The expression `!!(F)` is `!(!(F))` or `!T` or `F`. So, there is **1** true expression: `!!(T)`.\n*   `(!!v)`: Written as `(, !, !, v, )`. `(!!T)` simplifies to `(T)`, which is true. `(!!F)` simplifies to `(F)`, which is false. So, there is **1** true expression: `(!!T)`.\n*   `((v))`: Written as `(, (, v, ), )`. `((T))` is true. `((F))` is false. So, there is **1** true expression: `((T))`.\n\n### Total Count\n\nSumming up the counts from all the distinct structures:\n*   ` (v op v) `: 4\n*   ` v|v|v `: 7\n*   ` v&v&v `: 1\n*   ` v|v&v `: 5\n*   ` v&v|v `: 5\n*   ` !v|!v `: 3\n*   ` !v&!v `: 1\n*   ` !!v|v `: 3\n*   ` v|!!v `: 3\n*   ` !!v&v `: 1\n*   ` v&!!v `: 1\n*   ` !(!T) `: 1\n*   ` !!(T) `: 1\n*   ` (!!T) `: 1\n*   ` ((T)) `: 1\n\nTotal = 4 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **38**.\n\n"
