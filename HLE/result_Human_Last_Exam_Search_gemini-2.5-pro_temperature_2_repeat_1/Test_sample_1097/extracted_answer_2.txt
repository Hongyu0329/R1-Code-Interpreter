The set M you should define is a closed subset of the Banach space of continuous functions on, C. Specifically, M is defined as a closed ball of radius R centered at the zero function, restricted to functions that satisfy the boundary conditions:

**M = {u ∈ C | u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0, and ||u||_∞ ≤ R}**

where `||u||_∞` is the supremum norm `max_{x∈[0,1]} |u(x)|`.

The radius R > 0 is a sufficiently small constant chosen to ensure two conditions are met:
1.  **T maps M into M (T(M) ⊆ M):** For any function `u ∈ M`, we must have `||Tu||_∞ ≤ R`. This leads to the condition `(e^R)/8 ≤ R`.
2.  **T is a contraction on M:** There must exist a constant `k < 1` such that for all `u, v ∈ M`, `||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ k ||u - v||_∞`. This leads to the condition `(e^R)/8 < 1`, which simplifies to `R < ln(8)`.

By choosing an `R` that satisfies both conditions (for instance, `R = 1` works as `e/8 ≈ 0.34 < 1`), M becomes a complete metric space on which the operator T is a contraction. The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem then guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in M, which is the unique solution to the BVP.
