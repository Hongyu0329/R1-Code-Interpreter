    "Let $C$ be a genus 3 Riemann surface and $X$ its 15th symmetric power, denoted as $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, depends on the geometry of the curve $C$. We can determine the smallest and largest possible values for this rank by analyzing its relationship with the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of $C$.\n\nThe Néron-Severi group, $NS(X)$, is the group of divisors on $X$ modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank $\\rho(X)$ is a fundamental invariant of the variety. For the symmetric power of a curve, there is a well-established formula connecting its Néron-Severi group to that of the curve's Jacobian variety, $J(C)$.\n\nAccording to a theorem by H. Lange, for a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, the Néron-Severi group of its $d$-th symmetric power $C_d$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus NS(J(C))$ for all $d \\ge g$. In this problem, we have $g=3$ and $d=15$, so the condition $d \\ge g$ is satisfied. This isomorphism implies a direct relationship between the ranks:\n$\\rho(\\text{Sym}^{15}(C)) = \\text{rk}(\\mathbb{Z}) + \\rho(J(C)) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n\nTherefore, finding the smallest and largest possible ranks for $NS(X)$ is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum possible ranks for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety is always at least 1. The minimum value is achieved for a \"generic\" curve. For a very general Riemann surface $C$ of genus 3, its Jacobian variety $J(C)$ has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1.\n\nThus, the minimum possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1. Substituting this into our formula gives the smallest possible rank for $X$:\n$\\rho(X)_{\\text{min}} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{\\text{min}} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nFor a general genus 3 curve, the Néron-Severi rank of its 15th symmetric power is 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a complex abelian variety of dimension $g$ is bounded by $g^2$. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the dimension is $g=3$, so the maximum possible rank is $3^2=9$.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved when the Jacobian has complex multiplication by a large algebra of endomorphisms. Such abelian varieties are sometimes called \"singular\" (in the sense of having a large endomorphism ring). A key question is whether a Jacobian of a smooth curve can actually achieve this theoretical maximum. It is known that for $g=3$, this is indeed possible. A prominent example is the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = 1$, which is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and its Néron-Severi group has the maximal rank of $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9. Substituting this into our formula gives the largest possible rank for $X$:\n$\\rho(X)_{\\text{max}} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{\\text{max}} = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\nIn conclusion, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10, depending on the specific choice of the curve.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
