In the CCSD method, beyond the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants for which the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are explicitly zeroed by the amplitude equations, these matrix elements are also zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, which limits the connectivity of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ to generate, at most, quadruply excited determinants when acting on the reference determinant.
