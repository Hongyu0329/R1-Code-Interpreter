The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the protein target associated with CHEMBL4803817 (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14) include a range of compounds from high-throughput screening hits to approved drugs. Key examples are RU-0415529, its highly potent derivative TDI-015051, and existing drugs like conivaptan, hesperidin, glycyrrhizic acid, and ritonavir. Additionally, numerous other small molecule inhibitors have been identified through various screening campaigns.
