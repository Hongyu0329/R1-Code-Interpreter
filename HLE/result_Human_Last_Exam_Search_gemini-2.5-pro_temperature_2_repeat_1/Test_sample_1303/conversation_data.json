    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is associated with research into inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein, which has both exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (MTase) activities crucial for viral replication. Various small molecules have been identified that form protein-ligand interactions with this target.\n\nA significant screening effort led to the discovery of numerous small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14-MTase enzyme. In one study, three successive rounds of structure-based virtual screening against different molecular libraries initially identified 19 inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 3.5 μM to 341 μM. Subsequent optimization resulted in a more potent compound. Further in silico screening and in vitro testing identified 80 active hit molecules with IC50 values between 1.45 μM and 33.27 μM. An additional round of screening and testing revealed another 32 inhibitory compounds with IC50 values from 2.18 μM to 30.79 μM.\n\nSpecific small molecules that have been reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 include:\n\n*   **RU-0415529**: Identified through high-throughput screening, this molecule inhibits SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a ternary complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).\n*   **TDI-015051**: An optimized derivative of RU-0415529 with high potency, exhibiting a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM in a cell-based assay. It also functions by stabilizing the SAH-bound state of the enzyme.\n*   **Conivaptan, Hesperidin, and Glycyrrhizic acid**: These approved drugs were identified through virtual screening as potential inhibitors. Hesperidin was noted to interact with all five catalytic residues of the N7-MTase domain.\n*   **Ritonavir**: This antiviral drug is suggested to bind to the exoribonuclease active site of NSP14.\n*   **SS148**: This compound was identified as a competitive inhibitor of the NSP14 methyltransferase activity.\n*   A high-throughput screen of FDA-approved drugs identified **12 inhibitors** of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 N7-MTase.\n\nFurthermore, the human protein SIRT5 has been found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been shown to reduce viral replication, suggesting that small molecules targeting this interaction could also be of interest.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the protein target associated with CHEMBL4803817 (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14) include a range of compounds from high-throughput screening hits to approved drugs. Key examples are RU-0415529, its highly potent derivative TDI-015051, and existing drugs like conivaptan, hesperidin, glycyrrhizic acid, and ritonavir. Additionally, numerous other small molecule inhibitors have been identified through various screening campaigns.>>>"
