    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This algorithm is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers and involves successive divisions with remainders. An equivalent and often more practical method, especially when the leading coefficient matrix of the divisor is singular, is to use elementary row operations on a block matrix formed by the given matrices.\n\nLet the given matrices be:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n-s - 1, 1]\n\nWe form the block matrix M by stacking P1 and P2:\nM =\n[s^2 + s, -s  ]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2 ]\n[s,       0   ]\n[-s - 1,  1   ]\n\nThe GCRD can be found by reducing this matrix to a simpler form using elementary row operations, which include:\n1. Swapping two rows.\n2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe goal is to obtain a matrix whose non-zero rows form a basis for the row space of M. This basis will be the GCRD.\n\nThe reduction process is as follows:\n\n1.  Let the rows be R1, R2, R3, and R4. We can simplify the matrix by adding a multiple of one row to another.\n    *   Replace R4 with R4 + R3: `[-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [s^2 + s, -s  ]\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2 ]\n    [s,       0   ]\n    [-1,      1   ]\n\n2.  Now use the new R4 to simplify other rows.\n    *   Replace R3 with R3 + s*R4: `[s + s*(-1), 0 + s*1] = [0, s]`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [s^2 + s, -s  ]\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2 ]\n    [0,       s   ]\n    [-1,      1   ]\n\n3.  Use the new R3 to simplify R1 and R2.\n    *   Replace R1 with R1 + R3: `[s^2 + s, -s + s] = [s^2 + s, 0]`.\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 - s*R3: `[-s^2 - 1, s^2 - s*s] = [-s^2 - 1, 0]`.\n    The matrix is now:\n    [s^2 + s,   0]\n    [-s^2 - 1,  0]\n    [0,         s]\n    [-1,        1]\n\n4.  Simplify the first two rows.\n    *   Replace R1 with R1 + R2: `[s^2 + s - s^2 - 1, 0] = [s - 1, 0]`.\n    The matrix is:\n    [s - 1,     0]\n    [-s^2 - 1,  0]\n    [0,         s]\n    [-1,        1]\n\n5.  Continue to simplify.\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 + s*R1: `[-s^2 - 1 + s*(s-1), 0] = [-s - 1, 0]`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [s - 1,     0]\n    [-s - 1,    0]\n    [0,         s]\n    [-1,        1]\n\n6.  *   Replace R1 with R1 + R2: `[s - 1 - s - 1, 0] = [-2, 0]`.\n    The matrix is now:\n    [-2,        0]\n    [-s - 1,    0]\n    [0,         s]\n    [-1,        1]\n\n7.  *   Multiply R1 by -1/2: `[1, 0]`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [1,         0]\n    [-s - 1,    0]\n    [0,         s]\n    [-1,        1]\n\n8.  Use the new R1 to eliminate other entries.\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 + (s+1)*R1: `[0, 0]`.\n    *   Replace R4 with R4 + R1: `[0, 1]`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n   \n   \n    [0, s]\n   \n\n9.  Use the new R4 to simplify R3.\n    *   Replace R3 with R3 - s*R4: `[0, 0]`.\n    The matrix is now:\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nAfter removing the zero rows and reordering, we are left with:\n\n\n\nThis is the identity matrix. When the reduction of the concatenated matrix results in the identity matrix, it means that the original polynomial matrices are right coprime.\n\n"
