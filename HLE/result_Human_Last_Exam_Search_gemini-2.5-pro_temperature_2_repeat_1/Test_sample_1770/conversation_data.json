    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, a gene from the *phd* cluster, which is responsible for phenylpropanoid degradation, should be knocked out.\n\nThe degradation of p-coumaric acid and other phenylpropanoids in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* is carried out by a β-oxidative deacetylation pathway. The enzymes for this pathway are encoded by the *phd* gene cluster. This cluster contains several genes essential for the breakdown of these aromatic compounds.\n\nKey genes within this cluster whose knockout has been shown to prevent phenylpropanoid degradation include:\n*   ***phdA*** (cg0341)\n*   ***phdB*** (cg0344)\n*   ***phdC*** (cg0345)\n*   ***phdE*** (cg0347)\n\nThe deletion of any one of these genes—*phdA, phdB, phdC,* or *phdE*—has been demonstrated to eliminate the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on phenylpropanoids as a sole carbon source, indicating a halt in their degradation. Therefore, to ensure the accumulation of the desired p-coumaric acid, knocking out one of these genes is a crucial step in the metabolic engineering of the bacterium. In fact, the creation of a *C. glutamicum* platform strain for producing plant polyphenols involved the deletion of four gene clusters, including genes from the *phd* cluster, to prevent the breakdown of aromatic compounds.\n\nThe *phd* gene cluster also includes *phdD*, but its deletion specifically affects the degradation of α,β-saturated phenylpropanoids. Thus, targeting *phdA, phdB, phdC,* or *phdE* is more directly relevant for preventing p-coumaric acid degradation. The cluster is regulated by a repressor protein encoded by *phdR* (cg0343).\n\n<<<phdA, phdB, phdC, or phdE>>>"
