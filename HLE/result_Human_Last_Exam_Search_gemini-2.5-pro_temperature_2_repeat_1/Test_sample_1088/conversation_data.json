    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed value; it depends on the specific atoms that make up a molecule. To determine the total number of primitives, one must calculate the number for each atom and then sum them up based on the molecular formula.\n\nThe notation \"6-311G**\" can be broken down to understand how the number of primitive Gaussians is determined for each atom:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes a split-valence, triple-zeta basis set.\n    *   **6-**: The core electrons (the 1s orbital for first- and second-row atoms) are described by a single contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **-311**: The valence electrons are described by three contracted functions. These are formed from **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, respectively. For atoms beyond hydrogen, this applies to both the valence s and p orbitals.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: The two asterisks indicate the addition of polarization functions, which are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The first **\\*** adds a set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., all atoms except hydrogen and helium). In the context of Pople basis sets, this typically means a set of **6** Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   The second **\\*** adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This is a set of **3** p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\nBased on this, we can calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for individual atoms:\n\n### For a Hydrogen (H) atom:\n*   As hydrogen has no core electrons, only the valence description applies. The 1s orbital is described by the **-311** split, which means 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n*   The second asterisk (**\\***) adds a set of p-type polarization functions, which consists of **3** primitive p-Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen = 5 (s) + 3 (p) = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n### For a second-row \"heavy\" atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):\n*   The core 1s orbital is described by **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   The valence 2s orbital is described by the **-311** split, totaling 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n*   The valence 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z) share the same exponents and are also described by the **-311** split, adding another **5** p-type primitive Gaussians.\n*   The first asterisk (**\\***) adds a set of d-type polarization functions, consisting of **6** primitive d-Gaussians.\n*   **Total for a heavy atom (like C, N, or O) = 6 (core) + 5 (valence s) + 5 (valence p) + 6 (polarization d) = 22 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nTo find the total for a molecule, you multiply the number of primitives for each unique atom by the number of times that atom appears in the molecule and sum the results.\n\nFor example, in a water molecule (H₂O):\n*   One Oxygen atom: 22 primitives\n*   Two Hydrogen atoms: 2 × 8 = 16 primitives\n*   **Total for H₂O = 22 + 16 = 38 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nFor a methane molecule (CH₄):\n*   One Carbon atom: 22 primitives\n*   Four Hydrogen atoms: 4 x 8 = 32 primitives\n*   **Total for CH₄ = 22 + 32 = 54 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nTherefore, you must specify a molecule to get a single number for the total count of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set. As an example, for methane (CH₄), the answer is 54.\n\n<<<54>>>"
