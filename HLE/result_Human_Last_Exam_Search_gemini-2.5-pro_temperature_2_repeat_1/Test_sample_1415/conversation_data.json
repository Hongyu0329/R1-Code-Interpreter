    "The evaluation of the integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1 is given by the following steps.\n\nLet the integrand be `g(x) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This form is the result of the differentiation of `ln(F₃(x))` with respect to `x`. Therefore, the antiderivative of `g(x)` is `ln(F₃(x))`.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral can be evaluated as:\n`∫[from 0 to 1] g(x) dx = [ln(F₃(x))]` from 0 to 1 which equals `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\nThis expression can be simplified using the properties of logarithms to `ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`.\n\nNext, we calculate the values of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration, 0 and 1:\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the integral `V`:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\nUsing the computed values:\n*   `ln(2)` is approximately 0.6931.\n*   `sin(1)` (with 1 in radians) is approximately 0.8415.\n*   `e^(sin(1))` is approximately `e^0.8415` ≈ 2.3198.\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is approximately `ln(1 + 2.3198) = ln(3.3198)` ≈ 1.200.\n\nSo, `V ≈ ln(1.200 / 0.6931) ≈ ln(1.7314) ≈ 0.5489`.\n\nFor a more precise calculation:\n`V ≈ 0.548749`\n\nWe are asked to report the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * 0.548749 = 5487.49`\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.49 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
