    "The given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. To determine the values of $\\lambda$ for which there are no solutions, we can analyze the kernel of the integral and convert the equation into a system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, the kernel of the integral is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$. This can be expanded as a finite sum:\n$K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (also known as a degenerate kernel). We can substitute this expansion back into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u(y) dy$\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define the moments $c_k$ as:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the solution $u(x)$ takes the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nTo find the coefficients $c_i$, we substitute this expression for $u(y)$ back into the definition of $c_i$:\n$c_i = \\int_0^1 y^i \\left(1 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^{n-1-j}\\right) dy$\n$c_i = \\int_0^1 y^i dy + \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\int_0^1 y^{i+n-1-j} dy$\n$c_i = \\frac{1}{i+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{i+n-j}$\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. This can be written in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A)C = F$, where:\n*   $C$ is the column vector of coefficients $(c_0, \\dots, c_{n-1})^T$.\n*   $F$ is the column vector with entries $F_i = \\frac{1}{i+1}$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{i+n-j}$ for $i,j = 0, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this equation fails to have a solution if and only if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value (the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the operator/matrix A) and the forcing term $F$ is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. Since the kernel is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, the integral operator is self-adjoint, which simplifies the analysis. A solution fails to exist if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and the function $f(x)=1$ is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction $u^*(x)$.\n\nThe condition for having no solution becomes:\n1.  $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n2.  The orthogonality condition $\\int_0^1 f(x) u^*(x) dx \\neq 0$ is met.\n\nHere $f(x) = 1$, and $u^*(x)$ is the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\mu$. The eigenfunction has the form $u^*(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j^* x^{n-1-j}$, where $c^*$ is the eigenvector of $A$. The orthogonality condition is $\\int_0^1 (1) u^*(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's test for small values of $n$:\n\n*   **For n=1:** The kernel is $K(x,y)=1$. The equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$. This leads to a single equation for $c_0 = \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$: $c_0 = 1 + \\lambda c_0$, which gives $(1-\\lambda)c_0 = 1$. If $\\lambda = 1$, we get $0=1$, which is impossible. Thus, for $n=1$, there is no solution when $\\lambda = 1$.\n\n*   **For n=2:** The kernel is $K(x,y)=x+y$. The matrix $A$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation for this matrix is $\\det(A-\\mu I) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\mu^2 - \\mu - 1/12 = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The characteristic values are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, so $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. For these values of $\\lambda$, the integral of the corresponding eigenfunctions can be shown to be non-zero.\n\nThe problem asks for \"the values\" of $\\lambda$, which implies the answer should be independent of $n$ or there is a specific context for $n$ that is not provided. Without a specific value for $n$, the values of $\\lambda$ for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{i-j+n}$ (with $i,j$ from 0 to $n-1$), provided the corresponding eigenfunction has a non-zero integral over. As this generally holds, particularly for the principal eigenfunction, the set of such $\\lambda$ is non-empty. Since the question seems to seek a general answer, it is possible it refers to a property common to all $n$. However, based on the calculations, the specific values depend on $n$.\n\nAssuming the question seeks the most fundamental case or there might be a misunderstanding in the general applicability of the answer. Let's provide the answer for the simplest non-trivial case.\nFor n=1, $\\lambda=1$.\nFor n=2, $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nAs no specific `n` is provided and the results for different `n` are distinct, a single numerical answer cannot be provided. The answer must be expressed in terms of `n`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{i+n-j}$, for $i, j = 1, \\dots, n$.>>>"
