    "To determine the expected number of random English letters one must generate until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula from probability theory that accounts for overlapping patterns within the sequence itself.\n\nThe general formula for the expected waiting time, E, for a specific sequence (or \"word\") of length *N* from an alphabet of size *S* is:\n\nE = S^N + Σ (S^k)\n\nIn this formula:\n*   **S** is the size of the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters.\n*   **N** is the length of the target sequence. For \"TENETENET\", N = 9.\n*   The summation (Σ) is taken over the lengths, *k*, of all non-empty proper prefixes of the sequence that are also suffixes. A \"proper prefix\" is a prefix that is not equal to the entire string.\n\nFirst, we must identify the overlaps in the sequence \"TENETENET\". We look for prefixes that are also suffixes:\n\n*   \"**T**\" is a prefix and is also a suffix of \"TENETENE**T**\". The length of this overlap is 1.\n*   \"**TENET**\" is a prefix and is also a suffix of \"TENE**TENET**\". The length of this overlap is 5.\n*   \"**TENETEN**\" is a prefix and is also a suffix of \"TE**TENETEN**\". The length of this overlap is 7.\n\nThese are all the proper prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that also serve as suffixes.\n\nNow, we can apply these values to the formula for the expected time:\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁷ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁷ = 8,031,810,176\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,483,678,376\n\nAdding these values together:\nE = 5,429,483,678,376 + 8,031,810,176 + 11,881,376 + 26\n\nE = 5,437,527,369,954\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,437,527,369,954.\n\n<<<5437527369954>>>"
