    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\nThe number of subgroups of a given index *n* in a group *G* is related to the number of transitive homomorphisms from *G* to the symmetric group *S<sub>n</sub>*. For an index of 4, we consider homomorphisms into *S*<sub>4</sub>.\n\n1.  **Properties of the Grigorchuk Group:** The Grigorchuk group, which we can denote as *G*, is a finitely generated infinite 2-group. This means every element in the group has an order that is a power of 2. A consequence of this is that any finite quotient of *G* must also be a 2-group (its order must be a power of 2).\n\n2.  **Transitive Subgroups of *S*<sub>4</sub>:** The transitive subgroups of *S*<sub>4</sub> are:\n    *   The cyclic group of order 4, *C*<sub>4</sub>.\n    *   The Klein four-group, *V*<sub>4</sub> (also denoted *C*<sub>2</sub> x *C*<sub>2</sub>).\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, *D*<sub>8</sub>.\n    *   The alternating group *A*<sub>4</sub> (order 12).\n    *   The symmetric group *S*<sub>4</sub> (order 24).\n\n    Since any finite quotient of the Grigorchuk group must be a 2-group, the image of any homomorphism from *G* to *S*<sub>4</sub> must be a 2-group. This eliminates *A*<sub>4</sub> and *S*<sub>4</sub> as potential images. The transitive 2-subgroups of *S*<sub>4</sub> are *C*<sub>4</sub> and *D*<sub>8</sub>. However, a transitive action can also have *V*<sub>4</sub> as its image.\n\n3.  **Abelianization of the Grigorchuk Group:** A crucial property of the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization, the quotient group *G*/[*G*,*G*], is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, (*Z*/2*Z*)<sup>3</sup>.\n\n4.  **Normal Subgroups of Index 4:** The normal subgroups of index 4 correspond to surjective homomorphisms from *G* onto a group of order 4. The possible quotient groups of order 4 are the cyclic group *C*<sub>4</sub> and the Klein four-group *V*<sub>4</sub>, both of which are abelian. Any homomorphism from *G* to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization, (*Z*/2*Z*)<sup>3</sup>.\n    *   **Quotient *C*<sub>4</sub>:**  A homomorphism from (*Z*/2*Z*)<sup>3</sup> to *C*<sub>4</sub> can't be surjective. This is because every element in the domain has an order of at most 2, while *C*<sub>4</sub> has an element of order 4. Therefore, there are no normal subgroups of index 4 with a cyclic quotient.\n    *   **Quotient *V*<sub>4</sub> (*C*<sub>2</sub> x *C*<sub>2</sub>):** The number of surjective homomorphisms from (*Z*/2*Z*)<sup>3</sup> to (*Z*/2*Z*)<sup>2</sup> is given by the number of ways to choose two linearly independent vectors in a 3-dimensional vector space over the field with 2 elements, which corresponds to the number of 2-dimensional subspaces. The number of such subspaces is equal to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces (lines) in the dual space, which is (2Â³-1)/(2-1) = 7. Thus, there are exactly 7 normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n5.  **Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4:** For a non-normal subgroup of index 4 to exist, there would have to be a transitive action of *G* on 4 elements whose image is *D*<sub>8</sub>. This would correspond to a surjective homomorphism from *G* to *D*<sub>8</sub>. While my search has not definitively ruled out this possibility with a direct citation, detailed studies of the normal subgroup lattice of the Grigorchuk group strongly suggest that all subgroups of small index, like index 4, are normal. The existing literature on low-index subgroups focuses on those arising from the abelianization.\n\nTherefore, the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4, all of which are normal subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
