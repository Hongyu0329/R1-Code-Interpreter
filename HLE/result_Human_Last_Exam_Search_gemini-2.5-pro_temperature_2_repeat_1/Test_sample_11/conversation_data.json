    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law, enacted in 1973, marked a significant shift in Israeli contract law, which had previously been heavily influenced by English common law that lacked a general principle of good faith.\n\nSections 12 and 39 of the Contracts (General Part) Law are pivotal in this regard. Section 12 mandates that parties act in a \"customary manner and in good faith\" during the negotiation of a contract. Section 39 extends this obligation to the fulfillment of rights and obligations arising from a contract.\n\nThe introduction of the good faith principle was a far-reaching innovation in Israeli legislation, applying not only to the performance of an existing contract but also to the pre-contractual negotiation stage, irrespective of whether a contract is ultimately formed. This principle is considered a basic tenet of modern Israeli contract law.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
