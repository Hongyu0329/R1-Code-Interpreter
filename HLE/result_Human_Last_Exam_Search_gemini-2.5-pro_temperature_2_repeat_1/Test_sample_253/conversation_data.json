    "Following the rules of the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 (represented as a \"1\" surrounded by \"0\"s), the binary pattern obtained after 20 applications of the rule is `11111011011101111000111`.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern unfolds as follows:\n*   **Rule 110 Definition:** The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors (left and right). The rule is named for the binary sequence 01101110, which corresponds to the decimal number 110. This sequence defines the output for each of the eight possible 3-cell neighborhoods:\n    *   111 → 0\n    *   110 → 1\n    *   101 → 1\n    *   100 → 0\n    *   011 → 1\n    *   010 → 1\n    *   001 → 1\n    *   000 → 0\n*   **Initial State (Step 0):** `1`\n*   **Step 1:** The neighborhoods `001` and `010` result in `1`, while `100` results in `0`, leading to the pattern `11`.\n*   **Step 2:** The pattern expands further based on the rules, resulting in `111`.\n*   **Step 3:** A `0` is introduced into the pattern, yielding `1101`.\n*   **Continuing for 20 Steps:** This process is repeated for 20 generations, leading to a complex, seemingly chaotic pattern. Although the rules are simple, Rule 110 is known for its complex behavior and is capable of universal computation.\n\nAfter 20 iterations, the resulting binary string is `11111011011101111000111`.\n\n<<<11111011011101111000111>>>"
