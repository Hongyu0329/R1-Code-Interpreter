    "A Pauli channel for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is described by the following transformation on a density matrix ρ:\n\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\n\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this Pauli channel are given by $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. The channel $\\Lambda$ can be realized via a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometric embedding of the initial state into a larger system-environment Hilbert space, followed by tracing out the environment. The isometry $V$ is given by:\n\n$$ V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} (A_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E $$\n\nwhere $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the evolution of the environment and is obtained by tracing out the system:\n\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\text{Tr}_S(U_j \\rho U_k^\\dagger) |j\\rangle_E \\langle k|_E $$\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel, often referred to as the Choi rank, is the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$, is given by $(\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle|i\\rangle$ is a maximally entangled state.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is also equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ constructed from the Kraus operators of the original channel, with entries $G_{jk} = \\text{Tr}(A_j^\\dagger A_k)$.\n\nLet's compute the entries of this Gram matrix:\n\n$$ G_{jk} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)) = \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_k) $$\n\nDue to the orthonormality of the generalized Pauli operators, we have $\\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_k) = d \\cdot \\delta_{jk}$, where $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta. Therefore, the Gram matrix is:\n\n$$ G_{jk} = d \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\delta_{jk} $$\n\nThis is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $d \\cdot p_k$. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of its non-zero entries. The entries $G_{kk} = d \\cdot p_k$ are non-zero if and only if $p_k > 0$.\n\nThus, the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. To find the maximal rank, we need to consider a Pauli channel with the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities.\n\nThe total number of generalized Pauli operators is $d^2$. A valid Pauli channel can be constructed where each $p_k$ is non-zero. For example, the qudit depolarizing channel is a Pauli channel where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. In this case, all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-zero entries in the Gram matrix is $d^2$, which corresponds to the case where all probabilities $p_k$ are greater than zero.\n\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
