In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ as an inverse proportionality in frequency-momentum space. Specifically, for a given momentum k and Matsubara frequency iωₙ, the bare Green's function is given by the expression G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - ϵₖ).
