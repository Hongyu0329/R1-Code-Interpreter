    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀, for a non-interacting system exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship arises from the definition of the Green's function as a correlation function evaluated using the path integral, with an action that explicitly includes these energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions. In the context of the path integral formalism for fermions, it is defined as the time-ordered two-point correlation function:\n\nG₀(k, τ - τ') = -⟨T_τ cₖ(τ) c̄ₖ(τ')⟩\n\nwhere cₖ and c̄ₖ are Grassmann fields representing the fermionic annihilation and creation operators in the path integral, k is the momentum (or a general quantum number), and τ is imaginary time. The expectation value is calculated as a functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the action.\n\nThe key to understanding the dependence on ϵₖ lies in the action for a non-interacting system (S₀). When expressed in terms of the Grassmann fields in momentum and imaginary time space, the action is given by:\nS₀ = ∫ dτ Σₖ c̄ₖ(τ) (∂_τ + ϵₖ) cₖ(τ)\n\nHere, ϵₖ represents the energy of a single-particle state with quantum number k, relative to the chemical potential.\n\nTo find the Green's function, one introduces source terms into the path integral and takes functional derivatives, or, for this quadratic action, performs a Gaussian integral over the Grassmann fields. The most straightforward approach is to transform to frequency space. The imaginary-time fields are expressed as a sum over Matsubara frequencies (iωₙ):\n\ncₖ(τ) = (1/√β) Σₙ cₖ(iωₙ) e^(-iωₙτ)\n\nIn this frequency-momentum basis, the time derivative ∂_τ becomes -iωₙ, and the action simplifies to:\n\nS₀ = Σₖ,ₙ c̄ₖ(iωₙ) (-iωₙ + ϵₖ) cₖ(iωₙ)\n\nThe bare Green's function in this basis, G₀(k, iωₙ), is the inverse of the operator that is quadratic in the fields in the action. This leads directly to the expression:\n\n**G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - ϵₖ)**\n\nThis equation transparently shows the functional dependence. The bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the Matsubara frequency iωₙ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. The poles of the analytically continued Green's function (where iωₙ → ω + iη) are precisely at the single-particle energies ϵₖ, which physically represent the energies of the elementary excitations of the non-interacting system.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ as an inverse proportionality in frequency-momentum space. Specifically, for a given momentum k and Matsubara frequency iωₙ, the bare Green's function is given by the expression G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - ϵₖ)."
