    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor. This specific residue is Cysteine-364 (C364).\n\nThe GABAAρ1 subunit has a total of three cysteine residues. Two of these are located in the extracellular Cys-loop (C177 and C191), and the single remaining one is the C364 residue found in the intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-TM4 linker). This intracellular cysteine has been identified as a sensor for reactive oxygen species.\n\n<<<1>>>"
