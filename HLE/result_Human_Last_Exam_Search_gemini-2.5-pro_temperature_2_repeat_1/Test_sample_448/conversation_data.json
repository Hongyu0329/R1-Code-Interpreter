    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.**\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases, radon (Rn) is the least abundant. Its extreme rarity is a consequence of its radioactivity; it has no stable isotopes and its most stable isotope, ²²²Rn, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. Radon is formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which itself is a decay product of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust. Due to its short half-life, it quickly decays into other elements, resulting in a minuscule overall presence in Earth's matter at any given time.\n\nWhile xenon (Xe) is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases, with an atmospheric abundance of about 0.0000087%, its overall terrestrial abundance is higher than that of radon. Argon (Ar) is the most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, making up about 0.93% by volume.\n\nAnother noble gas, oganesson (Og), was first synthesized in 2002. However, as a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, it is not considered in the context of the rarest noble gas within terrestrial matter.\n\nTherefore, based on its radioactive nature and exceptionally short half-life, radon was the rarest noble gas as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
