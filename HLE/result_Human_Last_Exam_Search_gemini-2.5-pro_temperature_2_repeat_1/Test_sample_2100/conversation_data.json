    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem refers to Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer. The lines \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are from Voznesensky's work about Rezanov, likely the poem \"Story Under Full Sail\" or the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n\nNikolai Petrovich Rezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and envisioned a Russian colonization of Alaska and California. His story is also famously a tragic romance; he fell in love with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, during his expedition to California.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on March 8, 1807, while on his way back to St. Petersburg. His original gravesite was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. While a new memorial was erected in 2000, the precise location of his remains was a subject of uncertainty for a long time. The question of his final resting place, as posed by Voznesensky, began to be answered in the late 20th century.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
