The expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution, $\psi(y)$, in a parallel-plate microchannel of height $H$ under the given conditions is determined by solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

The governing equation for the EDL potential, assuming the Debye-Hückel approximation for low potentials, is:
$\frac{d^2\psi}{dy^2} = k^2 \psi$
where $k$ is the Debye-Hückel parameter.

The boundary conditions are defined by the zeta potentials at the two surfaces of the microchannel, located at $y=0$ (bottom) and $y=H$ (top).
The zeta potential at the bottom surface is given as $\psi(0) = z_{a1} = z_1(1+\beta k)$.
The zeta potential at the top surface is specified by the condition $z_2=0$, which results in $\psi(H) = 0$.

The general solution to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is:
$\psi(y) = A \cosh(ky) + B \sinh(ky)$

Applying the given boundary conditions to solve for the constants A and B:
1.  From $\psi(0) = z_1(1+\beta k)$, we get $A = z_1(1+\beta k)$.
2.  From $\psi(H) = 0$, we have $0 = A \cosh(kH) + B \sinh(kH)$.

Substituting the value of A into the second equation gives:
$0 = z_1(1+\beta k) \cosh(kH) + B \sinh(kH)$
$B = - z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\cosh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)} = - z_1(1+\beta k) \coth(kH)$

Substituting the constants A and B back into the general solution yields:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \cosh(ky) - z_1(1+\beta k) \coth(kH) \sinh(ky)$
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \left( \cosh(ky) - \frac{\cosh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)} \sinh(ky) \right)$

This expression can be simplified using the hyperbolic trigonometric identity $\sinh(X-Y) = \sinh(X)\cosh(Y) - \cosh(X)\sinh(Y)$:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(kH)\cosh(ky) - \cosh(kH)\sinh(ky)}{\sinh(kH)}$

Thus, the final expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution is:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)}$
