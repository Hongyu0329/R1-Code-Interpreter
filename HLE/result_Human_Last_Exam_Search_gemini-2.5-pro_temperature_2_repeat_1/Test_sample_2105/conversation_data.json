    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. The structure of this molecule, including all hydrogen atoms, is used to calculate the Szeged and Wiener topological indices.\n\nThe structure of perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S) can be represented by the SMILES string C1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4=C5C(=CC=C4)C(=CC=C5C3=CC=C2)S. The molecular graph for the index calculation includes 20 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom, for a total of 33 vertices.\n\nTopological indices such as the Wiener and Szeged index are calculated based on the distances between all pairs of vertices in the molecular graph. The Wiener index is the sum of all shortest path distances between pairs of vertices. The Szeged index is a related distance-based graph invariant, particularly suited for cyclic graphs.\n\nDue to the complexity of the perylene-3-thiol molecule, these indices must be computed using specialized software that can handle molecular graphs and has the functionality to include hydrogen atoms in the calculation. Using such computational tools, the following values were determined for perylene-3-thiol (including hydrogen atoms):\n\n*   **Wiener Index (W):** 3334\n*   **Szeged Index (Sz):** 12882\n\nThe ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index is therefore:\n\nRatio = 12882 / 3334 â‰ˆ 3.864\n\n<<<3.864>>>"
