A fully functional MRI receive coil might not show resonance when tested with a magnetic loop and VNA for several key reasons. Modern coils are often complex phased-arrays with sophisticated decoupling mechanisms designed to isolate the coil elements from each other, and by extension, from an external test loop. The geometry of the coil (e.g., a birdcage or a non-loop design like a dipole) may create an external magnetic field that does not couple effectively with a simple loop probe. Furthermore, receive coils incorporate active detuning circuits that, in an unpowered state on the bench, may leave the coil in a non-resonant mode. The coil's resonance is also optimized for when it is "loaded" by the patient; its properties when "unloaded" can be significantly different. Finally, the ability to measure the resonance is highly dependent on the precise positioning and orientation of the test loop, which can be difficult to determine for a complex coil.
