    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a tree-like structure. The operations on these matrices, such as matrix-matrix multiplication, are performed by traversing this tree and accessing the constituent submatrices, often referred to as generators (`D`, `U`, `V`, and `B` matrices).\n\nFor an HSS tree with a specified depth, we can determine the number of submatrices involved. Assuming a standard full binary tree structure where a depth of 4 corresponds to 5 levels of nodes (from level 0 at the root to level 4 at the leaves), the number of accessed submatrices during a matrix-matrix multiplication can be calculated.\n\nBased on a performance model for HSS matrix-matrix multiplication, the number of submatrices accessed for a tree of depth `d` is given by the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2d - 6.\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4 (`d=4`), the calculation is as follows:\n\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + (2 * 4) - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 8 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 2\n= 98\n\nTherefore, during a matrix multiplication involving an HSS tree of depth 4, a total of 98 submatrices are accessed.\n\n<<<98>>>"
