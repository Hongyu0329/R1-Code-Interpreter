    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Battle of Huj**.\n\nThis engagement, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, was immortalized by Lady Butler in her painting titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*. The painting captures a cavalry charge by units of the British 5th Mounted Brigade against a rearguard position of German, Austrian, and Turkish artillery and infantry. This event is considered one of the last classic cavalry charges in British military history.\n\nLady Butler painted other scenes from the First World War, including:\n*   ***The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted in 1927), depicting the Battle of Mons in 1914.\n*   ***Footballers at Loos***, showing an event from the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n*   ***The Charge of The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February, 1916***, portraying a charge from 1916.\n\nHowever, the 1917 Battle of Huj is the latest of these specific historical events that she depicted.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
