*   **Two Subsets:** The set of all rational numbers **Q** and the set of rational numbers in the interval, i.e., **Q ∩**.
*   **Equivalence Relation:** For two subsets X and Y of Q, X is equivalent to Y if X is homeomorphic to a subset of Y and Y is homeomorphic to a subset of X. This partitions the set of all subsets of Q into classes of homeomorphic spaces.
*   **Number of Equivalence Classes:** The number of equivalence classes is **2^ℵ₀** (the cardinality of the continuum).
