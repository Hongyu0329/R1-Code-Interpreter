    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide involves a selective reaction at the most reactive halogen atom. In organometallic reactions with polyhalogenated aromatic compounds, the reactivity of the halogens typically follows the order I > Br > Cl. This is because the Carbon-Iodine bond is the weakest, making it the most susceptible to both metal-halogen exchange and cross-coupling reactions.\n\nThe two primary competing pathways for this reaction are:\n1.  **Metal-Halogen Exchange:** The Grignard reagent can swap its magnesium-halide component with the iodine on the aromatic ring.\n2.  **Cross-Coupling (Kumada Reaction):** The phenyl group from the Grignard reagent can substitute the iodine atom. This type of reaction is often slow without a transition-metal catalyst (like nickel or palladium). Iron salts, which can be present as impurities, can also catalyze such couplings.\n\nGiven that no catalyst is mentioned in the reaction conditions, the most likely and fastest pathway is the metal-halogen exchange. The phenyl magnesium bromide will react with the most labile halogen, the iodine at the C-2 position, to form a new Grignard reagent, (2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide, and phenyl iodide as a byproduct.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   **Step 1: Metal-Halogen Exchange**\n    `C₆H₃Br₂I + C₆H₅MgBr → C₆H₃Br₂(MgBr) + C₆H₅I`\n    *(1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene + Phenyl magnesium bromide → (2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide + Phenyl iodide)*\n\n*   **Step 2: Aqueous Work-up**\n    The subsequent aqueous work-up quenches all remaining Grignard reagents by protonating them. The (2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide intermediate is protonated to yield the final product.\n    `C₆H₃Br₂(MgBr) + H₂O → C₆H₄Br₂ + Mg(OH)Br`\n    *((2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide + Water → 1,3-dibromobenzene + Hydroxymagnesium bromide)*\n\nThe excess phenyl magnesium bromide is also neutralized by the water to form benzene.\n\nTherefore, the main organic product of the reaction sequence is 1,3-dibromobenzene.\n\n<<<1,3-dibromobenzene>>>"
