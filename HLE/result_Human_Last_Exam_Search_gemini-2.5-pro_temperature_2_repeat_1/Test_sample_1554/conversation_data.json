    "While no Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher appears to have specifically decomposed the term \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals,\" the core of this distinction in the theory of signs can be attributed to **Kazimierz Twardowski**, the school's founder. Twardowski, in his work on semiotics, divided signs into two primary categories based on the nature of their connection to the entities they signify.\n\nAccording to Jacek Jadacki's analysis of the Lviv-Warsaw School's semiotics, Twardowski made the following distinction:\n*   **Symptoms**: These are signs that have a causal connection to what they signify. An example would be speech in relation to the thoughts it expresses, where the speech is a direct result of the mental activity. This connection is often an involuntary association.\n*   **Symbols**: These signs have a conventional or arbitrary connection to what they represent. For instance, a musical note represents a specific sound due to an established agreement or convention.\n\nThis fundamental division between naturally caused signs and conventional signs is a significant contribution of the Lviv-Warsaw School to the field of semiotics.\n\nIt is worth noting that other members of the school, such as Tadeusz Kotarbiński, also developed theories of signs. Some analyses suggest Kotarbiński discussed signs in terms of \"symptoms and signals\". This indicates that Twardowski's initial distinction was a foundational concept that may have been adopted and potentially refined by his students. The term \"signal\" is sometimes used interchangeably with or as a subcategory of \"symbol\" in semiotic theory, often referring to a sign intended to provoke a specific action.\n\nTherefore, while the specific term \"hallmark\" is not found in this context within the available research, the conceptual decomposition of signs into symptoms (natural, causal) and signals/symbols (conventional, purposeful) is a key element of the semiotic work initiated by Kazimierz Twardowski within the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Twardowski>>>"
