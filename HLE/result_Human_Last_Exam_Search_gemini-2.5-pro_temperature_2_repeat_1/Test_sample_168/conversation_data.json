    "An animal that might be able to hear human muscle twitches is the herring.\n\nThe sound produced by a contracting human muscle, known as phonomyography, is of a very low frequency. Studies show that the vibrations from these contractions are typically periodic with a frequency of about 25 Hz. Some research indicates that the peak frequency of these sounds is around 4.1 Hz and that most of the signal's power is below 40 Hz. Some sources even state the frequency is between 10 and 30 Hz for slow-twitch fibers and 30 to 70 Hz for fast-twitch fibers. Much of this sound is in the infrasound range, below the typical 20 Hz lower limit of human hearing.\n\nWhen comparing the hearing capabilities of the animals listed:\n*   **Human:** The typical hearing range is 20 to 20,000 Hz. While the upper range of muscle twitch sounds might just be audible, most of the sound is below what humans can normally detect.\n*   **Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 40 to 60,000 Hz, meaning they are much better at hearing high-frequency sounds than humans, but their low-frequency hearing doesn't extend as low as a human's.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their exceptional high-frequency hearing, often up to 200,000 Hz, which they use for echolocation. Their low-frequency hearing is poor, with the most sensitive species only hearing sounds as low as about 700 Hz.\n*   **Whale:** Baleen whales are specialized in hearing low frequencies and can hear sounds down to 15 Hz or even lower, which they use for long-distance communication.\n*   **Herring:** This fish is a low-frequency hearing specialist. Neurophysiological studies show responses to frequencies as low as 30 Hz. The hearing range of herring and their relatives can extend from below 100 Hz up to 4,000 Hz, with some species being able to detect sounds well above that. Notably, some members of the herring family (clupeids) have an auditory system that is specialized to sense infrasound, potentially allowing them to hear frequencies that are inaudible to humans.\n\nGiven that the sound of a human muscle twitch is very faint and occurs at extremely low frequencies (largely 5-40 Hz), the herring, with its specialized and highly sensitive low-frequency hearing, is a plausible candidate to be able to detect such a sound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
