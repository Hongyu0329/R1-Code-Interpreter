    "From the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign'\", we can trace its development into Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages through a series of regular sound changes. The PIE root is also the source of Latin *sāgīre*, \"to perceive keenly,\" and Hittite *sākizzi*, with a similar meaning. The cognate in Germanic took on the meaning of \"to seek.\"\n\nThe transformations into the requested languages are as follows:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** *\\*sōkīþi*\n    *   The PIE sequence `*seh₂g-` develops into PGmc `*sōk-`.\n    *   According to Grimm's Law, the PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes the voiceless velar stop `*k` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding vowel `*e` to `*a` which is then lengthened, resulting in the Proto-Germanic long vowel `*ō`.\n    *   The PIE third-person singular present indicative ending `*-eti` becomes `*-iþi` for this class of verbs in Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n    *   The Proto-Germanic root vowel `*ō` undergoes i-umlaut (mutation caused by a following `*i` or `*j`), changing it to `œ`.\n    *   The original Proto-Germanic ending `*-īþi` is lost and replaced with the standard Old Norse ending for the third-person singular present indicative of this verb class, `*-ir`.\n\n*   **Old English (OE):** *sēcp* (also written as *sēceþ*)\n    *   Similar to Old Norse, the PGmc vowel `*ō` is affected by i-umlaut, becoming `ē` in Old English.\n    *   The third-person singular ending `*-iþi` evolves into `*-eþ` or is contracted to `*-þ`. Thus, *sēceþ* is often contracted to *sēcp*.\n\n*   **Old High German (OHG):** *suochit*\n    *   In Old High German, the Proto-Germanic long vowel `*ō` diphthongized to `uo`.\n    *   The ending `*-iþi` became `*-it`.\n\nTherefore, the derivation from PIE *seh2gieti provides a clear example of the systematic sound laws that differentiate the Germanic languages from their Indo-European parent and from each other.\n\n<<<\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkīþi\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkir\n*   **Old English:** sēcp (or sēceþ)\n*   **Old High German:** suochit\n>>>"
