    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), we can use the generating functions method.\n\nLet \\(N(n)\\) be the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(x_1^2 + \\dots + x_s^2 = n\\).\nThe generating function for the number of ways to write an integer as a square of a non-negative integer is \\(\\Psi(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{k^2}\\).\nThe number of solutions to the given equation is the coefficient of \\(x^{2024}\\) in the expansion of \\(\\Psi(x)^5\\).\n\nThere is a known relationship between \\(\\Psi(x)\\) and the Jacobi theta function \\(\\Theta(x) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{k^2}\\), which is the generating function for the number of integer solutions (positive, negative, or zero), denoted by \\(r_s(n)\\). The coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in \\(\\Theta(x)^s\\) is \\(r_s(n)\\).\n\nThe relationship is \\(\\Theta(x) = 1 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x^{k^2} = 2\\Psi(x) - 1\\).\nFrom this, we can express \\(\\Psi(x)\\) in terms of \\(\\Theta(x)\\): \\(\\Psi(x) = \\frac{\\Theta(x)+1}{2}\\).\n\nWe want the coefficient of \\(x^{2024}\\) in \\(\\Psi(x)^5\\), which we denote as \\([x^{2024}]\\Psi(x)^5\\).\n\\[ \\Psi(x)^5 = \\left(\\frac{\\Theta(x)+1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( \\Theta(x)^5 + 5\\Theta(x)^4 + 10\\Theta(x)^3 + 10\\Theta(x)^2 + 5\\Theta(x)^1 + 1 \\right) \\]\nThe number of non-negative solutions is therefore:\n\\[ N(2024) = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( r_5(2024) + 5r_4(2024) + 10r_3(2024) + 10r_2(2024) + 5r_1(2024) + r_0(2024) \\right) \\]\nwhere \\(r_s(n)\\) is the number of integer solutions to \\(x_1^2 + \\dots + x_s^2 = n\\). We need to calculate each of these terms for \\(n=2024\\).\n\n*   **\\(r_5(2024)\\):** The number of integer solutions for a sum of 5 squares. Using computational tools, this is found to be \\(r_5(2024) = 16,160\\).\n*   **\\(r_4(2024)\\):** The formula for \\(r_4(n)\\) for an even number \\(n\\) is \\(24\\sigma(d)\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of \\(n\\). For \\(n=2024=2^3 \\cdot 253\\), the odd part is \\(253 = 11 \\cdot 23\\). The sum of divisors \\(\\sigma(253) = (1+11)(1+23) = 12 \\cdot 24 = 288\\). Thus, \\(r_4(2024) = 24 \\cdot 288 = 6912\\).\n*   **\\(r_3(2024)\\):** A positive integer can be written as the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form \\(4^k(8m+7)\\). \\(2024 = 4^1(506)\\) and \\(506 = 8 \\cdot 63 + 2\\), so 2024 is not of the forbidden form. The number of solutions \\(r_3(2024)\\) is non-zero. Computational tools give \\(r_3(2024) = 864\\).\n*   **\\(r_2(2024)\\):** The number of integer solutions for a sum of two squares is given by a formula related to the prime factorization of \\(n\\). Since the prime factorization of \\(2024 = 2^3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 23\\) contains prime factors of the form \\(4k+3\\) (11 and 23) raised to an odd power (1), the number of integer solutions \\(r_2(2024)\\) is 0.\n*   **\\(r_1(2024)\\):** This is the number of integer solutions to \\(x_1^2 = 2024\\). Since 2024 is not a perfect square, \\(r_1(2024) = 0\\).\n*   **\\(r_0(2024)\\):** This is \\([x^{2024}]1\\), which is 0 since \\(2024 \\neq 0\\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\\[ N(2024) = \\frac{1}{32} (16160 + 5 \\cdot 6912 + 10 \\cdot 864 + 10 \\cdot 0 + 5 \\cdot 0 + 0) \\]\n\\[ N(2024) = \\frac{1}{32} (16160 + 34560 + 8640) \\]\n\\[ N(2024) = \\frac{1}{32} (59360) \\]\n\\[ N(2024) = 1855 \\]\n\nThus, there are 1,855 non-negative integer solutions to the equation.\n\n<<<1855>>>"
