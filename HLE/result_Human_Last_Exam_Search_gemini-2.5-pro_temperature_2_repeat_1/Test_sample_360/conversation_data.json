    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed that exists as a mixture of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe reaction involves the 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand bridging two ruthenium centers. This results in the formation of a meso (Δ/Λ) form, which has a center of inversion, and a racemic (rac) form (a mixture of Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ enantiomers), which has a two-fold rotation axis. These two diastereomers are separable by techniques such as cation exchange chromatography.\n\nTherefore, a total of two isomers are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
