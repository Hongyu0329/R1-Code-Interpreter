### a) Negligible Interaction

When intermolecular interactions are neglected, each molecule acts independently. The creation of a second exciton on the chain corresponds to the excitation of one of the `(N-1)` remaining ground-state molecules. The total absorption cross-section for the chain is the sum of the cross-sections of these `(N-1)` molecules.

The equation is:
**σₐ(ωL) ≈ (N-1) * [ (πωL / (2ε₀cħ)) * |μ₁₀|² * gₐ * G(ωL - ω₁₀) ]**

*   **N**: Number of molecules in the chain.
*   **μ₁₀**: Transition dipole moment of a single molecule, `⟨φ\*| **d** |φ₀⟩`.
*   **ωL**: Angular frequency of the laser.
*   **ω₁₀**: Resonant transition angular frequency of a single molecule.
*   **ħ**: Reduced Planck constant.
*   **ε₀**: Vacuum permittivity.
*   **c**: Speed of light.
*   **gₐ**: Factor for orientational averaging.
*   **G(ωL - ω₁₀)**: A Gaussian lineshape function `exp[-(ωL - ω₁₀)²τ²]` originating from the Fourier transform of the Gaussian laser pulse of duration `τ`. This shows that absorption is most efficient when the laser frequency matches the molecular resonance.

### b) Near-Neighbor Interaction (Frenkel Exciton Model)

With near-neighbor interactions, the excitations (excitons) are delocalized across the chain in states described by a wavevector `k`. The absorption process is a transition from one of these delocalized one-exciton states to a delocalized two-exciton state (which can be a bound "biexciton").

The absorption cross-section for a transition starting from a one-exciton state with a specific wavevector `k` is:
**σₖ,b(ωL) ∝ (πωL / (2ε₀cħ)) * |⟨Ψ_biex| **d** |Ψᵢ(k)⟩|² * gₑ * G(ωL - ω₣ᵢ(k))**

*   **|Ψᵢ(k)⟩**: The delocalized initial one-exciton state with energy `Eᵢ(k)`.
*   **|Ψ_biex⟩**: The final two-exciton (biexciton) state with energy `E_biex`.
*   **⟨Ψ_biex| **d** |Ψᵢ(k)⟩**: The transition dipole moment between the delocalized one- and two-exciton states. This term depends on the intermolecular coupling strength.
*   **ω₣ᵢ(k)**: The resonant frequency for the transition, `(E_biex - Eᵢ(k))/ħ`. Unlike the non-interacting case, this frequency depends on the wavevector `k` of the initial exciton due to the exciton energy band structure.
*   **gₑ**: A geometric factor for the aggregate.
*   **G(...)**: The same Gaussian function as above, but now centered at the resonance frequency `ω₣ᵢ(k)`.

This equation indicates that the absorption will be a new band (induced absorption), with its position and strength determined by the properties of the delocalized one- and two-exciton states.
