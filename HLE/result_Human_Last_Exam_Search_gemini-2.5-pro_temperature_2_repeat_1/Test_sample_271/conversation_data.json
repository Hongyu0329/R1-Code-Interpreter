    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we must first understand the structure of the Galois group of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. Here, $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension by definition. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be its Galois group. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields $L$ (such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and the subgroups of $G$.\n\nA crucial part of this correspondence is that an intermediate extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension if and only if the corresponding subgroup, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of this extension is given by the index of the subgroup, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nThe problem asks for the degrees of normal extensions $L$ that are proper subsets of $K$ and properly contain $\\mathbb{Q}$ ($\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$). In the language of Galois theory, this means we are looking for the indices of all normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are proper and non-trivial (i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$).\n\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group is the projective special linear group PSL(2,7). This is a finite simple group of order 168.\n\nA simple group is defined as a group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup (containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$) and the group itself. In our case, the only normal subgroups of $G = \\text{PSL}(2,7)$ are $\\{e\\}$ and PSL(2,7).\n\nLet's examine the corresponding fields for these two normal subgroups:\n*   If we take the normal subgroup $H = G$, the corresponding field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}$, and the degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:G] = 1$. This case is excluded by the condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L$.\n*   If we take the normal subgroup $H = \\{e\\}$, the corresponding field is $L = K$, and the degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:\\{e\\}] = |G| = 168$. This case is excluded by the condition $L \\subsetneq K$.\n\nSince there are no proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\text{PSL}(2,7)$, there are no intermediate fields $L$ that satisfy the condition of being a normal extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ while being strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nTherefore, the set of possible degrees for such field extensions is empty.\n\n<<<There are no possible degrees.>>>"
