    "The performed search confirms my initial reasoning. Here's a breakdown of the key findings from the search results and how they support the conclusion:\n\n*   **Definition of All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** Multiple sources define an \"all-or-nothing\" (or \"all-or-none\") vaccine as one that provides perfect protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest receive no protection and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Efficacy Estimator:** The search results state that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the time-invariant vaccine efficacy estimator is the proportion of individuals who are completely protected. One paper explicitly states that the parameter for protective vaccine efficacy (let's call it `α`) is equivalent to the direct effectiveness of the vaccine (VE), which is calculated based on the relative reduction in the transmission rate.\n*   **Mathematical Equivalence:** One article on distinguishing vaccine efficacy and effectiveness directly addresses this. For an 'all-or-nothing' vaccine, it shows that the parameter for protective vaccine efficacy (α) is equivalent to the direct effectiveness of the vaccine (VEI,2). This direct effectiveness is what is typically measured by 1 minus the incidence rate ratio.\n*   **Incidence Rate Dynamics:** My initial derivation holds. In a population where a fraction `p` is perfectly protected by an all-or-nothing vaccine, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IR_V) is due only to infections in the non-protected `(1-p)` fraction. Assuming the force of infection (`λ`) is the same for the unprotected vaccinated individuals and the unvaccinated individuals, then IR_V = λ * (1-p). The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IR_U) is simply `λ`.\n*   **Calculation:** Therefore, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) = IR_V / IR_U = [λ * (1-p)] / λ = 1-p.\n*   **Conclusion:** The vaccine efficacy calculated from the incidence rate ratio is VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p. This `p` is, by definition, the per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine (i.e., the fraction of people who are perfectly protected from any exposure).\n\nThus, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n**Final Answer Determination:**\nBased on the logical deduction and the supporting evidence from the search results, the correct answer is \"correctly estimate\".\n\nAn all-or-nothing vaccine model assumes that a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals receive complete protection, while the remainder receive none. In this scenario, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy is the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nLet's denote this proportion as 'VE'. The remaining fraction, `1 - VE`, is not protected and has a risk of infection equal to that of the unvaccinated population.\n\nThe incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IRv) will be the rate in the unprotected subgroup, which is `(1 - VE)` multiplied by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated population (IRu). So, `IRv = (1 - VE) * IRu`.\n\nThe incidence rate ratio (IRR) is calculated as:\n`IRR = IRv / IRu`\n\nBy substituting the expression for IRv, we get:\n`IRR = ((1 - VE) * IRu) / IRu`\n`IRR = 1 - VE`\n\nThe vaccine efficacy estimated from the incidence rate ratio is `1 - IRR`.\n`1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE)`\n`1 - IRR = VE`\n\nThus, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the measure `1 - incidence rate ratio` is mathematically equivalent to the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. It therefore correctly estimates it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
