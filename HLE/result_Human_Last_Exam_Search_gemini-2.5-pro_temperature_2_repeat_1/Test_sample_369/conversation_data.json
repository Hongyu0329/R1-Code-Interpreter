    "The analysis of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* reveals the metrical pattern through the identification of dactyls (a long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables). The process involves accounting for natural vowel lengths, syllable length by position, and elisions, where a word-final vowel or a vowel followed by 'm' is dropped before a word beginning with a vowel.\n\nThe scansion of the line is as follows:\n\n**D S S D D S**\n\nHere is a foot-by-foot breakdown:\n\n1.  **vērum ub(i)**: This foot is a **dactyl** (– u u). The initial syllable \"vēr-\" is long. The \"-um\" of *verum* elides with the initial \"u-\" of *ubi*. The \"u\" in *ubi* is short, and its final \"-i\" is also treated as short before being elided with the following word, which starts with a vowel.\n2.  **equ(i) atque**: This foot is a **spondee** (– –). The \"-i\" of *equi* elides with the \"a-\" of *atque*. The first syllable of *equi*, \"e-,\" is scanned as long here. The syllable \"at-\" in *atque* is long by position because it is followed by two consonants (\"q\" represents the sounds of 'k' and 'w').\n3.  **hominis**: This foot is a **spondee** (– –). The first syllable \"ho-\" is long, and the second syllable, \"-mi-\", containing a short \"i,\" is followed by \"n\" and the \"s\" of the \"-nis\" ending, making it long by position. The \"-is\" ending itself constitutes the next syllable but is part of the foot.\n4.  **cāsū con-**: This foot is a **dactyl** (– u u). The \"-u\" at the end of *casu* is long. The syllable \"-ven-\" in *convenit* has a short vowel sound, as does the subsequent syllable \"-it\".\n5.  **venit i-**: This foot is a **dactyl** (– u u). Following the previous analysis, \"con-\" is long by position, while \"-ve-\" and \"-nit\" are both short. The \"i\" in *imago* starts the next foot.\n6.  **māgō**: The final foot is a **spondee** (– –). The penultimate syllable, \"-ma-\" in *imago*, has a naturally long \"a.\" The final syllable, \"-go,\" contains a long \"o\" and is always treated as long under the rule for the final syllable of a hexameter line.\n\nTherefore, the complete scansion of the line is Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S D D S>>>"
