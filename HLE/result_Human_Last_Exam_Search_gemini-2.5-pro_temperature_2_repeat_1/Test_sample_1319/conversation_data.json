    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is the Cretan **Mount Ida**.\n\nIn Greek mythology and classical texts, there are two sacred mountains named Ida. One is on the island of Crete and the other is in the Troad region of ancient Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy. While the Anatolian Mount Ida features more prominently in the narrative of the Trojan War as a vantage point for the gods, both mountains are mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n\nHere is a comparison of the mountains' elevations:\n\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest mountain on Crete, Mount Ida, stands at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). It is mythologically known as the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on the Chalcidice peninsula in Greece, Mount Athos reaches an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). It is also mentioned by Homer in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida (Troad, Turkey):** The mountain overlooking Troy, from which the gods witnessed the war, has a height of approximately 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** The peak of the island of Samothrace, from which Poseidon is said to have watched the battle, rises to 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\nExcluding the 2,918-meter Mount Olympus, the Cretan Mount Ida is the highest of these historical peaks referenced in the epic poem.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
