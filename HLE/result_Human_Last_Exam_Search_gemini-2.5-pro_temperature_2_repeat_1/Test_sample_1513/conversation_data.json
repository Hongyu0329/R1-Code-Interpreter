    "**No island town perfectly matches the unique combination of being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island while also sitting on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name.**\n\nExtensive research into the world's most remote inhabited islands reveals that while some are of volcanic origin and feature calderas, none have a town and a caldera bay with the same name that also meets the isolation criteria.\n\nSeveral islands come close to the description, but fail on at least one key point:\n\n**Pitcairn Island:** This remote British Overseas Territory in the Pacific Ocean has a single settlement, **Adamstown**, which is situated within a volcanic basin, the remnant of a collapsed caldera. Pitcairn Island is more than 500 kilometers from the nearest inhabited island, Mangareva (688 km away). However, the bay that serves as the island's harbor is named **Bounty Bay**, not Adamstown Bay.\n\n**Tristan da Cunha:** As the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, this British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean certainly meets the isolation requirement. Its only settlement is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. The island itself is a large volcano, and the settlement lies on a coastal plain at the base of the volcano's cliffs. However, there is no evidence that the settlement is situated on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera of the same name.\n\n**Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** A remote Chilean island in the Pacific, Easter Island is famous for its volcanic craters. Its main town, **Hanga Roa**, translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay,\" and is located on a bay. While the island has calderas, the town itself is not described as being on a caldera bay that shares its name.\n\n**Santorini, Greece:** The Greek island of Santorini has towns like Fira perched on the rim of the dramatic Santorini Caldera. However, it is part of the Cyclades island group and is not situated more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, failing the remoteness criterion.\n\nBased on available information, an island town fitting all the specified geographical and toponymical characteristics does not appear to exist."
