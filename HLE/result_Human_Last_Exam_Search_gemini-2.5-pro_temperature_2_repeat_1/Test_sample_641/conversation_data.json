    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4,997) is determined by the sum of the sizes of its conjugacy classes of involutions. For G = PSU(4,q) with q an odd prime power, the structure of these classes depends on the value of q.\n\nThe order of PSU(4,q) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(4,q)| = (1/gcd(4, q+1)) * q⁶ * (q² - 1)(q³ + 1)(q⁴ - 1)\n\nFor PSU(4,997), we have q = 997. Since 997 is a prime, it is an odd prime power.\nThe divisor is gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2.\nSo, |PSU(4,997)| = (1/2) * 997⁶ * (997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1).\n\nAccording to detailed studies of the group structure for q odd, particularly when q ≡ 1 (mod 4) (which is true for q=997), PSU(4,q) has two distinct conjugacy classes of involutions. The number of elements in each class is found by dividing the order of the group by the order of the centralizer of a representative involution from that class.\n\nThe orders of the centralizers for the two classes of involutions are:\n1.  |C₁| = q²(q-1)²(q+1)³\n2.  |C₂| = (1/2)q²(q-1)(q⁴-1)\n\nThis leads to the following sizes for the two conjugacy classes:\n1.  Size₁ = |PSU(4,q)| / |C₁| = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * (q² + 1)\n2.  Size₂ = |PSU(4,q)| / |C₂| = q⁴ * (q+1)² * (q² - q + 1)\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum of these two sizes:\nTotal = Size₁ + Size₂ = (q⁴ / 2) * (q² - q + 1) * (3q² + 4q + 3)\n\nSubstituting q = 997 into this formula:\n- q⁴ = 997⁴ = 988,053,848,081\n- q² - q + 1 = 997² - 997 + 1 = 993,013\n- 3q² + 4q + 3 = 3(997)² + 4(997) + 3 = 2,986,018\n\nNumber of involutions = (988,053,848,081 / 2) * 993,013 * 2,986,018\n= 494,026,924,040.5 * 993,013 * 2,986,018\n= 1,464,972,591,636,239,535,300,047\n\n<<<1464972591636239535300047>>>"
