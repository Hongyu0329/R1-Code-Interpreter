    "Answering your question requires clarifying the term \"maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\", as this notation is not standard in the mathematical literature concerning the topic. However, based on the context provided by \"covolume ($V$)\" and \"squarefree natural numbers ($N$)\", it is highly probable that your question relates to the properties of modular curves, specifically $X_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}^*$, where $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a principal congruence subgroup of level $N$.\n\nIn this context, a plausible interpretation is that \"maximum norm\" refers to the **maximum width of a cusp** on the modular curve $X_0(N)$. The subscript $\\infty$ in your notation likely refers to the cusp at infinity, which serves as a reference, while the subscript $k$ might denote the weight of a modular form, although this seems less critical for the geometric property of cusp width.\n\nUnder this interpretation, we can establish a clear relationship and an upper bound.\n\nFor a square-free integer $N$, the modular curve $X_0(N)$ has a set of inequivalent cusps whose widths are given by the divisors of $N$. The maximum of these widths, let's call it $W_{max}$, corresponds to the divisor $d=1$ and is equal to $N$ itself.\n\nThe covolume, $V$, of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ is proportional to the index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in the full modular group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The volume of the fundamental domain of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\pi/3$. The index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is given by the formula $[SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$, where the product is taken over the prime divisors of $N$.\n\nTherefore, the covolume is:\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\n\nSince we've established that $W_{max} = N$, we can substitute this into the covolume formula:\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} W_{max} \\prod_{p|W_{max}} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\n\nTo find an upper bound for $W_{max}$ in relation to $V$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$W_{max} = \\frac{3V}{\\pi \\prod_{p|W_{max}} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})}$\n\nFor any square-free integer $N > 1$, the product term $\\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$ is strictly greater than 1. This leads to the inequality:\n$W_{max} < \\frac{3V}{\\pi}$\n\nThus, the upper bound for the maximum cusp width is directly proportional to the covolume.\n\n<<<In the context of modular curves $X_0(N)$ for square-free $N$, interpreting the \"maximum norm\" as the maximum cusp width ($W_{max}$), the upper bound in relation to the covolume ($V$) is given by the inequality $W_{max} < \\frac{3V}{\\pi}$.>>>"
