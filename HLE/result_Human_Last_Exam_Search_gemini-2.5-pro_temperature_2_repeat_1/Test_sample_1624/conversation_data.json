    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is the reasoning that establishes this upper bound:\n\n1.  Let $U$ be the dense open subset of $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n2.  Every topological manifold is second-countable. For a metric space, being second-countable is equivalent to being separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ by the name $D$.\n\n3.  Since $U$ is dense in $X$ and $D$ is dense in $U$, it follows that $D$ is also a dense subset of $X$. To see this, take any point $x \\in X$ and any open neighborhood $O$ of $x$. Because $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $O \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set in $U$. Since $D$ is dense in $U$, this non-empty open set must contain a point from $D$. Therefore, $O$ contains a point from $D$, which means $D$ is dense in $X$.\n\n4.  Since $X$ contains a countable dense subset $D$, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n5.  It is a well-established theorem in topology that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is because each point in the space can be uniquely determined by its distances to the points in the countable dense set.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of $X$ is no greater than that of the continuum.\n\nFurthermore, because $X$ is a connected metric space, it cannot be a single point (as a single point does not have a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$). Any connected metric space with more than one point must have a cardinality of at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Combining the upper and lower bounds, the cardinality of $X$ must be exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$, assuming $X$ is not empty.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
