    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized through various methods, with the most common being the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases in a nickel vessel. This direct synthesis is typically carried out at elevated temperatures to ensure an efficient reaction rate.\n\nThe most frequently cited temperature for the direct combination of xenon and fluorine to produce xenon tetrafluoride is 400°C. Some sources provide a range for this reaction, such as 350-450°C or 300-500°C.\n\nHowever, alternative methods have been developed that allow for the synthesis of XeF₄ at significantly lower temperatures. One such method involves the use of dinitrogen difluoride (N₂F₂) as the fluorinating agent. A patent for this process specifies that the reaction to produce xenon tetrafluoride can be carried out in a temperature range of 80°C to 150°C. The patent also mentions a broader range of 60°C to 200°C. This indicates that efficient production of xenon tetrafluoride is possible at temperatures substantially lower than the 400°C required for the direct fluorination method.\n\nOther synthesis techniques have been explored, such as using γ- or UV-irradiation or an electric discharge, but specific temperatures for efficient XeF₄ production using these methods are not as clearly defined in the provided results.\n\nComparing the established synthesis temperatures with the given options, the method utilizing dinitrogen difluoride operates efficiently at temperatures as low as 80°C. Among the choices provided, 78°C is the closest to this documented lower temperature for efficient synthesis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
