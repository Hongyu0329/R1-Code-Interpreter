The primary condition underlying the doppelg√§nger syndrome is now understood as a type of Delusional Misidentification Syndrome, most specifically the Syndrome of Subjective Doubles and the related phenomenon of heautoscopy. Neuroimaging has identified that these conditions often arise from damage or dysfunction within a specific brain network that includes the left retrosplenial cortex and the right ventral frontal cortex.
