    "In the art of ballroom dancing, with its precise techniques and established figures, the Viennese Waltz stands out for a particular technical constraint regarding the reverse turn. It is in this fast-paced, rotational dance that overturning a reverse turn without disregarding the established technique is considered impossible.\n\nThe Viennese Waltz is characterized by its continuous, rapid rotation down the line of dance. The reverse turn, a left-turning figure, has a specific mechanical structure that is not conducive to adding extra rotation. The standard technique for a reverse turn in Viennese Waltz covers a full 360-degree rotation over six steps.\n\nThe primary difficulty arises when navigating the corners of the dance floor. Since the line of dance is counter-clockwise, negotiating a corner requires making a left turn. To do this while dancing a reverse turn (which already turns to the left), a couple would need to overturn the figure, completing more than a full 360-degree rotation. This is widely regarded as extremely difficult and technically incorrect. Forcing an overturn in a Viennese Waltz reverse turn disrupts the balance and flow of the continuously rotating couple, particularly for the partner who is moving forward. As a result, it is standard practice to use natural (right-turning) turns to navigate corners, as they can be easily under-turned to fit the curve of the floor. While minor adjustments in the amount of turn are possible in other dances like the English Waltz, European Tango, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, often to create different choreographic effects, the Viennese Waltz's high speed and specific rotational technique of the reverse turn make any significant overturn a violation of its core principles. Dancers and instructors often state that it is much easier to under-turn a natural turn than to overturn a reverse turn to get around a corner.\n\n<<<A>>>"
