    "I need to determine the percentage of irreducible objects among the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\nLet $l=3$. The small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ (denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$) is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, and its representation theory is well-understood. The category of its finite-dimensional modules is of finite representation type for $l=3$, meaning there is a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. I need to find the total number of these modules and how many of them are irreducible.\n\nFirst, let's identify the irreducible (or simple) modules. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $q$ a primitive $l$-th root of unity, there are exactly $l$ non-isomorphic simple modules. For $l=3$, there are **3** irreducible modules. Their dimensions are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nNext, I need to find the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. This is often determined by studying the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the algebra. The structure of these modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is known.\n\nBesides the $l$ irreducible modules, there are also $l$ indecomposable projective modules. The structure of these projective modules is as follows:\n*   For the simple modules $L_i$ with dimension $i$ not divisible by $l$ (which for $l=3$ means dimensions 1 and 2), the projective cover $P_i$ has a Loewy series (a filtration by radical powers) that describes its structure.\n*   For the simple module $L_l$ of dimension $l$ (which is also projective, often called the Steinberg module), the projective cover is just $L_l$ itself.\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten quiver of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ consists of:\n*   A component of type $\\mathbb{Z}A_2$ containing the two simple modules of dimensions 1 and 2. This component is \"stable,\" meaning it contains no projective or injective modules. For a length of $l-1=2$, the tube has rank 2, and it contains the two simple modules of dimensions 1 and 2. There are also two other indecomposable modules that are the extensions of one simple module by another. Let's call them $M_{12}$ and $M_{21}$. These four modules form a tube of rank 2 in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n*   The simple module of dimension 3, $L_3$. This module is both projective and injective, so it forms a component by itself in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n\nIn addition to these, there are the indecomposable projective modules $P_1$ and $P_2$, which are the projective covers of the simple modules $L_1$ and $L_2$. The module $P_1$ is uniserial with composition factors (from top to bottom) $L_1, L_2, L_1$, and has dimension $1+2+1=4$. Similarly, $P_2$ is uniserial with composition factors $L_2, L_1, L_2$ and has dimension $2+1+2=5$. These two projectives are distinct from the modules in the tube and from $L_3$.\n\nLet's list all the indecomposable modules for $l=3$:\n1.  **The simple modules**:\n    *   $L_1$ (dimension 1, irreducible)\n    *   $L_2$ (dimension 2, irreducible)\n    *   $L_3$ (dimension 3, irreducible and projective)\n    These are **3** irreducible modules.\n\n2.  **The non-simple, non-projective indecomposable modules (in the tube)**:\n    *   There is a non-split extension of $L_1$ by $L_2$.\n    *   There is a non-split extension of $L_2$ by $L_1$.\n    These are **2** additional modules. They are not irreducible.\n\n3.  **The indecomposable projective modules which are not simple**:\n    *   $P_1$, the projective cover of $L_1$.\n    *   $P_2$, the projective cover of $L_2$.\n    These are **2** additional modules. They are not irreducible.\n\nSo, the complete list of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules is:\n*   $L_1$\n*   $L_2$\n*   $L_3$\n*   The extension of $L_1$ by $L_2$\n*   The extension of $L_2$ by $L_1$\n*   $P_1$\n*   $P_2$\n\nThis gives a total of $3+2+2=7$ indecomposable modules.\n\nThe number of irreducible modules is 3 ($L_1, L_2, L_3$).\nThe total number of indecomposable modules is 7.\n\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ that are irreducible is the number of irreducible modules divided by the total number of indecomposable modules, multiplied by 100.\n\nPercentage = $(3/7) * 100 \\approx 42.857\\%$\n\nThus, about 42.86% of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity are irreducible. The final answer is the fraction 3/7.\n\nFinal Calculation: 3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.4285714.\n\nThe set of indecomposable modules consists of $l-1=2$ projective modules ($P_1, P_2$), the Steinberg module $L_3$ (which is simple and projective), and $l-1=2$ \"band\" modules for each positive integer, representing the regular part of the Auslander-Reiten quiver. In our case ($l=3$, which corresponds to a tame representation type but not finite), there are families of indecomposable modules. This would imply infinitely many indecomposable representations. The problem specifies finite-dimensional representations, which are all included.\n\nLet me re-evaluate based on the Auslander-Reiten quiver structure for the tame case. For $l \\ge 3$, the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of tame representation type, not finite. The Auslander-Reiten quiver consists of:\n*   $l-1$ projective-injective modules at the end of tubes of rank 1.\n*   The simple Steinberg module $L_l$, which is projective and injective and isolated in the AR quiver.\n*   A family of tubes of rank 1, indexed by the ground field $k$. Each tube contains indecomposable modules of ever-increasing dimension.\n\nFor $l=3$:\n*   The projective modules $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n*   The simple projective module $L_3$.\n*   The simple modules $L_1$ and $L_2$ are at the mouth of a tube of rank 2. The Auslander-Reiten quiver of the non-projective modules consists of a single tube of rank $l-1 = 2$. This tube contains modules of dimension $d$ and $d+1$ for $d=1, 3, 5, ...$. So there are infinitely many indecomposable modules.\n\nThe question \"what percentage\" implies a ratio. In the context of infinite sets of representations, this often refers to a limit based on dimension or another natural grading. However, a common interpretation in such contexts within representation theory questions might imply a focus on a specific, fundamental part of the representation structure if the context is not a formal limit calculation.\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly simplifies the infinite family. Often, questions like this from a course or a general context might overlook the full complexity of the tame type. If we restrict to modules up to a certain complexity or dimension, we could get a percentage. Without a specified limit, the question is ill-posed if there are infinite indecomposable objects.\n\nHowever, some sources might be using a slightly different definition or context for \"the category C\". Let's reconsider the sources about the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $u_q(sl_2)$. The description of the Auslander-Reiten quiver having tubes of rank greater than 1, implying infinite modules, is for the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.\n\nLet's check other classifications. A number of sources confirm that for $l \\ge 3$, the algebra is of tame representation type. For $l=3$, the non-projective indecomposable modules lie in a single stable tube of rank 2. This means for each dimension, there are two indecomposable modules. Thus, there is an infinite number of indecomposable modules.\n\nSo the denominator (total indecomposable objects) is infinite, while the numerator (irreducible objects) is finite (3). A literal interpretation gives a percentage of 0.\n\nPerhaps the category C is intended to be a specific subcategory. Without further clarification from the prompt, let's explore this possibility. If 'C' refers to a category where one can sensibly speak of percentages, it might be that it is implicitly restricted. If we only count the types of \"series\" of indecomposable objects, we would have the projective series, and the tubular series.\n\nIf we reconsider the initial simpler analysis of 7 modules, it comes from a context where perhaps only the modules of small dimension or specific structure are considered, which can happen in some textbook examples.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most mathematically rigorous interpretation with an infinite number of indecomposable modules is that the percentage is 0. But this seems too trivial and likely not the intended answer for such a specific setup.\n\nLet's look at the structure more closely. The indecomposable modules are:\n*   $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$ (irreducible)\n*   The projectives $P_1, P_2$\n*   An infinite family of modules in the tube, $M_{d,1}, M_{d,2}$ for $d=1,2,3,...$ where $d$ is related to the length.\n\nThe number of irreducible objects is 3. The total number of objects is infinite. The percentage is $3 / \\infty = 0$.\n\nLet's search again specifically for the number of indecomposable representations for the small quantum group $u_q(sl_2)$ when q is a 3rd root of unity, to see if some standard convention is being used. If there's a standard result for \"the number\" of these, it implies a standard truncation or interpretation.\n\nThe sources found indicate the classification is well-known but do not give a simple finite number for the total set of indecomposable modules. This points back to the infinite (tame) case. It seems the most direct interpretation is that the set of indecomposable modules is infinite.\n\nGiven this, the only logical answer is that the percentage is 0. While this may feel counter-intuitive for a posed question, it's the direct consequence of having a finite number of simple objects and an infinite number of indecomposable objects.\n\nIt is possible that \"the objects of C\" is implicitly restricted to indecomposable modules with quantum dimension zero, or some other special class. But based purely on the prompt, no such restriction is stated. I will proceed with the most direct interpretation of the category of *all* indecomposable finite-dimensional representations.\n\nNumber of irreducible objects = 3.\nNumber of indecomposable objects = $\\infty$.\nPercentage = $(3/\\infty) \\times 100 = 0$.\n\n<<<0>>>"
