The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a number, but rather the set of defining rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable θ, these rules are ∫dθ = 0 and ∫dθ θ = 1. These rules are a direct consequence of the nilpotency (θ² = 0) of Grassmann variables, which is the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle.
