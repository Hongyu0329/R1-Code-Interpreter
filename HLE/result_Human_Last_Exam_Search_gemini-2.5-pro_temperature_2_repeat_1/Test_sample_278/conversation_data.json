    "The shape described by the parametric equations is composed of two parts:\n*   **For t in [0, π]:** The equations are x = cos(t) and y = sin(t). This represents the upper half of a unit circle, as y is always non-negative. The x-values range from cos(0) = 1 to cos(π) = -1, and the y-values range from sin(π/2) = 1 down to sin(0) = 0 and sin(π) = 0.\n*   **For t in (π, 2π):** The equations are x = cos(t) and y = 5sin(t). This represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin. For this interval, sin(t) is negative, so y is also negative. The x-values range from cos(π) = -1 to cos(2π) = 1. The y-values range from 5sin(3π/2) = -5 to just under 5sin(2π) = 0.\n\nTo find the smallest square that outcircles the figure, we need to determine the figure's maximum width and height.\n\n*   **Width (x-range):** The x-coordinate is given by x = cos(t) for the entire interval t ∈ [0, 2π]. The maximum value of cos(t) is 1, and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the total width of the figure is 1 - (-1) = 2.\n*   **Height (y-range):**\n    *   For the upper semi-circle (t ∈ [0, π]), the maximum y-value is sin(π/2) = 1.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse (t ∈ (π, 2π)), the minimum y-value is 5sin(3π/2) = -5.\n    *   The total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values, which is 1 - (-5) = 6.\n\nThe side of the smallest square that can circumscribe the figure must be equal to the larger of its width and height. In this case, the larger dimension is the height, which is 6.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
