The proposed approach is **partially valid but has significant limitations.** It can be considered a reasonable first step for generating initial hypotheses about mimicry rings, especially if resources are limited. The data from human observers is likely to capture the broad strokes of visual similarity and may correlate well with the groupings perceived by natural predators.

However, due to the major differences between human and avian vision, particularly the inability of humans to perceive UV light, this method cannot be considered definitive. The "gold standard" for this type of research would involve using spectrophotometry to measure the full-spectrum reflectance of the bees' coloration and modeling how these colors and patterns would be perceived by the visual systems of relevant predators.

Therefore, while the researcher can proceed with the proposed method to gain preliminary insights, the findings should be interpreted with caution. The conclusions would need to be supported by further, more objective analyses before they can be considered ecologically robust. The approach is a pragmatic compromise, trading a degree of ecological accuracy for logistical simplicity.
