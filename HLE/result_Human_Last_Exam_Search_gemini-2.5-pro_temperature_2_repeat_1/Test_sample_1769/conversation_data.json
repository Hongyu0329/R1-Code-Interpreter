    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **suster** or **soster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a hybrid of the native Old English word and Old Norse. The original Old English term for a female sibling was *sweostor*, which also had regional variations like *swuster* and *swester*. This word came directly from the Proto-Germanic word *swestÄ“r, making it the indigenous Anglo-Saxon term.\n\nDuring the Viking Age, extensive contact with Old Norse speakers, particularly in the Danelaw, led to the introduction of many Norse words into English. The Old Norse word for sister was *systir*. This Norse word influenced the native Old English term, resulting in the Middle English form *sister*, which eventually became the standard in Modern English. The crucial change was the shift in the vowel sound from \"u\" (in *suster*) to \"i\" (in *sister*), a direct result of this Scandinavian influence.\n\nWithout the Norse influence, the Old English *sweostor* would have followed its own natural evolutionary path. By the Middle English period, it was already commonly written as *suster*. Had the Old Norse *systir* not altered its development, the word would likely have evolved from *suster* into a form like \"suster\" or perhaps \"soster\", similar to its cognates in other Germanic languages like Dutch (*zuster*) and German (*Schwester*).\n\n<<<suster"
