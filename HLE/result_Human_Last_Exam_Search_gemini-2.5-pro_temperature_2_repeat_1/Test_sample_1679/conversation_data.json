    "An American in Paris, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1951, is the first film in that category to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe film includes an elaborate 17-minute ballet sequence, with a scene set in a vibrant, impressionistic replica of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of the famous Egyptian obelisk. The ballet's opening scene is styled after Raoul Dufy's depiction of the Place de la Concorde, and it features Gene Kelly's character, Jerry, dancing in a replica of the square's iconic fountain.\n\nOther early Best Picture winners set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), do not contain any scenes that have been documented as taking place at the Place de la Concorde. Similarly, while *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) includes a brief sojourn in Paris, the scenes are not described as featuring the famous landmark.\n\nTherefore, based on available descriptions and film analyses, *An American in Paris* holds the distinction of being the first Best Picture winner to showcase the Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
