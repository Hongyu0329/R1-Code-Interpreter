**1. Amlodipine**
This is a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). For African American patients with hypertension, a CCB or a thiazide-type diuretic is a recommended first-line therapy. Since multiple diuretics are not an option for this patient, amlodipine is a logical and effective foundational agent. Combining a CCB with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker is an evidence-based strategy for patients who require more than one drug to control their blood pressure.

**2. Losartan**
This is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). This class of medication is particularly beneficial for MM due to her concurrent diagnosis of diabetes (A1C of 6.7%), as ARBs provide renal protection. While historically there has been debate about the initial use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors in Black patients for hypertension alone, they are a recommended component of therapy for those with compelling comorbidities like chronic kidney disease or diabetes. An ARB is often chosen over an ACE inhibitor in this population to avoid the higher risk of a side effect known as angioedema.

**3. Spironolactone**
This is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that also functions as a potassium-sparing diuretic. For patients with resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite treatment with three antihypertensive agents from different classes (ideally including a diuretic), spironolactone is the recommended fourth-line agent. Multiple studies have shown its superiority in lowering blood pressure compared to other add-on therapies in resistant cases. Though other diuretics are contraindicated for this patient, spironolactone works via a different mechanism that is often effective when other drugs have failed. While eplerenone is not an option for her, spironolactone is the other primary drug in this class recommended for this condition. It's important that her kidney function and potassium levels would be monitored closely when initiating this combination, especially with an ARB like losartan, to manage the risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium).

This three-drug regimen targets different pathophysiological pathways contributing to her hypertension: vasodilation (amlodipine), blockage of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (losartan), and addressing sodium retention and aldosterone excess (spironolactone), which is a common driver of resistant hypertension.
