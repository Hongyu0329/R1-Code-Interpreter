    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured as the proportion of variance explained (R²), is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability (h²snp) for a given phenotype. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in the calculation, effectively setting a theoretical maximum for the predictive power of a polygenic score based on those SNPs.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the fact that polygenic scores currently capture only a fraction of the SNP heritability:\n\n*   **Error in effect size estimates:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to build the score are estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and these estimates contain statistical error.\n*   **\"Missing heritability\":** Current polygenic scores do not capture the full SNP-heritability, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as part of the \"missing heritability\" problem. For example, the SNP heritability for ADHD is estimated at 21.6%, while a polygenic score for ADHD explains a maximum of 5.5% of the variance. Similarly, for educational attainment, the PGS explains about 12% of the variance, whereas the SNP-based heritability is estimated to be between 22-28%.\n*   **Sample differences:** The predictive accuracy of a PGS can be lower due to inevitable differences between the initial GWAS sample (base data) and the sample in which the score is being tested (target data).\n\nIn an ideal theoretical scenario, if the effects of all SNPs were estimated from a GWAS without any error, a polygenic score could explain a proportion of variance equal to the SNP-heritability. However, in practice, this is not the case, and the predictive power of polygenic scores is typically substantially lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
