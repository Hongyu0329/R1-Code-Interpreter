The provided information is insufficient to calculate a specific numerical value for the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r) because E_r is not a standard metric and there is no established formula to derive it from the given parameters. The conflicting local and neighborhood evidence, combined with the described graph structure, points toward a statistical artifact (like Simpson's Paradox) that cannot be resolved by a simple ratio.
