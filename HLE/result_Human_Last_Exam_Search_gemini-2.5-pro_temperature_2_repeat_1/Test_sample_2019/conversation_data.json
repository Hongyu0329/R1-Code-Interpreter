    "Zero.\n\nThere are 0 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This is based on a statement from a discussion on MathOverflow, a site for professional mathematicians, which indicates that while four queens can be placed in two non-attacking groups, they cannot be placed as four individually non-attacking queens. This implies that it's impossible to place four queens on a 5x5 toroidal board where no two queens threaten each other.\n\nThe problem of placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is a well-studied mathematical problem. A key result by the mathematician George PÃ³lya states that a solution for *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. For the 5x5 board, since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, there are indeed solutions for placing 5 non-attacking queens. However, the question asks for placing 4 queens, which is a variation of the classic problem.\n\nWhile there are methods like backtracking to computationally determine the number of placements for such problems, the available resources and mathematical discussions point towards the conclusion that no such arrangement for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is possible.\n\n<<<0>>>"
