    "I have performed the initial Google search and have a foundational understanding of wallpaper groups and point groups.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. There are exactly 17 such groups. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotations and reflections that leave a point of the lattice fixed. The crystallographic restriction theorem states that the order of rotation in a wallpaper group can only be 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\nA point group of order 2 can be of two types in two dimensions: C2 or D1.\n- C2 contains a single 2-fold rotation (a 180-degree rotation).\n- D1 contains a single reflection.\n\nTo answer the user's question, I need to identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2. I need to find a list of the 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups, and then count how many have a point group of order 2 (either C2 or D1).\n\nThe search results already provide some of this information. For example, result mentions that the wallpaper group `p2` has a point group C2. Result mentions that the wallpaper group `pm` has a point group D1. Result mentions that for an oblique lattice, the point group is C2, and for a rectangular lattice, the point group is D2. However, a comprehensive list linking all 17 wallpaper groups to their point groups is needed to ensure a complete and accurate count. I will refine my search to find this specific information.\n\nUpdated plan:\n- Search for a complete table of the 17 wallpaper groups that lists their corresponding point groups.\n- Identify all wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 (this includes both C2 and D1).\n- Count the identified wallpaper groups.\n- Provide the final count as the answer.I have successfully gathered information that will help me answer the user's question. The search results provide tables and descriptions of the 17 wallpaper groups, which are also known as plane symmetry groups. Crucially, I have found information that links each wallpaper group to its characteristics, such as the types of rotation and reflection it possesses. A point group of order 2 corresponds to either a single 2-fold rotation (C2) or a single reflection (D1).\n\nBased on the search results, I can now identify the wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n- The wallpaper group 'p2' has 2-fold rotations but no reflections, so its point group is C2 (order 2).\n- The wallpaper groups 'pm', 'pg', and 'cm' have reflections but no rotations. Their point group is D1 (order 2). 'pg' has glide reflections, which are a combination of a reflection and a translation, but its point group only considers the reflection component.\n\nTherefore, the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm. I can now count these and provide the final answer.\nThere are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. There are 17 such groups in total. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotations and reflections that leave a specific point fixed. A point group of order 2 corresponds to a group with two symmetry operations: the identity and either a single two-fold rotation (a 180-degree turn) or a single reflection. These correspond to the point groups C2 and D1, respectively.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a C2 point group. It features two-fold rotational symmetry but lacks any reflection or glide reflection axes.\n*   **pm**: This group has a D1 point group. It has parallel reflection axes but no rotational symmetry.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a D1 point group. It is characterized by parallel glide reflection axes and no rotational symmetry. Although it involves translation, its point group is defined by the reflection component.\n*   **cm**: This group possesses a D1 point group as well. It has parallel reflection and glide reflection axes but no rotational symmetry.\n\nThese four groups—p2, pm, pg, and cm—are the only wallpaper groups whose point groups have an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
