    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie) in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio,\" is a notable work of the New Objectivity movement. It depicts a man, identified as a Herr Schreck who was a wheelchair-bound tenant in the artist's house, listening to the radio. This new technology of the era, the radio, became a recurring motif in the art of the Weimar Republic, representing both a connection to the wider world and a potential for social isolation.\n\nThe artwork is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie, one of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums).\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie)>>>"
