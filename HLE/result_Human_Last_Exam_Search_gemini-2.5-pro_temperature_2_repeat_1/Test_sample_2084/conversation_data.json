    "When the compound represented by the SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` is added to an aqueous acidic solution, it undergoes hydrolysis. Although the SMILES string is complex, it represents a specific bicyclic orthoester: 4-phenyl-1-methyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.\n\nOrthoesters are functional groups that readily hydrolyze in the presence of acid. Unlike the hydrolysis of a simple ketal, which would yield two separate molecules (a ketone and a diol), the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this specific bicyclic orthoester results in the formation of a single product.\n\nThe reaction involves the addition of a water molecule, which cleaves the orthoester linkages. The resulting product is a molecule that contains both a hydroxyl group and an ester functional group. The chemical structure of this single product is (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propyl) benzoate.\n\nSince only one product is formed, it is, by definition, the product with the higher molar mass.\n\nThe SMILES string for this product is: `c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC(C)(CO)CO`\n\n<<<c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC(C)(CO)CO>>>"
