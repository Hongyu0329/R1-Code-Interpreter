    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)), where 'a' and 'b' are relatively prime integers, can be determined using a standard formula. The given curve is (cos(9t), sin(5t)), which is a type of Lissajous curve.\n\nFor such a curve, we identify a = 9 and b = 5. To find the number of self-intersections, we first need to ensure that 'a' and 'b' are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. In this case, the greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are relatively prime.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points when both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nApplying this formula to the given curve:\n<ul>\n<li>a = 9</li>\n<li>b = 5</li>\n</ul>\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\n= 8 * 4 / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
