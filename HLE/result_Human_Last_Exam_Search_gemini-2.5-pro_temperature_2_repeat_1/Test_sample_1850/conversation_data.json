    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a number of historical saints are mentioned by name. Based on a comprehensive review of the text, there are at least **eleven** such figures.\n\nThese mentions occur predominantly in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals to Adam a vision of the future of mankind. Additionally, some saints are named in other parts of the poem. The historical saints named are:\n\n*   **Adam:** The first man, considered a saint in some Christian traditions, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church (in the wider sense of \"holy one\"). His story is central to the entire epic.\n*   **Eve:** The first woman and the mother of all living, also venerated as a saint in some traditions alongside Adam. Her role is pivotal throughout the poem.\n*   **Abel:** The second son of Adam and Eve, who is presented in Book XI as the first martyr.\n*   **Enoch:** Mentioned in Book XI as the one who \"walk[ed] with God\" and was taken to Heaven without dying.\n*   **Noah:** The builder of the Ark, whose story of the great flood is recounted to Adam in Book XI.\n*   **Abraham:** The patriarch of the Israelite nation, who is shown in Book XII as an example of faith.\n*   **Isaac:** The son of Abraham, mentioned in the lineage of the \"seed of Abraham\" in Book XII.\n*   **Jacob:** The son of Isaac, also part of the patriarchal lineage described in Book XII.\n*   **Moses:** The leader who delivers the Israelites from Egypt, his story is detailed by Michael in Book XII.\n*   **Joshua:** Named in Book XII as the one who will lead the Israelites into the promised land of Canaan. Milton states, \"Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,\" drawing a typological connection to Christ.\n*   **David:** The king of Israel, mentioned in Book XII as the ancestor of the future Messiah.\n\nBeyond these, the archangels **Michael**, **Gabriel**, and **Raphael** are prominent characters in the poem and are venerated as saints in Christian tradition. While central to the narrative, they are celestial beings rather than historical human figures in the same sense as the others listed. The poem also refers to \"saints\" in a more general sense, such as the \"Saints and Patriarchs\" in Book IV and God's \"armed Saints\" during the war in Heaven in Book VI.\n\n<<<11>>>"
