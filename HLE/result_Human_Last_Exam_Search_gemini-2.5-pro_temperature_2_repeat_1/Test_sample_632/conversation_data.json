    "A prominent and unique architectural feature of the Piazza della Rotonda, which was removed by the city administration, was a pair of twin bell towers flanking the Pantheon's facade. However, this removal did not take place in 1950 but rather in 1883.\n\nThese bell towers were added to the ancient structure in the 17th century, during the pontificate of Pope Urban VIII. While often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, some sources suggest they may have been designed by his rivals, Carlo Maderno and Francesco Borromini. The towers were a significant alteration to the Pantheon's original classical appearance and were derisively nicknamed \"the ass's ears\" by the Roman populace.\n\nThe decision to demolish the towers in the late 19th century was part of a broader effort to restore the Pantheon to its original form and to clear the piazza of later additions. This included the removal of various shops and sheds that had clustered around the ancient monument over the centuries.\n\nWhile other architectural modifications and demolitions occurred in the piazza throughout its history, the removal of these distinctive, albeit controversial, bell towers represents the most significant removal of a singular architectural feature from the Pantheon itself. No records from the search results indicate the removal of a different, unique architectural feature from the piazza around the year 1950.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers on the Pantheon.>>>"
