    "Let `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The condition is that for every pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the intersection of `K` with the line `L_{p,q}` defined by the equation `px + qy = 1` is non-empty.\n\nFirst, let's identify a convex domain that satisfies this property. Consider the square `S` with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`. This is the set of points `(x, y)` such that `|x| + |y| <= 1`. The area of this square is `(√2 * √2) = 2`.\n\nLet's verify if `S` intersects every line `L_{p,q}`. A line intersects a closed convex set if the set is not entirely contained in one of the open half-planes defined by the line. The value of the expression `px + qy` for `(x, y)` in `S` is bounded. The maximum value of `px + qy` on `S` is `max(|p|, |q|)`, and the minimum value is `-max(|p|, |q|)`.\nFor the line `px + qy = 1` to intersect `S`, the value `1` must be between the minimum and maximum of `px + qy` over `S`. That is:\n`-max(|p|, |q|) <= 1 <= max(|p|, |q|)`\n\nThe left-hand inequality, `-max(|p|, |q|) <= 1`, is always true since `max(|p|, |q|)` is non-negative.\nThe right-hand inequality, `1 <= max(|p|, |q|) overtly`, requires consideration. Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. This means that at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer, so its absolute value is at least 1. Therefore, `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\nThus, the square `S` defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1` intersects all lines `px + qy = 1` for coprime integers `p` and `q`. The area of this set is 2.\n\nNow, we must show that this is the minimal possible area.\nLet `K` be any convex domain that satisfies the given condition.\nThe set of lines includes:\n*   For `(p,q) = (1,0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   For `(p,q) = (-1,0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   For `(p,q) = (0,1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   For `(p,q) = (0,-1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n\nFor `K` to intersect the line `x=1`, there must be at least one point `(x,y)` in `K` with `x >= 1`. This implies that `x_max = sup{x | (x,y) in K} >= 1`.\nFor `K` to intersect the line `x=-1`, there must be at least one point `(x,y)` in `K` with `x <= -1`. This implies that `x_min = inf{x | (x,y) in K} <= -1`.\n\nThe width of the set `K` in the direction of the y-axis (which is the length of its projection onto the x-axis) is `w_y = x_max - x_min`. From the above, we have `w_y >= 1 - (-1) = 2`.\nSimilarly, because `K` must intersect `y=1` and `y=-1`, its width in the direction of the x-axis (length of its projection onto the y-axis) must satisfy `w_x >= 2`.\n\nFor a convex body `K` in the plane, its area `A` is related to its widths `w_a` and `w_b` in any two orthogonal directions `a` and `b`. A known inequality in convex geometry states that `A >= (w_a * w_b) / 2`.\nUsing the widths in the directions of the x and y axes, we have:\n`Area(K) >= (w_x * w_y) / 2`\nSince `w_x >= 2` and `w_y >= 2`, we get:\n`Area(K) >= (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`\n\nThis establishes that the area of any such convex domain must be at least 2. Since we have found a convex domain with area 2 that satisfies the condition, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
