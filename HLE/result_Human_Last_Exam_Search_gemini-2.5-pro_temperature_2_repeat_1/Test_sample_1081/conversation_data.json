    "The problem asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nLet $G$ be a reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ if the group $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. If $G$ is not split, the number of classes of maximal tori corresponds to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism. For a split group, the action of $F$ on $W$ is trivial, so the $F$-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes. The standard assumption, unless otherwise specified, is that we are dealing with the split form of the group, which is the Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\nThe Weyl group for a group of type $E_8$ is denoted by $W(E_8)$. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nBased on the search results, specifically from a resource on the conjugacy classes of Lie groups, the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is stated to be 112. This number is a well-established fact in the theory of Lie groups and their associated structures.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in the split reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n"
