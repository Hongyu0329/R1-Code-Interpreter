    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of a complete graph Kₙ with n = 35. The total number of vertices in a family of graphs is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph in the family. This quantity is also known as the \"capacity\" of the covering.\n\nFirst, let's establish the necessary terminology and some known results from graph theory.\n*   A **complete graph Kₙ** is a graph with n vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   A **bipartite graph** is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, say U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.\n*   A **family of bipartite graphs covering Kₙ** is a set of bipartite subgraphs of Kₙ, {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ}, such that every edge of Kₙ is present in at least one of the subgraphs Bᵢ.\n*   The **capacity** of this covering is the sum of the number of vertices of the bipartite graphs in the family, i.e., ∑ᵢ |V(Bᵢ)|.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum capacity for K₃₅.\n\nA key result in this area is a theorem by Graham and Pollak, which states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to *partition* the edges of Kₙ is n-1. However, for a *covering*, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is a different value. It is known that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of Kₙ is k = ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\n\nFor n = 35:\nk = ⌈log₂(35)⌉\nSince 2⁵ = 32 and 2⁶ = 64, we have k = 6.\nSo, at least 6 bipartite graphs are needed to cover all the edges of K₃₅.\n\nNow, we need to determine the minimum sum of the number of vertices of these bipartite graphs. There is a standard construction to create such a covering using k = ⌈log₂(n)⌉ bipartite graphs:\n1.  Assign a unique binary vector of length k to each of the n vertices. For n=35, we use k=6, so we can assign a unique binary string of length 6 to each of the 35 vertices. For instance, we can use the binary representations of the integers 0 to 34.\n2.  For each of the k positions in the binary vectors (from i=1 to k), we define a bipartite graph Bᵢ. The vertex set of Kₙ is partitioned into two sets: Vᵢ⁰, containing all vertices whose i-th binary coordinate is 0, and Vᵢ¹, containing all vertices whose i-th coordinate is 1. The bipartite graph Bᵢ is the complete bipartite graph with these two sets as its partitions.\n3.  Any two distinct vertices must have different binary representations, so they must differ in at least one position, say the j-th position. This means one vertex will be in Vⱼ⁰ and the other in Vⱼ¹, so the edge between them is covered by the bipartite graph Bⱼ. Thus, the family {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ} covers all edges of Kₙ.\n\nIn this construction, for each of the k bipartite graphs Bᵢ, its vertex set V(Bᵢ) is the entire set of n vertices of Kₙ (i.e., V(Bᵢ) = Vᵢ⁰ ∪ Vᵢ¹ = V(Kₙ)). Therefore, each of the k bipartite graphs is a \"spanning\" subgraph.\n\nThe total number of vertices in this family of bipartite graphs is the sum of the number of vertices of each graph:\nCapacity = |V(B₁)| + |V(B₂)| + ... + |V(Bₖ)| = n + n + ... + n (k times) = n * k.\n\nA theorem by Hansel provides a lower bound for the capacity of a bipartite covering of Kₙ, which is n * log₂(n).\nFor n = 35, the lower bound is 35 * log₂(35) ≈ 35 * 5.129 ≈ 179.5.\n\nThe construction described above gives an upper bound on the minimum capacity:\nMinimum Capacity ≤ n * ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\nFor n = 35, this upper bound is 35 * 6 = 210.\n\nIt is known that the lower bound of n * log₂(n) is tight if and only if n is a power of 2. When n is not a power of 2, like 35, the exact minimum capacity is given by the construction n * ⌈log₂(n)⌉. The local biclique cover number of Kₙ is known to be ⌈log₂(n)⌉, which means that in any bipartite covering of Kₙ, there is at least one vertex that is contained in at least ⌈log₂(n)⌉ of the bipartite graphs. The standard construction balances this load perfectly, with every vertex being in exactly ⌈log₂(n)⌉ bipartite graphs.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of K₃₅ is n * ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\n\nCalculation:\nn = 35\nk = ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6\nMinimum number of vertices = 35 * 6 = 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
