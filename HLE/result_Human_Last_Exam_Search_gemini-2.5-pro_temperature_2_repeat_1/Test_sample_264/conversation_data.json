    "The problem asks for the volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1. One cube is shifted relative to the other by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n\nLet the first cube (C1) be defined by the region where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. Its main diagonal connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe shift of 1/2 along this main diagonal corresponds to a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, the second cube (C2) is defined by the region where 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2.\n\nTo find the volume of the intersection, we need to find the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for both cubes simultaneously. For axis-aligned cubes, we can find the intersection of the coordinate ranges independently.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube with side lengths of 1/2.\n\nThe volume of this intersection is the product of the lengths of these new intervals:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
