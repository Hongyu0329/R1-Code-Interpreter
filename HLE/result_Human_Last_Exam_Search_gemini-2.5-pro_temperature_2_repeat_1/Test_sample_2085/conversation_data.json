    "## The French Equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" is a Descriptive Nickname: \"Pue-du-Bec\"\n\nThe Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" does not have a direct, one-to-one equivalent in modern French as a proper name. However, based on the etymology of its components, the closest French equivalent is the descriptive nickname \"Pue-du-bec,\" which translates to \"stinks-from-the-beak\" or, more colloquially, \"one with bad breath.\"\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is a compound of two Gaulish elements: \"odo-\" and \"-beccus.\" The second part, **-beccus**, is well-attested in Gaulish and means \"beak\" or \"snout\". This word was later adopted into Latin and has survived in modern French as *bec*, meaning \"beak\".\n\nThe first element, **odo-**, is less definitive. While some sources suggest a link to the Germanic name element \"Odo,\" meaning \"wealthy\" or \"prosperity,\" this is unlikely given the context of the full name. The most probable meaning of \"odo-\" in this context relates to an unpleasant odor. This is supported by the existence of the French verb *puer*, which means \"to stink.\" The informal French expression *puer de la bouche* is used to describe having bad breath.\n\nFurthermore, the French nickname *Pue-du-bec* is recorded as a term for a person with bad breath. This strongly suggests that \"Odobeccus\" was a nickname, likely of a pejorative nature, for someone with a malodorous mouth.\n\nA historical figure by the name of Odobeccus (or Edobicus) is mentioned as a general in Gaul during the early 5th century CE. It is plausible that this was a nickname he was known by.\n\nTherefore, while you would not find \"Odobeccus\" listed as a common French name, its meaning is preserved in the descriptive phrase and old nickname \"Pue-du-bec.\"\n\n<<<Pue-du-bec>>>"
