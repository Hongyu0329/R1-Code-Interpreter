A tightly secure two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme can be designed by combining a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol with a two-round signing process. The FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) scheme is a leading example.

**1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG):**
Instead of a trusted dealer, a DKG protocol is used to create the secret key shares. This avoids a single point of failure. Participants collaboratively generate their own secret shares such that no single participant ever knows the full private key, while a single public key represents the group.

**2. Two-Round Signing Protocol:**

*   **Round 1 (Commitment/Pre-computation):** Each of the *t* participating signers generates secret nonces and exchanges public commitments to these nonces. This round can be done before the message is known, improving efficiency.
*   **Round 2 (Signing):** Once the message is known, the signers exchange their signature shares. A designated aggregator then combines these shares to form the final, standard Schnorr signature.

**3. Tight Security:**
"Tight security" refers to a proof of security where the reduction from the scheme's security to a hard mathematical problem (like the discrete logarithm problem) has a minimal, constant "security loss." This allows for the use of more efficient parameters in practice without compromising security. Achieving tight security for Schnorr-based threshold signatures is an active area of research, with some proofs relying on stronger assumptions or operating in idealized models like the Random Oracle Model or Algebraic Group Model. FROST itself is proven secure against chosen-message attacks under the standard discrete logarithm assumption.
