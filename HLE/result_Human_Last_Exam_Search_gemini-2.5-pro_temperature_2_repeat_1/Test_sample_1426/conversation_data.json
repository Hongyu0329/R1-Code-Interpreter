    "The first violin part in the closing measures of Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" concludes with a series of three notes. The lowest of these final three notes is D.\n\nThe symphony, completed in 1865, ends with a flourish in the key of B-flat major. In the final bars of the fourth movement, titled \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco,\" the first violins play a triumphant passage that culminates in three powerful B-flat major chords. The notes played by the first violin in these last three chords are F, D, and B-flat. The lowest of this group is D. The score for the symphony is available for public viewing through the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP).\n\n<<<D>>>"
