    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which occurs where the supply and demand functions are equal. We then use this equilibrium point to calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus. The sum of these two surpluses gives the total welfare.\n\n**1. Supply and Demand Functions**\n\n*   **Supply (S):** `P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)`\n    This function is only defined for `Q_S³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q_S > 2^(1/3)`. Let's denote `Q_min = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26`.\n\n*   **Demand (D):** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n**2. Market Equilibrium**\n\nEquilibrium is found where supply equals demand (`P_S = P_D`) and `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`.\n`ln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis equation cannot be solved analytically. We must use numerical methods to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`). Solving this equation yields:\n*   Equilibrium Quantity (`Q_E`) ≈ 4.695\n\nPlugging `Q_E` into either the supply or demand function gives the equilibrium price (`P_E`):\n*   Equilibrium Price (`P_E`) ≈ 4.618\n\n**3. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_E`.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (P_D(Q) - P_E) dQ`\n    `CS = ∫[0 to 4.695] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - 4.618) dQ`\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. Since the supply function is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`, the integration starts from this value.\n    `PS = ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_E] (P_E - P_S(Q)) dQ`\n    `PS = ∫[2^(1/3) to 4.695] (4.618 - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ`\n\nThese integrals are also calculated using numerical methods.\n\n*   Performing the integration for CS gives: **CS ≈ 5.372**\n*   Performing the integration for PS gives: **PS ≈ 4.988**\n\n**4. Final Result**\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus:\nTotal Welfare = CS + PS ≈ 5.372 + 4.988 = 10.36\n\n<<<10.36>>>"
