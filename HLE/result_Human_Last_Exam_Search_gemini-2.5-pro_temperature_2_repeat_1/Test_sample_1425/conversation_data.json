    "In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H is given by the trace of the statistical operator e^(-β(H - μN)), where β is the inverse temperature, μ is the chemical potential, and N is the particle number operator. This can be expressed as a functional integral over fields, which provides the path integral representation.\n\nThe specific form of the path integral depends on whether the system is composed of bosons or fermions, as this determines the nature of the fields and the boundary conditions in the imaginary time formalism. For the given Hamiltonian H = 0, the operator in the exponent becomes -μN.\n\nThe path integral for the partition function is generally expressed as:\nZ = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])\n\nHere, S is the Euclidean action, and the integral is a functional integral over all possible field configurations ψ(x, τ) and their conjugates ψ*(x, τ). In the imaginary time formalism, the action S is given by:\n\nS = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L(ψ*, ψ)\n\nWhere L is the Lagrangian density corresponding to the grand canonical Hamiltonian H' = H - μN. For the specified system where H = 0, the grand canonical Hamiltonian is H' = -μN. The number operator N is expressed in terms of the fields as N = ∫ d³x ψ*(x)ψ(x). Therefore, the grand canonical Hamiltonian density is h' = -μψ*(x)ψ(x).\n\nA standard form for the kinetic part of the Lagrangian density in the many-body path integral is ψ*∂τψ. Combining this with the Hamiltonian density gives the full Lagrangian density:\nL = ψ*(x, τ)∂τψ(x, τ) - μψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)\n\nThus, the action for the system is:\nS = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ψ*(x, τ)(∂τ - μ)ψ(x, τ)]\n\nThe resulting partition function is:\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ψ*(x, τ)(∂τ - μ)ψ(x, τ)])**\n\nThe key difference between a system of bosons and a system of fermions lies in the boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the imaginary time variable τ and the nature of the fields themselves:\n*   For **bosons**, the fields ψ and ψ* are complex-valued, and they obey periodic boundary conditions: ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β).\n*   For **fermions**, the fields ψ and ψ* are Grassmann numbers (anti-commuting), and they obey anti-periodic boundary conditions: ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β).\n\n<<<The path integral representation for the partition function Z of a system with the grand canonical Hamiltonian H' = -μN in the imaginary time formalism is given by:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - μ)ψ(x, τ))**\n\nwhere:\n*   **∫ D[ψ*, ψ]** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the field ψ and its conjugate ψ*.\n*   **β** is the inverse temperature (1/k_B T).\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential.\n*   **τ** is the imaginary time variable, integrated from 0 to β.\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   **∂_τ** is the partial derivative with respect to τ.\n*   The fields are subject to boundary conditions in imaginary time:\n    *   **For Bosons:** Periodic boundary conditions, ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β). The fields are complex numbers.\n    *   **For Fermions:** Anti-periodic boundary conditions, ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β). The fields are Grassmann numbers."
