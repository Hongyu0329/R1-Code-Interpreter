    "To remain secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be sufficiently long to withstand brute-force attacks that are sped up by quantum algorithms. The most relevant quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric key encryption is Grover's algorithm.\n\nGrover's algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up over classical brute-force attacks. This means that if a symmetric key has a length of 'n' bits, a classical computer would need to perform on the order of 2^n operations to try every possible key. However, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm could theoretically find the correct key in approximately the square root of that time, on the order of 2^(n/2) operations.\n\nThis effectively halves the bit-strength of the symmetric key against a quantum attack. For example, an AES-128 key, which is considered very secure against classical computers, would only offer a 64-bit security level against a quantum computer. A 64-bit security level is not considered secure.\n\nTo mitigate this quantum threat, the general recommendation is to double the length of the symmetric key. For a desired post-quantum security level equivalent to 128 bits of classical security, a 256-bit symmetric key is recommended. An attack on a 256-bit key using a quantum computer would require on the order of 2^128 operations, which is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future. Therefore, a symmetric key length of 256 bits is considered the minimum to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
