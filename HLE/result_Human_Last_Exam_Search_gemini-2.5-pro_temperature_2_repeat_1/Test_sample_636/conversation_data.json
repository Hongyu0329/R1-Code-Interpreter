    "To find the state feedback gain matrix F, we first need to define the desired characteristic polynomial from the given eigenvalues, which are -1 + j and -1 - j.\n\nThe desired characteristic polynomial p(λ) is given by:\np(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))\np(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)\np(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²\np(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 + 1\np(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + BF.\nLet the state feedback gain matrix F be:\nF = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]\n\nNow, calculate the product BF:\nBF = [,] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\n\nThen, form the matrix A + BF:\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\nA + BF = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of A + BF is given by det(λI - (A + BF)) = 0.\nThis can also be expressed as λ² - tr(A + BF)λ + det(A + BF) = 0.\n\nThe trace of A + BF is:\ntr(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1\n\nThe determinant of A + BF is:\ndet(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)\ndet(A + BF) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)\ndet(A + BF) = -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A + BF with the desired characteristic polynomial (λ² + 2λ + 2), we get:\n1. -tr(A + BF) = 2  => -(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2  => f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1\n2. det(A + BF) = 2  => -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2 => -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns, which means there are infinite solutions. We can find a particular solution by assuming a simpler control structure. Let's assume that the second input is not used, which means u₂ = 0. This can be achieved by setting the second row of F to zero, so f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\n\nSubstituting f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0 into the two equations gives:\n1. f₁ + f₂ = -1\n2. -f₁ - 2f₂ = 3\n\nNow we solve this system of two linear equations. Adding the two equations together:\n(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3\n-f₂ = 2\nf₂ = -2\n\nSubstitute f₂ = -2 into the first equation:\nf₁ + (-2) = -1\nf₁ = 1\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = [[1, -2],]\n\nTo verify the result, calculate A + BF with the found F:\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\nA + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\n\nThe characteristic equation for this matrix is:\ndet(λI - (A+BF)) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ + 2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are λ = (-2 ± √(4 - 8)) / 2 = (-2 ± √(-4)) / 2 = -1 ± j. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
