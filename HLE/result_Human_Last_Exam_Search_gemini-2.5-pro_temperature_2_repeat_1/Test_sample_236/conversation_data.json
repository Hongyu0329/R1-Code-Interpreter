    "An infinite number of elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings. The knots with a maximum of four crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). Surgeries on just the unknot are sufficient to generate an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how these knots contribute to the homology cobordism group:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** An integral surgery with framing *n* on the unknot produces the lens space L(n, 1). For n = ±1, the resulting manifold is the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element of the homology cobordism group. However, for any two integers *n* and *m* with |n| ≠ |m| and |n|, |m| > 1, the lens spaces L(n, 1) and L(m, 1) are not homology cobordant. This can be demonstrated using invariants such as the d-invariant, which differ for these spaces. Since there are infinitely many integers, there are infinitely many distinct non-trivial elements of the homology cobordism group that arise from surgery on the unknot.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):**\n    *   A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot results in the Poincaré homology sphere Σ(2, 3, 5). The class of this sphere generates a subgroup isomorphic to the integers (ℤ) in the homology cobordism group and therefore has infinite order.\n    *   A -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil (or, equivalently, a +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil) gives the homology sphere -Σ(2, 3, 5), which is the inverse element and also of infinite order.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):**\n    *   A +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produces the Brieskorn homology sphere Σ(2, 3, 7). This element is also of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   It has been shown that surgeries on the figure-eight knot with coefficients ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±4 all result in non-trivial and distinct homology spheres.\n\nIn summary, the unknot alone generates an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. The trefoil and figure-eight knots also contribute additional elements of infinite order that are distinct from the lens spaces obtained from the unknot and from each other. Therefore, the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is infinite.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
