    "If two people successfully placed the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, there would be **14** edge squares without bishops.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 squares along its edges. The maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard without any of them attacking each other is 14. To achieve this maximum, all 14 bishops must be positioned on the edge squares of the board.\n\nThe placement involves placing 7 bishops on the light-colored edge squares and 7 bishops on the dark-colored edge squares. Since bishops of the same color attack each other along diagonals, they must be placed on squares that do not share a diagonal. A common solution is to place the bishops along the first and last ranks (rows).\n\nWith 28 total edge squares and 14 of them occupied by bishops, the number of empty edge squares is:\n\n28 total edge squares - 14 placed bishops = 14 empty edge squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
