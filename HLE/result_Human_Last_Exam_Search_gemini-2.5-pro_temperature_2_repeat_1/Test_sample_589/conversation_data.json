    "The search for a Hollywood feature film from a major studio depicting a teenager on a pink bike riding towards an oncoming car has not yielded a definitive match. Extensive searches across general search engines, movie-specific databases like IMDb and AllMovie, and community forums such as Reddit's /r/tipofmytongue did not identify a film with this specific scene.\n\nWhile many movies feature bicycles and car-related incidents, none of the search results contained the precise combination of a teenager, a pink bike, and a direct confrontation with an oncoming car as described. The searches brought up various unrelated films, products, and articles.\n\nIt is possible that such a scene exists in an independent film, a short film, a television show, or a non-US production, which would be less likely to be indexed in the databases searched with the specified criteria. It is also possible that the details of the scene may be remembered slightly differently than how they appear in a film.\n\nGiven the lack of any specific leads after multiple targeted searches, I am unable to provide the title of a film that matches the user's request.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify a Hollywood feature film from a major film studio with a scene where a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car.>>>"
