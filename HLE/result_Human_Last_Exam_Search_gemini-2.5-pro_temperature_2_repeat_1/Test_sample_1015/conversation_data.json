    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips and the corresponding action of the torso.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. When executing a cambré derrière, the movement should be initiated from the upper back, with a feeling of lifting the spine upwards before arching backwards. The hips are intended to remain square to the front, providing a solid foundation for the bend of the upper body. The Vaganova technique prioritizes a sense of harmony and coordination throughout the body, with the arms and head placement complementing the line created by the backbend.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features a more dynamic and less rigid torso. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style is the open hip in arabesque, which creates a longer, more extended line. While a cambré derrière is a backbend from a standing position rather than an arabesque, the underlying principles of the Balanchine aesthetic, such as the \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up,\" suggest a different use of the torso and hips compared to the strict squareness of Vaganova. The Balanchine approach allows for a greater sense of speed and a more unconventional line, which can influence the positioning of the hips even in a static backbend. The style is known for its speed and sharpness, with movements often having a more athletic and less formal quality than in the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement, head position, and speed can also differ between the two methods, the fundamental approach to hip placement—square and stable in Vaganova versus potentially more open and dynamic in Balanchine—is a significant point of divergence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
