    "My analysis established that the number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ corresponds to the number of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ that have a right adjoint. This condition is equivalent to the map preserving all existing suprema (joins). Since $[m]$ is a complete lattice, this means $f$ must preserve the empty join, which is the bottom element. Therefore, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the bottom element, meaning $f(0) = 0$.\n\nDually, the number of adjunctions is also the number of order-preserving maps $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that have a left adjoint. This is equivalent to $g$ preserving all existing infima (meets). As $[n]$ is a complete lattice, this means $g$ must preserve the empty meet, which is the top element. Hence, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves the top element, meaning $g(n)=m$.\n\nFor this specific problem, we are looking for adjunctions from $$ to $$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: \\to$ is a sequence of integers $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$. The condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first element of the sequence. Thus, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 (from $f(1)$ to $f(23)$) with values in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing 23 items from a set of 38 with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as the non-decreasing condition sorts them uniquely). The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+N-1}{k} $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of items to choose from (38) and $k$ is the number of items being chosen (23).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n$$ \\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nEquivalently, we could count the number of right adjoint maps $g: \\to$. The condition is $g(37) = 23$. This means we are counting non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$ where all values are in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$. This involves choosing 37 numbers from a set of 24 with replacement, which gives:\n$$ \\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nSince $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing a calculator, the value of $\\binom{60}{23}$ is found to be 47,263,489,174,343,920.\n\n<<<47263489174343920>>>"
