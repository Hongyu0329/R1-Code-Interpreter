The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, a₂, is given by the integral of a local density that depends on the scalar curvature of the spacetime and the square of the gauge field strength tensor. In four dimensions, the trace of this coefficient for N_f fermion flavors is given by  Tr(a₂) = (N_f / (4π)²) ∫ d⁴x √g [ (1/3) R - (1/6) F_μν^a F^aμν ], where R is the scalar curvature and F_μν is the gauge field strength.
