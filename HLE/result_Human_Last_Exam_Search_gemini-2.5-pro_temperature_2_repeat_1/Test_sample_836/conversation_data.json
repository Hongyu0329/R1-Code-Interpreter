    "I have performed the initial search and found several relevant documents. The search results indicate that the \"generalized pair correlation function\" is a concept used in statistical mechanics and is related to the probability of finding a pair of particles at certain positions and times. In the context of nuclear criticality, the relevant concepts appear to be \"neutron noise analysis,\" which includes methods like Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha. These methods analyze the correlations in neutron detections over time to determine reactor parameters. The space-time, double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function is known in a general context as the dynamic structure factor or scattering law, often denoted as S(Q,ω). Some documents also mention \"power spectral density\" (PSD) which is obtained by Fourier transforming time-series data of neutron counts. It seems that the specific terminology used in the nuclear criticality community for the double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function might be the \"power spectral density\" or a related quantity. I need to explicitly connect the generalized pair correlation function to the quantities measured in neutron noise analysis and confirm the name of its double Fourier transform within that specific community.\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In the context of neutron population in a nuclear reactor, the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of detecting a neutron at a certain position and time, given that another neutron was detected at a reference position and time. This function captures the correlations in the neutron population due to the fission chain reaction process.\n\n*   **Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform:**\n    *   The Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable (r) provides information about the spatial frequencies (wave vector, k).\n    *   The Fourier transform with respect to the temporal variable (t) provides information about the temporal frequencies (ω).\n    *   Performing a double Fourier transform on G(r, t) moves the function from the space-time domain to the frequency-wave vector domain, S(k, ω).\n\n*   **Nuclear Criticality Community Terminology:** Within the nuclear criticality community, the primary method for analyzing fluctuations (or \"noise\") in the neutron population is through measurements from neutron detectors. These detectors provide a time-series of neutron counts. The Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function of this time-series data is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.  The cross-correlation between two detectors leads to the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD).\n\nWhile in a more general statistical mechanics context the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function is known as the \"dynamic structure factor\" or \"scattering law\", the nuclear criticality community uses the term Power Spectral Density (PSD) to refer to the frequency spectrum of the neutron noise, which is fundamentally what the double Fourier transform of the underlying pair correlation of neutrons represents. The analysis of the PSD is a cornerstone of \"neutron noise analysis\" techniques used to determine reactor parameters.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and commonly used term in this specific field is the Power Spectral Density.The search results have confirmed that the \"generalized pair correlation function\" relates to the probability of finding particles at different positions and times, and its double Fourier transform is generally known as the dynamic structure factor, S(Q,ω). The documents from the nuclear criticality community extensively discuss \"neutron noise analysis\" techniques like Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha, which are based on measuring the correlation between neutron detection events. Furthermore, \"Power Spectral Density (PSD)\" is explicitly mentioned as the Fourier transform of the time-correlation of neutron signals and is a central quantity in reactor noise analysis. While the direct phrase \"space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\" is not explicitly defined in one place, the underlying physics and mathematics connect the concepts. The PSD in nuclear criticality is the practical, measurable quantity that results from the Fourier analysis of the temporal correlations, which are a manifestation of the underlying space-time pair correlations of neutrons. Therefore, I can confidently synthesize the answer.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
