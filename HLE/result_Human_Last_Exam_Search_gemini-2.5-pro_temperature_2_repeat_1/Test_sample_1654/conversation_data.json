    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat and his actions of taking it off and putting it on are mentioned 6 times to symbolize his shifting mentality and fearful deference to authority.\n\nThe instances are as follows:\n*   He is initially described as \"wearing a new overcoat\" as he walks across the market square.\n*   When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot and asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him take his coat off.\n*   Upon hearing a contradictory opinion that the dog is not the general's, he feels a \"chill\" and asks Yeldyrin to help him put his coat back on.\n*   When someone in the crowd reiterates that it might be the general's dog after all, he again complains of the heat and has the coat removed.\n*   When it's confirmed the dog isn't the general's, he orders his coat back on, feeling the \"wind\" again.\n*   Finally, upon learning the dog belongs to the general's brother, he once more requests help putting on his coat.\n\nThese repeated actions with his overcoat serve as a visual gag and a potent symbol of his servility and the farcical nature of his authority, which fluctuates with every new piece of information about the dog's ownership. His internal state of fear and desire to appease his superiors is externalized through his sensitivity to the \"heat\" and \"chill\" he feels, prompting the removal or wearing of his coat.\n\n<<<6>>>"
