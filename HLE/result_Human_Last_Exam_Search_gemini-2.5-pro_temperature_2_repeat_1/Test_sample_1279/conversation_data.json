    "In the context of φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are Feynman diagrams without any external lines, contributing to the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude at the second order of the coupling constant (λ). There are two such distinct diagrams. We will calculate the symmetry factor for each and then sum them.\n\n### The Two Second-Order Vacuum Bubble Diagrams\n\n1.  **The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:** This is a connected diagram with two vertices. Each vertex has four lines. Two lines from one vertex connect to the other vertex, and the remaining two lines at each vertex form a loop by connecting to the vertex itself.\n\n2.  **The \"Disconnected Double Tadpole\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two separate, disconnected loops. Each loop is a first-order vacuum bubble diagram (a \"tadpole\").\n\n### Calculation of Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, which corresponds to the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the structure of the diagram.\n\n#### 1. The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram\n\nThe symmetry factor for the figure-eight diagram is calculated by considering its various symmetries:\n\n*   **Swapping the two vertices:** The two vertices in the diagram are indistinguishable. Swapping their positions leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Swapping the lines within the loops:** Each of the two loops (the \"ears\" of the figure-eight) is formed by two propagator lines. These two lines can be interchanged without altering the diagram. This contributes a factor of 2 for each loop.\n*   **Swapping the lines connecting the vertices:** The two lines connecting the two vertices are also indistinguishable and can be swapped, which provides another factor of 2.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward way to arrive at the symmetry factor of 8 is as follows:\n*   There's a factor of 2 from the ability to swap the two vertices.\n*   There's a factor of 2 from swapping the two lines in the top loop.\n*   There's a factor of 2 from swapping the two lines in the bottom loop.\n\nCombining these gives a total symmetry factor of 2 × 2 × 2 = **8**.\n\n#### 2. The \"Disconnected Double Tadpole\" Diagram\n\nThis diagram is composed of two identical, disconnected first-order vacuum bubbles. The symmetry factor is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Symmetry of a single loop:** A single loop (tadpole) consists of a vertex with two lines connected to each other. These two lines can be swapped, leading to a symmetry factor of 2 for each loop.\n*   **Symmetry of the pair of loops:** Since the two loops are identical and disconnected, the two loops themselves can be interchanged. This introduces a factor of 2! (which is 2).\n\nTherefore, the total symmetry factor for this diagram is the product of the symmetries of the individual components and the symmetry of swapping the identical components: 2 (for the first loop) × 2 (for the second loop) × 2 (for swapping the loops) = **8**.\n\n### Sum of the Symmetry Factors\n\nTo find the total symmetry factor for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams, we sum the symmetry factors of the individual diagrams:\n\nTotal Symmetry Factor = (Symmetry Factor of Figure-Eight) + (Symmetry Factor of Disconnected Double Tadpole)\nTotal Symmetry Factor = 8 + 8 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
