Based on the information, a key counseling recommendation for the pharmacist would be to advise Allison about the potential interaction between Excedrin (aspirin) and Fluoxetine, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend a safer alternative for her headache. Additionally, the pharmacist should counsel Allison to see her doctor to investigate the cause of her olfactory hallucination (smelling sea water), as it could be a rare side effect of her medications, particularly the Atorvastatin or Fluoxetine, or a sign of an underlying medical condition. The headache itself is a common side effect of all three of her prescribed medications.
