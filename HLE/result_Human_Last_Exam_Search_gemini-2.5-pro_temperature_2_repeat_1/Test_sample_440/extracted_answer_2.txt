The density profile $\rho(z)$ of the gas mixture as a function of height ($z$) is determined by the set of equations derived from the principle of constant chemical potential for each gas species at equilibrium. The number density profiles, $n_A(z)$ and $n_B(z)$, are implicitly defined for $z \in [0, H]$ by the following system:

1.  **Equilibrium Conditions:**
    *   For Gas A: $k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_A(z)}{1 - (n_A(z)b_{AA,p} + n_B(z)b_{BB,p})}\right) + \frac{k_B T b_{AA,p}}{1-(n_A(z)b_{AA,p} + n_B(z)b_{BB,p})} - 2(n_A(z) a_{AA,p} + n_B(z) a_{AB,p}) + m_A g z = C_1$
    *   For Gas B: $k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_B(z)}{1 - (n_A(z)b_{AA,p} + n_B(z)b_{BB,p})}\right) + \frac{k_B T b_{BB,p}}{1-(n_A(z)b_{AA,p} + n_B(z)b_{BB,p})} - 2(n_B(z) a_{BB,p} + n_A(z) a_{AB,p}) + m_B g z = C_2$

2.  **Normalization Conditions:**
    *   $N_A = A \int_0^H n_A(z) \,dz$
    *   $N_B = A \int_0^H n_B(z) \,dz$

Solving this system yields the functions $n_A(z)$ and $n_B(z)$. The final mass density profile is then calculated as:
$\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)$

All parameters ($m_i, a_{ij,p}, b_{ii,p}$) are derived from the problem statement. A numerical solution is required to find the explicit functions.
