The post-reset covariance Σ' is computed using the formula: Σ' = J * Σ * J^T, where Σ is the pre-reset covariance and J is the Jacobian matrix given by the exact, non-approximated expression: J = I - (1/2) * \hat{δ} + (1/|δ|^2 - (1+|δ|*cot(|δ|/2))/(2*|δ|^2)) * (\hat{δ})^2. In this expression, I is the 3x3 identity matrix, δ is the mean of the attitude deviation vector that is being reset, \hat{δ} is the corresponding skew-symmetric matrix, and |δ| is the magnitude of the vector δ.
