    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Amartya Sen**.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is widely confirmed to have appeared in the television advertisement. In one of the commercials, an older man with a serious demeanor, identified as Gell-Mann, states, \"We inherit some ideas that are unnecessary. We have to jettison that excess baggage in order to make progress.\"\n\nThe second Nobel laureate was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. While his appearance is less directly documented, descriptions from the time refer to an \"Indian commentator\" who was a public intellectual of the 1990s also being featured in the \"Ask Why\" campaign, a description that fits Sen. Sen's work often touches on ethical considerations in economics, and he has been referenced in discussions regarding the Enron scandal.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a hallmark of Enron's public image before its catastrophic collapse and became an ironic symbol of the company's fraudulent practices.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
