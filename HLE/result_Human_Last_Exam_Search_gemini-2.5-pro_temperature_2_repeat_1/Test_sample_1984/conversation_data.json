    "The provided information confirms my initial analysis. I'll briefly restate the steps and conclusion to ensure accuracy.\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points:**\nThe differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^3(t) + 2x^2(t) - x(t)$.\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set $x'(t) = 0$:\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\nThe equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**2. Determine Stability of Equilibrium Points:**\nLet $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The stability of the equilibrium points is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at those points.\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n\nFor $x=0$:\n$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x=0$ is stable.\n\nFor $x=1$:\n$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\nThe derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ near $x=1$.\n- For $x < 1$ and close to 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(x) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$. This means that solutions starting slightly below $x=1$ will move away from it.\n- For $x > 1$ and close to 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(x) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$. This means that solutions starting slightly above $x=1$ will move towards it.\nSince solutions on one side move towards the equilibrium and on the other side move away, $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nBased on this analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Value:**\nWe are asked to find $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$. I will format the response as requested.\n\nThe number of stable equilibria, denoted by $m$, for the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^3(t) + 2x^2(t) - x(t)$ must be determined.\n\nFirst, we find the equilibrium points by setting the derivative to zero:\n$x'(t) = -x(x-1)^2 = 0$\nThis gives us the equilibrium points $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we analyze the function $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The derivative of this function is $f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x=0$, we evaluate the derivative:\n$f'(0) = -1 < 0$.\nSince the derivative is negative, the equilibrium at $x=0$ is stable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x=1$, the derivative is:\n$f'(1) = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\nSince the derivative is zero, we examine the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly greater than 1, $f(x)$ is negative, causing the solution to move towards 1. For values of $x$ slightly less than 1, $f(x)$ is also negative, which causes the solution to move away from 1. This means that $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium, not a stable one.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, so $m=1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
