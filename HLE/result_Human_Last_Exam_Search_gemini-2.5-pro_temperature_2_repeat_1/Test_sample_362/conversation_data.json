    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃CCHO) reacts with the Wittig reagent, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, which has the structure (C₆H₅)₃P=CHCH₂(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde with the carbon group from the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond where the carbonyl group and the phosphorus ylide double bond were, resulting in an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe resulting alkene product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nFurthermore, the stereochemistry of the alkene product can be predicted. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, is considered a non-stabilized ylide because the group attached to the P=C bond is an alkyl-type group, not a group that can stabilize the negative charge through resonance (like an ester or ketone). Reactions of non-stabilized ylides with aldehydes typically lead to the formation of the (Z)-alkene as the major product. Therefore, the primary product of this reaction is expected to be **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
