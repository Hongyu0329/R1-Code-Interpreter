    "## Thomas Aquinas and the Concept of \"Obediential Potency\"\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Thomas Aquinas**. The key term he utilized is **\"obediential potency\"** (*potentia obedientialis*).\n\nThis concept describes the inherent capacity within all created things to be acted upon by God in ways that exceed their natural abilities. Essentially, it is the creature's \"obedience\" to the Creator's will, allowing for miracles to occur without violating the natural order, as God, the author of that order, can choose to operate outside of its usual workings.\n\n### Application to the Virgin Birth and the Fall\n\n**The Virgin Birth:** According to Aquinas's framework, the virgin birth of Jesus is a prime example of obediential potency. While it is not within the natural capacity of a virgin to conceive and give birth, Mary's body possessed an obediential potency to be used by God in a supernatural way. In his writings, Aquinas affirms that God can \"make a virgin to give birth and yet remain a virgin,\" demonstrating God's power to work beyond the established laws of nature.\n\n**The Fall:** The concept of obediential potency also provides a framework for understanding the consequences of the Fall of Man. Theologians following Aquinas have argued that at creation, human nature was elevated by grace to a supernatural state. With the Fall and the loss of this grace, human nature was \"wounded\" and its relationship with the natural world altered. This change can be understood through the lens of obediential potency, as human nature, originally capable of a harmonious relationship with God and creation through grace, was returned to a lower, purely natural state, subject to corruption and disorder. The inherent openness of nature to be elevated by grace, a form of obediential potency, was no longer actualized in the same way.\n\nWhile the philosophical and theological underpinnings of obediential potency have roots in earlier Christian thinkers like Augustine of Hippo, who spoke of nature's obedience to God, it was Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century who systematically developed and named this concept, providing a specific theological language to discuss divine action in relation to the laws of nature.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
