    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box in a specific interval is determined by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nFor a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function for the quantum state n=2 is given by the formula ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a). The probability density is therefore |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a).\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a, we need to calculate the following integral:\n\nP = ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, the integral becomes:\n\nP = (1/a) ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n\nEvaluating this definite integral gives:\n\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nPlugging in the limits of integration yields:\n\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nThe final calculated probability is approximately:\n\n<<<6.58 x 10⁻⁶>>>"
