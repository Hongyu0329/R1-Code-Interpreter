    "When a curve of genus 4, defined over a valuation field, has a Jacobian that possesses good reduction, the stable reduction of the curve itself is constrained to a finite number of specific configurations. According to the theory of stable reduction, particularly the results of Deligne and Mumford, if the Jacobian variety of a curve has good reduction, then the stable model of the curve must be a so-called \"curve of compact type\". This means its special fiber is a connected nodal curve whose irreducible components have positive genera, and whose dual graph is a tree.\n\nThe classification of these stable reduction types is equivalent to classifying the ways the integer 4 can be partitioned into a sum of smaller positive integers, and for each partition, enumerating the possible tree-like configurations of the component curves.\n\nThe possible types of stable reductions are as follows:\n\n*   **One Component (Good Reduction):**\n    1.  The simplest case is where the curve itself has good reduction, resulting in a single, smooth curve of genus 4.\n\n*   **Two Components:**\n    2.  A curve of genus 3 connected to a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve) at a single node. A genus 3 curve can be either hyperelliptic or a non-hyperelliptic plane quartic, leading some classifications to consider this as two distinct types.\n    3.  A curve of genus 3 that is not hyperelliptic connected to a genus 1 curve at a single point.\n    4.  Two curves of genus 2 connected at a single node.\n\n*   **Three Components (all of genus > 0):** The partition must be 2+1+1.\n    5.  A central curve of genus 2 connected to two elliptic curves at two different points.\n    6.  A central elliptic curve connected to another elliptic curve and a genus 2 curve.\n\n*   **Four Components (all of genus > 0):** The partition must be 1+1+1+1.\n    7.  Four elliptic curves connected in a line (a path graph).\n    8.  One central elliptic curve connected to the other three at three different points (a star graph).\n\nConsidering the distinction between a hyperelliptic and a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 component, there are a total of **8** types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n<<<8>>>"
