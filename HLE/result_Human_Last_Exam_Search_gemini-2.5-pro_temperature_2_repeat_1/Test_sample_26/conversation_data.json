    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is reached through a series of steps combining key theorems from algebraic topology:\n\n1.  **Relation between Homotopy and Homology:** For a simply-connected space such as $X$, the rational Hurewicz theorem implies that the rank of the n-th homotopy group is equal to the rank of the n-th homology group (the n-th Betti number). Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem guarantees that it is simply-connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$). Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the rank of the third homology group, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Duality:** $X$ is a smooth complex surface, making it a compact, connected, orientable real manifold of dimension 4. For such a manifold, Poincaré duality establishes an isomorphism between homology and cohomology groups. Specifically, it shows that $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $H^{1}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Cohomology:** The first cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be determined using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem relates cohomology to homology. Since $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ (a consequence of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem) and $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (as $X$ is connected), the formula yields that $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, by Poincaré duality, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ must also be 0. Since the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the rank of $H_3(X)$, the rank of the third homotopy group of $X$ is 0. All integral homology groups of a smooth hypersurface $X$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$ are torsion-free.\n\n<<<0>>>"
