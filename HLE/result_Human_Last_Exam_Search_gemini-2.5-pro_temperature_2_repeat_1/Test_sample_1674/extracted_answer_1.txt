Yes, the theory will not hold. The birefringent medium alters the polarization of the Laguerre-Gaussian beam before it enters the random medium. The inverse of the random medium's transmission matrix will only reverse the effects of the random medium, not the polarization changes introduced by the birefringent material. Consequently, the final output will be the original beam as modified by the birefringent medium, not the original input beam itself.
