The effective electron-electron interaction is given by the following potential:
$U_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = -\sum_{j} \frac{2 g^2 q_j^2}{m} \frac{1}{w_q^2 + \omega_n^2}$
This interaction is added to the electron action as $S_{eff} = \frac{1}{2\beta} \sum_{\mathbf{q},n} U_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) \rho_{\mathbf{q},n} \rho_{-\mathbf{q},-n}$.
