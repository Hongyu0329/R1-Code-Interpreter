    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, there are **7** power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup is a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group for some integer k. To find all power subgroups of a finite group, it is sufficient to consider the divisors of the group's exponent. The exponent of a group is the smallest positive integer `e` such that `g^e = 1` for every element `g` in the group.\n\nThe group Q128 has the presentation:\nQ128 = < a, b | a⁶⁴ = 1, b² = a³², bab⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of elements of the form aⁱ (for i from 0 to 63) and aⁱb (for i from 0 to 63). The order of element 'a' is 64, and the order of any element of the form aⁱb is 4. The exponent of Q128 is the least common multiple of the orders of its elements, which is 64.\n\nThe divisors of the exponent 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. For each divisor `d`, we can compute the power subgroup Gᵈ, which is the subgroup generated by all elements of the form gᵈ where g is in Q128.\n\nThe resulting power subgroups are:\n*   **G¹:** The subgroup generated by all elements, which is Q128 itself.\n*   **G²:** The subgroup generated by the squares of all elements. This is the cyclic subgroup `<a²>` of order 32.\n*   **G⁴:** The subgroup generated by the 4th powers of all elements. This is the cyclic subgroup `<a⁴>` of order 16.\n*   **G⁸:** The subgroup generated by the 8th powers of all elements. This is the cyclic subgroup `<a⁸>` of order 8.\n*   **G¹⁶:** The subgroup generated by the 16th powers of all elements. This is the cyclic subgroup `<a¹⁶>` of order 4.\n*   **G³²:** The subgroup generated by the 32nd powers of all elements. This is the cyclic subgroup `<a³²>` of order 2.\n*   **G⁶⁴:** The subgroup generated by the 64th powers of all elements, which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element.\n\nThese seven subgroups are all distinct, giving a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
