    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 12.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. The symmetry group of a system of differential equations is the group of transformations that leave the equations unchanged. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions, this group is a 12-dimensional Lie group. The dimension is determined by the number of independent generators of the corresponding Lie algebra. These generators correspond to the following physical symmetries:\n\n*   **Time translation (1 dimension):** The laws of physics do not change over time.\n*   **Space translations (3 dimensions):** The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space. This corresponds to translations along the x, y, and z axes.\n*   **Rotations (3 dimensions):** The laws of physics are isotropic, meaning they are the same in all directions. This corresponds to rotations about the x, y, and z axes.\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame. This corresponds to boosts in the x, y, and z directions.\n*   **Scaling (1 dimension):** A specific scaling of space, time, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant. This particular scaling transformation reflects the balance between the inertial and viscous terms in the equations.\n*   **Pressure shift (1 dimension):** Because the pressure `p` only appears as its gradient (`âˆ‡p`) in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, adding a constant value to the pressure does not affect the equations.\n\nSumming these up gives the total dimension: 1 (time) + 3 (space) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (boosts) + 1 (scaling) + 1 (pressure) = 12.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the Lie symmetry group is also 12-dimensional, though the physical interpretation of the pressure and the form of some generators differ. Furthermore, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations also admit an infinite-dimensional symmetry group if one considers transformations where the pressure is shifted by an arbitrary function of time. However, the standard finite-dimensional Lie point symmetry group has dimension 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
