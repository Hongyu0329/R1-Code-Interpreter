    "During the period of 1730 to 1731, the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery was Markell (Radyshevsky).\n\nMarkell was appointed as the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery in 1724 and also served as a judge at the bishop's house. His appointment was facilitated by his school friend, Bishop Feofan. By 1726, he had moved to become the abbot of the Yuriev Monastery in Novgorod. However, historical records indicate his continued involvement and influence within the church, including writing critiques of Archbishop Feofan in 1730.\n\n<<<F>>>"
