In summary, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, below the upper critical dimension of four, primarily described by the ε-expansion (where ε = 4 - d). To the second order in ε for a single component scalar field, the quantitative scaling is given by α ≈ (4-d)/6 + (4-d)²/54.
