For a distance-3 code with a 1% error rate, the required number of non-Clifford gates is effectively infinite as the error correction is insufficient. For a distance-5 code, implementing a single high-fidelity non-Clifford gate requires a "T-factory" involving hundreds of thousands to millions of physical gate operations.
