    "This puzzle requires identifying a transformation rule that converts the input grid into the output grid. The transformation revolves around the movement of the digit '2'.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nBy observing the changes between the input and output grids in the provided examples, we can deduce a set of rules governing the transformation.\n\n1.  **The Core Mechanic**: The digit '2' moves to an adjacent '0'. The original cell of the '2' becomes a '0', and the destination cell containing the '0' becomes a '2'.\n\n2.  **Move Selection**: The choice of which adjacent '0' to move to is determined by a specific criterion. This criterion seems to depend on the properties of the candidate '0' cells. For each neighboring '0' of the '2', we calculate the sum of the values of its own neighbors.\n\n3.  **Alternating Criterion**:\n    *   In **Input_A to Output_A**, the '2' moves to the neighboring '0' cell that has the **minimum** sum of its own neighbors.\n    *   In **Input_B to Output_B**, the '2' moves to the neighboring '0' cell that has the **maximum** sum of its own neighbors.\n\nThis suggests an alternating pattern for the selection criterion: minimum, then maximum. For Puzzle C, we will therefore use the **minimum** sum criterion again.\n\n### Applying the Rule to Puzzle C\n\n**Input_C**: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\nThis can be represented as the following grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: The '2' is at position (1, 4).\n\n2.  **Identify Neighboring '0's**: The '0's adjacent to the '2' at (1, 4) are at:\n    *   `c1 = (0, 3)`\n    *   `c2 = (0, 4)`\n    *   `c3 = (0, 5)`\n    *   `c4 = (1, 5)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Neighbor Sums**: We calculate the sum of the neighbors for each candidate '0' cell. The rule for Puzzle C is to choose the location with the **minimum** sum.\n\n    *   **c1 (0, 3)**: Neighbors are at (0,2)=0, (0,4)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=2. Sum = `0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.\n    *   **c2 (0, 4)**: Neighbors are at (0,3)=0, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. Sum = `0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 3`.\n    *   **c3 (0, 5)**: Neighbors are at (0,4)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. Sum = `0 + 2 + 0 = 2`.\n    *   **c4 (1, 5)**: Neighbors are at (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (1,4)=2, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=1. Sum = `0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\n\n4.  **Select the Destination**: The sums are {4, 3, 2, 4}. The minimum sum is 2, which corresponds to the cell `c3 = (0, 5)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Transformation**:\n    *   The '2' at `(1, 4)` moves, so its position becomes '0'. Row 1 (`011120`) changes to `011100`.\n    *   The destination `(0, 5)` which was '0', becomes '2'. Row 0 (`000000`) changes to `000002`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Output**:\n    *   Row 0: `000002`\n    *   Row 1: `011100`\n    *   Row 2: `111111` (unchanged)\n\nThe resulting output string is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
