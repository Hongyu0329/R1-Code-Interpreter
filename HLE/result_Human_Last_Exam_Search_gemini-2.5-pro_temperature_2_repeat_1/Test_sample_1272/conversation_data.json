The ensuing battle at Bô Cô, located on the Đáy River, resulted in a decisive victory for the Vietnamese forces under the command of Giản Định Đế (Trần Ngỗi). The Ming forces, led by Mu Sheng, were defeated in what is considered the largest battle of the conflict between the Ming dynasty and the Later Trần dynasty's loyalist forces.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
