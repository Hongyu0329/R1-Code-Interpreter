    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels, you should prepare several types of essential controls to ensure accurate and reproducible results. The primary controls needed are for setting voltages, compensation, gating, and ensuring cell viability.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and the number of individual samples required for each:\n\n### **1. Unstained Control (1 sample)**\n*   **Purpose:** This sample contains your cells and the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent dyes. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of both the cells and the beads, which is crucial for setting the initial detector voltages (PMTs).\n*   **Preparation:** A tube containing both the cells and streptavidin beads in your staining buffer.\n\n### **2. Compensation Controls (5 samples)**\n*   **Purpose:** In a multicolor experiment, the fluorescence emission of one dye can often \"spill over\" into another detector. Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spectral overlap. To do this accurately, you need to run a sample stained with only one fluorochrome for each color in your panel.\n*   **Preparation:** Five separate tubes, each containing cells or compensation beads stained with only one of the following:\n    *   AF350\n    *   GFP\n    *   PE\n    *   AF647\n    *   AF750\n\n### **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples)**\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, especially for markers that have dim or continuous expression. Each FMO control is stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel, except for one. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for precise gating. For a sorting experiment where purity is paramount, FMO controls are essential.\n*   **Preparation:** Five separate tubes, each missing one of the fluorochromes from your five-color panel.\n\n### **4. Viability Dye Control (1 sample)**\n*   **Purpose:** Dead cells have a tendency to non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit higher autofluorescence, which can lead to false-positive results. A viability dye allows you to identify and exclude dead cells from your analysis and sort, which is crucial for obtaining a pure and viable sorted population.\n*   **Preparation:** A tube with cells stained only with the viability dye. This allows you to set the gate to distinguish live cells from dead cells. This viability dye will also need to be included in your fully stained sample and FMO controls, and it requires its own separate detection channel that does not significantly overlap with your other five fluorochromes.\n\n### **Optional but Recommended Controls**\n*   **Isotype Controls:** These are antibodies that have the same immunoglobulin class and subclass as your primary antibody but are raised against an antigen not present in your sample. Their purpose is to assess non-specific binding of the antibody itself. The use of isotype controls is debated, with many researchers now favoring FMO controls for more accurate gating. They can, however, be useful for troubleshooting unexpected staining results. If you were to use them, you would need one for each primary antibody in your panel.\n\n### **Summary of Essential Controls**\nIn summary, for a rigorous five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare:\n*   1 Unstained Control\n*   5 Compensation Controls\n*   5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\n*   1 Viability Dye Control\n\n<<<12>>>"
