    "While the specific name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not readily available in online sources, historical records provide insight into the governance of the town during this period. The head of the town was known as the \"richtár\" in Slovak or \"bíró\" in Hungarian, which translates to judge or mayor.\n\nDuring the 15th century, a dynamic period for Bardejov, the position of richtár was held by a limited number of individuals. Over the latter half of the century, only about ten men served in this capacity. The town was governed by a town council, and in the decade from 1461 to 1470, a total of 35 different burghers are recorded as having served on this twelve-member council.\n\nHistorical accounts mention a significant event in 1461 where townspeople from Bardejov were involved in a dispute with the residents of Nowy Sącz, accusing them of aiding thieves and robbers. Letters from this time were often addressed to the town's judge and council, highlighting their central role in the administration and legal affairs of the town. For instance, a letter from 1465 is known to have been addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\".\n\nSeveral notable individuals were active in Bardejov's civic life around this time. Juraj Stenczel was a long-serving member of the town council during the 15th century. While the name of the judge for the specific year of 1461 remains elusive in the available records, a later judge, George Mager, is mentioned as being in office in 1479. Another richtár, Leonard Haid, is also mentioned in connection with a historical inscription, although the exact year of his service is not specified.\n\nDetailed information regarding the town's administrative officials is likely contained within specialized academic publications that are not fully accessible online. These include \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková and particularly \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, which contains a chapter specifically on the judges of Bardejov in the 15th century. Without access to these comprehensive sources, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be definitively stated.\n\n<<<The identity of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not specifically mentioned in the available search results.>>>"
