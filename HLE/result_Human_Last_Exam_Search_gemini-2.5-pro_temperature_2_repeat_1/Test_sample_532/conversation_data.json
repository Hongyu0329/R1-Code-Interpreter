    "### Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups Characterized\n\nA finite group *G* is termed a \"filled group\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also fills the group. Research into this area of group theory has led to the classification of certain families of groups with this property, including the finite nilpotent groups.\n\nA finite group is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. This decomposition is fundamental to understanding their structure. The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups leverages this property, along with results from the study of product-free sets.\n\nThe complete classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is as follows:\n\nA finite nilpotent group *G* is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n*   **An elementary abelian 2-group:** These are groups of the form (C₂)ⁿ for some integer n ≥ 1, where C₂ is the cyclic group of order 2. In these groups, every non-identity element has order 2.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.**\n*   **The cyclic group of order 5, C₅.**\n*   **The direct product of an elementary abelian 2-group and the cyclic group of order 3, C₂ⁿ × C₃.**\n*   **The direct product of an elementary abelian 2-group and the cyclic group of order 5, C₂ⁿ × C₅.**\n\nThis classification is a result of work by C. S. Anabanti, S. B. Hart, and G. Erskine. Their research, particularly in the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\", provides a detailed analysis leading to this classification. The study builds upon the classification of abelian filled groups, which are identified as elementary abelian 2-groups, C₃, and C₅.\n\nFor a nilpotent group to be filled, its Sylow p-subgroups must themselves be filled groups or combine in a way that preserves the filled property. The analysis shows that the only possible Sylow p-subgroups for a filled nilpotent group are elementary abelian 2-groups, C₃, and C₅. Furthermore, the direct product of filled p-groups is not always filled. The investigation reveals that only the specific combinations listed above result in a finite filled nilpotent group.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is one of the following: an elementary abelian 2-group, C₃, C₅, C₂ⁿ × C₃, or C₂ⁿ × C₅ for some integer n ≥ 1.>>>"
