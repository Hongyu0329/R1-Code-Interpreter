    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. This formalism is essential to correctly incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n\nThe partition function Z in quantum statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the thermal density matrix, Z = Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ), where β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/(kₛT)), H is the Hamiltonian of the system, and kₛ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nIn the imaginary time path integral formalism, this trace is expressed as an integral over all possible field configurations. For fermions, these fields are not ordinary numbers but anticommuting Grassmann variables. This leads to the following formula for the fermionic partition function:\n\n<<<Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ e⁻ˢᵉ[ψ̄,ψ]\n\nwhere:\n*   **Z** is the fermionic partition function.\n*   **ψ(τ, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x)** are the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields, which are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates x. These anticommuting numbers are used to represent fermionic degrees of freedom.\n*   **∫Dψ̄Dψ** represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fields ψ̄ and ψ.\n*   **Sₑ[ψ̄,ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system.\n\nThe integral is performed subject to a crucial boundary condition for fermions in the imaginary time direction: **anti-periodic boundary conditions**. This means the fields must satisfy:\nψ(τ = 0, x) = -ψ(τ = β, x)\nψ̄(τ = 0, x) = -ψ̄(τ = β, x)\n\nThis anti-periodicity arises from the fermionic statistics and is a key difference from the periodic boundary conditions used for bosonic fields.\n\nThe **Euclidean action Sₑ** is obtained from the standard (Minkowskian) action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). It is given by an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density Lₑ over imaginary time from 0 to β and over all spatial dimensions:\n\nSₑ[ψ̄,ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫dᵈx Lₑ(ψ̄, ψ, ∂ₜψ, ∇ψ)\n\nA common form for the Euclidean Lagrangian density for a non-relativistic fermion system is:\n\nLₑ = ψ̄(τ,x)(∂ₜ + H)ψ(τ,x)\n\nHere, H could be the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, for instance, H = - (∇²/2m) - μ, where μ is the chemical potential. The path integral, therefore, sums over all possible \"histories\" of the fermionic field in imaginary time, weighted by the factor e⁻ˢᵉ. For non-interacting fermions where the action is quadratic in the fields, this Gaussian integral can be evaluated exactly and results in the determinant of the operator (∂ₜ + H)."
