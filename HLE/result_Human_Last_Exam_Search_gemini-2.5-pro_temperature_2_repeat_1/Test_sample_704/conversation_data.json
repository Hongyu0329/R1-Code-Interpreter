    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color green (produced by combining yellow and blue) and blue itself is G.\n\nNewton created a circular diagram of colors based on the spectrum of light he observed through a prism. He associated these colors with the seven notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on the note D. In this system, each color of the spectrum is assigned a note.\n\nWhen yellow and blue are mixed, they produce the color green. According to Newton's color-music wheel, the color green corresponds to the musical note G. The next color in his sequence is blue, which is associated with the note A. Therefore, the musical note corresponding to the beginning of the range between green and blue is G.\n\nHere is the correspondence of colors and musical notes on Newton's circle:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\n<<<G>>>"
