    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemistry pun that combines the structure of a benzene ring with the iconic three-pointed star logo of Mercedes-Benz. The imagined structure consists of a benzene ring with a tert-butyl group attached to it.\n\nA standard benzene ring (C₆H₆) is a hexagon containing six carbon atoms. The tert-butyl group, which resembles the Mercedes-Benz logo, has a central carbon atom bonded to three other carbon atoms (in the form of methyl groups).\n\nTherefore, to determine the total number of carbons in \"mercedesbenzene,\" we add the carbons from the benzene ring and the tert-butyl group:\n\n*   **Benzene ring:** 6 carbon atoms\n*   **tert-Butyl group:** 4 carbon atoms\n\nThis results in a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<10>>>"
