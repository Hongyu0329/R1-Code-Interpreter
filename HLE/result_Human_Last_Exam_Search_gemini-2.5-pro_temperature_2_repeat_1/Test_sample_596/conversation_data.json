    "The higher-dimensional rooted forests `(F, R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest `F` simplicially collapse onto the root `R` are those for which the relative homology group `H_1(F, R; Z)` is non-trivial.\n\nFor a non-orientable 2-manifold like the Möbius band, this non-collapsibility is intrinsically linked to the non-orientability of the surface itself. The primary examples of such non-collapsing forests arise when the forest `F` is the entire triangulation `K` of the Möbius band. In this case, for any valid root `R`, the relative homology group `H_1(K, R; Z)` contains a `Z_2` torsion component, making it non-trivial. This is a fundamental result in the study of higher-dimensional trees on non-orientable manifolds.\n\nConversely, for a minimal triangulation of the Möbius band, any forest `F` that is a proper subcomplex of the full triangulation `K` (i.e., `F` is obtained by removing one or more 2-simplices from `K`) is known to be simplicially collapsible. This is because the Möbius band is a \"punctured\" non-orientable manifold (a punctured real projective plane), and removing a simplex can resolve the topological obstruction to collapse that the full manifold possesses.\n\nTherefore, the set of rooted forests that fail to simplicially collapse consists solely of those where the forest `F` is the entire triangulation `K`. The problem is thus reduced to counting the number of these specific rooted forests, which is equivalent to counting the number of possible valid roots `R` for the maximal forest `F = K`.\n\nThe number of roots for the maximal forest of the minimal triangulation of the real projective plane (the closed non-orientable surface from which the Möbius band is derived by puncturing) is known to be 4. Given the close topological relationship and the shared source of non-collapsibility (torsion in homology), the same number of roots applies to the maximal forest of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n\nThus, there are 4 such rooted forests.\n\n<<<4>>>"
