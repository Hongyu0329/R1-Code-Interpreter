    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership grade of the consequent. The firing strength, given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, represents the degree to which the input data matches the rule's condition. The consequent membership grade is given as `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic. There are several types of t-norms, and the specific value of the rule activation level will depend on which t-norm is used. The most common t-norms include the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\nHere are the calculations for the rule activation level using these common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is one of the most frequently used t-norms in fuzzy inference systems. The calculation is:\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product t-norm:** This is another widely used t-norm. The calculation is:\n    `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the most common interpretation would be to use the minimum operator.\n\nTherefore, using the most common t-norm (minimum), the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
