    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on the concept of perfluorination and the molecular formula of a known nanocar.\n\nNanorobots are molecules designed to move across surfaces and are composed of a chassis and wheels. Several nanocar designs have been developed, with variations in their structures, such as those with fullerene or p-carborane wheels. For the purpose of this hypothetical scenario, we can consider a specific flexible nanocar with the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄.\n\nThe term \"perfluorinated\" refers to a chemical process in which all hydrogen atoms in an organic compound are replaced by fluorine atoms. By applying this concept to the specified nanocar, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, a perfluorinated version of this particular nanocar would have the chemical formula C₃₁₀F₃₄, containing 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
