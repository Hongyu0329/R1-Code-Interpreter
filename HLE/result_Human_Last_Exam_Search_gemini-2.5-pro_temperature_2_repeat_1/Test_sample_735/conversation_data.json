    "A comprehensive classification of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 has been completed, with research showing that such groups must have an order of 24 or less. A product-free set is a subset of a group where the product of any two elements within the subset is not itself in the subset. A maximal by inclusion product-free set is one that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property.\n\nThe definitive classification, presented in a paper by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, identifies a specific and finite list of such groups. The groups containing these small maximal product-free sets are as follows:\n\n*   **C₃ × C₃**: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3.\n*   **A₄**: The alternating group on four letters.\n*   **C₉**: The cyclic group of order 9.\n*   **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10.\n*   **D₁₂**: The dihedral group of order 12.\n*   **D₁₄**: The dihedral group of order 14.\n*   **D₁₈**: The dihedral group of order 18.\n*   **D₂₂**: The dihedral group of order 22.\n\nIn total, there are eight finite groups that possess maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<8>>>"
