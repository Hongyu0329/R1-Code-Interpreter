    "There are 8 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that cannot be disconnected by removing any single vertex. In other words, it does not have any cut vertices (or articulation points). For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, it must have at least 3 vertices.\n\nThe non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are listed below, categorized by their number of edges:\n\n*   **5 Edges:**\n    *   The **cycle graph C₅** is the only 2-vertex-connected graph with 5 edges. Removing any vertex leaves a connected path of four vertices.\n\n*   **6 Edges:** There are three such graphs:\n    *   The **house graph**, which consists of a square (a 4-cycle) with a triangle (a 3-cycle) on top, sharing one edge.\n    *   The **complete bipartite graph K₂,₃**.\n    *   The **5-cycle with a chord (C₅+e)**, which creates two smaller cycles.\n\n*   **7 Edges:** There is one such graph. It can be constructed by taking the complete graph K₅ and removing three edges that form a path (P₃).\n\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two such graphs:\n    *   The graph formed by removing two non-adjacent edges from the complete graph K₅.\n    *   The graph formed by removing two adjacent edges from the complete graph K₅. This is also known as the wheel graph W₅.\n\n*   **9 Edges:**\n    *   The graph created by removing a single edge from the complete graph K₅ is 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **10 Edges:**\n    *   The **complete graph K₅** is the most connected graph on 5 vertices and is therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n\nIn summary, the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, categorized by the number of edges, is:\n*   5 edges: 1 graph\n*   6 edges: 3 graphs\n*   7 edges: 1 graph\n*   8 edges: 2 graphs\n*   9 edges: 1 graph\n*   10 edges: 1 graph\n\nAdding these up gives a total of 8 graphs.\n\n<<<8>>>"
