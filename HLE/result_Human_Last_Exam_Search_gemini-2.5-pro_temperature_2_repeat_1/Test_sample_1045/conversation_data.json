    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Composition of Toluene:** The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Basis Functions per Atom (6-31G):** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. This means it treats core and valence electrons differently.\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (a second-row element):**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is \"split\" into two sets of functions. This results in one set of inner functions (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) and one set of outer functions (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz').\n        *   This gives a total of 1 (for the 1s core) + 4 (for the inner valence) + 4 (for the outer valence) = 9 contracted functions per carbon atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom:**\n        *   As hydrogen has no core electrons, only its valence 1s orbital is considered.\n        *   This 1s orbital is split into two contracted Gaussian functions (an inner function composed of 3 primitives and an outer function composed of 1 primitive).\n        *   This results in a total of 2 contracted functions per hydrogen atom.\n\n3.  **Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   **Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 contracted functions.\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 contracted functions.\n    *   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
