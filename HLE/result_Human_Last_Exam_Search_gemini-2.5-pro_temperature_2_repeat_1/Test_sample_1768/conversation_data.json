    "An Open Reading Frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame is the one that translates into an amino acid sequence without any interruptions from stop codons. The sequence can be translated in three possible reading frames.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's analyze the translations of the three forward reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins with the first nucleotide (`gga`). The codons are `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. This indicates that Frame 1 is not the correct reading frame.\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins with the second nucleotide (`gac`). The sequence is read as `gac att gtt gtt agc...`. This frame has no stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins with the third nucleotide (`aca`). The codons are `aca ttg ttg tta gcg...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. This makes Frame 3 incorrect as well.\n\nBased on this analysis, Frame 2 is the only one without stop codons, making it the correct reading frame.\n\n<<<Frame 2 is the correct reading frame.\nThe protein sequence is:\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
