    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM), followed by quenching with an electrophile.\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring:\n1.  A tertiary amide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1.\n2.  A tertiary amine group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n\n**Step 1: Directed *ortho*-Metalation**\n\nIn the first step, the aromatic ring is deprotonated by a strong base, sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). TMEDA coordinates to the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the organolithium reagent and facilitating the deprotonation of the aromatic ring.\n\nBoth the amide and the amino groups can direct the lithium to an *ortho* position. However, the tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine group (-NR₂). Therefore, the deprotonation (lithiation) will occur at a position *ortho* to the N,N-diethylcarboxamido group.\n\nThe positions *ortho* to the amide group are C2 and C6.\n*   The C2 position is situated between the amide and the dimethylamino group.\n*   The C6 position is *meta* to the dimethylamino group.\n\nIn cases of 1,3-disubstituted rings with two directing groups, lithiation preferentially occurs at the C2 position, which is located between the two groups. This is due to a cooperative effect where the C2 proton is rendered more acidic by the inductive effects of both adjacent groups, and the resulting lithiated intermediate is stabilized. The formation of a six-membered chelate involving the lithium atom and the heteroatoms of both directing groups can also contribute to the stability of the C2-lithiated species. This synergistic effect generally overcomes the steric hindrance at the doubly substituted C2 position. Studies on similar 1,3-disubstituted systems confirm that metalation occurs predominantly at the position between the two directing groups.\n\nThus, the intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with Methyl Iodide**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The lithium atom is replaced by a methyl group at the C2 position.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nThe final compound obtained from this two-step reaction is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
