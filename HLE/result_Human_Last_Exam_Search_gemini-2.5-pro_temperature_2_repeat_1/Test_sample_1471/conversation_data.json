    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\n*   **xl**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (X = 10) comes before a larger value (L = 50), it is subtracted. So, XL = 50 - 10 = 40.\n*   **ccc**: This represents C + C + C, where C is 100. So, CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\n*   **mmmd**: This represents M + M + M + D. Since M = 1000 and D = 500, mmmd = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 500 = 3500.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n40 / 300 - 3500\n\nNext, we perform the calculation:\n\n1.  **Division**: 40 / 300 = 4 / 30 = 2 / 15 ≈ 0.1333...\n2.  **Subtraction**: 0.1333... - 3500 = -3499.8666...\n\nThe fraction form of the answer is -52498/15.\n\nThe decimal form, rounded to four decimal places, is -3499.8667.\n\n<<<-3499.8666...>>>"
