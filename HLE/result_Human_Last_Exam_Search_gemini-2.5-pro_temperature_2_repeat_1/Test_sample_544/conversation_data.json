    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a Pummerer-type reaction.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide**: The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride (Tf₂O). This step forms a triflyloxysulfonium triflate intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺ TfO⁻, which is a very good leaving group.\n2.  **Formation of a thionium ion**: The highly activated intermediate is acidic at the α-protons of the methyl group. Even a weak base can deprotonate it, leading to the formation of a sulfonium ylide. This ylide quickly eliminates triflic acid to generate an electrophilic thionium ion, [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺.\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack**: The trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) acts as a cyanide (CN⁻) source. The cyanide nucleophile then attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion.\n\nThis sequence yields an α-cyano sulfide. The product is named by considering acetonitrile as the parent chain with a phenylthio group substituent.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the product is **2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile**.\n\n<<<2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile>>>"
