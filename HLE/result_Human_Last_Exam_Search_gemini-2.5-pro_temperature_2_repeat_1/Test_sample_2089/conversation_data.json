    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a detail that does not appear in the plot summaries or dialogue transcripts of well-known films featuring such scenes.\n\nExtensive research into Oscar-nominated films with pivotal bus sequences, such as the Best Picture winner *Midnight Cowboy* (1969), reveals a critical scene on a bus where a main character, \"Ratso\" Rizzo, dies. However, the dialogue in this scene does not involve the character saying \"Thank you\" as a fateful precursor to this event.\n\nAnother Oscar-nominated film, *Babel* (2006), features a significant and dramatic event on a tourist bus, but the plot details do not align with the specific scenario described in the question.\n\nWhile many films feature dramatic and fatal scenes on buses, the specific act of a character saying \"Thank you\" upon boarding and this phrase directly leading to their demise in an Oscar-nominated film is not a readily identifiable or documented cinematic moment.\n\n<<<There is no evidence to suggest that such a scene exists in an Oscar-nominated film.>>>"
