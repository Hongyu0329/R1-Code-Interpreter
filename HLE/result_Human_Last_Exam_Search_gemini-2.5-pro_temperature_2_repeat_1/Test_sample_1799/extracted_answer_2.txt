The assertion that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is a nuanced issue. It is not strictly true that the first postulate alone is sufficient. The deduction requires the additional assumption that Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism are fundamental laws of physics. If one accepts Maxwell's equations as universally valid, then the first postulate (the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames) implies that the speed of light, a constant derived from these equations, must also be the same in all inertial frames. This makes the second postulate a direct consequence of the first in the context of electromagnetism. However, without assuming the universal validity of Maxwell's equations, the first postulate, combined with general principles of homogeneity and isotropy of space, allows for different possible space-time transformations, including Galilean relativity where there is no universal speed limit. Einstein's second postulate, therefore, serves the crucial role of explicitly selecting the correct physical theory, based on the experimental evidence of the constancy of the speed of light, and resolving the conflict between Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism. Hence, it is not merely redundant.
