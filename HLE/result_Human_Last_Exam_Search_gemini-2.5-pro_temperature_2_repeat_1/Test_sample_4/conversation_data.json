    "The Poincaré polynomial of the 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is given by:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis result is obtained by computing the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra, which are the dimensions of its cohomology groups with trivial coefficients. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent and thus unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra, the Poincaré polynomial for homology is the same as for cohomology due to Poincaré duality, which implies that the Betti numbers are symmetric, i.e., $b_k = b_{n-k}$ where $n$ is the dimension of the algebra.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be viewed as a semidirect product $\\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$, where $\\mathfrak{n}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence is a powerful tool for computing the cohomology of such Lie algebras. The $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence can be computed from the invariants and coinvariants of the action of $\\mathbb{R}$ on the cohomology of the ideal $\\mathfrak{n}$. As the ideal is abelian, its cohomology is an exterior algebra.\n\nThe calculation of the dimensions of the terms in the spectral sequence yields the Betti numbers for the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$. For a nilpotent Lie algebra, the spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page, which simplifies the computation considerably.\n\nThe Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are found to be:\n*   $b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = 5$\n*   $b_3 = 6$\n*   $b_4 = 5$\n*   $b_5 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = 1$\n\nThese Betti numbers are the coefficients of the Poincaré polynomial $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x**2 + 6*x**3 + 5*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
