    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nLet G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. We are interested in the set of integers *k* for which an induced subgraph of G is a complete graph (a clique) of size *k*, denoted as K<sub>k</sub>. Let's call this set of sizes *C(G)*. The objective is to find the maximum possible value of |*C(G)*| over all possible graphs G on 128 vertices.\n\nAn **induced subgraph** G[S] on a subset of vertices S is formed by the vertices S and *all* the edges present in the original graph G between any two vertices in S. A subset of vertices *S* forms an **induced clique** if the induced subgraph G[S] is a complete graph. This is equivalent to the standard definition of a clique, which is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.\n\nLet $\\omega(G)$ be the **clique number** of the graph G, which is the size of the largest clique in G. Let *C* be a clique of size $\\omega(G)$.\n\n1.  **Existence of an induced clique of size $\\omega(G)$**: The set of vertices *C* itself forms an induced clique of size $\\omega(G)$. The induced subgraph G[C] is a K$_{\\omega(G)}$ because all vertices in C are pairwise adjacent in G.\n2.  **Existence of smaller induced cliques**: For any integer *k* such that 1 ≤ *k* ≤ $\\omega(G)$, we can select any subset *C'* of *C* with |*C'*| = *k*. Since all vertices in *C* are pairwise adjacent, all vertices in the subset *C'* are also pairwise adjacent. Therefore, the subgraph induced by *C'*, which is G[C'], is a complete graph of size *k*.\n3.  **The set of all induced clique sizes**: From the points above, if a graph G has a maximum clique of size $\\omega(G)$, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to $\\omega(G)$. Thus, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., $\\omega(G)$}. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number, $\\omega(G)$.\n\n### Maximizing the Number of Clique Sizes\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number, $\\omega(G)$, for a graph G with 128 vertices.\n\nThe clique number of any graph on *n* vertices cannot exceed *n*. Therefore, for a graph with 128 vertices, the maximum possible clique number is 128.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved by the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted K<sub>128</sub>. In K<sub>128</sub>, all 128 vertices are pairwise adjacent, so the set of all vertices forms a clique of size 128. The clique number of K<sub>128</sub> is 128.\n\nFollowing the logic above, the graph K<sub>128</sub> contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128. Consequently, the number of different induced clique sizes for K<sub>128</sub> is 128.\n\nNo other graph can have a higher number of induced clique sizes, as this number is limited by the total number of vertices.\n\n<<<128>>>"
