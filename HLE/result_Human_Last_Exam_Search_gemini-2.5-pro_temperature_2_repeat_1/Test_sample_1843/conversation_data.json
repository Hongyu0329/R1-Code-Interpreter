    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factor the conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character of a smaller modulus dividing $N$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. Let $o(\\chi)$ denote the order of a character $\\chi$. Then, $o(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), \\dots, o(\\chi_r))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ corresponding to the conductors $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$ such that $\\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), o(\\chi_3), o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_5)) = 6$.\n\n### 3. Analyze Component Characters\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character, $o(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, whose orders are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. There is one non-principal character, which is primitive. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_1$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The primitive characters are those that are not induced by characters modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. So, the primitive characters modulo 9 are those with orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both 3 and 6 divide 6, so we have $2+2 = \\mathbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The orders of these characters can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    All these orders divide 6, so there are $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_3$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We are interested in primitive characters whose order divides 6. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The only non-trivial order that also divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Thus, there is only **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need orders that divide 6. These are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    All these orders divide 6, so there are $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_5$.\n\n### 4. Combine the Results\nThe total number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_5)$ where each component has an order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n$1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must ensure the lcm of the orders is exactly 6. Let $S$ be this set of 100 combinations. We need to exclude the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). Since primitive characters have order greater than 1, the lcm cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case 1: The lcm of the orders is 2.**\n    This requires every component character to have an order of 2. Let's count the number of such combinations:\n    *   For conductor 4: 1 character of order 2.\n    *   For conductor 9: 0 characters of order 2 (orders are 3, 6).\n    Since there are no primitive characters of order 2 for conductor 9, the total number of such combinations is $1 \\times 0 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: The lcm of the orders is 3.**\n    This requires every component character to have an order of 3.\n    *   For conductor 4: 0 characters of order 3 (order is 2).\n    The total number of such combinations is $0 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 0 \\times 2 = 0$.\n\nThe number of combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 is $0+0=0$.\nTherefore, all 100 combinations result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
