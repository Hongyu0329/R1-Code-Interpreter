    "Critical-level views in population ethics violate the Weak Quality Addition condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the concepts involved:\n*   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** These are a series of proofs in population ethics showing that it is impossible for any theory about the value of populations to simultaneously satisfy a set of intuitively plausible conditions (axioms). The sixth theorem states that no population axiology can satisfy Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition all at once.\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** These theories assert that adding a new person to a population only contributes positive value if that person's welfare is above a certain positive \"critical level.\" If their welfare is positive but below this critical level, their existence is considered to have neutral or even negative value. This approach is used to avoid certain paradoxical outcomes like the \"Repugnant Conclusion,\" where a massive population of people with lives barely worth living is deemed better than a smaller, extremely happy population.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** This is one of the conditions in Arrhenius's theorem. It states that for any number of lives with very negative welfare, there exists a number of lives with very high positive welfare whose addition would be better. A simpler way to understand the core idea is that adding lives with *any* positive quality of life should, if numerous enough, eventually be considered a net good.\n\n**The Violation:**\n\nThe conflict arises directly from the definitions. The Weak Quality Addition condition implies that for any life that is worth living (i.e., has a positive welfare level), adding a sufficient number of these lives should be seen as a good thing.\n\nHowever, a critical-level view explicitly denies this. For any positive welfare level that is *below* the critical level, adding any number of people at that welfare level is not a net good; in fact, it can be judged as making the world worse. This directly contradicts and thus violates the Weak Quality Addition condition.\n\nA modified version of Critical Level Utilitarianism has been proposed that could satisfy the Weak Quality Addition condition by assigning zero, rather than negative, value to lives below the critical level. However, standard critical-level views are in violation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
