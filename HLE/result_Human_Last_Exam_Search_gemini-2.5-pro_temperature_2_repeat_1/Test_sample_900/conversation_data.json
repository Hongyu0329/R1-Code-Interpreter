    "I have been unable to locate a viewable video of Svetlana Gileva performing the Jete Woman solo in the Semperoper Ballett's 2015 production of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Ms. Gileva performed this role, and a video was once available on YouTube, it is no longer accessible. Without a visual of the performance, it is impossible to accurately identify and count the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" steps she executed in the solo. Therefore, a definitive answer to the user's question cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question as the requested video footage is not available for analysis.>>>"
