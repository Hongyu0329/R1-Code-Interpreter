    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point (x, y, z) that satisfies the equations `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z` for three distinct functions F, G, and H. The existence of such a point is guaranteed under a specific set of conditions, typically established in the framework of a partially ordered complete metric space. These conditions generalize the well-known Banach Contraction Principle.\n\nLet (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set and d be a complete metric on X, such that (X, d) is a complete metric space. The functions are given as `F: X × X × X → X`, `G: X × X × X → X`, and `H: X × X × X → X`. A point (x, y, z) ∈ X × X × X is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, z, x) = y\n*   H(z, x, y) = z\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence and often uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### 1. Mixed Monotone Property\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order ≤ on X. This means that each function is non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others. A common formulation of this property is:\n\n*   **F(x, y, z)** is non-decreasing in `x` and `z`, and non-increasing in `y`.\n    *   For any `x1, x2` ∈ X, if `x1 ≤ x2`, then `F(x1, y, z) ≤ F(x2, y, z)`.\n    *   For any `y1, y2` ∈ X, if `y1 ≤ y2`, then `F(x, y1, z) ≥ F(x, y2, z)`.\n    *   For any `z1, z2` ∈ X, if `z1 ≤ z2`, then `F(x, y, z1) ≤ F(x, y, z2)`.\n*   **G(y, z, x)** and **H(z, x, y)** have similar mixed monotone properties, which must be compatible with F to ensure the convergence of the iterative sequences used in the existence proofs.\n\n### 2. Contractive Condition\nThe core of the existence theorems is a generalized contraction condition that links the three functions. This condition ensures that when applied iteratively, the distances between successive points in a sequence diminish, leading to a Cauchy sequence that converges to the fixed point. There are many variations of this condition, but a typical example is:\n\nFor all `x, y, z, u, v, w` ∈ X such that `x ≥ u`, `y ≤ v`, and `z ≥ w`, the following inequality holds:\n\n`d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) + d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * (d(x, u) + d(y, v) + d(z, w))`\n\nHere, `k` is a contraction constant, with `0 ≤ k < 1`. More complex contractive conditions can involve different combinations of distances, altering functions, or dependence on the points themselves, but all serve to guarantee convergence.\n\n### 3. Existence of an Initial Point\nThere must exist an initial triple of points `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` ∈ X × X × X that satisfies a specific order relationship with the outputs of the functions F, G, and H. This condition provides a starting point for the iterative construction of the sequences that will converge to the fixed point. A typical formulation is:\n\n*   `x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)`\n*   `y₀ ≥ G(y₀, z₀, x₀)`\n*   `z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)`\n\n### 4. Continuity or Regularity of the Space\nTo ensure that the limit of the constructed sequences is indeed a fixed point, an additional condition is required:\n\n*   **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n*   **OR**\n*   **Regularity:** The partially ordered metric space (X, ≤, d) is regular. A space is considered regular if for any non-decreasing sequence `{xₙ}` that converges to `x`, we have `xₙ ≤ x` for all `n`, and for any non-increasing sequence `{yₙ}` that converges to `y`, we have `y ≤ yₙ` for all `n`.\n\nIf the functions F, G, and H are continuous, their continuity ensures that if the sequences `(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ)` converge to `(x, y, z)`, then `F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ)` converges to `F(x, y, z)`, which allows proving that `x = F(x, y, z)`. If continuity is not assumed, the regularity of the space provides the necessary property to prove that the limit is a fixed point.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point hinges on the combination of a complete metric space structure, a compatible partial order, mixed-monotone functions satisfying a collective contraction-like condition, and the existence of a suitable starting point. For uniqueness, a further condition is usually required, such as the partial order having the property that for every pair of elements, there exists a common lower or upper bound.\n\n<<<The primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point in a partially ordered complete metric space (X, d, ≤) for functions `F, G, H: X³ → X` are:\n1.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must have a compatible mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order ≤. For example, F may be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** A generalized contraction inequality must be satisfied by the functions. For instance, for all comparable elements (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), `d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) + d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * (d(x, u) + d(y, v) + d(z, w))` for some constant `k` in `[0, 1)`.\n3.  **Existence of an Initial Ordered Point:** There must be a starting point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` that satisfies the order relations `x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)`, `y₀ ≥ G(y₀, z₀, x₀)`, and `z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)`.\n4.  **Continuity or Regularity:** Either the functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the partially ordered metric space (X, ≤, d) must be regular.>>>"
