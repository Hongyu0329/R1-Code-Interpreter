No, it is generally not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only the Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms. An additional energy term, such as an external magnetic field or magnetic anisotropy, is typically required to make the uniform ferromagnetic background state energetically favorable, thereby allowing the soliton to exist as a stable or metastable localized excitation.
