    "In William Morris's epic romance, *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a messenger of the Goths who describes the religious practices of the Romans in a way that clearly alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThis messenger, who had been a prisoner of the Romans, returns to the Wolfings to report on the approaching Roman army. In Chapter VIII, while describing the enemy's encampment and customs, he details their objects of worship. He first mentions a banner with the image of a ravening eagle and then describes another significant symbol. He exclaims, \"but yet another God they have, and look you! it is a wolf, as if they were of the kin of our brethren; a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs; wonderful is this.\"\n\nThis description of a she-wolf suckling two infant boys is a direct reference to the iconic imagery of the Roman founding myth, immediately recognizable to readers familiar with the story of Romulus and Remus. The information about Roman customs, including this vivid description of their idol, is presented as firsthand intelligence gathered by a former captive, a thrall of the Goths, and is relayed to the Wolfing assembly by this messenger.\n\n<<<A messenger of the Goths, relaying information from a former Roman thrall.>>>"
