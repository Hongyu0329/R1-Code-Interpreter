    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a pericyclic reaction governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The prediction of the product ratio between the *cis*-isomer A and the *trans*-isomer B involves analyzing the stereochemical course of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Application of FMO Theory and Woodward-Hoffmann Rules\n\nThe reacting system is deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, which contains 8 π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case) undergoing a thermal reaction, the electrocyclization proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n\nFMO theory explains this by examining the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the π-system. For an 8π-electron system in its electronic ground state (thermal conditions), the HOMO is ψ₄. The lobes of the p-orbitals at the termini of the conjugated system in ψ₄ have opposite phases on the same face of the molecule. To achieve constructive overlap and form a new σ-bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction (conrotation).\n\n### 2. Analysis of Conrotatory Ring Closure for the Specific Isomer\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of the reaction depends on the specific stereoisomer of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, and the two possible modes of conrotatory ring closure. The substituents at the termini of the reacting polyene are methyl groups, which will form the stereocenters in the resulting product, 7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\nLet's visualize the reactant in a conformation suitable for ring closure.\n*   The double bond at C8 is *E*, meaning the methyl group is positioned \"outward\" from the curve of the carbon chain backbone.\n*   The double bond at C2 is *Z*, positioning its methyl group also \"outward\".\n\nThere are two possible conrotatory pathways for the ring to close:\n\n1.  **Pathway 1 (Outward rotation):** Both terminal methyl groups rotate outwards as the ring closes. This movement is sterically favorable as the bulky methyl groups move away from the rest of the molecule. This pathway leads to the formation of the two methyl groups on the same side of the newly formed ring, resulting in ***cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (Isomer A)**.\n\n2.  **Pathway 2 (Inward rotation):** Both terminal methyl groups rotate inwards. This would involve significant steric hindrance as the two bulky methyl groups are forced into close proximity with each other and the rest of the carbon ring during the transition state. This pathway would lead to the ***trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (Isomer B)**.\n\n### 3. Prediction of the Product Ratio\n\nThe activation energy for Pathway 2 is substantially higher than for Pathway 1 due to severe steric repulsion in the transition state. Consequently, the reaction will overwhelmingly proceed via Pathway 1. This preference for one rotational direction over another due to steric effects is known as torquoselectivity.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction will be the *cis*-isomer (A), and the *trans*-isomer (B) will be the minor product, if it forms at all. The reaction is highly stereoselective. In fact, literature suggests that for this specific reactant, the reaction is stereospecific, forming only the *cis* product.\n\nHowever, as the question states that both isomers are produced, it implies a strong preference rather than absolute specificity. Based on FMO theory and steric considerations, the ratio of isomer A to isomer B will be much greater than 1.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is >> 1."
