    "The problem is to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of such a function $f$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: The function $\\exp(x)$ is injective. If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with the fact that $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f(f(x))$ is a composition of two strictly decreasing functions, which results in a strictly increasing function. This is also consistent with the properties of $\\exp(x)$.\n\n3.  **Existence of Fixed Points**: Let's consider the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing. A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point, i.e., there is a unique $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. To see this, consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. As a decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$. Therefore, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist an $x_0$ such that $g(x_0)=0$, which means $f(x_0)=x_0$.\n    If such a fixed point $x_0$ exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. From the given equation, we would have $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions (since $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions for $f$.\n\nThis leaves us with the conclusion that any continuous solution $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of such strictly increasing solutions. The cardinality of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is because a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = c^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$. So, the set of solutions, being a subset of the set of all continuous functions, can have a cardinality of at most $c$.\n\nTo show that the cardinality is exactly $c$, we need to demonstrate that there are at least $c$ distinct solutions. We can do this by constructing a family of solutions with cardinality $c$. The construction of such a function, often called a half-exponential function, involves defining the function on an interval and then extending its definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the given functional equation.\n\nLet's fix an arbitrary number $a > 0$ with $a \\neq 1$. Let's assume a solution $f$ exists such that $f(0) = a$. Then $f(a) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. Since $f$ must be strictly increasing, its values on the interval $[0, a]$ must map to the interval $[a, 1]$.\n\nWe can define $f$ on the interval $[0, a]$ by choosing any continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ such that $h(0) = a$ and $h(a) = 1$. The number of such functions $h$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum. To see this, pick any point $x_0 \\in (0, a)$ and any point $y_0 \\in (1, a)$ (assuming $a>1$ for simplicity). We can define a piecewise linear, strictly increasing continuous function passing through $(0, a)$, $(x_0, y_0)$, and $(a, 1)$. The choice of $y_0$ can be any value in $(1, a)$, a set of cardinality $c$. Each choice of $y_0$ defines a different function $h$ on $[0, a]$.\n\nLet's pick one such function $h$ to define $f$ on $[0, a]$. Now we can extend the definition of $f$ to other intervals:\n*   For $x \\in [a, 1] = f([0, a])$, we define $f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x)) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$. This function is well-defined, continuous, and strictly increasing on $[a, 1]$. It maps $[a, 1]$ to $[e^0, e^a] = [1, e^a]$.\n*   We can continue this process. For $x$ in the image of the last interval, we define $f(x)$ using the same rule. This iterative process allows us to define $f$ on a sequence of intervals expanding to cover $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nSince there are $c$ different choices for the initial function $h$ on the interval $[0, a]$, and each choice leads to a different continuous function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, there are at least $c$ solutions.\n\nGiven that the number of solutions is at most $c$ and at least $c$, by the Cantor-Schr√∂der-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $c$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum.>>>"
