    "While Virgil's epic, the *Aeneid*, transports readers to a world of mythological journeys and divine interventions, it is grounded in a landscape that blends the real with the supernatural. The poem mentions both actual rivers of the ancient world and the legendary rivers of the Underworld. When considering the longest of these, a distinction must be made between those with a physical presence in our world and those of mythological significance.\n\nThe three longest earthly rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid* are:\n\n1.  **Hebrus (modern Maritsa):** This river, which flows through the Balkans, is the longest among those referenced in the epic. It has a total length of approximately 480 kilometers (about 300 miles). In the *Aeneid*, the Hebrus is associated with the Thracian hero Orpheus.\n\n2.  **Tiber (Italian: Tevere):** As the primary river of Rome, the Tiber is central to the latter part of the Aeneid. It is the third-longest river in Italy, stretching for about 406 kilometers (252 miles). The river god, Tiberinus, appears to Aeneas in a dream, welcoming him to his destined homeland.\n\n3.  **Eurotas (also Evrotas):** The main river of Laconia, in the Peloponnese region of Greece, the Eurotas is about 82 kilometers (51 miles) long. The river is associated with Sparta and is mentioned in the Aeneid in the context of the beautiful Spartan women.\n\nIn addition to these terrestrial rivers, the *Aeneid* famously depicts the rivers of the Underworld, which Aeneas crosses in Book VI. These mythological rivers, which include the Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe, do not have measurable lengths as they exist within a mythical realm. Although there is a real river named Acheron in Greece, the one in the Aeneid is primarily a feature of the Underworld.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Hebrus (Maritsa), the Tiber, and the Eurotas.>>>"
