    "The sequence of numbers you have provided is:\n\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nBased on extensive research, all the numbers in this sequence correspond to current or former London bus routes. For example, Route 111 runs between Heathrow Central and Kingston, while Route 142 operates between Watford Junction and Brent Cross bus station.\n\nHowever, the specific order and repetition of the numbers in the sequence do not appear to follow a publicly documented or easily recognizable pattern. Extensive searches for lists of bus routes by operator, garage, historical changes, or geographical location did not yield a match for this particular sequence.\n\nIt is likely that this sequence originates from a specific, non-public context, such as an internal report from Transport for London, a log of bus movements, or a list related to a specific event or operational change. The repetition of numbers might indicate multiple assignments or movements for those particular bus routes.\n\nWithout the specific rule or context that was used to generate this sequence, it is not possible to definitively determine the next number.\n\n<<<Unable to determine the next number based on the provided information.>>>"
