    "## Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas a Subject of Scholarly Debate\n\n**The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is a subject of ongoing academic discussion, with the strongest, though debated, claim pointing to a cylinder seal from the Olmec civilization dated to approximately 650 BCE.** This artifact, discovered at the site of San Andrés in Tabasco, Mexico, bears glyphs that some researchers interpret as the date \"3 Ajaw\" from the sacred 260-day Mesoamerican calendar.\n\nThe interpretation of the San Andrés cylinder seal as containing a calendrical date is supported by prominent archaeologists, including Mary Pohl, who led the research. They argue that the glyphs, which emanate from the beak of a bird, represent an early form of writing and the first known instance of a recorded date in the Americas. If this interpretation is correct, it would establish the Olmec as the first civilization in the region to develop a formal system of calendrics and writing. The artifacts were found in a refuse deposit from a feast, suggesting the sacred and ritual importance of writing in Olmec culture.\n\nHowever, the \"3 Ajaw\" interpretation is not universally accepted. Some scholars, including respected Mayanist epigrapher David Stuart, express skepticism, suggesting that the symbols may be iconographic representations rather than a true system of writing that records a specific date. There is currently no scholarly consensus on this matter.\n\nAnother significant Olmec artifact, the Cascajal block, is dated even earlier to around 900 BCE and is widely considered to be the earliest example of writing in the Americas. This serpentine slab contains 62 distinct glyphs. However, the script on the Cascajal block remains undeciphered, and there is no evidence to suggest that it contains any calendrical or numerical notations. Therefore, while older, the Cascajal block does not hold the claim for the earliest recorded date.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Cascajal block represents the earliest known writing in the Americas, the San Andrés cylinder seal holds the distinction of having the earliest *claimed* recorded date. This assertion remains a point of active debate among specialists in the field.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date is on a cylinder seal from San Andrés, Mexico, dated to c. 650 BCE and interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" though this interpretation is not universally accepted.>>>"
