    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path from one point to another that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is commonly used to refer to a square grid lattice. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), is a well-studied sequence in combinatorics and physics.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice for small values of n are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThis sequence is cataloged as A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, the value of a(10) is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
