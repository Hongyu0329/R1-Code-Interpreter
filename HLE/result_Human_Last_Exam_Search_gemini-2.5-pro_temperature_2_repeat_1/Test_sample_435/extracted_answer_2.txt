Based on the body of evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to have a significantly higher release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is expected to lead to more potent anti-tumor activity but also an increased risk and severity of cytokine release syndrome.
