The exact amount of money $c_k$ that person $p_k$ gets is given by the formula:
$$ c_k = k S_N^3 - k^2 S_N^2 + k S_N S_{N,2} $$
where $S_N = \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $S_{N,2} = \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.

Substituting these sums into the equation gives the formula in terms of $n$ and $k$:
$$ c_k = \frac{k n^2(n+1)^2 ((3n+1)(n+2) - 6k)}{24} $$
