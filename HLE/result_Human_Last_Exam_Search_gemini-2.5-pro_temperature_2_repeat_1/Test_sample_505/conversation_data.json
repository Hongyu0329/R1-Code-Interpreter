    "There are two ways to encode logical qubits in this scenario: within each patch using its holes, and between the two separate patches. These contributions are additive.\n\n1.  **Qubits from Holes:** A single, planar patch of surface code can encode a number of logical qubits equal to the number of holes it contains. Since each of the two patches has two holes, each patch can encode 2 logical qubits. This gives a subtotal of 2 + 2 = 4 logical qubits. The logical operators for these qubits consist of loops that enclose a single hole or connect a hole to a boundary.\n\n2.  **Qubits from Disconnected Patches:** When multiple, separate patches of surface code are used, it's possible to encode additional logical qubits. The number of extra qubits that can be encoded is `N-1`, where `N` is the number of disconnected patches. In this case, with two patches, you can encode `2-1 = 1` additional logical qubit. The logical operators for this qubit are \"global\" in nature, involving operations that act jointly across both patches, a process often realized through a technique called lattice surgery.\n\nCombining these two sources, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4 (from the holes) + 1 (from the two patches) = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
