    "Given the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge and restricting our epistemic states to only Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise that are independent of Gettier-style cases.\n\n<<<Here are the two problems JTB runs into, ignoring Gettier problems:\n\n**1. The Infinite Regress of Justification (Agrippa's Trilemma)**\n\nThe \"Justification\" condition of the JTB account is foundationally unstable. For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by good reasons. These reasons, in turn, must also be justified beliefs. This creates an inescapable logical puzzle known as Agrippa's Trilemma, which presents three exhaustive and problematic possibilities for the structure of justification:\n\n*   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, with each new reason requiring another reason to support it. Since a person cannot hold an infinite number of reasons, no belief can ever be fully justified.\n*   **Circularity:** The chain of justifications eventually loops back to support itself (e.g., Belief A is justified by B, which is justified by C, which is justified by A). This is a logical fallacy and provides no genuine support.\n*   **Dogmatism:** The chain of justifications stops at a \"foundational\" belief that is asserted without its own justification. Such an arbitrary stopping point is a dogma, and a belief that rests on an unjustified assumption cannot itself be considered justified.\n\nSkeptics argue that since any attempt at justification must fall into one of these three failed structures, true justification is impossible, and therefore, under the JTB model, knowledge itself is impossible.\n\n**2. The Ambiguity of the Justification Threshold and the Inaccessibility of Truth**\n\nThe JTB model has two related weaknesses concerning the \"Justification\" and \"Truth\" conditions: it doesn't specify *how much* justification is sufficient, and it demands a \"Truth\" condition that the believer can never definitively confirm.\n\n*   **Unspecified Threshold of Justification:** The JTB account states a belief must be justified, but it fails to define the threshold for how much or what quality of evidence is sufficient. Justification is not a simple \"yes or no\" quality; it exists on a spectrum. A belief can be weakly or strongly justified. The model offers no clear criterion to determine the point at which justification is strong enough to turn a true belief into knowledge. This ambiguity leads to concepts like fallibilismâ€”the idea that a belief can be justified even if it's possible for it to be false. The very need for fallibilism highlights the vagueness of the justification condition.\n*   **Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The \"Truth\" condition is external to the believer's mind; it depends on the actual state of the world. A person can have a perfectly coherent and internally valid justification for a belief, but there is no way for that person to step outside of their own perspective to guarantee that their belief aligns with objective reality. For instance, one might have every reason to believe a scientific theory that is later overturned; the justification was robust, but the belief was never true. The JTB model requires that this external condition be met, but it offers no mechanism by which the believer can confirm it, making it impossible for an individual to reliably distinguish between a justified true belief (Knowledge) and a well-justified false belief.>>>"
