    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For this reaction to occur, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, orientation.\n\nIn the (1S,2R) isomer, the bromo and methyl groups are trans to each other. For the E2 reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane ring must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. To achieve this, the more stable conformation (with both bulky groups in equatorial positions) must ring-flip to a higher-energy conformation where both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n\nIn this reactive, all-axial conformation:\n*   The hydrogen on the same carbon as the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position and thus cannot be eliminated.\n*   A hydrogen atom on C6 is in an axial position, making it anti-periplanar to the axial bromine atom.\n\nBecause of this strict stereochemical requirement, the base can only abstract the axial proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The resulting product is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product, rather than the more substituted Zaitsev product. The name of this product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. The anti-periplanar requirement of the E2 reaction overrides Zaitsev's rule in this case.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
