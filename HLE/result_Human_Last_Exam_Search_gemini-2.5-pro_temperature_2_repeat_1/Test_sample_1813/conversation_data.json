    "The continued fraction associated with a generalized Markov number is determined by the rational number that indexes it. Specifically, for a rational number \\( r \\), the \"associated\" number, let's call it \\( \\alpha_r \\), has a continued fraction that begins with the coefficients of the continued fraction of \\( r \\) itself, followed by a repeating block that is a palindrome.\n\nFirst, we compute the continued fraction of \\( r = 4/7 \\).\nThe Euclidean algorithm for the pair (4, 7) gives:\n\\begin{align*} 7 &= 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\\\ 4 &= 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 &= 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe sequence of quotients is 1, 1, 3. Therefore, the simple continued fraction for 4/7 is:\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] $$\n\nThe number \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\) for which the infimum of the Lagrange spectrum is attained has a continued fraction of the form \\([0; 1, 1, 3, \\overline{P}]\\), where \\(P\\) is a palindromic sequence of integers. The determination of this palindrome \\(P\\) is a non-trivial result of the theory of the Lagrange and Markov spectra.\n\nAccording to the work of Harvey Cohn and later detailed in publications by others, for each rational number, there corresponds a specific palindromic block. Based on published tables of these values, the palindrome associated with \\( r = 4/7 \\) is \\( (1, 3, 1) \\).\n\nThus, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is:\n$$ [0; 1, 1, 3, \\overline{1, 3, 1}] $$\nThis expands to \\( [0; 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, \\ldots] \\).\n\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]>>>"
