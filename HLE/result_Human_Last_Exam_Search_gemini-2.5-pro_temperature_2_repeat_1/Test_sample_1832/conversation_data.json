    "I have performed a Google search and found several resources, including a Physics Stack Exchange post and a Wikipedia article, that directly list the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric. This metric describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass M.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are given as:\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>tt</sub> = M(r-2M)/r<sup>3</sup>\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>rr</sub> = -M/(r(r-2M))\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>θθ</sub> = -(r-2M)\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>φφ</sub> = -(r-2M)sin<sup>2</sup>θ\n*   Γ<sup>t</sup><sub>rt</sub> = M/(r(r-2M))\n*   Γ<sup>θ</sup><sub>rθ</sub> = 1/r\n*   Γ<sup>θ</sup><sub>φφ</sub> = -sinθcosθ\n*   Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>rφ</sub> = 1/r\n*   Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>θφ</sub> = cosθ/sinθ\n\nChristoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices, meaning Γ<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μν</sub> = Γ<sup>ρ</sup><sub>νμ</sub>.  Taking this symmetry into account:\n*   Γ<sup>t</sup><sub>rt</sub> is the same as Γ<sup>t</sup><sub>tr</sub>.\n\nTherefore, by simply counting the unique non-zero Christoffel symbols from the provided list, I can arrive at the final answer. It is important to remember that some sources might use slightly different notation or sign conventions, but the number of non-zero components should be consistent.\n\nBased on the information gathered, I am ready to provide the final answer without any further searches.\n\nIn empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are derived from this metric, represent the gravitational field's effects on the coordinates. Due to the high degree of symmetry (time-independence and spherical symmetry), most of the Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = \\frac{GM}{c^2r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = -\\frac{GM}{c^2r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -r\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -r\\sin^2\\theta\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\frac{GM}{c^2r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi = \\cot\\theta$\n\nCounting the unique non-zero components, we have:\n\n1.  $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$\n2.  $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$\n3.  $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$\n4.  $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$\n5.  $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$ (which is the same as $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$ due to symmetry)\n6.  $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta$ (which is the same as $\\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$)\n7.  $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$\n8.  $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi$ (which is the same as $\\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$)\n9.  $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi$ (which is the same as $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$)\n\nThus, there are a total of 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols. Note that some conventions set c=G=1, which simplifies the appearance of the formulas but does not change the count of non-zero symbols.\n\n<<<9>>>"
