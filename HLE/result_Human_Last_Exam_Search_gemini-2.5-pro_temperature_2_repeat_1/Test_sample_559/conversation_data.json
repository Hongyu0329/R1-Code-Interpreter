    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrix is a curve or a set of curves that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors, and these are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points:**\nEquilibrium points exist where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t)=u^2(u-1)=0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u=0:** Substituting into the first equation gives $2d^2=0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n*   **Case u=1:** Substituting into the first equation gives $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2+2d=0$ or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Thus, we have two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis:**\nTo determine the stability, we analyze the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (source)**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so this is a non-hyperbolic point, and stability cannot be determined by linearization.\n\n**3. Identifying the Separatrix:**\nA separatrix is a boundary that divides the phase space into regions with different long-term behaviors. In systems with saddle points, their stable and unstable manifolds act as separatrices. We will look for an invariant curve that passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\nLet's test for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. By inspection of the system's structure, we can test a simple polynomial relationship. Let's test the curve **d = -uÂ²**.\n\nTo verify if this is an invariant curve (a trajectory), we check if it satisfies the system's differential equations. We compute the derivatives with respect to $t$:\n$d' = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^3(u-1) = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n\nSince both expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nThis curve connects the equilibrium point **(0, 0)** (at u=0) to the saddle point **(-1, 1)** (at u=1). A phase curve that connects equilibrium points is a strong candidate for a separatrix. In fact, calculating the tangent vector of the curve $d=-u^2$ at the point $(-1,1)$ shows that it aligns with the direction of the unstable eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix at that saddle point. This confirms that the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will exhibit a different long-term behavior than those starting on the other side.\n\nThus, the separatrix of the system is the parabola given by the equation:\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
