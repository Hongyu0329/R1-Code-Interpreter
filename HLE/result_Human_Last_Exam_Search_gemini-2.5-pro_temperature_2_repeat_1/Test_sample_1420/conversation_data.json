    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion, a technique developed by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher. This method computes critical exponents as a power series in ε, the deviation of the spatial dimension *d* from the upper critical dimension *d<sub>c</sub>*. For a broad class of systems described by the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory (which includes the Ising model universality class), the upper critical dimension is *d<sub>c</sub>* = 4.\n\nThe epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α is dependent on *n*, the number of components of the order parameter. The general formula to the first order in ε is:\n\n**α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ε + O(ε²)**\n\nFor the specified spatial dimension of *d* = 3, the expansion parameter ε takes the value:\n\nε = d<sub>c</sub> - d = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSubstituting ε = 1 into the first-order formula gives the value of the exponent α for a three-dimensional system as a function of *n*:\n\n**α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8))**\n\nWhile the problem does not specify the system, the most common case is the Ising universality class, which corresponds to a one-component order parameter (n=1). For this case, the specific heat exponent is:\n\n**α = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = 1/6**\n\nTherefore, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent α for an Ising-like system in three dimensions is 1/6, which is approximately 0.167. It is important to note that this is the first-term approximation; higher-order calculations and other methods like Monte Carlo simulations provide more precise values that are in general agreement with this initial estimate.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
