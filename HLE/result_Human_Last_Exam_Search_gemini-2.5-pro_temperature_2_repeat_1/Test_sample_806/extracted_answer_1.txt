The initiating biochemical reaction is the non-covalent binding of the causative drug to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule, creating an altered complex that is recognized by T-cell receptors, leading to the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. This triggers the release of granulysin, a key protein that induces widespread death of skin cells (keratinocytes), resulting in blister formation.
