    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe primary and most well-known allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black. However, more extensive research and synthesis have identified other allotropes with unique observable colors.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the colors of the different pure phosphorus allotropes:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear colorless. It is highly reactive and can turn yellow upon exposure to light and impurities, leading to it sometimes being referred to as yellow phosphorus. However, yellow phosphorus is not considered a distinct allotrope.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is perhaps the most commonly recognized and is found on the striking surface of matchboxes. Amorphous red phosphorus has a characteristic dark red color. Crystalline forms of red phosphorus also exist.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form of red phosphorus that has a distinct violet or purple color. It is more stable than white phosphorus.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, it has a blue color and is being studied for its potential in electronic and optoelectronic applications.\n*   **Other colored forms:** There is also mention of fibrous red phosphorus which can appear red/brown.\n\nTherefore, counting the distinct, observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes, we have white (colorless), red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5"
