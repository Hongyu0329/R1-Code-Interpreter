    "I have completed the initial research on \"knobs-into-holes\" packing and its role in determining the oligomeric state of coiled-coils. The key takeaway is that the identity of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat is a major determinant of whether a coiled-coil will be a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc. I also understand that a heptad repeat is a recurring sequence of seven amino acids, labeled `a` through `g`, where `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic residues that form the core of the coiled-coil.\n\nNow I need to apply this knowledge to the specific sequence provided by the user: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nI will break down the next steps to analyze this sequence and predict its oligomeric state.\n\nFirst, I will identify the heptad repeat in the given sequence and assign the `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g` positions to each amino acid.\n\nThen, I will specifically look at the amino acids occupying the 'a' and 'd' positions, as these are crucial for determining the oligomeric state.\n\nFinally, I will use the established rules from the literature about which amino acid combinations at the 'a' and 'd' positions favor which oligomeric states to make a final prediction. Based on the search results, combinations of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L) at these positions are particularly informative. The relative positions of these residues (e.g., I at 'a' and L at 'd', or vice versa, or I at both) strongly influence the packing and thus the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\nThe provided amino acid sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nLet's align this sequence into heptad repeats (`abcdefg`):\n\n```\ng a b c d e f\nG E I A Q S L K\ng a b c d e f\nE I A K S L K\ng a b c d e f\nE I A W S L K\ng a b c d e f\nE I A Q S L K\ng\nG\n```\n\nLet's re-examine the registration. A common starting position for the 'a' residue is the first hydrophobic residue. Let's try aligning starting with 'I' as 'a'.\n\n```\n  a b c d e f g\nG E I A Q S L\n  a b c d e f g\nK E I A K S L\n  a b c d e f g\nK E I A W S L\n  a b c d e f g\nK E I A Q S L\n  g\nK G\n```\nThis registration doesn't seem optimal as it leaves a 'G' and 'E' at the beginning. Let's try another registration, which is more common, starting the heptad with a hydrophobic residue at position 'a' or 'd'.\n\nLet's assume the first `I` is at position `d`.\n`g a b c d`\n`G E I A Q`\n\nLet's try a different approach. Coiled-coil sequences are characterized by a hydrophobic residue typically at positions `a` and `d`. Let's identify the hydrophobic residues in the sequence: I, L, A, W, V (none in this sequence).\nThe sequence is: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nHydrophobic residues are: I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L\n\nLet's try to establish the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`) pattern. A common pattern is `HPPHPPP` where H is hydrophobic and P is polar.\nLet's assign `a` and `d` to the hydrophobic residues.\n\nLet's try assigning the first `I` as the `d` position.\n`g a b c d e f`\n`E I A Q S L K` - here `I` is `b`\nThis is unlikely.\n\nLet's try the most common alignment method. Let the first hydrophobic residue be `a` or `d`. `I` is a good candidate for a core position. Let's assume the first Isoleucine (`I`) is in an `a` position.\n\n`a b c d e f g`\n`I A Q S L K E`\n`I A K S L K E`\n`I A W S L K E`\n`I A Q S L K G`\n\nThis seems like a plausible repeat. Let's look at the `a` and `d` positions in this alignment:\n- Heptad 1: `a`=I, `d`=S\n- Heptad 2: `a`=I, `d`=S\n- Heptad 3: `a`=I, `d`=S\n- Heptad 4: `a`=I, `d`=S\n\nThe presence of Serine (S), a polar amino acid, at the hydrophobic `d` position is unusual but can occur. However, it's more likely that the registration is different.\n\nLet's reconsider the sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nLet's look at the pattern of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues.\nG(P) E(P) I(H) A(H) Q(P) S(P) L(H) K(P) E(P) I(H) A(H) K(P) S(P) L(H) K(P) E(P) I(H) A(H) W(H) S(P) L(H) K(P) E(P) I(H) A(H) Q(P) S(P) L(H) K(P) G(P)\nThe pattern is `PPIHPSLHPIHPSLHPIHWHPSLHPIHPSLHP`\n\nLet's look for a repeating 7-residue pattern. `(abcdefg)`\nThe core `a` and `d` positions are typically hydrophobic.\nLet's re-examine the sequence:\n`G E I A Q S L`\n`K E I A K S L`\n`K E I A W S L`\n`K E I A Q S L`\n`K G`\n\nThis seems to show a repeat of `X E I A X S L`\n\nLet's try a different registration:\n`a b c d e f g`\n`L K E I A Q S`\n`L K E I A K S`\n`L K E I A W S`\n`L K E I A Q S`\n`L K G`\n\nHere, `a=L` and `d=I`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence based on the assumption that the repeat is `L K E I A Q S`\nThe provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nThis does not fit well.\n\nLet's re-examine the sequence with the knowledge of `a` and `d` positions.\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nThe core residues are hydrophobic. Let's assume the leucines and isoleucines are in the core `a` and `d` positions.\nThe sequence can be written with the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)` as:\n`g a b c d e f`\n`G E I A Q S L`\n`K E I A K S L`\n`K E I A W S L`\n`K E I A Q S L`\n`K G`\nIf we assume the last L of the first segment `GEIAQSL` is in the `g` position.\n`a b c d e f g`\n`E I A Q S L K`\n`E I A K S L K`\n`E I A W S L K`\n`E I A Q S L K`\n`G`\n\nThis looks like a very regular repeat of `E I A X S L K`.\nLet's assume the heptad is `(abcdefg)` where `a` is the first `E`.\n`a=E`, `b=I`, `c=A`, `d=X`, `e=S`, `f=L`, `g=K`\nThe core positions `a` and `d` are `E` and `X` (where X is Q, K, or W). `E` is charged, which is not typically found at a core position, but can occur. However, having polar residues at the majority of 'a' and 'd' positions is very unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to the most chemically sound assignment where hydrophobic residues occupy the core `a` and `d` positions.\nSequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nLet's try to find a repeating hydrophobic-polar pattern. `HPPHPPP`\nLet's start the heptad at `L`:\n`abcdefg`\n`LKEIAQS`\nThis does not seem to match the given sequence.\n\nLet's try a web-based coiled-coil prediction tool. Since I cannot browse the web, I will rely on the principles I've learned from the initial search.\n\nLet's try to manually assign the heptad positions based on the likely hydrophobic core.\n`a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by `I, L, V, A, M`.\nIn our sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we have `I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L`.\n\nLet's try a registration with `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`.\n`d e f g a b c`\n`S L K E I A Q`\n`S L K E I A K`\n`S L K E I A W`\n`S L K G`\nThis doesn't seem to fit the pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider the registration from earlier:\n`a b c d e f g`\n`I A Q S L K E`\n`I A K S L K E`\n`I A W S L K E`\n`I A Q S L K G`\n\nThis gives us:\n- **Heptad 1**: a=I, b=A, c=Q, d=S, e=L, f=K, g=E\n- **Heptad 2**: a=I, b=A, c=K, d=S, e=L, f=K, g=E\n- **Heptad 3**: a=I, b=A, c=W, d=S, e=L, f=K, g=E\n- **Heptad 4**: a=I, b=A, c=Q, d=S, e=L, f=K, g=G\n\nIn this assignment, position `a` is consistently Isoleucine (`I`), and position `d` is consistently Serine (`S`). While having a polar residue like Serine at a core `d` position is unusual, it's not impossible, especially if it's involved in specific interactions.\n\nLet's try one more alignment:\nLet's assume the `(abcdefg)` repeat starts with the `K` before the first `E`:\n`g a b c d e f`\n`K E I A Q S L`\n`K E I A K S L`\n`K E I A W S L`\n`K E I A Q S L`\n`K G`\n\nIn this case:\n- `a` positions are all `E` (Glutamic acid - charged)\n- `d` positions are `Q` (Glutamine), `K` (Lysine), `W` (Tryptophan), `Q` (Glutamine).\nThis is a very unlikely hydrophobic core.\n\nGiven the typical composition of coiled-coils, it is most probable that the hydrophobic residues form the core. The sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. It has four clear segments `EIAQSLK`, `EIAKSLK`, `EIAWSLK`, `EIAQSLK`. The only difference is at the 4th position of this septic repeat (Q, K, W, Q).\n\nLet's re-examine the sequence: `G**EIAQSLK**EIAKSLK**EIAWSLK**EIAQSLK**G`. There seems to be a repeating motif of 7 amino acids.\nLet's define the heptad repeat as `abcdefg`.\nIf we assign `E` to `a`, then the positions are:\n`a b c d e f g`\n`E I A Q S L K`\n`E I A K S L K`\n`E I A W S L K`\n`E I A Q S L K`\n\n`a` positions: E, E, E, E\n`d` positions: Q, K, W, Q\nThe `a` positions are consistently glutamic acid (charged), and the `d` positions are mostly polar or charged, with one hydrophobic (tryptophan). As discussed, a polar residue at a core position is unusual.\n\nHowever, research has shown that interactions between `e` and `g` positions are also crucial, particularly for trimerization. Let's look at the `e` and `g` positions in this potential assignment:\n- `e` positions: S, S, S, S (Serine)\n- `g` positions: K, K, K, K (Lysine)\n\nLet's reconsider another registration.\n`a b c d e f g`\n`A Q S L K E I`\n`A K S L K E I`\n`A W S L K E I`\n`A Q S L K G`\n\n`a` positions: A, A, A, A (Alanine - hydrophobic)\n`d` positions: L, L, L, L (Leucine - hydrophobic)\nThis gives a very consistent and hydrophobic `a`/`d` core. The residues at `a` are Alanine, and residues at `d` are Leucine.\n\nNow let's apply the rules for oligomeric state prediction based on the `a` and `d` residues.\n- **Dimer:** Isoleucine at `a` and Leucine at `d` (`a=I, d=L`).\n- **Trimer:** Isoleucine at both `a` and `d`.\n- **Tetramer:** Leucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d` (`a=L, d=I`).\n\nIn our case, with the most plausible heptad assignment, we have Alanine at the `a` position and Leucine at the `d` position. While Alanine is not Isoleucine, it is a small, non-bulky hydrophobic residue. The presence of Leucine at the `d` position is a strong indicator. Considering the options, having a small hydrophobic residue like Alanine at the `a` position and a larger one like Leucine at the `d` position most closely resembles the packing of a dimer. The combination does not strongly suggest a trimer (which prefers Isoleucine at both positions for optimal packing) or a tetramer (which prefers the reverse arrangement of larger and smaller hydrophobic residues). The packing efficiency for an Alanine \"knob\" into a Leucine \"hole\" would be reasonably favorable in a dimeric context.\n\nLet's explore if there are other rules. A strong preference for dimers is observed when `β-branched` residues (I, V) are at `a` and `γ-branched` residues (L) are at `d`. Alanine is not branched. The general principle is that the size and shape of the side chains at the `a` and `d` positions dictate the packing geometry. A trimer forms a more cylindrically symmetrical core and tends to favor residues of similar size at both `a` and `d`, like isoleucine. A dimer has a flatter interface, accommodating different residue sizes more readily.\n\nGiven the `a=A` and `d=L` pattern, this arrangement is most likely to be a dimer due to the packing preferences. A trimer would be less stable due to the dissimilar size of Ala and Leu in the core, and a tetramer usually prefers the opposite arrangement of larger residue at 'a' and smaller at 'd'.\n\nTherefore, based on the knobs-into-holes model and packing efficiency principles derived from the literature search, the sequence is most likely to form a dimer.\n\nFinal check of the heptad assignment:\nSequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nLet's assign the heptad starting with `I` as the `a` position.\n`g a b c d e f`\n`E I A Q S L K`\n`a=I`, `d=S`. `S` is polar which is unfavorable at a core `d` position.\n\nLet's try another assignment:\n`f g a b c d e`\n`Q S L K E I A`\n`K S L K E I A`\n`W S L K E I A`\n`Q S L K G`\n`a=L`, `d=I`. `a=L, d=I` strongly indicates a tetramer.\n\nLet's verify this heptad assignment:\nHeptad 1: `a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=Q, g=S`\nHeptad 2: `a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=K, g=S`\nHeptad 3: `a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=W, g=S`\nThis seems to be a consistent pattern.\nLet's map this back to the original sequence:\n`...QSLKEIA...` starts with `...LKEIA...` which doesn't fit the start `GEIA...`\n\nLet's go back to my previous analysis.\n`G-E-I-**A(a)**-Q(b)-S(c)-**L(d)**-K(e)-E(f)-I(g)` -- No, `e`, `f` and `g` are wrong.\nLet's re-register.\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (32 residues)\nA typical coiled coil has a heptad repeat `abcdefg`. `a` and `d` are hydrophobic, `e` and `g` are often charged.\nLet's find the hydrophobic residues: I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L\nLet's assume the first `I` is at `a`.\n`a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n`I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nThis is offset by 2 residues (`GE`).\nPositions:\na: I, I, I, I\nd: S, S, S, S\nThis is very unlikely, as `S` (Serine) is polar and at a core position.\n\nLet's try `I` at `d`.\n`d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a`\n`I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K`\nThis also leaves a `GE` at the beginning.\nPositions:\nd: I, I, I, I\na: L, L, L, L\nHere `a` positions have Leucine (L) and `d` positions have Isoleucine (I). The combination of L at 'a' and I at 'd' is a very strong indicator for the formation of a tetramer. This seems like the most chemically plausible registration of the heptad repeat, as it places the most consistently hydrophobic residues in the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's write out the full heptad repeat based on this `a=L, d=I` assignment, starting from the second `K` in the sequence:\nOriginal Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nThe heptad repeat seems to start at `E`, the 10th residue. Let's try this:\n`e f g a b c d`\n`E I A K S L K` - this gives `a=K, d=K` which is unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to `a=L` and `d=I`. To have this pattern, we would need to register the sequence as follows:\n`g a b c d e f`\n`K L E I A Q S`... (example pattern)\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence again very carefully:\n`GEIAQSLK`\n`EIAKSLK`\n`EIAWSLK`\n`EIAQSLKG`\nThe repeating unit is `EIAxSLK`\nLet's consider the registration:\n`c d e f g a b`\n`I A Q S L K E`\n`I A K S L K E`\n`I A W S L K E`\n`I A Q S L K G`\n`a=K`, `d=A`. `K` is charged.\n\nIt is highly likely one of the two main patterns of hydrophobic residues is correct: `a=I, d=L` for dimers, `a=L, d=I` for tetramers, or `a=I, d=I` for trimers.\n\nGiven the provided sequence, let's test these possibilities.\nIf it's a dimer (`a=I, d=L`):\nThe core residues would alternate between I and L.\n`... I x x L ...`\nSequence: `G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\nLet's assign `a` and `d` to these I and L residues:\n`g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g`\n`K E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L`\n`a=I, d=S`. Unlikely.\n\nLet's try: `f g a b c d e`\n`...K E I A Q S L...`\n`a=I, d=L`. This requires the heptad repeat to be `I-x-x-L-x-x-x`.\nLet's see if our sequence fits this.\n`I A Q S L` fits this pattern `a b c d e` so the repeat would be `I A Q S L x x`\nThis doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's try to register with `a=Isoleucine (I)` and `d=Leucine (L)` to see if the sequence supports a dimer.\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nCore `a`/`d` residues are hydrophobic.\nLet's propose a heptad alignment based on hydrophobicity:\n`f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n`A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G E I` (wrapping around)\nHere `a=L` and `d=I` or `a=I, d=L` do not consistently hold.\n\nLet's step back and look at the provided sequence again: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nThere are four isoleucines (`I`) and four leucines (`L`). Also, four alanines (`A`) and one tryptophan (`W`).\n\nA very strong repeating pattern of `L-x-x-x-I` or `I-x-x-x-L` would be expected for simple dimers or tetramers.\nLet's reconsider the `d=I, a=L` registration.\nIf the sequence is written as:\n`g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d`\n`S L K E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K G...`\nThis seems to fit the middle part of the sequence: `Q S L K E I A`.\nSo `...QSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQS...`\n\nWhat if the sequence is composed of 4 heptads? 4 * 7 = 28. The sequence has 32 amino acids.\nLet's assume there is a 4-residue insertion, or the N and C termini are not part of the coiled-coil.\n\nLet's assume the core is composed of Isoleucine at position `d` and Alanine at position `a`.\nThis registration:\n`d e f g a b c`\n`I A Q S L K E`\n`I A K S L K E`\n`I A W S L K E`\n`I A Q S L K G`\nSo, `a` positions are `L`, `L`, `L`, `L`. And `d` positions are `I`, `I`, `I`, `I`.\nThis looks like the most plausible arrangement, as it places the most consistently hydrophobic and bulky residues (`L` and `I`) in the core `a` and `d` positions. This requires the coiled-coil to start with `L`.\nIf so, the sequence of the coiled-coil region would be `LKEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQ`. The flanking residues would be `GEIAQS` at the N-terminus and `KG` at the C-terminus.\nSo the repeating unit is `L K E I A Q S`.\nAnd the core positions are:\n`a`: L, L, L, L\n`d`: I, I, I, I\n\nWith `a` positions being Leucine and `d` positions being Isoleucine, this corresponds to the rule for tetramer formation (`a=L, d=I`).\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of knobs-into-holes packing and the empirically determined rules for how amino acid identity at the core `a` and `d` positions influences the oligomeric state, this sequence is most likely to form a tetramer.\n\nLet's re-confirm my final proposed heptad assignment.\nHeptad starts with `a=L`\n`a b c d e f g`\n`L K E I A Q S`\n`L K E I A K S`\n`L K E I A W S`\n`L K E I A Q S` (with `G` at the end)\n\nLet's see if this aligns with the provided sequence:\n`GEIAQS` `LKEIAKS` `LKEIAWS` `LKEIAQS` `LKG`\nThe proposed heptads are not directly present in this sequence.\n\nThere must be a different registration.\n\nLet's try one more time, very methodically.\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G` (32 aa)\nPossible core residues: `I, A, L, W`\n\nLet's assume the first `I` is at an `a` position and see where it leads.\n`a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g`\n`I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K` (last G is extra)\nCore `a`: I, I, I, I\nCore `d`: S, S, S, S\nThis is not a good hydrophobic core due to Serine at `d`.\n\nLet's assume the first `A` is at an `a` position.\n`a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\n`A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G E`\nCore `a`: A, A, A, A\nCore `d`: L, L, W, L\n`W` at `d` is possible, as it's hydrophobic. Aromatic residues can be found at `d`. This is a possibility. In this case, we have `a=A` and mostly `d=L`. This would suggest a dimer.\n\nLet's assume the first `L` is at an `a` position.\n`a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n`L K E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K G...`\nThe problem is that the given sequence is `GEIAQSL...` not `LKEIAQS...`\n\nLet's look at the problem from the perspective of the answer choices. A, B, C, D correspond to 2, 3, 4, 5. So a specific answer is expected.\n\nWhat if the first `g` position is `G`?\n`g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L`\n`a` positions: E, K, E, E (all charged, very unlikely)\n\nThis suggests my registration with `a=A` and `d=L/W` is the most chemically sound one that fits the actual sequence string provided.\n\nLet's analyze that `a=A`, `d=L/W` case again.\nHeptad registration: starts at residue `A(4)` of `GEIA...`\n`a b c d e f g`\n`A Q S L K E I`\n`A K S L K E I`\n`A W S L K E I`\n`A Q S L K G E`\nThis corresponds to the sequence from `A(4)` to `E(31)`.\nCore residues:\n`a` positions: A, A, A, A\n`d` positions: L, L, W, L\n\nAlanine at `a` and Leucine at `d` is most consistent with a dimer, as the smaller Ala fits well against the larger Leu in the less-constrained packing of a dimer compared to a trimer or tetramer. While not the canonical `I-L` pair for a dimer, it follows the same principle of packing a smaller residue against a larger one.\n\nThus, a dimer is a very strong candidate.\n\nLet's quickly check for trimer (`a=I, d=I`). The sequence doesn't have `IxxxI` as a repeating core.\nLet's check for tetramer (`a=L, d=I`). The sequence doesn't have `LxxxI` as a repeating core.\n\nGiven the choices, and my most plausible heptad assignment (`a=A, d=L/W`), the prediction is a dimer.\n\nFinal answer rationale:\n1. Identify the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`)n. The most plausible assignment that results in a hydrophobic core is when the repeat starts at Alanine (residue 4).\n2. This assignment gives Alanine (`A`) at all `a` positions and primarily Leucine (`L`) at the `d` positions.\n3. The rules of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which determine oligomeric state, indicate that a combination of a small hydrophobic residue (like Alanine) at the `a` position and a larger one (like Leucine) at the `d` position is most favorable for a dimeric coiled-coil. Trimers and tetramers have more stringent packing requirements that are not well-satisfied by this `A-L` combination. Therefore, the protein is most likely to be a dimer.To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequence, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`) and then analyze the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions. The interactions between these core residues, known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, are the primary determinant of the coiled-coil's oligomeric state.\n\nThe amino acid sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coil sequences are characterized by a repeating seven-residue pattern where the `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. We need to find the correct \"register\" or starting frame for this pattern in the given sequence. Let's test possible registrations to find one that places hydrophobic residues consistently at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\n    A plausible registration for the sequence starts at the fourth residue, Alanine (A), placing it in the `a` position. This establishes the following heptad repeats:\n\n    *   `a b c d e f g`\n    *   **Heptad 1:** `A Q S L K E I` (residues 4-10)\n    *   **Heptad 2:** `A K S L K E I` (residues 11-17)\n    *   **Heptad 3:** `A W S L K E I` (residues 18-24)\n    *   **Heptad 4:** `A Q S L K G E` (residues 25-31)\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Core `a` and `d` Positions:** Based on this registration, let's identify the amino acids at the critical `a` and `d` core positions:\n    *   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n    *   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (Leucine) - In the third heptad, `d` is `L`. We align based on the consistent pattern: A(a)x(b)x(c)L(d)x(e)x(f)x(g).\n    Looking closely at the sequence with this AxxL pattern:\n    - `**A** Q S **L**` (Heptad 1)\n    - `**A** K S **L**` (Heptad 2)\n    - `**A** W S **L**` (Heptad 3)\n    - `**A** Q S **L**` (Heptad 4)\n    This shows a very consistent pattern where the `a` position is Alanine (A) and the `d` position is Leucine (L). Tryptophan (W) appears at the `c` position in the third heptad.\n\n3.  **Applying Knobs-into-Holes Principles:** The oligomeric state is strongly influenced by the identity of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions:\n    *   **Dimer:** Favored by having a β-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the `a` position and a γ-branched amino acid (like Leucine) at the `d` position. This is due to the efficient packing of a smaller \"knob\" from the `a` position into a \"hole\" created by the side chains of the `d` position on the opposing helix.\n    *   **Trimer:** Favored when both `a` and `d` positions contain isoleucine, allowing for symmetrical packing in the hydrophobic core.\n    *   **Tetramer:** Favored by the reverse arrangement of a dimer, with Leucine at the `a` position and Isoleucine at the `d` position.\n\n    In the given sequence, the core is consistently composed of Alanine at the `a` position and Leucine at the `d` position. Alanine is a small, non-bulky hydrophobic residue. The packing of a small `a` residue (Alanine) with a larger `d` residue (Leucine) is most analogous to the pattern that favors the formation of a **dimer**. The packing in trimers and tetramers is generally more restrictive and less likely to favorably accommodate this combination. The arrangement provides good knobs-into-holes packing efficiency for a two-stranded coiled-coil.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequence is predicted to form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
