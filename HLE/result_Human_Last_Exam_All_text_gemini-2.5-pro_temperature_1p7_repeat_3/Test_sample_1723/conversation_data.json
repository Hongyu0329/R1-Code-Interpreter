    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a *single genus* of mushroom. The key and very specific characteristic is that it is \"known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Eliminating Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many people immediately think of the Indigo Milk Cap mushroom (*Lactarius indigo* or *Lactifluus indigo*). This mushroom has a vibrant blue cap, blue flesh, and even exudes a blue \"milk\" or latex when cut.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to distinguish between the color of the mushroom's body (fruitbody) or its latex and the color of its microscopic spores when collected en masse (a spore print).\n    *   **Verification:** A quick check of mycological resources confirms that the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is actually cream to pale yellow, not blue. Therefore, the genus *Lactarius* (or *Lactifluus*) is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Investigating Other Blue-Colored Mushrooms:**\n    *   There are other mushrooms that are blue in color or that stain blue when bruised. For example, some species in the genera *Cortinarius*, *Mycena*, and many species of Boletes.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** We must check the spore print color for these genera, not their physical appearance.\n    *   **Verification:** *Cortinarius* species have a characteristic rusty brown spore print. Most blue *Mycena* have a white spore print. Boletes that stain blue have an olive-brown spore print. None of these produce blue spores.\n\n4.  **Honing in on the Correct Genus:**\n    *   The question states there is a *single genus*. This points to a very rare and specific trait. Through mycological literature, we find that the vast majority of mushroom spore prints are white, cream, pink, brown, purple-brown, or black. Blue is exceptionally rare.\n    *   Research consistently points to the genus *Entoloma*. The family Entolomataceae, to which this genus belongs, is largely defined by its pink, angular spores.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** While the *defining* characteristic of the genus *Entoloma* is a pink spore print, it is the only known genus that contains a few rare species that break this rule and produce spores with a blue pigment.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Trait within the Genus:**\n    *   Species within *Entoloma*, particularly in certain subgenera like *Leptonia* (e.g., *Entoloma nitidum*, *Entoloma chalybeum*), are known to produce spore prints that can be grayish-blue, violaceous (violet), or sky-blue.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** This blue color can sometimes be faint or fade over time, but its presence is a documented and unique feature of this genus. No other mushroom genus is known to have this capability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter eliminating common but incorrect candidates based on the critical distinction between mushroom color and spore color, the evidence points definitively to a single genus. While most species in this genus have pink spores, it is uniquely known for also containing species that can produce a blue spore print.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
