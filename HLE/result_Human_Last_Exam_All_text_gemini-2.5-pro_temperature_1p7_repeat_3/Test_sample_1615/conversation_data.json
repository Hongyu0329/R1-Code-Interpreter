    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of colours needed.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$). The chromatic number is the minimum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring, where no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound on the Chromatic Number**\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph. By definition, a complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. Since $G$ is not complete, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent. That is, there is no edge $(u,v)$ in $G$.\n\nThe fact that $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent has a direct implication for colouring the graph. In any proper colouring, non-adjacent vertices are allowed to have the same colour. We can use this to show that $n-1$ colours are always sufficient to colour such a graph.\n\nTo prove this, we can construct a valid colouring using at most $n-1$ colours:\n1.  Assign colour 1 to both vertex $u$ and vertex $v$. This is valid since they are not adjacent.\n2.  Now consider the remaining $n-2$ vertices in the graph.\n3.  We can assign a new, unique colour to each of these remaining $n-2$ vertices. For example, we can use colours $2, 3, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThis procedure results in a proper colouring of the graph $G$:\n*   No two vertices from the set of $n-2$ vertices have the same colour, so any edges between them are properly handled.\n*   Vertices $u$ and $v$ have the same colour, which is valid as they are not adjacent.\n*   Any of the other $n-2$ vertices, say $w$, is adjacent to $u$ or $v$. Its colour (from $\\{2, ..., n-1\\}$) is different from the colour of $u$ and $v$ (which is colour 1), so the colouring is proper.\n\nThis construction shows that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can be coloured with at most $n-1$ colours. Therefore, the chromatic number must satisfy $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. For our specific case, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n**Step 3: Show the Upper Bound is Achievable (Tightness)**\nTo show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate the existence of a graph $G^*$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete and requires exactly $n-1 = 12344$ colours.\n\nConsider the following graph $G^*$:\n*   Let $G^*$ be the disjoint union of a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$). We denote this as $G^* = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$.\n*   The total number of vertices in $G^*$ is $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$.\n*   $G^*$ is not a complete graph because it is not connected (the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex).\n*   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components of $G^*$ are $K_{n-1}$ and $K_1$.\n    *   The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_k$ is $k$. Thus, $\\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1$.\n    *   The chromatic number of a single vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(\\chi(K_{n-1}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\nFor $n=12345$, this graph $G^* = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$ has 12345 vertices, is not a complete graph, and has a chromatic number of $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   **Conclusion**: We have shown that for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most $12344$. We have also constructed a graph that meets these conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly $12344$. Therefore, the maximum number of colours needed is $12344$.\n\n*   **Careful Points**:\n    1.  **The \"not complete\" constraint is key**: This single constraint reduces the maximum chromatic number from $n$ (for $K_n$) to $n-1$.\n    2.  **Connectivity is not assumed**: The problem does not state the graph must be connected. Our example $K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$ is disconnected. If connectivity were required, we could use the graph $K_n - e$ (a complete graph with one edge removed), which is connected for $n \\ge 3$ and also has a chromatic number of $n-1$. So the result would be the same.\n    3.  **The role of Maximum Degree $\\Delta(G)$**: The mention of $\\Delta(G)$ in the problem description might seem to point towards theorems like Brooks' Theorem, which states $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ for most connected graphs. However, our example $G^* = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$ has $\\Delta(G^*) = 12343$, but $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$. This does not violate Brooks' Theorem because the theorem does not apply to disconnected graphs. The direct proof is more general and avoids this complication. Even if the problem implied a constraint $\\Delta(G) < n-1$, our example graph satisfies it.\n\nThe final answer is derived directly from the number of vertices, $n=12345$. The maximum number of colours is $n-1$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
