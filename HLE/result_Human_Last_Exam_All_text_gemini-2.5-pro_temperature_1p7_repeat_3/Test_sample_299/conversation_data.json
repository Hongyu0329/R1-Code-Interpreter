    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Deduce basic properties of the function $f$\n\nLet $g(x) = e^x$. The equation is $f(f(x)) = g(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we have $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Therefore, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the monotonicity of $f$\n\nLet's consider the two cases for the monotonicity of $f$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    If $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, let's analyze the composition $f \\circ f$. If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ because $f$ is decreasing. Applying $f$ again to this inequality, we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$, again because $f$ is decreasing. This shows that $f(f(x))$ is a strictly increasing function. The function $g(x) = e^x$ is indeed strictly increasing, so this case is plausible so far.\n\n    Let's investigate the limiting behavior of a strictly decreasing function $f$.\n    As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a limit, which is the infimum of its range. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L_1$.\n    As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a limit, which is the supremum of its range. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L_2$.\n    The range of $f$ is $(L_1, L_2)$. Note that $L_1$ can be $-\\infty$ and $L_2$ can be $\\infty$.\n\n    Let's evaluate the limits of $f(f(x))$:\n    -   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n        $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y)$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y) = 0$.\n    -   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\n        $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y)$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n\n    From $\\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y) = \\infty$, since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, this can only happen if $L_1$ is not a real number. For a decreasing function, this means $L_1 = -\\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\n    Now consider $\\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y) = 0$. If $L_2$ is a finite real number, by continuity of $f$, we have $f(L_2) = 0$. The range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, L_2)$, so $f(x) < L_2$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, for $x=L_2$, we have $f(L_2) < L_2$, which implies $0 < L_2$.\n    Now, let's use the functional equation at $x=L_2$: $f(f(L_2)) = e^{L_2}$. This simplifies to $f(0) = e^{L_2}$.\n    Since $0$ is a real number, $f(0)$ must be in the range of $f$, so $f(0) < L_2$. This gives the inequality $e^{L_2} < L_2$.\n    However, the function $h(t) = e^t - t$ has derivative $h'(t) = e^t - 1$, which is zero only at $t=0$. The minimum value is $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. So, $e^t - t \\ge 1$ for all real $t$, which means $e^t > t$. Therefore, the inequality $e^{L_2} < L_2$ has no real solution. This is a contradiction, so $L_2$ cannot be finite.\n\n    If $L_2=\\infty$, then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. Let's re-evaluate $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x))$. Let $y=f(x)$, so as $x \\to -\\infty$, $y \\to \\infty$.\n    $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = L_1 = -\\infty$.\n    But we know $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$. This leads to the contradiction $-\\infty=0$.\n    So, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ satisfying the equation.\n\n*   **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n    Let's analyze the limits:\n    -   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$. If $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = M$ (finite), then $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = f(M)$, which is a finite value, a contradiction. Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    -   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$. Then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n    Since the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is continuous at $L$. Thus, $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = f(L)$, which means $f(L)=0$.\n    The range of $f$ is $(L, \\infty)$. So, $f(x) > L$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, $f(L)=0 > L$. This implies $L < 0$.\n\n    Also, let's analyze $f(x)$ vs $x$. Since $f$ is continuous, if it has a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0))=f(x_0)=x_0$, so $e^{x_0}=x_0$. This equation has no real solutions. Thus $f$ has no fixed points. This means either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$.\n    If $f(x)<x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $e^x < x$, which is false.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(x)>x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 3: Construction of Solutions\n\nThe analysis in Step 2 shows that any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing and there exists a unique number $L<0$ (associated with $f$) such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$ and $f(L)=0$.\n\nLet's try to construct such functions. The construction shows that we have degrees of freedom.\n\n1.  **Choose $L$**: We can choose any number $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. This choice will determine the limit of our function at $-\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Define a \"seed\" function**: Having chosen $L$, we know that $f$ must map $L$ to $0$. Let's find where $f$ maps $0$. From $f(f(x))=e^x$, we have $f(f(L)) = e^L$, which means $f(0)=e^L$.\n    Our function $f$ must be a strictly increasing, continuous map from the interval $[L, 0]$ to the interval $[f(L), f(0)] = [0, e^L]$.\n    Let's pick any such function and call it $h$. That is, we choose a strictly increasing continuous function $h: [L, 0] \\to [0, e^L]$ with $h(L)=0$ and $h(0)=e^L$. We set $f(x)=h(x)$ for $x \\in [L, 0]$.\n\n3.  **Extend the function**: We can now use the functional equation to extend $f$ to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   **For $x>0$**: We can define $f$ on intervals iteratively. For instance, on $[0, e^L]$, $f(x)$ must be $e^{h^{-1}(x)}$, where $h^{-1}: [0, e^L] \\to [L,0]$ is the inverse of our chosen $h$. This defines $f$ on $[L, 0] \\cup [0, e^L] = [L, e^L]$. This process can be continued over a sequence of intervals that cover $[L, \\infty)$. The construction at each step is unique once $h$ is fixed.\n    *   **For $x<L$**: We use the relation $f(f(x))=e^x$. For $x<L$, $f(x)$ must be in the interval $(L, 0)$. Let $y=f(x)$, so $y \\in (L,0)$. Then $f(y) = e^x$. This means $y=f^{-1}(e^x)$. So we can define $f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x)$ for $x<L$. The function $f^{-1}$ here is the inverse of the function we have already constructed on $[L, \\infty)$, which maps to $[0, \\infty)$. Since $e^x > 0$ for all $x$, $f^{-1}(e^x)$ is well-defined.\n\nThis construction process shows that for every choice of $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and every choice of a \"seed\" function $h$, we get a valid solution.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Solutions\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of possible choices we can make in the construction.\n\n1.  **Number of choices for L**: The value $L$ can be any real number in $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$. Different choices of $L$ lead to different functions, since $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$.\n\n2.  **Number of choices for h**: For a fixed $L<0$, we need to count the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $h: [L, 0] \\to [0, e^L]$ with $h(L)=0$ and $h(0)=e^L$. By a linear scaling of the domain and range, this is equivalent to counting the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $H: [0, 1] \\to [0, 1]$ with $H(0)=0$ and $H(1)=1$.\n    We can construct a continuum of such functions. For example, choose any number $y \\in (0, 1)$. Then define a piecewise linear function $H_y(x)$ that passes through $(0,0)$, $(1/2, y)$, and $(1,1)$.\n    $H_y(x) = \\begin{cases} 2yx & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/2 \\\\ y + (2-2y)(x-1/2) & \\text{if } 1/2 < x \\le 1 \\end{cases}$\n    For each distinct $y \\in (0,1)$, we get a distinct function $H_y$. The number of choices for $y$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    The total number of continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ is determined by their values on the countable set of rationals $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$. This cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. So, there are at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    Therefore, for each fixed $L$, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $h$. Different choices of $h$ result in different functions $f$ because they differ on the interval $[L,0]$.\n\n3.  **Total Cardinality**: The total number of solutions is the number of choices for $L$ multiplied by the number of choices for $h$.\n    Cardinality = $|\\{(L,h)\\}| = |(-\\infty, 0)| \\times |\\{h\\}| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    We know that $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\times 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nFinal answer: The cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the real numbers."
