    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Premises**\n\n*   **Core Definition:** We must use the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge. This states that a subject S knows a proposition P if and only if:\n    1.  P is true.\n    2.  S believes that P.\n    3.  S is justified in believing that P.\n*   **Constraint 1: Epistemic States:** The only two available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This simplifies the mental landscape, meaning any proposition is held as either a belief or as knowledge. It's important to note that under JTB, Knowledge is a specific *type* of Belief (one that is also true and justified), not a completely separate category.\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** Gettier problems are a specific class of counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief that still doesn't seem to be knowledge, usually due to a form of epistemic luck. We must find problems that are *not* of this type.\n*   **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems with the JTB definition under these conditions.\n\n**2. Identifying Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\n*   **The Logic of Justification:** The JTB model requires \"justification\" to elevate a true belief to the level of knowledge.\n*   **The Central Question:** What is the epistemic status of the justification itself? Let's say we want to establish that we *know* proposition P. According to JTB, we need a justification, which we can call J1.\n*   **The Dilemma:** For J1 to serve as a proper foundation for Knowledge, we must have a secure epistemic relationship with J1. Within our constrained system of only \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" what state applies to J1?\n    *   **Option A: We merely *believe* J1.** If our justification is just another belief, it could be false. A justification that might be false seems too weak to guarantee knowledge.\n    *   **Option B: We must *know* J1.** This seems more robust. However, if we must know J1, then according to the JTB definition, our belief in J1 must itself be justified. This new justification can be called J2.\n*   **The Regress:** For J2 to be a valid justification for J1, we must also *know* J2. This, in turn, requires another known justification, J3, and so on.\n*   **The Problem:** This creates an infinite regress (P ← J1 ← J2 ← J3 ← ...). To know anything, one would need an infinite chain of known justifications, which is impossible for a finite mind to possess. Therefore, no belief could ever be ultimately justified, and no knowledge could ever be acquired. This is a fundamental structural problem with the \"Justification\" condition.\n\n**3. Identifying Problem 2: The Problem of False Grounds (No False Lemmas)**\n\n*   **The Ambiguity of \"Justified\":** The simple formulation of JTB states that the belief must be \"justified.\" It does not explicitly specify that the beliefs forming the justification must themselves be true.\n*   **The Scenario:** Imagine the following:\n    1.  **Proposition P (True):** My keys are in my jacket pocket.\n    2.  **Belief (S believes P):** I believe my keys are in my jacket pocket.\n    3.  **Justification (J1):** I believe my keys are in my jacket pocket because I distinctly remember putting them there this morning.\n*   **The Flaw:** Let's say my memory is wrong. I did *not* put them there this morning; in fact, my partner found them on the counter and put them in my jacket pocket for me without my knowledge.\n*   **The Analysis:**\n    *   P is true (the keys are in the pocket).\n    *   I believe P (I believe they are in the pocket).\n    *   I am justified in believing P based on my (false) memory.\n*   **The Problem:** According to a strict reading of JTB, I have a Justified True Belief. However, this doesn't seem like knowledge because my reason for believing—my justification—is fundamentally false. Knowledge should not be derivable from a false premise or a \"false lemma.\" The JTB definition's failure to explicitly forbid justifications based on false beliefs is a second major weakness, distinct from both Gettier problems and the infinite regress problem.\n\n### Final Careful Points\n*   **Distinction from Gettier:** The Infinite Regress problem is about the *structure* of justification, while Gettier problems are about the *link* between justification and truth being accidental. The False Grounds problem is about whether the justification itself is *true*, which Gettier cases do not always depend on (in some Gettier cases, the justifying beliefs are true).\n*   **Role of the Constraint:** The constraint of \"only Knowledge and Belief\" highlights both problems. For the regress, it forces the justification into a loop where \"Belief\" is too weak and \"Knowledge\" requires another justification. For the false grounds problem, it poses the question: can a mere \"Belief\" (which could be false) act as the justification that elevates another belief to the status of \"Knowledge\"?\n\n***\n\nThe two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems and assuming only the epistemic states of Knowledge and Belief, are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** For a belief to count as knowledge, it must be justified. For that justification to be sound, it must also be known. For that justification to be known, it must in turn be justified by something that is also known, and so on *ad infinitum*. This makes it impossible for any belief to be ultimately justified, as it would require an infinite chain of justifications.\n\n2.  **The Problem of False Grounds (No False Lemmas):** The JTB definition does not explicitly state that the justification for a true belief must itself be true. This allows for scenarios where a person has a true belief that is justified by a false belief. For instance, someone might correctly believe their friend is at home (a true belief) because they were told so by a known liar who, by sheer chance, happened to tell the truth this one time. Intuitively, knowledge cannot be grounded in falsehoods, but the simple JTB definition fails to rule this out."
