The two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems and assuming only the epistemic states of Knowledge and Belief, are:

1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** For a belief to count as knowledge, it must be justified. For that justification to be sound, it must also be known. For that justification to be known, it must in turn be justified by something that is also known, and so on *ad infinitum*. This makes it impossible for any belief to be ultimately justified, as it would require an infinite chain of justifications.

2.  **The Problem of False Grounds (No False Lemmas):** The JTB definition does not explicitly state that the justification for a true belief must itself be true. This allows for scenarios where a person has a true belief that is justified by a false belief. For instance, someone might correctly believe their friend is at home (a true belief) because they were told so by a known liar who, by sheer chance, happened to tell the truth this one time. Intuitively, knowledge cannot be grounded in falsehoods, but the simple JTB definition fails to rule this out.
