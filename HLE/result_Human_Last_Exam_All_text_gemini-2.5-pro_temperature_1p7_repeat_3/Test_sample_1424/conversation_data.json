    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**:\n    The bare Green's function, also known as the non-interacting propagator, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. In the time domain, for fermions, it is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of the field operators in the non-interacting ground state:\n    $G_0(x, x') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x')] \\rangle_0$\n    where $x = (t, \\mathbf{r})$, $T$ is the time-ordering operator, and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ denotes the expectation value with respect to the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Problem in the Path Integral Formalism**:\n    In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function is calculated as a correlation function over classical fields (or Grassmann fields for fermions).\n    $G_0(x, x') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n    where $S_0$ is the action corresponding to the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_0$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**:\n    The question specifies that the system has well-defined single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. This means the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal in a basis of single-particle states indexed by $k$ (e.g., momentum).\n    $H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$\n    where $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$. The corresponding Lagrangian ($L_0 = \\sum_k i c_k^\\dagger \\dot{c}_k - H_0$) and action ($S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0$) in terms of Grassmann fields $\\psi_k(t)$ become:\n    $S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) (i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Path Integral in Fourier Space**:\n    The calculation is simplest in Fourier space. We transform from the time domain to the frequency ($\\omega$) domain.\n    $\\psi_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n    Substituting this into the action, the time derivative $i\\partial/\\partial t$ becomes a factor of $\\omega$. The action becomes a simple algebraic expression in $(\\omega, k)$ space:\n    $S_0 = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n    The action is quadratic in the fields, meaning the path integral is of a Gaussian form. For such integrals, the two-point correlation function (the Green's function) is the inverse of the operator appearing between $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ in the action.\n\n5.  **Determine the Explicit Form of the Green's Function**:\n    The operator in the action for a given mode $k$ is simply the scalar $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The inverse of this operator gives the Green's function in Fourier space, which we denote as $G_0(k, \\omega)$:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\n6.  **Apply the Feynman Prescription for Causality**:\n    A crucial point is handling the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. To correctly represent the time-ordered Green's function, we must include a small imaginary part, $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), in the denominator. The sign of this term ensures causality and depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied (a hole state, energy below the chemical potential $\\mu$) or unoccupied (a particle state, energy above $\\mu$) in the ground state.\n    *   For an unoccupied state ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$): The pole is shifted slightly into the upper-half complex plane: $\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta$.\n    *   For an occupied state ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$): The pole is shifted slightly into the lower-half complex plane: $\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta$.\n    This can be written compactly as:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is most simply expressed in frequency-momentum space. For a given frequency $\\omega$ and quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum), the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. The explicit form is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta_k}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency variable, and $i\\delta_k$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality (its sign depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the chemical potential). Therefore, the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency and the single-particle energy, and its poles in the complex frequency plane are located exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta_k)^{-1}$, where $i\\delta_k$ is an infinitesimal term required for causality.>>>"
