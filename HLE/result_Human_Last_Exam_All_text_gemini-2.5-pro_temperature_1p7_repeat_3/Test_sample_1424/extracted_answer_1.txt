In frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = (\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta_k)^{-1}$, where $i\delta_k$ is an infinitesimal term required for causality.
