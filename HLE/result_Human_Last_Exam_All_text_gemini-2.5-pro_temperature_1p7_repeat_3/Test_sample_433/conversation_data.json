    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Item:** Single-dose container, specifically an **ampule**.\n    *   **Action:** From the time of puncture (or, more accurately for an ampule, from the time it is opened/broken).\n    *   **Environment:** In a sterile environment (implying handling within an ISO Class 5 or cleaner Primary Engineering Control like a laminar airflow workbench).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Standard:**\n    The standards for sterile compounding in the United States are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. This chapter provides explicit rules for handling various sterile containers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Nature of an Ampule:**\n    An ampule is a sealed glass or plastic container holding a sterile medication. To access the contents, its neck must be broken. Critically, once opened, an ampule **cannot be resealed**. It becomes an open system, directly exposed to the surrounding environment. This physical characteristic is the primary determinant of its handling requirements.\n\n4.  **Consult the USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    USP <797> (2022 version, official as of November 1, 2023) is very clear regarding opened ampules. The standard states: **\"Opened ampules must not be stored for any period.\"**\n\n5.  **Interpret the Rule and Determine the BUD:**\n    *   The phrase \"must not be stored for any period\" means the contents of the ampule must be withdrawn and used immediately in a single, continuous procedure.\n    *   Therefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for the opened ampule itself is effectively zero. There is no permissible storage time.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication remaining in the ampule after the dose is withdrawn must be discarded immediately and cannot be saved for later use.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Single-Dose Vial:** This is the most common point of confusion.\n    *   **Ampule (Opened):** An open, unsealable system. Must be used immediately, and the remainder discarded.\n    *   **Single-Dose Vial (Punctured):** A closed system with a rubber stopper. If punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it can be used for up to **12 hours**. The question specifically names an **ampule**, so the 12-hour rule for vials does not apply.\n\n2.  **The Meaning of \"Sterile Environment\":** Handling the ampule in a sterile, ISO Class 5 environment is essential to prevent microbial contamination of the dose **during the withdrawal process** (i.e., when drawing the drug into a syringe). However, the sterile environment does *not* negate the fact that the ampule is an open container and cannot be stored.\n\n3.  **Definition of BUD in this Context:** A BUD typically implies a storage time (e.g., hours, days). For an opened ampule, the concept of a storage BUD does not apply. The directive is \"immediate use,\" not a specific time frame for storage.\n\n4.  **\"Puncture\" vs. \"Open\":** While the question uses the word \"puncture,\" ampules are \"opened\" or \"broken.\" The principle is the same: the moment the container's sterile seal is breached, the clock starts.\n\n### Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1:** The item in question is a single-dose ampule, a container that cannot be resealed once opened.\n**Step 2:** According to the governing standard, USP <797>, sterile preparations must be handled according to specific rules based on container type.\n**Step 3:** The rule for ampules is explicit: \"Opened ampules must not be stored for any period.\"\n**Step 4:** This rule means that once an ampule is opened, its contents must be used immediately. There is no allowable storage period.\n**Step 5:** Any medication remaining in the ampule after the required dose has been withdrawn must be discarded immediately.\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the BUD for a single-dose ampule from the time of opening is for immediate use only.\n\n<<<An opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any period, so there is no storage BUD.>>>"
