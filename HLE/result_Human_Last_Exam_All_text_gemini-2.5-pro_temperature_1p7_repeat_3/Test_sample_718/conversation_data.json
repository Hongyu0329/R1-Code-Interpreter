    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question's components\n\nThe question asks for which integer $n$ a \"tame functor\" $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is \"$n$-resolvable\", given that $J$ is an \"upper semilattice\". Let's break down these terms.\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**:\n    *   This is a partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their least upper bound (or join), denoted $j_1 \\lor j_2$, exists.\n    *   Any poset can be viewed as a category, where objects are the elements of the poset and there's a unique morphism $j_1 \\to j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$.\n    *   The upper semilattice property means that in this category, any pair of objects has a coproduct.\n\n2.  **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**:\n    *   This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\le j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ for each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, respecting composition.\n    *   These functors are the objects of a category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. This category is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra $KJ$ of the poset $J$.\n\n3.  **$n$-resolvable**:\n    *   This is a homological property. A functor (or module) $f$ is $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$.\n    *   This means there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   The smallest such $n$ is the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$. Being $n$-resolvable means $\\text{pd}(f) \\le n$.\n    *   The question asks for a uniform bound $n$ that holds for a specific class of functors.\n\n4.  **Tame Functor**:\n    *   This is the most critical and potentially ambiguous term. In representation theory, \"tame\" usually describes a class of problems or algebras, not individual objects.\n    *   **Interpretation A**: \"Tame\" refers to the poset $J$. The poset $J$ (and its incidence algebra $KJ$) is of tame representation type. A poset is tame if it's neither of finite nor wild representation type. By Drozd's Tame and Wild Theorem, this means the indecomposable representations of any given dimension fall into a finite number of one-parameter families.\n    *   **Interpretation B**: \"Tame\" is a property of the functor $f$ itself, irrespective of the representation type of $J$. For instance, it could mean that $f$ is a direct sum of indecomposable functors that belong to one-parameter families, or that its endomorphism ring, $\\text{End}(f)$, is a tame algebra. This interpretation is less common in introductory contexts.\n    *   **Interpretation C**: The phrasing \"Let J be an upper semilattice. Then a tame functor...\" could mean that the property \"tame functor\" is considered for *any* upper semilattice $J$, not just for tame ones.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the consequences of the properties\n\nLet's assume Interpretation A for now, as it's the most standard context for the term \"tame\". The question becomes: if $J$ is a tame upper semilattice, what is the maximum projective dimension of a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$? This is the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n*   **Global Dimension of Poset Algebras**: For a *finite* poset $J$, the global dimension of the module category over its incidence algebra $KJ$ is equal to the length of the longest chain of elements in $J$. The length of a chain $j_0 < j_1 < \\dots < j_m$ is $m$. So, $\\text{gldim}(KJ) = \\max \\{m \\mid \\exists j_0 < j_1 < \\dots < j_m \\text{ in } J\\}$.\n\n*   **Do \"Tame\" and \"Upper Semilattice\" bound chain length?**:\n    *   Consider a chain $C_m = \\{0 < 1 < \\dots < m\\}$. This is a total order, and thus an upper semilattice (the join is the maximum).\n    *   The incidence algebra of a chain $C_m$ is the algebra of $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ upper-triangular matrices, which is of *finite* representation type for any $m$. Finite type is a subset of tame type.\n    *   The global dimension for this algebra is $m$.\n    *   Since $m$ can be arbitrarily large, we can find a tame upper semilattice ($C_m$) for which the global dimension is arbitrarily large.\n\nThis implies that there is **no single integer $n$** for which *every* functor on *every* tame upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate the premise\n\nThe conclusion from Step 2 contradicts the premise of the question, which asks for \"what $n$\". This suggests one of our assumptions or interpretations is incorrect. The most likely point of failure is the interpretation of \"tame functor\".\n\nLet's consider Interpretation C: $J$ is any upper semilattice, and \"tame functor\" is a property of $f$. This is the most robust phrasing. The question is what property \"tame functor\" signifies. Without a standard definition provided, we must infer it from the context of where such a question might arise.\n\nIn several areas of modern representation theory, the classes of objects described as \"tame\" have specific, strong homological properties.\n*   **Hereditary Algebras**: These are algebras of global dimension at most 1. Tame hereditary algebras (path algebras of extended Dynkin quivers) play a foundational role. Any module has projective dimension at most 1.\n*   **Canonical Algebras**: Introduced by Ringel, these are archetypal tame algebras. They generally have global dimension 2. Modules for canonical algebras are well-behaved, and their homological properties are central to the theory. Any module over a canonical algebra is 2-resolvable.\n*   **Gentle Algebras**: A subclass of tame algebras where all indecomposable modules have projective dimension 1 or infinity.\n\nThe question could be alluding to a general principle that \"well-behaved\" or \"non-wild\" representations, when considered on a structured poset like an upper semilattice, have controlled homological dimension. The jump from hereditary algebras (gldim 1) to more general tame algebras often leads to global dimension 2. This suggests that $n=2$ might be the intended answer, likely relying on a deeper theorem that connects tameness to homological dimension, possibly under the specified condition of the domain being an upper semilattice.\n\nFor example, a theorem by Happel states that a finite-dimensional algebra that is \"tiltable to a tame hereditary algebra\" has a global dimension of at most 2. While not all tame algebras satisfy this, it points to a recurring theme where `tame` implies `gldim` is small (often 2) or infinite. The existence of arbitrarily long chains (finite type, hence tame) shows that the `gldim=âˆž` case is possible. However, the question asks about a property of a `tame functor`, not about all functors. This suggests the properties of this specific functor constrain its resolution length, even if other functors in the same category have higher projective dimension.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the common patterns in representation theory, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"tame functor\" refers to a class of particularly well-behaved functors, for which the upper semilattice structure of the domain $J$ allows for a projective resolution of a fixed, small length. The value $n=2$ is a frequent upper bound for homological dimensions in various contexts of tame representation theory that go beyond the hereditary case (where $n=1$).\n\nFinal consideration: The property of $J$ being an upper semilattice ensures a certain \"connectedness towards the top\". For any two objects, there is a common object they both map to. This structure could be what's needed to ensure that the homological complexity, for \"tame\" functors, does not grow indefinitely. For instance, it might guarantee that after two syzygy steps, the remaining kernel becomes projective.\n\nTherefore, the most educated guess based on established theories is $n=2$.\n\n>>>2"
