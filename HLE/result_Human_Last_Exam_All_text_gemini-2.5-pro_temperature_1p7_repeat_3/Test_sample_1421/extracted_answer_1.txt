The formula is:
$Z = \int_{\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}\psi^*(\tau) \mathcal{D}\psi(\tau) \, \exp\left( -S_E[\psi^*, \psi] \right)$
where the Euclidean action $S_E$ is given by:
$S_E[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \, \left[ \psi^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$

Here:
*   $Z$ is the partition function.
*   $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.
*   $\psi(\tau)$ and $\psi^*(\tau)$ are independent Grassmann-valued fields.
*   $\mathcal{D}\psi^*(\tau) \mathcal{D}\psi(\tau)$ is the functional integration measure over all field paths.
*   The subscript on the integral sign, $\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)$, signifies that the integration is restricted to paths that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\tau$.
*   $H(\psi^*, \psi)$ is the classical analogue of the system's Hamiltonian, obtained by replacing the creation and annihilation operators with their corresponding Grassmann fields.
