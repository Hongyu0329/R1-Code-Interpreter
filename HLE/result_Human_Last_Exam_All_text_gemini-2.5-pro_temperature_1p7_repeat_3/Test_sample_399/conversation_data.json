    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Differential Equation and Initial Condition**\nWe are given the initial value problem (IVP):\n- Differential Equation: $x'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t)$\n- Initial Condition: $x(0)=-8$\n\n**2. Recognize the Type of Equation**\nThe equation can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t) \\cdot h(x)$, where $g(t) = t-1$ and $h(x) = x^2$. This is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation.\n\n**3. Separate the Variables**\nTo solve a separable equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nA careful point here is division by $x^2$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side becomes $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. So $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is never zero, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**4. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe left side integral is:\n$$\n\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe right side integral is:\n$$\n\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t\n$$\nCombining these and adding the constant of integration, C:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nThis is the general solution in implicit form.\n\n**5. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant C**\nWe use the given initial condition, $x(0)=-8$, to find the specific value of C. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Write the Particular Solution**\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this IVP.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**7. Solve for the Target Value x(1)**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nFirst, combine the terms on the right side.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{4}{8}\n$$\nSo the equation is:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $x(1)$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides.\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
