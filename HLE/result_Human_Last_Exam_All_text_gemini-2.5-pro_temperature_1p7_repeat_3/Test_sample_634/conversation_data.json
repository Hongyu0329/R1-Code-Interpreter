    "This problem asks for the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**1. Definition of GCRD**\n\n*   A polynomial matrix D(s) is a **right divisor** of a polynomial matrix P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n*   A matrix R(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   A matrix G(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if it is a common right divisor, and any other common right divisor R(s) is a right divisor of G(s). This means G(s) = L(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s).\n*   The GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then so is U(s)G(s) for any unimodular matrix U(s) (a matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**2. Method for Finding the GCRD**\n\nA standard method to find a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) is to use the Euclidean algorithm on a composite matrix. We form the matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) and P2(s), and then reduce it to a row-echelon form using elementary row operations.\n\nM(s) = [P1(s) ; P2(s)]\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThese operations are equivalent to left-multiplying by a unimodular matrix. The goal is to transform M(s) into the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is a square matrix (in this case, 2x2). The resulting matrix G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the composite matrix M(s).**\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s      ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2     ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,         0       ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,    1       ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M(s).**\nRow 4 has a `1` in the second column, which is a convenient pivot to eliminate other elements in that column.\n\n*   Let's eliminate the `-s` in Row 1. We perform `Row 1 -> Row 1 + s * Row 4`.\n    `[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n    So, the new Row 1 is `[0, 0]`.\n\n*   Let's eliminate the `s^2` in Row 2. We perform `Row 2 -> Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4`.\n    `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n    So, the new Row 2 is `[s^3 - 1, 0]`.\n\nAfter these two operations, the matrix becomes:\n[ 0,         0       ]\n[ s^3 - 1,   0       ]\n[ s,         0       ]\n[ -s - 1,    1       ]\n\nWe have already found one zero row. We now need to simplify the remaining three non-zero rows to find another zero row. Let's work with the non-zero rows:\nRow A: `[s^3 - 1, 0]`\nRow B: `[s, 0]`\nRow C: `[-s - 1, 1]`\n\nWe can simplify Row A and Row B using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. Notice `s^3 - 1 = s^2 * s - 1`.\n\n*   Perform the operation `Row A -> Row A - s^2 * Row B`.\n    `[s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0 - 0] = [-1, 0]`\n    The set of non-zero rows is now:\n    Row A': `[-1, 0]`\n    Row B:  `[s, 0]`\n    Row C:  `[-s - 1, 1]`\n\nNow, we use the simple row A' (`[-1, 0]`) to eliminate the first elements in the other rows.\n\n*   Perform `Row B -> Row B + s * Row A'`.\n    `[s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [s - s, 0 + 0] = [0, 0]`\n    This gives us our second zero row.\n\n*   Perform `Row C -> Row C - (s + 1) * Row A'`.\n    `[-s - 1, 1] - (s + 1) * [-1, 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 - 0] = [0, 1]`\n\nThe two remaining non-zero rows are `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. These rows form a basis for the row space of the original composite matrix M(s). We can form our GCRD, G(s), from these rows.\n\nG(s) = [ -1, 0 ;\n          0, 1 ]\n\n**4. Verification**\n\nWe can check that G(s) is indeed a common right divisor.\n*   For P1: P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) where Q1(s) = P1(s)G(s)⁻¹ = [s²+s, -s; -s²-1, s²] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [-s²-s, -s; s²+1, s²], which is a polynomial matrix.\n*   For P2: P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s) where Q2(s) = P2(s)G(s)⁻¹ = [s, 0; -s-1, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [-s, 0; s+1, 1], which is a polynomial matrix.\n\nSince G(s) was found using a standard algorithm that preserves the GCRD property, and it is a common right divisor, it is a GCRD. The determinant of G(s) is -1 (a non-zero constant), which means G(s) is unimodular. This implies that P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime.\n\nThe identity matrix I = [1, 0; 0, 1] is also a valid GCRD, as it can be obtained by left-multiplying G(s) by the unimodular matrix U(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]. Both answers are correct. We will provide the one derived directly from the algorithm."
