    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of the Object:**\n    The problem asks for an invariant of a \"Calabi-Yau Link\". This refers to the manifold formed by the intersection of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface with a sphere in the ambient complex space. The hypersurface is defined by the zero set of a polynomial, $P=0$, within a weighted projective space, $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n\n    *   **Polynomial:** $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n    *   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Verify Weighted Homogeneity and Determine the Degree (d):**\n    For a variety to be well-defined in a weighted projective space, its defining polynomial must be weighted homogeneous. This means every monomial in the polynomial must have the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_n^{a_n}$ is calculated as $\\sum a_i w_i$.\n\n    Let's calculate the degree for each monomial of $P$:\n    *   `deg`( $z_1^8z_3$ ) = $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ ) = $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_1z_2^7$ ) = $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$ ) = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_2z_3^4$ ) = $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_4^3z_5$ ) = $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   `deg`( $z_5^3$ ) = $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** There is an inconsistency. The second monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has a degree of 224, while all other six monomials have a degree of 225. This indicates a likely typo in the problem statement's polynomial.\n\n3.  **Apply the Calabi-Yau Condition to Resolve Inconsistency:**\n    A hypersurface is defined as \"Calabi-Yau\" when its degree, $d$, is equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient space, $\\sum w_i$. Let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n    *   $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\n    The Calabi-Yau condition is $d = \\sum w_i = 225$. This strongly suggests that the intended degree of the polynomial is 225. The single monomial with degree 224 is erroneous and should be disregarded. We will proceed by assuming the polynomial is the sum of the six monomials of degree 225.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** Using the \"Calabi-Yau\" property is crucial to determine the correct degree $d=225$ and systematically correct the error in the polynomial.\n\n4.  **Define and Interpret the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant is formally defined for a different class of varieties called Fano varieties. For a Fano hypersurface $X_d \\subset \\mathbb{P}(w_i)$, the invariant is given by the log canonical threshold (lct) of the affine cone over $X_d$. This value is calculated as:\n    *   `inv`(X) = lct($P$; 0) = $\\frac{\\sum w_i}{d}$\n\n    Although our variety is Calabi-Yau, not Fano, this calculation is the natural extension of the invariant to the Calabi-Yau case, where it measures the singularity type of the corresponding affine cone at the origin. The question uses this terminology, so we apply this formula.\n\n    **Careful Point 3:** It is important to correctly identify the specific mathematical quantity being asked for, even if the terminology might be slightly extended from its original context. The calculation boils down to the lct of the defining polynomial.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Using the values we have confirmed:\n    *   The sum of weights: $\\sum w_i = 225$.\n    *   The degree of the polynomial: $d = 225$.\n\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant is:\n    *   `inv` = $\\frac{\\sum w_i}{d} = \\frac{225}{225} = 1$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step analysis, which includes identifying and resolving an inconsistency in the provided polynomial by using the Calabi-Yau condition, leads to the conclusion that the invariant is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
