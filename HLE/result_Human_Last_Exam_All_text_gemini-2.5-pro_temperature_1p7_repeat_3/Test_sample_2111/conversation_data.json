    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conceptual entity in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Context:** The question centers on the historian Fernand Braudel and a quote he attributes to the writer Paul Morand. Braudel is famous for his work with the Annales School of history, which championed a \"total history\" or a \"global historical perspective.\" This approach emphasizes long-term structures (*la longue durée*) over short-term events and looks at large-scale systems rather than isolated nations.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Core Assertion:** The central idea is that a \"particular conceptual entity\" must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **\"Inscribed within a sphere\":** This is a metaphor. A sphere represents the globe, the world, or a complete, all-encompassing context. \"Inscribed within\" means that the entity cannot be understood in isolation; it must be studied as part of this larger, global whole.\n    *   **\"Conceptual entity\":** This indicates we are looking for an abstract idea or a framework for analysis, not a physical thing.\n    *   **\"Exemplified by the symbol of a nation\":** This is a crucial clue. The nation is a primary *example* of this entity, but not the entity itself. The entity is therefore a broader category to which a nation belongs.\n\n3.  **Locate the Original Source:** The quote is found in Fernand Braudel's influential 1958 essay, \"History and the Social Sciences: The *Longue Durée*.\" In this essay, Braudel argues for a new scale of historical analysis.\n\n4.  **Examine the Specific Text:** In the essay, Braudel first reverses a proposition from Paul Morand and then elaborates on his own methodological idea. The key passage states:\n\n    > \"On an even vaster scale, **a civilization**, of which the symbol of a nation is now but a particular instance, a sub-group, ought to be inscribed within a sphere, with its original longitude and latitude carefully defined...\"\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Braudel explicitly names the \"conceptual entity.\"\n    *   The text directly states that **\"a civilization\"** is what should be inscribed within a sphere.\n    *   The text clarifies the relationship with the nation, calling it a \"particular instance\" or a \"sub-group\" of the larger civilization. This perfectly matches the phrasing in the question (\"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\").\n    *   This concept is the cornerstone of Braudel's work, which studies broad entities like \"the Mediterranean world\" or \"Islamic civilization\" as the primary units of historical analysis, viewing individual nations as components within these larger systems.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe conceptual entity that Braudel argues should be inscribed within a global sphere, and of which a nation is merely a subordinate example, is a civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
