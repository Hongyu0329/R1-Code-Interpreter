    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the key figures.**\n*   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A high-ranking military commander of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n*   **First Major Defeat:** We need to look for a significant military loss commanded by Mu Sheng himself, not just a strategic retreat or a battle where he was not the primary commander.\n*   **Location:** The battle site must be identified and mapped to a current Vietnamese province. This inquiry relates to the period of Ming rule in Vietnam, particularly during the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427) led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was involved in two major phases of Ming military action in Vietnam:\n1.  **The initial invasion (1406–1407):** This campaign against the Hồ Dynasty was largely successful. Mu Sheng was a commander but the overall command was held by Zhang Fu. No major defeat for Mu Sheng occurred here.\n2.  **The campaigns against the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427):** This is the most likely period for his defeat. The Ming forces were ultimately expelled from Vietnam.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's first major defeat during the Lam Sơn Uprising.**\n*   In the early years of the uprising, Lê Lợi's forces were based in the mountainous western regions.\n*   In 1422, Ming forces, including an army commanded by Mu Sheng, launched a major offensive against Lê Lợi's base at Chí Linh mountain.\n*   Under pressure, Lê Lợi and his army retreated westwards into the territory of Ai Lao (modern-day Laos). Mu Sheng pursued them.\n*   In late 1422, at Khả Lưu Pass (or Ai Lao Pass), Lê Lợi's forces, despite being outnumbered, laid an ambush for Mu Sheng's pursuing army. The Ming forces were caught by surprise and suffered a heavy defeat, with many soldiers killed. Mu Sheng was forced to abandon the pursuit and retreat. This event is widely considered his first significant personal defeat at the hands of Lê Lợi's army.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the historical location to a modern Vietnamese province.**\n*   The Lam Sơn Uprising originated in the Lam Sơn region. The early bases of the rebellion, including Chí Linh mountain (not to be confused with the one in Hải Dương), were located in the mountainous western part of this region.\n*   The historical Lam Sơn area corresponds to the western districts of modern-day **Thanh Hóa Province**.\n*   The military campaign of 1422, which culminated in the defeat at Khả Lưu Pass, was fought in and originated from this region. While the final ambush may have technically occurred just over the modern border in Laos, the campaign's theater of operations and the core territory being contested was what is now Thanh Hóa. Therefore, the province where Mu Sheng's campaign suffered this major setback is Thanh Hóa.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Distinguishing between different types of defeat:** Mu Sheng's retreat in 1427 after hearing of Liu Sheng's annihilation at Chi Lăng was a strategic failure, but not a defeat in a pitched battle he personally commanded. The 1422 defeat at Khả Lưu was a clear tactical defeat in the field.\n*   **Geographical precision:** Historical borders do not perfectly match modern ones. The battle took place in the rugged border region between Vietnam and Laos. However, the military campaign was focused on the rebellion's heartland, which is definitively located in modern Thanh Hóa Province. Thus, Thanh Hóa is the correct answer for the province where he *experienced* the defeat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the Lam Sơn Uprising, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in 1422. This happened when his army was ambushed by Lê Lợi's forces at Khả Lưu Pass after pursuing them from their mountain bases. These bases and the overall military theater for this campaign are located in the territory of the modern Vietnamese province of Thanh Hóa.\n\n<<<Thanh Hóa Province>>>"
