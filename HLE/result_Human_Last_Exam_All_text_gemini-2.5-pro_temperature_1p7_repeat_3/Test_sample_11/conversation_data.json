This is a very fundamental concept. In Hebrew, it's \"תום לב\" (tom lev).\n    *   Where does this concept appear? It's central to contract law. It's also in other areas of civil law.\n    *   The question asks for the *first* statute in the *modern State of Israel* to *explicitly introduce* the concept.\n    *   \"Modern State of Israel\" means after its establishment in 1948.\n    *   \"Explicitly introduce\" means the term \"good faith\" or its Hebrew equivalent \"תום לב\" must appear in the text of the law. Implied concepts or judicial interpretations don't count for this specific question.\n    *   I know the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is famous for its good faith provisions (Sections 12 and 39). This is a very strong candidate. But was it the *first*?\n    *   I need to consider laws enacted between 1948 and 1973.\n    *   What other major civil laws were enacted during that period?\n        *   Standard Contracts Law, 1964. Does it have \"good faith\"? I should check.\n        *   Agency Law, 1965. This deals with fiduciary duties. Is \"good faith\" explicitly mentioned?\n        *   Guarantee Law, 1967.\n        *   Sale Law, 1968.\n        *   Land Law, 1969. This is a big one. It has a section (Section 12) about good faith in exercising property rights, but it was interpreted by the courts *later*. The explicit language might be key. Let's check the original text.\n        *   Movable Property Law, 1971.\n    *   Let's do a more systematic search. Israeli law before the major codifications of the 60s and 70s was a mix of Ottoman law and British Mandate common law. The move towards original Israeli legislation was gradual. The codification of private law was a major project.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Analysis Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: Identify the key term.** The term is \"good faith,\" which in Hebrew is \"תום לב\" (tom lev).\n    *   **Step 2: Define the search scope.** \"Modern State of Israel\" means laws passed by the Knesset from 1948 onwards. The question is about the *first* statute, so I need to look chronologically.\n    *   **Step 3: Investigate major civil law statutes chronologically.** I'll start with laws before the Contracts Law of 1973, as that one is the most well-known for this concept.\n    *   **Step 4: Examine candidate statutes.**\n        *   **Standard Contracts Law, 1964 (חוק החוזים האחידים, תשכ\"ד-1964):** This law dealt with unfair terms in standard form contracts. Did it use the term \"good faith\"? A quick check of its provisions shows it focused on \"unduly disadvantageous\" terms or terms that create \"unfair advantage\". The concept is related, but the explicit phrase \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\" is not the central operative term. It was more about public policy and unconscionability. The later 1982 version of this law *does* use the term, but the question is about the *first* law. So, 1964 law is likely not it.\n        *   **Agency Law, 1965 (חוק השליחות, תשכ\"ה-1965):** This law deals with the relationship between a principal and an agent. Section 8 outlines the agent's duties of loyalty (\"חובת נאמנות\"). It states the agent must act with loyalty to the principal. While loyalty is a core component of good faith, the law doesn't use the explicit term \"good faith\" (תום לב). So, probably not the answer.\n        *   **Sale Law, 1968 (חוק המכר, תשכ\"ח-1968):** This law governs contracts for the sale of goods. Let's look at its provisions. It mainly deals with conformity of goods, warranties, passing of risk, etc. A quick review of the key sections of the 1968 law doesn't show an explicit \"good faith\" clause. The obligation of good faith was later *applied* to sales contracts via the general Contracts Law of 1973.\n        *   **Land Law, 1969 (חוק המקרקעין, תשכ\"ט-1969):** This is a very important law. Let's examine it carefully. It contains provisions about property rights. I remember there's a concept of \"market overt\" or \"תקנת השוק\" (takanat hashuk) in Section 10. This section protects a person who acquires a property right in registered land *in good faith* (\"בתום לב\") and for consideration, relying on the registry. Let's check the text of Section 10 of the Land Law, 1969.\n            *   \"מי שרכש זכות במקרקעין מוסדרים בתמורה ובהסתמך **בתום-לב** על הרישום, יהא כוחה של זכותו יפה אף אם הרישום לא היה נכון.\"\n            *   Translation: \"Whosoever acquires a right in regulated land for consideration, relying **in good faith** on the registration, his right shall be valid even if the registration was not correct.\"\n            *   Bingo. The phrase \"בתום-לב\" (in good faith) is explicitly there. The law was passed in 1969. This is a strong candidate. It predates the Contracts Law of 1973.\n        *   **Movable Property Law, 1971 (חוק המיטלטלין, תשל\"א-1971):** This law also has a \"market overt\" provision in Section 34.\n            *   \"נמכר נכס נד על ידי מי שעוסק במכירת נכסים מסוגו של הממכר והמכירה היתה במהלך הרגיל של עסקיו, עוברת הבעלות לקונה כשהיא נקיה מכל שעבוד, עיקול וזכות אחרת בממכר, אף אם המוכר לא היה בעל הממכר או לא היה זכאי להעבירו כאמור, ובלבד שהקונה קנה וקיבל אותו לחזקתו **בתום-לב**.\"\n            *   Translation: \"Where any movable property is sold by a person who deals in the sale of property of the same type as the property sold, and the sale was in the ordinary course of his business, ownership passes to the buyer free of any charge, attachment or other right in the property, even if the seller was not the owner of the property or was not entitled to transfer it as aforesaid, provided that the buyer bought and received it into his possession **in good faith**.\"\n            *   This also uses the term explicitly. However, it's from 1971. The Land Law was from 1969. Therefore, the Land Law is earlier.\n        *   **Contracts (Remedies for Breach of Contract) Law, 1970 (חוק החוזים (תרופות בשל הפרת חוזה), תשל\"א-1970):** Does this use the term? It deals with remedies like enforcement, cancellation, and damages. The general duty of good faith is not laid out here; that came in the 1973 General Part law.\n        *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 (חוק החוזים (חלק כללי), תשל\"ג-1973):** This law is famous for introducing a general, overarching duty of good faith. Section 12 mandates good faith in negotiations, and Section 39 mandates good faith in the performance of the contract.\n            *   Section 12: \"במשא ומתן לקראת כריתתו של חוזה חייב אדם לנהוג בדרך מקובלת ו**בתום לב**.\" (In negotiating a contract, a person shall act in a customary manner and **in good faith**.)\n            *   Section 39: \"בקיום של חיוב הנובע מחוזה יש לנהוג בדרך מקובלת ו**בתום לב**...\" (An obligation arising out of a contract shall be fulfilled in a customary manner and **in good faith**...)\n            *   This law made good faith a \"super-principle\" of Israeli private law. However, it was enacted in 1973. The Land Law was enacted in 1969.\n\n4.  **Consolidating the Findings and Double-Checking:**\n    *   The term \"good faith\" (תום לב) was used in specific contexts before it was established as a general principle in contract law in 1973.\n    *   The Land Law of 1969 uses the term explicitly in Section 10 regarding acquiring rights in registered land.\n    *   The Movable Property Law of 1971 uses it in a similar \"market overt\" context.\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957 also uses the concept of a \"holder in due course\" which involves taking a bill \"in good faith\". Let's check this one. This ordinance is a \"New Version\" (נוסח חדש) of a Mandate-era law. The question asks about statutes in the *modern State of Israel*. The \"New Version\" laws were re-enactments by the Knesset of mandatory ordinances, with updated Hebrew text but generally preserving the substance. Is this considered a statute that \"introduced\" the concept?\n    *   Let's check the Hebrew text of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957 (פקודת השטרות [נוסח חדש], תשי\"ז-1957). Section 28(b) defines a holder in due course: \"אוחז כשורה הוא אוחז שנטל את השטר...\" and one of the conditions is \"(2) נטל את השטר **בתום-לב** ובעד ערך...\" (He took the bill **in good faith** and for value...).\n    *   So, this ordinance from 1957 *does* contain the explicit phrase \"בתום לב\".\n    *   Now the question is, which came first? The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] from 1957 or the Land Law from 1969?\n    *   1957 is clearly earlier than 1969.\n    *   So, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance is a very strong candidate.\n\n5.  **Refining the Analysis:** What about other laws before 1957?\n    *   I'll quickly check major early statutes. It's unlikely. The major codification efforts started later. The Bills of Exchange Ordinance is one of the earliest \"New Version\" laws consolidating mandatory law into Israeli statutory text.\n    *   Let's consider the nature of the \"New Version\" laws (חוקי נוסח חדש). They were primarily a technical-linguistic project to create a binding Hebrew version of Mandatory ordinances, which were originally in English. While passed by the Knesset, they weren't creating *new* substantive law in the same way the codification laws of the late 60s and 70s were. The question asks which statute *introduced* the concept. One could argue the concept was already present in the Mandatory law and the 1957 ordinance just restated it in Hebrew. However, it *is* a statute of the Knesset and it *does* contain the phrase explicitly. It seems the most plausible interpretation of the question is \"in which Knesset statute did the term first appear?\".\n    *   Let's compare the contenders:\n        *   Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957: Contains \"in good faith\" (בתום לב). Enacted by the Knesset. It's a \"New Version\" of a prior Mandate law.\n        *   Land Law, 1969: Contains \"in good faith\" (בתום לב). An original Israeli codification, replacing prior Ottoman and Mandate law.\n        *   Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973: Famous for making \"good faith\" a general principle.\n    *   Chronologically, the 1957 ordinance is the earliest of these.\n    *   Does \"introduced\" mean \"created for the first time in the Israeli legal system\" or \"appeared for the first time in a statute of the State of Israel\"? Given the wording, \"first statute ... to explicitly introduce\", the latter seems more likely. The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] is a statute (a \"פקודה [נוסח חדש]\" is a form of statute). It was the first of these major laws to explicitly use the Hebrew term \"תום לב\".\n    *   While the concept existed in the English source (\"good faith\"), the 1957 statute is the first *statute of the State of Israel* (passed by the Knesset) to contain the *explicit Hebrew term*. Other original Israeli laws, like the Land Law (1969), came later.\n\n6.  **Structuring the Answer:**\n    *   **Introduction:** State the core of the question: identifying the first Israeli statute explicitly using \"good faith\" (תום לב).\n    *   **Step 1: Common Misconception:** Mention the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973. Explain that while it made the principle famous and universal in contract law, it wasn't the first statute to use the term.\n    *   **Step 2: Exploring Earlier Statutes:** Go through the chronological candidates.\n        *   Mention the laws of the late 1960s, specifically the Land Law, 1969.\n        *   Explain that Section 10 of the Land Law explicitly uses \"in good faith\" (בתום לב) in the context of the \"market overt\" rule for real property. This predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n    *   **Step 3: Identifying the Earliest Statute:** Go further back in time.\n        *   Introduce the \"New Version\" laws (חוקי נוסח חדש), explaining they were official Hebrew restatements of British Mandate ordinances.\n        *   Pinpoint the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] from 1957.\n        *   Specify that Section 28(b) of this ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as one who took the bill, among other things, \"in good faith\" (בתום לב).\n    *   **Step 4: Conclusion:** Conclude that since 1957 precedes 1969 and 1973, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] is the first statute of the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" into its text.\n    *   **Final Answer Formatting:** Ensure the final answer is just the name of the statute, without \"the\" or the year, as requested. The name is \"Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]\".\n\n7.  **Final Review:**\n    *   Question: \"first statute in the modern State of Israel\" - Check. The 1957 ordinance was passed by the Knesset.\n    *   Question: \"to explicitly introduce\" - Check. The term \"בתום-לב\" is in the text.\n    *   Constraint: \"Do not append 'the'\" - Check.\n    *   Constraint: \"or the statute's year\" - Check.\n    *   Constraint: \"Analyze the question step by step\" - Done.\n    *   Constraint: \"list all the careful points\" - Done. (e.g., distinguishing between a general principle and a specific use, the nature of \"New Version\" laws).\n    *   The answer should be \"Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]\". This seems correct and well-supported by the chronological analysis. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A specific legal concept, \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this is \"תום לב\" (tom lev).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The \"modern State of Israel,\" meaning laws passed by the Knesset after its establishment in 1948.\n    *   **Action:** The statute must \"explicitly introduce\" the concept. This means the actual words \"good faith\" or \"בתום לב\" must appear in the text of the law itself, rather than being a later judicial interpretation.\n    *   **Chronology:** We are looking for the *first* such statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis and Common Misconception:**\n    *   Many associate the principle of good faith in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle in private law, particularly in Section 12 (duty of good faith in negotiations) and Section 39 (duty of good faith in the performance of a contract).\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute to use the term, not the one that gave it its broadest application. Therefore, we must look at laws enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation:**\n    *   A significant period of original Israeli codification in private law occurred in the late 1960s. We should examine these statutes.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969 (חוק המקרקעין, תשכ\"ט-1969):** This major piece of legislation contains Section 10, which establishes the \"market overt\" principle for real estate (תקנת השוק במקרקעין). This section protects a person who acquires a right in registered land for consideration, relying on the public registry. A key condition for this protection is that the acquisition must be made **\"in good faith\" (\"בתום-לב\")**. This statute explicitly uses the term and predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   **Movable Property Law, 1971 (חוק המיטלטלין, תשל\"א-1971):** This law also contains a \"market overt\" rule in Section 34, which similarly requires the purchaser to have acted **\"in good faith\" (\"בתום-לב\")**. However, this law was passed in 1971, which is after the Land Law of 1969.\n\n4.  **Searching for an Earlier Instance:**\n    *   Having found an explicit use of the term in 1969, we must now check for any statutes enacted between 1948 and 1969.\n    *   During the first decade of the state, many laws were \"New Version\" statutes (חוקי נוסח חדש). These were not entirely new laws but rather official, binding Hebrew versions of pre-state British Mandate ordinances, re-enacted by the Knesset. While their substance was often preserved, their enactment as Knesset statutes makes them \"statutes of the modern State of Israel\".\n    *   One such law is the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957 (פקודת השטרות [נוסח חדש], תשי\"ז-1957)**. This ordinance replaced the British Mandate's Bills of Exchange Ordinance.\n    *   Section 28(b) of this 1957 statute defines a \"holder in due course\" (אוחז כשורה). One of the essential conditions for a person to qualify as a holder in due course is that he or she \"took the bill **in good faith** and for value...\" (\"נטל את השטר **בתום-לב** ובעד ערך...\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 made \"good faith\" a foundational principle but was not the first to use the term.\n    *   The Land Law of 1969 explicitly used the term \"good faith\".\n    *   However, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] of 1957 also explicitly uses the term \"good faith\".\n    *   Since 1957 predates 1969, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] is the first statute in the modern State of Israel to have explicitly introduced the term \"good faith\" into its text.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The analysis focuses only on statutes that explicitly use the words \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\". Related concepts like \"loyalty\" (נאמנות) in the Agency Law (1965) do not satisfy the query's specific wording.\n*   **\"New Version\" Statutes:** It is important to recognize that a \"New Version\" law, while based on a mandatory ordinance, is itself a statute passed by the Knesset and therefore qualifies as a \"statute in the modern State of Israel\".\n*   **Specific vs. General Principle:** The first use of the term was in a very specific context (holder in due course of a negotiable instrument), not as the general, all-encompassing duty it would later become with the 1973 Contracts Law.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is determined.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
