    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sentence:** The given sentence is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n2.  **Identify the Target Word:** The question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n3.  **Examine the Word's Function in the Sentence:** Let's look at the words immediately around \"Fat\". The word \"Fat\" is followed by the word \"people\".\n4.  **Identify the Part of Speech of the Following Word:** The word \"people\" is a noun, as it refers to a group of persons.\n5.  **Determine the Relationship:** The word \"Fat\" is describing or modifying the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\". Words that describe or modify nouns are called adjectives.\n6.  **Consider the Grammatical Structure:** While the complete sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically awkward and likely incorrect, the phrase \"Fat people\" is a standard grammatical unit. In this unit, \"Fat\" acts as an adjective modifying the noun \"people\".\n7.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Verb: A verb shows an action or state of being. \"Fat\" is not an action in this context.\n    *   B. Noun: While \"fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"body fat\"), in this sentence it is describing the noun \"people\", not acting as a noun itself.\n    *   C. Adjective: An adjective modifies a noun. \"Fat\" modifies the noun \"people\". This is the correct function.\n    *   D. Adverb: An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not modifying a verb like \"eat\".\n    *   E. Conjunction: A conjunction connects words or clauses (e.g., \"and\", \"but\"). \"Fat\" is not a conjunction.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is functioning as an adjective in this sentence.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Do not get confused by the grammatical errors in the latter part of the sentence (\"eat accumulates\"). The part of speech of a word is determined by its function in relation to the words around it.\n*   The relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\" is a clear example of an adjective-noun pair, forming a noun phrase.\n*   Recognize that a single word like \"fat\" can be different parts of speech in different sentences. The key is to analyze its role in the specific sentence provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
