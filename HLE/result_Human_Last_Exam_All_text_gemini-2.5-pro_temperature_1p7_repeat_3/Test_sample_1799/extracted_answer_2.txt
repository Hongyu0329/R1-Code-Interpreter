No, the second postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. The first postulate by itself is ambiguous because it does not specify the transformation rules between inertial frames. Historically, classical mechanics (which follows Galilean transformations) and Maxwell's electromagnetism (which implies a constant speed of light) were in direct conflict. The second postulate is crucial because it resolves this conflict by explicitly stating that the constancy of the speed of light is a fundamental principle, thereby forcing the adoption of the Lorentz transformations instead of the Galilean ones and defining the framework for special relativity.
