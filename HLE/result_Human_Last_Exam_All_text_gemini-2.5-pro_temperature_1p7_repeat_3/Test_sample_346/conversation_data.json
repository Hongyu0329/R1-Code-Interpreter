    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the expression and identify key combinators.**\n\nThe given expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, manageable parts. We first need to understand the definitions of the fundamental combinators:\n*   `I x = x` (Identity)\n*   `K x y = x` (Constant, or Kestrel)\n*   `S f g x = f x (g x)` (Substitution, or Starling)\n\nFrom these, we can define more complex combinators. A particularly important one for Church numerals is the `B` combinator for function composition:\n*   `B f g x = f (g x)`\n*   `B` can be written in terms of S and K as `S(KS)K`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and evaluate the inner components `T1` and `T2`.**\n\nLet's look inside the main expression. We see a recurring sub-expression: `S(S(K(S))(K))`.\nLet's analyze this: `K(S)` is `KS`. So we have `S(S(KS)K)`.\nThis is `S B`. `S B` is a standard definition of the **Successor function (SUCC)** for Church numerals. Let's verify:\n`SUCC n f x = (S B n) f x = (B f (n f)) x = f ((n f) x) = f (n f x)`. This is indeed the successor of `n`.\n\nNow let's define the two main inner branches of the expression:\n*   `T1 = S(S(K(S))(K))(I) = (S B) I = SUCC(I)`\n*   `T2 = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = (S B) (S I I) = SUCC(S I I)`\n\nWe need to know the Church numerals for `I` and `S I I`.\n*   The identity combinator `I` represents the Church numeral **1**. (`I f x = f x`).\n*   The combinator `S I I` represents the Church numeral **2**. Let's verify: `(S I I) f x = (I f (I f)) x = (f f) x`. If we interpret `f f` as composition `f . f` which is applying `f` twice, this gives `f(f(x))`, which is the definition of 2. This is a standard identity.\n\nNow we can evaluate `T1` and `T2`:\n*   `T1 = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n*   `T2 = SUCC(2) = 3`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the outer structure of the expression.**\n\nThe main expression `E` has the form `S(I)(S(I)(X))`, where `X` is the sub-expression `(S(I)(K(T1)))(T2)`.\nLet's analyze the `S(I)` combinator. Applied to a Church numeral `m`, `S I` acts as another successor function:\n`(S I m) f x = (I f (m f)) x = f (m f x) = (SUCC m) f x`.\nSo, `S(I)` is also `SUCC`.\n\nSubstituting this into the main expression, we get:\n`n = SUCC(SUCC(X))`\nwhere `X` is the church numeral represented by `(S(I)(K(T1)))(T2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the intermediate expression X.**\n\nWe substitute the numeral values we found for `T1` and `T2`:\n`X = (S(I)(K(2)))(3)`\nThis is `(SUCC(K 2))` applied to `3`. Let's reduce this expression:\n`X = (S I (K 2)) 3`\nUsing the `S` rule `S f g x = f x (g x)`:\n`X = I 3 ((K 2) 3)`\nUsing the `I` rule `I x = x` and `K` rule `K x y = x`:\n`X = 3 (2)`\nSo `X` is the Church numeral that results from applying numeral `3` to numeral `2`.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the application of one Church numeral to another.**\n\nThe application of a Church numeral `e` to another Church numeral `b`, written `e b`, corresponds to **exponentiation `b^e`**.\nLet's verify: `e b` means `b` is treated as the function to be applied `e` times. The numeral `b` as a function applies its argument function `b` times. So `(b . b)` applies it `b*b` times. Applying `b` as a function `e` times results in a composition corresponding to the number `b^e`.\nIn our case, `X = 3 2`, so `e=3` and `b=2`.\n`X` is the church numeral for `2^3 = 8`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final value of n.**\n\nWe substitute the value of `X` back into the expression for `n`:\n`n = SUCC(SUCC(X)) = SUCC(SUCC(8))`\n`SUCC(8) = 9`\n`SUCC(9) = 10`\nSo, the Church numeral `n` is **10**.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(10)`\n\nThis is the final numerical value. It is an irrational number, approximately 3.3219.\n\n`log_2(10) â‰ˆ 3.321928`\n\nThe result is not an integer, which is unusual for such problems, but the derivation from standard combinator identities is sound.\n\n<<<3.321928>>>"
