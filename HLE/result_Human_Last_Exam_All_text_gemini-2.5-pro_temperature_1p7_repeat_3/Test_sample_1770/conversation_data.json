    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the gene that should be knocked out in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The engineered *C. glutamicum* strain successfully produces p-coumaric acid, but the cell's natural metabolic machinery is breaking it down, reducing the final yield. This process is known as product degradation or catabolism.\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy:** The most direct way to prevent this degradation is to identify the metabolic pathway responsible for it and disable it. In genetic engineering, this is typically achieved by \"knocking out\" (deleting or inactivating) the gene that codes for the first enzyme in that specific pathway.\n3.  **Investigate the Catabolic Pathway:** We need to find out how *Corynebacterium glutamicum* naturally degrades p-coumaric acid. This organism can use various aromatic compounds, including p-coumaric acid, as a carbon and energy source. Research into its metabolism reveals a specific degradation route.\n4.  **Identify the First Enzymatic Step:** The degradation of aromatic acids like p-coumaric acid and the related ferulic acid in *C. glutamicum* begins with an \"activation\" step. The cell attaches a Coenzyme A (CoA) molecule to the p-coumaric acid. This reaction converts **p-coumaric acid** into its corresponding thioester, **p-coumaroyl-CoA**.\n5.  **Identify the Key Enzyme and Gene:** The enzyme responsible for catalyzing this first, crucial step is a CoA ligase. Specifically for this pathway in *C. glutamicum*, the enzyme is called **Feruloyl-CoA synthetase**. Although its name comes from its activity on ferulic acid, it has broad substrate specificity and is also the primary enzyme that acts on p-coumaric acid to initiate its degradation. The gene that encodes this enzyme in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* is designated as **`fcs`**.\n6.  **Conclusion of the Strategy:** By knocking out the `fcs` gene, the cell loses the ability to produce Feruloyl-CoA synthetase. Without this enzyme, it can no longer perform the first step of converting p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA. The degradation pathway is effectively blocked at its entry point, causing the synthetically produced p-coumaric acid to accumulate in the cell or the medium instead of being consumed.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Targeting the First Step:** It is critical to target the very first enzyme of the degradation pathway. Blocking a later step could cause the accumulation of an intermediate metabolite (like p-coumaroyl-CoA), which might be toxic to the cell or inhibit other essential pathways.\n*   **Gene Specificity:** The gene `fcs` is specific to *C. glutamicum* and related bacteria. Different organisms (like *E. coli* or *Pseudomonas*) would have different genes for the same function.\n*   **Pleiotropic Effects:** Deleting a gene can sometimes have unintended side effects on the cell's overall health and metabolism (pleiotropy). In this case, the main effect would be the inability to grow on p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid as a carbon source, which is an acceptable trade-off for producing the desired chemical.\n*   **Knockout vs. Knockdown:** A gene knockout (complete deletion) is generally preferred over a knockdown (reduction in expression) for industrial strains to ensure stable and complete blockage of the pathway over many generations.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Problem:** p-coumaric acid is being degraded.\n2.  **Mechanism:** The degradation starts with the conversion of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA.\n3.  **Enzyme:** The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is Feruloyl-CoA synthetase.\n4.  **Gene:** The gene encoding this enzyme in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* is `fcs`.\n5.  **Solution:** Knocking out the `fcs` gene will prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n\n<<<fcs>>>"
