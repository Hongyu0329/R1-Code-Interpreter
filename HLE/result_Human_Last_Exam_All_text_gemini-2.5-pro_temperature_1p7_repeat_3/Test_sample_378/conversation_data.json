    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the core of the question:** The user is asking for the specific year when a person named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Identify the individual:** The name \"Goodluck Ebele... Jonathan\" clearly refers to Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.\n\n3.  **Fact-check the name:** The critical part of the question is the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his name. We must verify if \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's official or commonly used name.\n    *   His full, officially recognized name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n    *   The name **Azikiwe** is famously associated with another prominent Nigerian leader, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n\n4.  **Search for evidence of identification:** The next step is to search for any public record, speech, interview, or official document where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan might have adopted the name \"Azikiwe\" or publicly identified himself as such, perhaps as a nickname or in an honorary context.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the findings:** A thorough review of reliable sources (such as official biographies, news archives, and historical records) shows no evidence of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name or identifying himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" The two names belong to two different individuals who were both presidents of Nigeria at different times.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of the Premise:** The fundamental assumption in the question is that Goodluck Jonathan's name includes \"Azikiwe\". This premise is incorrect.\n*   **Distinction Between Two Leaders:** It is crucial to distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are separate historical figures.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The lack of a specific year is not due to a gap in information, but rather because the event described in the question never occurred.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nSince \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name and there is no public record of him ever identifying himself by that name, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that never happened. The question is based on a factual error.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His name does not include Azikiwe, which is the name of Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe. Therefore, the event described in the question never occurred.>>>"
