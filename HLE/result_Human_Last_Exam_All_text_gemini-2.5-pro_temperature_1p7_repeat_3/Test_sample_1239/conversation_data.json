    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we have set the density $\\rho=1$ for simplicity, as it can be absorbed into the pressure term. The independent variables are time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The dependent variables are the velocity components $\\mathbf{u}=(u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure $p$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the concept of a Lie group of symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries for a system of differential equations is a group of continuous transformations of both independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters defining these transformations, which is equal to the dimension of the associated Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators. We find these generators using the infinitesimal method.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the infinitesimal generators\n\nThe standard procedure involves finding the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of the form:\n$X = \\xi^t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\xi^{x_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\eta^{u_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} + \\eta^p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$\nBy requiring that the prolongation of this generator annihilates the Navier-Stokes equations on their solution manifold, one can derive a set of determining equations for the coefficients $\\xi$ and $\\eta$. Solving these equations yields the complete set of symmetry generators.\n\nThis is a well-established result in the literature on symmetry analysis of differential equations. The full Lie algebra of point symmetries is infinite-dimensional. However, the question \"What is the dimension...\" usually implies a finite number, which conventionally refers to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra that does not involve arbitrary functions.\n\nLet's list the generators of this finite-dimensional part, which correspond to fundamental physical principles.\n\n1.  **Time translation** (1 generator): The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under time shifts $t' = t + \\epsilon$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$. Dimension: 1.\n\n2.  **Space translations** (3 generators): The equations are invariant in a homogeneous space, so they are symmetric under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$. Dimension: 3.\n\n3.  **Spatial rotations** (3 generators): The equations are invariant in an isotropic space, so they are symmetric under rotations $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, which also rotate the vector field $\\mathbf{u}'=R\\mathbf{u}$.\n    *   Generators: $J_{ij} = x_i \\partial_{x_j} - x_j \\partial_{x_i} + u_i \\partial_{u_j} - u_j \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i<j$. Dimension: 3.\n\n4.  **Galilean boosts** (3 generators): These reflect Galilean relativity, i.e., invariance when shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon t \\mathbf{v}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{v}$.\n    *   Generators: $G_i = t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$. Dimension: 3.\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation)** (1 generator): The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of all variables. If we set $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1}\\mathbf{u}, p' = \\lambda^{-2}p$, the equations remain unchanged. This gives rise to one generator.\n    *   Generator: $D = 2t\\partial_t + x_k\\partial_{x_k} - u_k\\partial_{u_k} - 2p\\partial_p$. Dimension: 1.\n\n6.  **Constant pressure shift** (1 generator): Since the pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient $\\nabla p$ in the momentum equation, shifting it by a constant value $p' = p + \\epsilon c$ leaves the equation invariant. The incompressibility condition is unaffected as it does not involve $p$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$. Dimension: 1.\n\n### Step 4: The infinite-dimensional part\n\nThe full symmetry algebra is infinite-dimensional. This arises because there are symmetries involving arbitrary functions of time. For example:\n*   **Pressure gauge freedom:** $p' = p + f(t)$ for any arbitrary function $f(t)$. The generator is $f(t)\\partial_p$. The constant pressure shift is the special case where $f(t)$ is a constant.\n*   **Projective symmetries:** Transformations to an arbitrarily accelerating reference frame, indexed by an arbitrary vector function $\\mathbf{g}(t)$, also form a class of symmetries.\n\nThese infinite-dimensional symmetries are often considered \"gauge\" freedoms and may be eliminated by imposing physical boundary conditions (e.g., that the velocity and pressure fields vanish at infinity). The question, as phrased, refers to the intrinsic symmetries of the PDE system itself. In such cases, it is standard practice to report the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries which does not depend on arbitrary functions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final dimension\n\nSumming the dimensions of the independent finite-parameter generators gives the dimension of this core Lie group of symmetries.\n*   Dimension = (Time translation) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling) + (Pressure shift)\n*   Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nThe resulting 12-parameter Lie group represents the fundamental symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations."
