    "Answering this question requires a deep dive into the structure of finite classical groups, specifically the projective special unitary group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group and the Question**\n\n*   **The Group:** We are working with `G = PSU(4, 997)`.\n    *   `U(n, q)` is the general unitary group of dimension `n` over the field `F_{q^2}`. It consists of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in `F_{q^2}` that preserve a non-degenerate Hermitian form, which is equivalent to the condition `A * A^* = I`, where `A^*` is the conjugate transpose (each entry replaced by its `q`-th power, then transposed).\n    *   `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group, a subgroup of `U(n, q)` containing matrices with determinant 1.\n    *   `PSU(n, q)` is the projective special unitary group, obtained by taking `SU(n, q)` and factoring out its center, `Z(SU(n, q))`.\n    *   In our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`. The field is `F_{997^2}`. Note that `q = 997` is an odd prime.\n\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the number of **involutions** in `PSU(4, 997)`.\n    *   An involution in a group is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` (the identity element) and `x ≠ 1`.\n\n**2. Lifting the Problem from PSU to SU**\n\nAn element `[g]` in `PSU(4, q) = SU(4, q) / Z(SU(4, q))` is an involution if `[g]^2 = [I]` and `[g] ≠ [I]`.\n*   `[g]^2 = [g^2] = [I]` means that `g^2` must be in the center, `Z(SU(4, q))`.\n*   `[g] ≠ [I]` means that `g` itself is not in the center.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of cosets `gZ` where `g ∈ SU(4, q) \\ Z(SU(4, q))` and `g^2 ∈ Z(SU(4, q))`.\n\n**3. Determine the Center of SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe center of `SU(n, q)`, denoted `Z(SU(n, q))`, consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that:\n1.  `λI ∈ SU(n, q)`. This means `det(λI) = λ^n = 1` and `(λI)(λI)^* = λI * λ^q I = λ^(q+1) I = I`. So `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n2.  Therefore, `λ` must be an element in `F_{q^2}` satisfying `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. This means `λ` must satisfy `λ^d = 1` where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\nThe order of the center is `|Z(SU(n, q))| = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor our group `SU(4, 997)`:\n*   `n = 4`\n*   `q = 997`, so `q+1 = 998`.\n*   `|Z(SU(4, 997))| = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n\nThe center has two elements. Since `(-1)^4 = 1` and `(-1)^(997+1) = (-1)^998 = 1`, the scalar matrix `-I` is in the center. Thus, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}`.\n\n**4. Classify Pre-images of Involutions in SU(4, 997)**\n\nFrom Step 2, we need to find elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}` and `g ∉ {I, -I}`. This leads to two cases for `g`:\n*   **Case 1:** `g^2 = I` (`g` is an involution in `SU`).\n*   **Case 2:** `g^2 = -I` (`g` is an element of order 4 in `SU`).\n\n**5. Analysis of Case 1: Involutions in SU(4, q)**\n\nAn involution `g ∈ SU(4, q)` (since the characteristic is not 2) is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues must be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   The matrix `g` corresponds to an orthogonal decomposition of the vector space `V = V_1 ⊥ V_{-1}`, where `V_1` and `V_{-1}` are the eigenspaces for `+1` and `-1`, respectively. Let `k = dim(V_1)`. Then `dim(V_{-1}) = 4-k`.\n*   The condition `g ∈ SU(4, q)` means `det(g) = 1`. The determinant is `(1)^k * (-1)^(4-k)`. For this to be `1`, the exponent `4-k` must be even.\n*   Possible values for `k`:\n    *   `k=0`: `g=-I`. This element is in the center, so its image in `PSU` is the identity. We exclude it.\n    *   `k=1`: `4-k=3` (odd). `det(g)=-1`. Not in `SU`.\n    *   `k=2`: `4-k=2` (even). `det(g)=1`. These are valid involutions and are not central.\n    *   `k=3`: `4-k=1` (odd). `det(g)=-1`. Not in `SU`.\n    *   `k=4`: `g=I`. This is the identity, not an involution.\n\nSo, we only need to count the elements `g` with two `+1` eigenvalues and two `-1` eigenvalues. These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. The size of this class is `|SU(4, q)| / |C(g)|`, where `C(g)` is the centralizer of `g` in `SU(4, q)`.\n*   The centralizer in `U(4, q)` of such an element is isomorphic to `U(2, q) × U(2, q)`.\n*   The size of the conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)` is given by the formula: `|U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2`.\n    *   Using the standard formulas for the orders of unitary groups:\n        `|U(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n    *   `|U(4,q)| = q^6 (q - (-1))(q^2 - 1)(q^3 - (-1)^3)(q^4 - 1) = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n    *   `|U(2,q)| = q (q - (-1))(q^2 - 1) = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\n*   The number of such involutions is:\n    `N_1 = |U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2 = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n    `= [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2]`\n    `= q^4 (q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`\n\nEach involution `[g]` in `PSU` corresponds to a coset `gZ = {g, -g}`. Since `g` and `-g` are in the same conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)` (one can be transformed into the other by swapping the `V_1` and `V_{-1}` eigenspaces), the set of `N_1` involutions is partitioned into `N_1 / 2` pairs.\n*   Number of involutions in `PSU` from this case: `(1/2) * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**6. Analysis of Case 2: Elements `g` with `g^2 = -I`**\n\nLet `g` be an element in `U(n, q)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n*   The eigenvalues `λ` of `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\n*   A fundamental property of any element in `U(n, q)` is that its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy the relation `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n*   Combining these conditions, we must have `(λ^2)^{(q+1)/2} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2} = 1`.\n*   This can only be true if the exponent `(q+1)/2` is an even integer. This means `q+1` must be a multiple of 4.\n\nLet's check this condition for our group with `q = 997`:\n*   `q+1 = 997 + 1 = 998`.\n*   `q+1 = 2 * 499`.\n*   Since 499 is odd, `q+1` is not a multiple of 4.\n*   Therefore, the condition `(-1)^{(q+1)/2} = 1` is not satisfied. It is `-1 = 1`, a contradiction.\n\nThis means there are **no** elements `g` in `U(4, 997)` (and thus none in `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`. This case contributes zero involutions to `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the number derived from Case 1.\n*   Number of involutions = `(1/2) * q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`\n*   Substituting `q = 997`:\n*   Number = `(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)`\n\nThis formula gives the exact number of involutions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of involutions is given by the formula `(1/2) * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)` where `q=997`.\n\n<<<(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)>>>"
