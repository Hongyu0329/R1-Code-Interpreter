The proposed filtering strategy involves four main steps implemented within a bioinformatics pipeline.

**Step 1: Perform Paired Differential Expression (DE) Analysis.**
Use a tool like DESeq2 to compare the `CAR_only` samples against the `CAR_IL15` samples. Crucially, use a paired design formula (e.g., `~ donor + condition`) to account for the donor-to-donor variability. Ensure the comparison is set up such that a positive log2 fold change (LFC) indicates higher expression in the `CAR_only` group.

**Step 2: Identify Contaminant Genes via Stringent Filtering.**
From the DE results table, identify genes that are highly likely to be contaminants by applying a two-part filter:
1.  **High Positive Log2 Fold Change:** Select genes with a `log2FoldChange > 5`. This strict threshold targets genes with at least a 32-fold higher expression in the `CAR_only` samples, which is characteristic of contamination by a different cell type rather than a true biological difference in T cells.
2.  **High Statistical Significance:** Select genes with an `adjusted p-value < 0.01` to ensure the observed difference is robust and consistent across all four donor pairs.
These two filters can be implemented with a single command-line script (e.g., using `awk`) to parse the DE results file and create a list of contaminant gene IDs.

**Step 3: Verify the Contaminant Gene List.**
Before removing genes, perform a sanity check. Manually inspect the top genes on the generated list by looking up their function in public databases (like GeneCards). Confirm that they are markers associated with the cancer cell type used in the co-culture and not essential T-cell genes. This step ensures the filtering logic is correct.

**Step 4: Filter the Raw Count Matrix.**
Use the finalized list of contaminant genes to create a clean count matrix. This can be done on the command line using `grep` with the `-v` (invert match), `-w` (whole word), and `-f` (pattern file) flags to remove the rows corresponding to the contaminant genes from your original count matrix file. The resulting filtered count matrix can then be used for all subsequent downstream analyses (PCA, GSEA, etc.).
