    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a phonological rule in the history of English, primarily active during the Middle English period. The rule states that a long vowel becomes short (lax) when it is in the first syllable of a three-syllable word (or a word with more than three syllables). More formally, the vowel is in an \"antepenultimate\" syllable (the third syllable from the end) or earlier.\n\nA classic example is the pair `sane` /seɪn/ and `sanity` /ˈsænɪti/.\n- `sane` has a long vowel sound (/eɪ/).\n- When we add the suffix `-ity`, the word becomes three syllables (`san-i-ty`).\n- The long vowel of `sane` is now in the first of three syllables.\n- Trisyllabic laxing applies, shortening the vowel from /eɪ/ to its short counterpart, /æ/.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word from the list, considering its root word and syllable structure to see if this rule has applied.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    - **Related Word:** `south` /saʊθ/. The vowel sound in `south` comes from the Middle English long vowel /uː/ (pronounced \"oo\").\n    - **Analysis:** The word `southern` derives from Old English *sūþerne*, which was a three-syllable word (*sū-þer-ne*). The long vowel `ū` was in the first of three syllables, causing it to shorten to a short `u`. This short `u` later developed into the modern /ʌ/ sound.\n    - **Conclusion:** `southern` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    - **Related Word:** `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/. The stressed vowel is a long diphthong /aɪ/ (from Middle English long `i`).\n    - **Analysis:** When suffixes are added to create `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), a four-syllable word, the vowel shortens to /ɪ/. The vowel is in the second syllable, but it is followed by two more syllables (`-a-tive`), fulfilling the condition for laxing.\n    - **Conclusion:** `derivative` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    - **Related Word:** `serene` /səˈriːn/. The stressed vowel is a long /iː/.\n    - **Analysis:** Adding the suffix `-ity` creates the four-syllable word `serenity` (/səˈrɛnɪti/). The long /iː/ shortens to its lax counterpart, /ɛ/. The vowel is followed by two more syllables (`-i-ty`).\n    - **Conclusion:** `serenity` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    - **Related Word:** `please` /pliːz/. The vowel is a long /iː/.\n    - **Analysis:** In the word `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/), the vowel is short (/ɛ/). However, `pleasant` is a two-syllable word (`pleas-ant`). The shortening is not caused by the trisyllabic rule but by another rule called **pre-cluster shortening**, where a long vowel shortens before a consonant cluster (here, `-sant`).\n    - **Conclusion:** `pleasant` has undergone vowel shortening, but it **has not** undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because it is not a three-syllable word.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    - **Related Latin Root:** `grātus` (meaning \"grateful\"), which had a long `ā`. This morpheme appears with a long vowel sound /eɪ/ in the related English word `grateful`.\n    - **Analysis:** `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) is a three-syllable word. Its first vowel /æ/ is short. This is parallel to the `sane`/`sanity` example, where the morpheme's underlying long vowel is shortened due to the trisyllabic structure.\n    - **Conclusion:** `gratitude` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    - **Related Word:** `shade` /ʃeɪd/. The vowel is a long /eɪ/.\n    - **Analysis:** `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/) has a short vowel /æ/. However, like `pleasant`, `shadow` is a two-syllable word (`shad-ow`). Therefore, it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. Furthermore, historically, `shade` and `shadow` come from different inflectional forms of the same Old English word. `shade` comes from `sceadu` (which had a long vowel), while `shadow` comes from `sceadwe` (which already had a short vowel). Therefore, the vowel in the word `shadow` was never long in its direct line of development, so it couldn't have been shortened.\n    - **Conclusion:** `shadow` **has not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the \"No\" Cases and Finalize the Answer\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` have not undergone trisyllabic laxing because they are disyllabic words. However, `shadow` is arguably the better answer for a subtle reason:\n- The root of `pleasant` (`please`) has a long vowel that was indeed shortened in the derived form, just by a different rule.\n- The direct ancestor of `shadow` never had a long vowel to begin with; it inherited a short vowel. So not only did it not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, it did not undergo this type of laxing at all. It was never a candidate for the process.\n\nGiven the clear etymological history, `shadow` is the most definitive example of a word on the list that has not been affected by trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
