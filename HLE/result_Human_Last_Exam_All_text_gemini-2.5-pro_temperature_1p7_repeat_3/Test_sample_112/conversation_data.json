    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside *Sir Launfal*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific version of *Sir Launfal* and its manuscript.** The question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre around the late 14th century. This poem is preserved in a single surviving manuscript: **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is held in the British Library. This is a famous composite manuscript, or miscellany, meaning it contains several different literary works bound together.\n\n2.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.** To find the \"book of manners,\" we need to know what other texts are in this manuscript alongside *Sir Launfal*. This manuscript contains a number of significant works, including the longer version of Layamon's *Brut* and the poem *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n3.  **Identify the text that fits the description \"book of manners\".** A \"book of manners\" is a piece of courtesy literature, a text that teaches etiquette and proper social conduct. Within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is a short didactic poem specifically designed to teach children proper behavior, particularly table manners.\n\n4.  **Name the specific book of manners.** This instructional poem is known as **_The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke_**. It is a prime example of a medieval courtesy book, providing rules on how to behave politely in society.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Manuscript:** The entire answer hinges on identifying the correct manuscript, as poems and texts were often copied into different collections. *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre is uniquely preserved in Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n*   **Definition of \"Book of Manners\":** This term refers to the genre of courtesy literature, which was popular in the Middle Ages. These texts were not necessarily long books but could be short poems, like the one found in this manuscript.\n*   **Title Variations:** Medieval texts often lack a single, official title. _The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke_ is the most common modern title for this work, derived from its content and opening lines. It might also be referred to simply as a \"courtesy poem.\"\n*   **Context:** The presence of a romance like *Sir Launfal* and a book of manners in the same collection shows how ideas of courtly behavior, adventure, and social etiquette were interconnected in the medieval mind.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe poem *Sir Launfal* is found in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii. This same manuscript also contains a medieval courtesy poem, or \"book of manners,\" intended to instruct children on proper conduct. This work is known as _The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke_.\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
