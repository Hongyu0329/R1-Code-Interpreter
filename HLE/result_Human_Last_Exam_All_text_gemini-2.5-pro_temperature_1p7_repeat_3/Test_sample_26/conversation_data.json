    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object X**\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by the vanishing of a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   Since the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ has complex dimension 3, $X$ is a complex submanifold of dimension 2. This means $X$ is a complex surface.\n*   As a real manifold, $X$ has dimension 4.\n*   The condition \"smooth\" means that $X$ is a smooth manifold.\n*   We want to find the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$, which is the dimension of the vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the low-dimensional homotopy and homology groups of X**\nTo understand $\\pi_3(X)$, we first need information about the lower homotopy groups and the homology of $X$.\n\n*   **Fundamental Group $\\pi_1(X)$:** The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for hypersurfaces states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of complex dimension $n-1 \\ge 1$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n    In our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so the ambient dimension is $n=3$. The theorem applies for $k < 3-1=2$.\n    For $k=1$, we get $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n*   **Homology Groups $H_k(X)$:** Since $X$ is a compact oriented 4-manifold, its Betti numbers $b_k = \\mathrm{rank}(H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$ satisfy PoincarÃ© duality: $b_0=b_4$ and $b_1=b_3$.\n    *   $X$ is connected, so $b_0(X) = 1$. By duality, $b_4(X)=1$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ (which is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$) is also zero. So, $b_1(X)=0$. By duality, $b_3(X)=0$.\n    *   To find $b_2(X)$, we can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^4 (-1)^i b_i = b_0-b_1+b_2-b_3+b_4 = 1-0+b_2-0+1 = 2+b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is given by the formula:\n        $\\chi(X_d) = \\frac{1}{d} [ (1-d)^{n+1} - 1] + n+1$.\n    *   For our case, $d=5$ and $n=3$:\n        $\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{5} [ (1-5)^{3+1} - 1] + 3+1 = \\frac{1}{5} [(-4)^4 - 1] + 4 = \\frac{1}{5}[256 - 1] + 4 = \\frac{255}{5} + 4 = 51+4 = 55$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $2+b_2 = 55$, which implies $b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   For simply connected algebraic surfaces like $X$, the integral homology groups $H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ are known to be torsion-free. Thus, we have:\n        $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n        $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n        $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$\n        $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n        $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Step 3: Relate Homotopy and Homology Groups**\nNow we use tools from algebraic topology to connect homology to the homotopy groups we want.\n\n*   **Second Homotopy Group $\\pi_2(X)$:** The Hurewicz theorem states that if a space $Y$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(Y)=0$), then the Hurewicz map $h_2: \\pi_2(Y) \\to H_2(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism.\n    Since we found $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we can apply this theorem to $X$:\n    $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n*   **Third Homotopy Group $\\pi_3(X)$:** For a simply connected space $Y$, J.H.C. Whitehead established a fundamental relationship between $\\pi_3(Y)$, $\\pi_2(Y)$, and $H_3(Y)$ via a short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\Gamma(\\pi_2(Y)) \\to \\pi_3(Y) \\to H_3(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$\n    Here, $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n    This sequence tells us that $\\pi_3(Y)$ is an extension of $H_3(Y)$ by the group $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(Y))$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\nThe rank of a group in a short exact sequence is additive. From the sequence above, we have:\n$\\mathrm{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\mathrm{rank}(\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))) + \\mathrm{rank}(H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$\n\nLet's calculate the two ranks on the right side:\n*   $\\mathrm{rank}(H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})) = b_3(X) = 0$.\n*   $\\mathrm{rank}(\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)))$: The group $\\pi_2(X)$ is a free abelian group of rank 53 (i.e., $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$). For a free abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$, the group $\\Gamma(A)$ is also a free abelian group, and its rank is given by the formula:\n    $\\mathrm{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^n)) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n    In our case, $n = \\mathrm{rank}(\\pi_2(X)) = 53$.\n    $\\mathrm{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})) = \\frac{53(53+1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\cdot 54}{2} = 53 \\cdot 27$.\n    Calculating the product: $53 \\times 27 = 1431$.\n\nCombining these results, we get the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$:\n$\\mathrm{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1431 + 0 = 1431$."
