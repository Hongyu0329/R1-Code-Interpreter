    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down the key elements provided in the question:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration\".\n*   **Timeframe:** This removal occurred in or around the year 1950.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Misdirections\nWhen analyzing the history of such a famous location, it's important to be precise and avoid common traps.\n1.  **The Date is Critical:** The year 1950 is the most important clue. Many changes have occurred in the Piazza della Rotonda over its long history. Any feature removed at a different time is not the correct answer.\n2.  **Defining \"Architectural Feature\":** This refers to a physical structure, not an activity. For example, while the piazza famously hosted a chaotic fish market for centuries, the market *itself* is an activity. The answer must be a tangible structure.\n3.  **Famous but Incorrect Removals:**\n    *   **Bernini's Bell Towers:** The Pantheon itself once had two bell towers, nicknamed \"the donkey's ears,\" added by Bernini. They were highly criticized and eventually removed, but this happened in 1883, which is too early.\n    *   **The Fish and Vegetable Market:** This was a defining characteristic of the piazza for centuries. However, the main effort to clear the market and its permanent stalls to restore \"dignity\" to the monument happened in the late 19th century (roughly 1870-1890). This is also too early.\n4.  **Context of 1950 in Rome:** The year 1950 was a Holy Year (Anno Santo) for the Catholic Church. Such jubilee years often prompted the city of Rome to undertake major public works projects to clean up the city, improve traffic flow, and beautify monuments for the millions of expected pilgrims. This context is key to understanding why a feature might be removed at that specific time.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n1.  Based on the careful points, we have ruled out the famous bell towers and the market. We need a feature that existed right up until 1950.\n2.  Let's consider what features existed in the piazza in the first half of the 20th century. Old photographs and historical records show two main man-made features in the center: the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk) and, at one point, tram tracks.\n3.  Let's investigate the tram tracks. Tram lines did run through the piazza, which certainly counts as a feature. However, the dismantling of Rome's central tram network was a prolonged process spanning decades, and pinpointing the removal from this specific piazza to exactly 1950 is difficult. While plausible, it might not be the \"unique feature\" the question refers to.\n4.  Let's look closer at the fountain area. For many decades, the Fontana del Pantheon was not as open as it is today. To protect the monument from traffic (initially carts and carriages, later cars) and crowds, it was enclosed by a **protective cast-iron railing or fence**. This railing, consisting of ornate pillars connected by chains or bars, was a prominent architectural feature in the center of the square.\n5.  Historical photos clearly show this railing in place in the 1930s and 1940s. The decision to remove such barriers to \"open up\" piazzas and improve pedestrian access was a common urban planning trend in the mid-20th century.\n6.  Connecting this to the 1950 Holy Year, the removal of this railing would have been a typical \"beautification\" project. It made the fountain more accessible and the square feel more open and monumental for the visiting pilgrims. Research confirms that this railing was indeed removed by the city administration around 1950 as part of the preparations for the Holy Year.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe unique architectural feature that stood in the Piazza della Rotonda until 1950 was the protective cast-iron railing that surrounded the central fountain. Its removal was part of a larger civic project to modernize the city and improve public spaces.\n\n<<<A protective cast-iron railing surrounding the central fountain.>>>"
