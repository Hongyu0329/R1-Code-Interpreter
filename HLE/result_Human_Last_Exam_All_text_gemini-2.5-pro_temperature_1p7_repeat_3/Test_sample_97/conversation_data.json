    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system:** We are dealing with the dissolution of solid aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water.\n2.  **Recognize multiple equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ is not a simple one-step process. Two key reactions occur simultaneously, affecting the overall solubility:\n    *   **Dissolution to form Al³⁺ ions:** This is the standard solubility product equilibrium.\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n    *   **Formation of a complex ion:** Dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. This reaction consumes hydroxide and further dissolves the solid Al(OH)₃.\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n3.  **Define Solubility (S):** The molar solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n4.  **Consider all sources of ions:** In pure water, we must also account for the autoionization of water, which establishes an equilibrium between H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)\n5.  **The Charge Balance Principle:** For any ionic solution, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge to maintain electrical neutrality. This principle provides a rigorous mathematical relationship connecting all the ion concentrations.\n    *   Positive ions in the system: Al³⁺, H⁺\n    *   Negative ions in the system: OH⁻, Al(OH)₄⁻\n    *   The charge balance equation is: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = 1[Al(OH)₄⁻] + 1[OH⁻]\n6.  **Simplification Strategy:** Solving the full charge balance equation can be very complex. The key is to estimate the relative magnitudes of the terms in the equation to see if a valid simplification can be made.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Express all ion concentrations in terms of [OH⁻].**\nWe use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate each concentration to the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻].\n\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], it's useful to first find the constant for the reaction Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq). This constant, let's call it K_c, is the product of K_sp and K_f.\n    K_c = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n    From this, K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻], so:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × [OH⁻]\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n3 * ( (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³ ) + ( (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / [OH⁻] ) = (5.83 × 10⁴) × [OH⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the charge balance equation.**\nThis equation is a high-order polynomial. Let's make an assumption that the solution is near neutral (pH ≈ 7, so [OH⁻] ≈ 10⁻⁷ M) and check the magnitude of each term.\n*   3[Al³⁺] ≈ 3 * (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (10⁻⁷)³ = 1.59 × 10⁻⁵ M\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 10⁻⁷ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ (5.83 × 10⁴) * (10⁻⁷) = 5.83 × 10⁻³ M\n*   [OH⁻] ≈ 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing the terms:\n*   On the left side: 3[Al³⁺] (1.59 × 10⁻⁵) >> [H⁺] (10⁻⁷)\n*   On the right side: [Al(OH)₄⁻] (5.83 × 10⁻³) >> [OH⁻] (10⁻⁷)\nTherefore, we can make the excellent approximation that the two largest terms are approximately equal:\n3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Solve the simplified equation for [OH⁻].**\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_sp × K_f) * [OH⁻]\n*Cancel K_sp from both sides:*\n3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]\n*Rearrange to solve for [OH⁻]:*\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 × 10³¹) = 2.727 × 10⁻³¹\n[OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 × 10⁻³¹)¹ᐟ⁴ ≈ 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations needed for the solubility.\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp × K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) * (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = (0.444 × 10⁻³) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 1.774 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, based on the given constants:\nS = 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
