    "An analysis of the question of how many pieces are needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Step 1: Understand How Numbers are Represented in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n\nIn red-blue Hackenbush, the value of a game position can be a dyadic rational number (a number of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$). A positive value favors the Left player (Red), and a negative value favors the Right player (Blue).\n\nThe value of a game that is a \"disjoint sum\" (components are not connected to each other, except to the ground) is the sum of the values of its components. We can represent a number by expressing it as a sum or difference of simpler numbers (specifically, signed powers of 2) and then constructing a game for each term and placing them side-by-side.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Canonical Game Constructions for Powers of 2\n\nWe need a standard way to construct games for values of the form $\\pm 2^k$.\n\n*   **Positive Integer Powers ($2^k$, for $k \\ge 0$):** A game with value $2^k$ can be constructed from $2^k$ red edges, each connected to the ground. For $k=0$, the value is $2^0=1$, which is represented by a single red edge. This construction requires $2^k$ pieces.\n*   **Negative Integer Powers ($-2^k$, for $k \\ge 0$):** Similarly, a game with value $-2^k$ is constructed from $2^k$ blue edges. This requires $2^k$ pieces.\n*   **Positive Fractional Powers ($2^{-j}$, for $j > 0$):** A game for $1/2^j$ can be built from a single red edge connected to the ground, with $j$ blue edges all connected to the top of that red edge. This construction requires $1$ red edge and $j$ blue edges, for a total of $j+1$ pieces.\n    *   Let's verify this: For $j=1$, we have a blue edge on a red edge. Left's move (cutting the red edge) results in a value of 0. Right's move (cutting the blue edge) leaves a single red edge, which has a value of 1. The game's value is $\\{0|1\\} = 1/2$. For $j=2$, Right's move leaves the game for $1/2$, so the value is $\\{0|1/2\\}=1/4$. This construction is correct.\n*   **Negative Fractional Powers ($-2^{-j}$, for $j > 0$):** A game for $-1/2^j$ is the \"negative\" of the game for $1/2^j$, meaning all red and blue pieces are swapped. It consists of a single blue edge connected to the ground, with $j$ red edges connected to its top. This also requires $j+1$ pieces.\n\n### Step 3: Find an Optimal Expansion of the Number $\\frac{13}{16}$\n\nOur goal is to express $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of the form $\\sum c_i 2^{p_i}$ (where $c_i = \\pm 1$) such that the total number of pieces is minimized. The number of pieces for each term $\\pm 2^p$ is $2^p$ if $p \\ge 0$ and $1-p$ if $p<0$.\n\nWe will consider two common expansions for the numerator, 13.\n\n**Expansion 1: Standard Binary Representation**\nFirst, write $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n$13_{10} = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1101_2$.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1101_2}{10000_2} = 0.1101_2$.\nThis corresponds to the sum:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = 2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + 2^{-4}$.\n\nNow we calculate the total number of pieces for this expansion:\n*   Pieces for $1/2$ ($j=1$): $1+1 = 2$ pieces.\n*   Pieces for $1/4$ ($j=2$): $2+1 = 3$ pieces.\n*   Pieces for $1/16$ ($j=4$): $4+1 = 5$ pieces.\n*   Total pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\n**Expansion 2: Non-Adjacent Form (NAF)**\nThe NAF representation minimizes the number of non-zero digits in a signed-digit binary representation. This often leads to simpler game representations. The NAF of an integer is unique.\nTo find the NAF of 13:\n$13 = 1101_2$. We can replace the `11` using the identity $2^k + 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1} - 2^{k-1}$. Here, $1100_2 = 10000_2 - 100_2$.\nSo, $13 = 1101_2 = (10000_2 - 100_2) + 1_2 = 16 - 4 + 1$.\nThe expansion for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{16 - 4 + 1}{16} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = 2^0 - 2^{-2} + 2^{-4}$.\n\nNow we calculate the total number of pieces for this expansion:\n*   Pieces for $1$ ($k=0$): $2^0 = 1$ piece (a single red edge).\n*   Pieces for $-1/4$ (negative of game for $j=2$): $2+1 = 3$ pieces.\n*   Pieces for $1/16$ ($j=4$): $4+1 = 5$ pieces.\n*   Total pieces = $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nComparing the two standard constructions, the one based on the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) expansion requires 9 pieces, while the one based on the standard binary expansion requires 10 pieces. The NAF representation is known to be optimal for minimizing the number of game components, and in this case, it also yields the minimum total number of pieces among the plausible expansions.\n\nThe representation consists of three disjoint game components:\n1.  A game for $+1$: one red edge.\n2.  A game for $-1/4$: one blue edge with two red edges on top.\n3.  A game for $+1/16$: one red edge with four blue edges on top.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$."
