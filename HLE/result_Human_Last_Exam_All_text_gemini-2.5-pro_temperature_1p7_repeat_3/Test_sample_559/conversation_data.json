    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Phase Plane Equation**\n\nWe are given the system:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe analyze the system in the $(u, d)$ phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. The trajectories $(u(t), d(t))$ are governed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2} $$\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d'=0$ gives $2d^2=0$, which implies $d=0$.\n    So, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d'=0$ gives $2d^2+2d = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d(d+1)=0$, which implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are equilibrium points.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points, we use the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$:\nLet $f(u,d) = (u-1)u^2 = u^3-u^2$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)u^2$. The expression in the question is $d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$, which is equivalent to $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2-2u$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2-3u$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(0) - 3(1)+4(1) & 4(0)+5(1)-3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are real and positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) - 3(1)+4(1) & 4(-1)+5(1)-3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the point is non-hyperbolic and cannot be classified by linearization.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of the phase plane with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. The main separatrix for this system will be related to the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nWe can look for an exact solution to the phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\dots$ in the form of a polynomial curve $d=d(u)$. Due to the complexity of the equation, we try to guess a simple form. Let's test for a quadratic solution: $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\nBy substituting $d(u)$ and its derivative $d'(u)=2au+b$ into the ODE $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + \\dots}{(u-1)u^2}$ and equating coefficients of the powers of $u$, we can find the values of $a, b, c$.\nThis procedure yields two exact solutions:\n1.  $d = -u^2$\n2.  $d = u - u^2$\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Found Trajectories**\n\nWe need to determine which of these curves is the separatrix. We check which equilibrium points they connect.\n\n1.  **Curve $d = -u^2$:**\n    *   If $u=0$, then $d=0$. It passes through the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   If $u=1$, then $d=-(1)^2=-1$. It passes through the saddle point **(1, -1)**.\n    A trajectory connecting an equilibrium point to a saddle point is a part of the saddle's stable or unstable manifold, and is therefore a separatrix. Let's check the tangency at (1, -1). The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is -2. The unstable eigenvector for the saddle point (1,-1) is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of -2. Thus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\n2.  **Curve $d = u - u^2 = u(1-u)$:**\n    *   If $u=0$, then $d=0$. It passes through the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   If $u=1$, then $d=1-1=0$. It passes through the unstable node **(1, 0)**.\n    This is another special trajectory, but it connects two non-saddle points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe separatrix is the trajectory that defines a critical boundary in the phase space. The unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1) serves this purpose. We found that the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact representation of this manifold. Therefore, it is the separatrix of the system.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{d=-u^2}$.\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
