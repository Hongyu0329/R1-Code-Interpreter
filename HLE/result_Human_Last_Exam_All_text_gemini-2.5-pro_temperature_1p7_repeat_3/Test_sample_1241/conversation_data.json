    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady-state (or stationary) distribution, denoted by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, is achieved when the probabilities no longer change with time. This means that all the time derivatives are equal to zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all states $i$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Set up the steady-state equations:**\nWe set the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system to zero to find the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$.\nThe system of equations becomes:\n(i)   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n(ii)  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n(iii) $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n(iv)  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\nWe also have the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n(v)   $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**2. Substitute the given rate constants:**\nThe values for the rate constants are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nLet's substitute these values into the equations (i), (iii), and (iv). We will use these three along with the normalization equation (v) to solve for the four unknown probabilities.\nFrom (i):\n$-0.019\\pi_0 + 0.65\\pi_1 = 0$\n\nFrom (iii):\n$0.4\\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 = 0 \\implies 0.4\\pi_1 - 0.4\\pi_2 = 0$\n\nFrom (iv):\n$0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3 = 0$\n\n**3. Solve the system of algebraic equations:**\nOur goal is to express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$. This is a standard procedure for solving such systems.\n\n*   From the simplified equation (iv), $0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3$, which directly implies:\n    $\\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\n*   From the simplified equation (iii), $0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2$, which directly implies:\n    $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n    **Careful point:** Combining these two results gives us a very useful relationship: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\n*   From equation (i), we can express $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n    $0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1$\n    $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$\n    **Careful point:** It is often easier and more accurate to work with fractions than with decimal approximations.\n\n**4. Use the normalization condition to find the value of $\\pi_1$:**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (v):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1 + 1 + 1\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_1 \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_1 \\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_1 \\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_1 \\left(\\frac{707}{19}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the final answer:**\nThe question asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe already have an expression for $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$: $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$.\nTherefore, the sum is:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1\\right)\\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650 + 19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{669}{19}\\right)\\pi_1$\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nThe value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ is $\\frac{669}{707}$."
