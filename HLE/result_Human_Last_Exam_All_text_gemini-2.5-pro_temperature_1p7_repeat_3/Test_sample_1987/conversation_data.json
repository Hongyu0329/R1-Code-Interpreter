    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe user wants me to analyze a recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` and calculate three specific values.\n\n**1. Analyzing the function `f`**\n\nThe function is defined as:\n*   (1) `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1, ..., a_n` is not a non-decreasing sequence (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`).\n*   (2) `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n*   (3) `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, a_2, ..., a_n) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)`. This is the sum of `n` recursive calls.\n\nThis recursion counts the number of paths on an `n`-dimensional lattice from `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to `(0, ..., 0)` using steps that decrease a single coordinate by 1, with the constraint that the coordinates of any point on the path must form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics. The number `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is equal to the number of **Standard Young Tableaux (SYT)** of the shape `λ = (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)`.\n\nA Standard Young Tableau of shape `λ` is a filling of the cells of the Ferrers diagram of `λ` with the integers `{1, 2, ..., N}` (where `N = a_1 + ... + a_n` is the total number of cells) such that the numbers are strictly increasing along each row and each column.\n\nThe number of SYT of a given shape `λ` can be calculated using the **Hook Length Formula**:\n`d_λ = N! / (product of all hook lengths h(x) for each cell x in the diagram)`.\nThe hook length `h(x)` for a cell `x` is the number of cells in the \"hook\" of `x`, which consists of `x` itself, all cells to its right in the same row, and all cells below it in the same column.\n\nLet's verify this model with some simple cases:\n*   `f(1, 1)`: `f(1,1) = f(0,1) + f(1,0) = f(0,1) + 0 = f(0,0) = 1`. The SYT model gives shape `λ=(1,1)`, `N=2`. The hooks are `h(1,1)=2, h(2,1)=1`. So `d_λ = 2!/(2*1) = 1`. It matches.\n*   `f(1, 2)`: `f(1,2) = f(0,2)+f(1,1) = 1+1=2`. The SYT model gives shape `λ=(2,1)`, `N=3`. The hooks are `h(1,1)=3, h(1,2)=1, h(2,1)=1`. So `d_λ = 3!/(3*1*1) = 2`. It matches.\n\nThe model appears to be correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculation of `f(2, 4, 5)`**\n\n*   This corresponds to the number of SYT of shape `λ = (5, 4, 2)`.\n*   The total number of cells is `N = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n*   The Ferrers diagram is:\n    ```\n    XXXXX\n    XXXX\n    XX\n    ```\n*   Let's calculate the hook lengths for each cell:\n    *   Row 1: `h(1,1)=7, h(1,2)=6, h(1,3)=4, h(1,4)=3, h(1,5)=1`. Product = `504`.\n    *   Row 2: `h(2,1)=5, h(2,2)=4, h(2,3)=2, h(2,4)=1`. Product = `40`.\n    *   Row 3: `h(3,1)=2, h(3,2)=1`. Product = `2`.\n*   The product of all hook lengths is `504 * 40 * 2 = 40320`.\n*   `N! = 11! = 39,916,800`.\n*   `f(2, 4, 5) = 11! / 40320 = 39,916,800 / 40320 = 990`.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculation of `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`**\n\n*   Let `A = 9000`. We need to calculate `f(A, A, A)`.\n*   Using the model, `f(A,A,A)` is the number of SYT of shape `λ=(A, A, A)`, which is a `3 × A` rectangle. The total number of cells is `N=3A`.\n*   There's a known identity `S(n,n,n) = S(n,n,n-1)`, where `S` is the number of SYT. Recursively, this leads to `f(A,A,A) = f(A-1,A,A) = ...`, which is consistent with the function definition: `f(A,A,A) = f(A-1,A,A) + f(A,A-1,A) + f(A,A,A-1) = f(A-1,A,A) + 0 + 0`.\n*   The formula for the number of SYT of a rectangular shape `m × n` is `(mn)! * (Π_{i=0}^{m-1} i!) / (Π_{i=0}^{m-1} (n+i)!)`.\n*   Here, the shape is `(A,A,A)`, so it's a `3 × A` rectangle.\n    `f(A,A,A) = (3A)! * (0! * 1! * 2!) / (A! * (A+1)! * (A+2)!) = 2 * (3A)! / (A! * (A+1)! * (A+2)!)`.\n*   For `A=9000`, this number is astronomically large and impossible to calculate by hand. This suggests there might be a trick or a specific context.\n*   Problems of this nature often test properties of functions modulo a prime. The next question is a modular arithmetic problem. Let's assume this question implies a modular context as well, perhaps `mod 9001` since `9001` is prime. Let `p=9001`, then `A=9000=p-1`.\n*   We need to calculate `f(p-1, p-1, p-1) mod p`.\n    The formula is `2 * (3p-3)! / ((p-1)! * p! * (p+1)!)`.\n*   We analyze the powers of `p` in the numerator and denominator using Legendre's formula `v_p(n!) = Σ floor(n/p^k)`.\n    *   `v_p(numerator) = v_p((3p-3)!) = floor((3p-3)/p) = 2`.\n    *   `v_p(denominator) = v_p((p-1)!) + v_p(p!) + v_p((p+1)!) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    The powers of `p` cancel, so the modulo is well-defined.\n*   We use the property `k!/p^{v_p(k!)} mod p`. And Wilson's Theorem: `(p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p`.\n    *   ` (3p-3)!/p^2 = ( (3p-3)!_p * 2! ) mod p `, where `n!_p` is the p-adic factorial. `(3p-3)!_p ≡ ((p-1)!)^3 ≡ (-1)^3 = -1 mod p`.\n        So `(3p-3)!/p^2 ≡ -1 * 2 = -2 mod p`.\n    *   ` (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p `.\n    *   ` p!/p = (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p`.\n    *   ` (p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! ≡ 1*(-1) = -1 mod p`.\n*   So, `f(p-1, p-1, p-1) ≡ 2 * (-2) / ((-1)*(-1)*(-1)) = -4 / -1 = 4 mod p`.\n*   Under the assumption that `f(9000, 9000, 9000)` implies calculation modulo `9001`, the value is 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculation of `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`**\n\n*   We need `f(A, A, A, A) mod p` where `A=p=10^9+7`.\n*   The model is `f(A,A,A,A) =` number of SYT of shape `(A,A,A,A)`, which is an `A × 4` rectangle.\n*   The formula for a `4 × A` rectangle gives `N = 4A`.\n    `f(A,A,A,A) = (4A)! * (0!1!2!3!) / (A! (A+1)! (A+2)! (A+3)!) = 12 * (4A)! / (A! (A+1)! (A+2)! (A+3)!)`.\n*   Since `A=p`, we need to compute this modulo `p`.\n    `f(p,p,p,p) mod p`.\n*   We analyze powers of `p`.\n    *   `v_p(numerator) = v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n    *   `v_p(denominator) = v_p(p!) + ... + v_p((p+3)!) = 1+1+1+1=4`.\n    The powers of `p` cancel out.\n*   Let's compute the value modulo `p`.\n    *   Numerator part: `12 * (4p)!/p^4`.\n        `(4p)! / (p*2p*3p*4p) = prod_{k=1..4p, p does not divide k} k`.\n        Modulo `p`, this product is `((p-1)!)^4 ≡ (-1)^4 = 1 mod p`.\n        So `(4p)!/p^4 ≡ 1 * (1*2*3*4) = 24 mod p`.\n        The numerator is `12 * 24 = 288 mod p`.\n    *   Denominator part: `(p!/p) * ((p+1)!/p) * ((p+2)!/p) * ((p+3)!/p)`.\n        `p!/p = (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p`.\n        `(p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! ≡ 1*(-1) = -1 mod p`.\n        `(p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! ≡ 2*1*(-1) = -2 mod p`.\n        `(p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! ≡ 3*2*1*(-1) = -6 mod p`.\n        The denominator product is `(-1)(-1)(-2)(-6) = 12 mod p`.\n*   `f(p,p,p,p) ≡ 288 / 12 = 24 mod p`.\n\nFinal answers separated by a comma.\n\n<<<990, 4, 24>>>"
