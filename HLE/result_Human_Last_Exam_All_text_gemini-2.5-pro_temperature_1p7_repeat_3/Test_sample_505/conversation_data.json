    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the System's Components\nThe user asks about a quantum error correction system with the following characteristics:\n*   **Code Type:** Surface Code. This is a topological CSS code defined on a 2D lattice of physical qubits.\n*   **Physical Layout:** Two separate (disjoint) \"patches\".\n*   **Topology of each patch:** Each patch has \"two holes\".\n\nThe total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits that can be encoded in each of the two identical patches. So, the core of the problem is to determine the maximum number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Topology of a Single Patch\n*   A \"patch\" of surface code is typically understood as a finite, 2D area of the code. Topologically, it is equivalent to a disk. A simple disk (a patch with no holes) has one continuous outer boundary.\n*   \"Two holes\" means that two regions inside this disk are removed. Topologically, this means we have punctured the disk twice.\n*   This results in a surface with one outer boundary and two inner boundaries (one for each hole).\n*   Therefore, a single patch with two holes is a surface with a total of **b = 3** boundary components.\n*   Since the patch is planar, its genus is **g = 0**.\n*   This surface is commonly known in topology as a \"pair of pants\".\n\n### Step 3: Relate Topology to the Number of Logical Qubits (k)\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a surface code depends on the topology of the surface (its genus `g` and number of boundaries `b`) and the specific boundary conditions chosen.\n\nA key result from the theory of topological quantum codes (specifically for genus-0 surfaces like ours) states that a single connected surface with `b` boundaries can encode a maximum of `k = b - 1` logical qubits.\n\nLet's apply this to our single patch:\n*   Number of boundaries, `b = 3`.\n*   Maximum number of logical qubits, `k = b - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode at most 2 logical qubits.\n\n### Step 4: A More Careful Point: Verifying `k = b - 1` with Logical Operators\nTo be certain this result is correct and maximal, we can consider the logical operators. A logical qubit requires a pair of operators, `X_L` and `Z_L`, that anti-commute with each other but commute with all stabilizers.\nIn surface codes, logical operators are represented by strings of single-qubit operators. Boundaries can be of two types: 'X-type' (where Z-strings can terminate) or 'Z-type' (where X-strings can terminate).\n\nTo maximize `k`, we must define the boundaries of the holes appropriately. Let our patch be a rectangle with two holes inside, H1 and H2.\n1.  **Outer Boundary:** Let the left/right sides be X-type boundaries and the top/bottom sides be Z-type. This standard configuration allows for the encoding of one \"planar\" qubit.\n2.  **Hole Boundaries:** To get the maximum number of qubits, we need to balance the number of available X and Z logical operators. A good choice is to make the boundary of hole H1 a Z-type boundary and the boundary of hole H2 an X-type boundary.\n\nWith this setup:\n*   **Logical Z operators:** These are strings of Z-operators that connect pairs of X-type boundaries. We have three X-type boundaries: Left side, Right side, and Hole H2. We can form `3 - 1 = 2` independent logical Z-operators (e.g., a string from Left to Right, and a string from Left to Hole H2).\n*   **Logical X operators:** These are strings of X-operators that connect pairs of Z-type boundaries. We have three Z-type boundaries: Top side, Bottom side, and Hole H1. We can form `3 - 1 = 2` independent logical X-operators (e.g., a string from Top to Bottom, and a string from Top to Hole H1).\n\nSince we can define 2 independent `X_L` operators and 2 independent `Z_L` operators, we can form **k = 2** logical qubits. This confirms the result from Step 3. The claim that one could encode `k=3` qubits (one planar plus two for the holes) is incorrect, because the logical operators would not be fully independent.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Qubits for Two Patches\nThe problem specifies \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". Since these patches are separate physical systems, the total information storage capacity is the sum of their individual capacities.\n*   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 2`\n*   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 2`\n*   Total Qubits: `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the described system is 4."
