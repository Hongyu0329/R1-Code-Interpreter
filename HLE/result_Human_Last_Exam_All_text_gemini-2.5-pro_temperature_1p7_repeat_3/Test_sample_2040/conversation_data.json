    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (conventionally named the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Governing Physics:** The process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   Energy conservation: `ω_pump = ω_signal + ω_idler`\n    *   Momentum conservation (phase matching): `k_pump = k_signal + k_idler`\n*   **Key Material Requirement:** SPDC is a *second-order nonlinear process*. This means its occurrence and efficiency are governed by the material's second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾** (chi-two). A material must have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ to exhibit SPDC.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material property required for a non-zero χ⁽²⁾**\n\n*   **Symmetry Consideration:** In the electric dipole approximation, which is the dominant mechanism for light-matter interactions, a material can only possess a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) if its crystal structure **lacks a center of inversion symmetry**.\n*   **Centrosymmetric vs. Non-centrosymmetric:**\n    *   A material is **centrosymmetric** if it has a point (a center of inversion) such that for any atom at position `r` from that center, there is an identical atom at position `-r`. Inverting the coordinate system leaves the crystal structure unchanged.\n    *   In a centrosymmetric material, the bulk second-order nonlinear optical response is zero (χ⁽²⁾ = 0). Therefore, centrosymmetric materials cannot exhibit SPDC or other second-order effects like second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n    *   A material must be **non-centrosymmetric** to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and thus to be a candidate for SPDC.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the crystal structure and symmetry of free-standing boron nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   **Nature of Borophene:** Borophene is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of boron. Unlike graphene, which has one primary structure, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different stable or metastable atomic structures.\n*   **Common Structures:** The most commonly studied and theoretically stable free-standing phases of borophene are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases.\n*   **Symmetry of Borophene Phases:**\n    *   The **β₁₂ borophene** sheet has an orthorhombic unit cell and belongs to the space group *Pmmn*. This space group is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   The **χ₃ borophene** sheet also has an orthorhombic unit cell and belongs to the space group *Cmcm*. This space group is also **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   Other predicted or synthesized phases (e.g., striped phases) are also generally found to possess inversion symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the analysis to answer the question**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is only possible in materials that lack inversion symmetry (are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The stable, free-standing structures of boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because they are centrosymmetric, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ of ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets is zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on this fundamental symmetry principle, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** This analysis applies to an ideal, pristine, free-standing nanosheet. In reality, factors could break the symmetry locally, but these effects would be very weak and not characteristic of the material itself.\n2.  **Edges and Defects:** The inversion symmetry is naturally broken at the edges of a finite nanosheet or at certain types of defects. This could theoretically lead to a very weak, localized SPDC signal from these specific locations, but not from the bulk of the material.\n3.  **Strain:** Applying significant, non-uniform strain could potentially break the inversion symmetry and induce a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. However, under normal conditions and without specific engineering, this effect is not assumed.\n4.  **Substrate Effects:** The question specifies \"free-standing\". If the borophene were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the overall system's symmetry, potentially enabling second-order effects. But for a free-standing sheet, this is not a factor.\n5.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant electric dipole χ⁽²⁾ is zero, there can be much weaker contributions from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions, or surface effects. These are typically orders of magnitude weaker and are generally not what is meant when asking if a material exhibits SPDC.\n6.  **Third-Order Effects:** Being centrosymmetric does not preclude odd-order nonlinearities. Boron nanosheets are expected to have a non-zero third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾) and could thus exhibit effects like third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. The question is specifically about SPDC, a second-order effect.\n\nBased on the core physical principles, the answer is a definitive no.\n\n<<<No. Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their stable crystallographic phases (such as β₁₂ and χ₃), are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Due to fundamental symmetry constraints, χ⁽²⁾ is zero in centrosymmetric materials. Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this effect.>>>"
