No. Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their stable crystallographic phases (such as β₁₂ and χ₃), are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Due to fundamental symmetry constraints, χ⁽²⁾ is zero in centrosymmetric materials. Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this effect.
