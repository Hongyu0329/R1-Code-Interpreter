The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi \phi)$ in the functional integral is given by the expression for twice the Euclidean action for the free field:
$\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d\vec{x} \, \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) [-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2] \phi(\tau, \vec{x})$
where $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the periodic imaginary time, $\vec{x}$ represents the $d$ spatial coordinates, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field $\phi$, and the operator $D_\phi = -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
