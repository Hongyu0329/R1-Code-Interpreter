    "Answering this question involves several steps from convex geometry and number theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the set of lines**\n\nThe problem requires a convex domain `D` to intersect every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let this set of lines be `L`.\n\nA crucial point is to analyze the full extent of this set of lines. If `p` and `q` are coprime integers, then `-p` and `-q` are also coprime integers. This means for every line `px + qy = 1` in `L`, the line `(-p)x + (-q)y = 1` is also in `L`. This second equation can be rewritten as `px + qy = -1`.\n\nTherefore, the convex domain `D` must intersect *both* `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1` for every coprime integer pair `(p,q)`.\n\n**2. Translating the condition into the language of support functions**\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain in the plane. For `D` to intersect a line `ax + by = c`, the values of the linear function `f(x,y) = ax + by` over the domain `D` must contain `c`. In other words, `inf_{(x,y)∈D} (ax+by) ≤ c ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈D} (ax+by)`.\n\nApplying this to our problem, for every coprime pair `(p,q)`:\n1.  `D` must intersect `px + qy = 1`: `inf_{x∈D} (px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{x∈D} (px+qy)`.\n2.  `D` must intersect `px + qy = -1`: `inf_{x∈D} (px+qy) ≤ -1 ≤ sup_{x∈D} (px+qy)`.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we must have:\n`inf_{x∈D} (px+qy) ≤ -1` and `sup_{x∈D} (px+qy) ≥ 1`.\n\nThe support function of a convex set `D` is defined as `h_D(v) = sup_{x∈D} (x · v)`. With `v = (p,q)`, this becomes `h_D(p,q) = sup_{x∈D} (px+qy)`.\nAlso, `inf_{x∈D} (x · v) = -sup_{x∈D} (x · (-v)) = -h_D(-v)`.\n\nSo, the condition on `D` becomes:\n`h_D(p,q) ≥ 1` and `-h_D(-p,-q) ≤ -1`, which simplifies to `h_D(-p,-q) ≥ 1`.\nLet `S` be the set of all primitive integer vectors `v=(p,q)` (where `gcd(p,q)=1`). The condition on `D` is that for every `v ∈ S`, we must have `h_D(v) ≥ 1` and `h_D(-v) ≥ 1`.\n\n**3. The role of symmetry**\n\nTo minimize the area of `D`, it's advantageous for `D` to be centrally symmetric with respect to the origin.\nLet's assume `D` is a convex set satisfying the conditions. Let `D_s = (D - D)/2` be its centrally symmetric version (the Minkowski difference body). One can show that `Area(D)` is minimized when `D` is centrally symmetric. In that case, `h_D(v) = h_D(-v)`. The two conditions `h_D(v) ≥ 1` and `h_D(-v) ≥ 1` become a single condition:\n`h_D(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\n**4. Using duality and geometric number theory**\n\nWe are looking for the minimum-area centrally symmetric convex body `D` such that `h_D(v) ≥ 1` for all primitive integer vectors `v`.\n\nWe can use the concept of a polar body. The polar `D^\\circ` of a centrally symmetric convex body `D` is defined as `D^\\circ = {y | x · y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ D}`. The support function `h_D(v)` is related to `D^\\circ`. Specifically, `h_D(v) ≥ 1` is equivalent to stating that the vector `v` cannot be in the interior of `D^\\circ`.\n\nSo, our condition `h_D(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S` translates to:\n`S ∩ int(D^\\circ) = ∅`.\nIn words, the interior of the polar body `D^\\circ` must not contain any primitive integer vectors.\n\nThe Blaschke-Santaló inequality relates the areas of a centrally symmetric convex body `D` and its polar `D^\\circ` in `ℝ²`: `Area(D) · Area(D^\\circ) ≥ 8`. Equality holds if and only if `D` is a parallelogram.\n\nTo minimize `Area(D)`, we need to maximize `Area(D^\\circ)`. So the problem is transformed into:\n**Find the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex body `K` in the plane whose interior contains no primitive integer vectors.**\n\nA consequence of Minkowski's First Theorem on lattice points is that if a centrally symmetric convex body `K` has an area greater than 4, its interior must contain a non-zero integer point `v = (p,q)`. If `v` is in `int(K)`, and `d=gcd(p,q)`, then the primitive vector `v/d` must also lie in `int(K)`.\nTherefore, for `int(K)` to contain no primitive integer vectors, we must have `Area(K) ≤ 4`.\n\nThe maximum possible area for `K = D^\\circ` is 4. This maximum is achieved by the square `K = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The area is `2 × 2 = 4`, and its interior `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points at all, thus no primitive ones.\n\n**5. Finding the minimal domain**\n\nSo, the optimal `D^\\circ` is the square `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The minimal domain `D` is the polar of this square, `D = ([-1, 1] × [-1, 1])^\\circ`.\n\nThe square `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is defined by the inequalities `-1 ≤ x ≤ 1` and `-1 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\nIts polar `D` is given by:\n`D = {(p,q) | px + qy ≤ 1 for all (x,y) in [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]}`.\nThe maximum value of `px + qy` over the square is `|p| + |q|`.\nSo, `D` is the set of points `(p,q)` such that `|p| + |q| ≤ 1`. (Note: we use `p,q` as coordinates here, they are not the integers from the line equation anymore).\n\nThis region `{ (x,y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1 }` is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.\n\n**6. Calculating the minimal area**\n\nThe area of this diamond-shaped region can be calculated easily. It's a square with diagonal length 2. The area is `(1/2)d_1 d_2 = (1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the result from the Blaschke-Santaló inequality. Since `D` is the polar of a square (a parallelogram), we have the equality case:\n`Area(D) · Area(D^\\circ) = 8`.\nSince `Area(D^\\circ) = 4`, we get `Area(D) = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nFinal verification: We check if the domain `D = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|≤1}` meets the original criteria. Its support function is `h_D(p,q) = sup_{|x|+|y|≤1} (px+qy) = max(|p|, |q|)`. For any coprime pair `(p,q)`, at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer, so `|p|≥1` or `|q|≥1`. Thus `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. The condition `h_D(p,q) ≥ 1` is satisfied. The area is 2.\n\n>>>2"
