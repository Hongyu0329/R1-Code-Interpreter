    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core clues provided in the text.**\n*   **\"HE\"**: The subject is a male figure associated with a significant work.\n*   **\"HIS work\"**: This refers to a foundational text, likely religious or legal in nature.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The specific part of the text being discussed is at its conclusion.\n*   **\"addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This points to a law or commandment concerning covetousness, envy, or theft of property.\n*   **\"prohibition against representation\"**: This is a very specific and crucial clue. It strongly suggests the Second Commandment in the Judeo-Christian tradition, which forbids the making of graven images or idols.\n*   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This describes the method. The rule about material possessions somehow requires one to bypass the rule about making images.\n*   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This is the scholarly source for this specific analysis. Her interpretation links the rule about possessions with the rule about representation.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the clues to a specific text.**\nThe combination of a \"prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment) and a final commandment about desiring \"another's material possessions\" (the Tenth Commandment) points unequivocally to the Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the commandments based on the interpretation.**\n*   The Second Commandment forbids making images/representations (\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...\").\n*   The Tenth Commandment forbids coveting what belongs to a neighbor (\"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house... wife... nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\").\n*   Veronika Campan, a media theorist, interprets this sequence by noting that to understand and obey the Tenth Commandment, one must first *imagine* or *mentally represent* the very things one is not supposed to desire (the house, the wife, the ox).\n*   Therefore, in the very act of stating the Tenth Commandment, the text compels a form of mental imaging, which \"naturally ignore[s]\" the spirit of the absolute prohibition against representation found in the Second Commandment. The lawgiver uses mental representation to forbid a mental crime (coveting).\n\n**Step 4: Identify \"HE\".**\nThe figure who, according to the biblical narrative (primarily in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy), received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the Israelites is Moses. He is the lawgiver and the human agent to whom \"HIS work\" (in the sense of transcribing and delivering the law) is attributed.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude with the full name.**\nBased on the analysis, the figure \"HE\" is the prophet and lawgiver Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
