    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the protein in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a protein that has a specific relationship with two other biological components: macrophages and amyloid. The relationship is as follows:\n*   The protein, in its normal or active state, *prevents* macrophages from engulfing amyloid.\n*   When this protein is \"broken down\" (which can mean degraded, deleted, or functionally inhibited), it *allows* macrophages to engulf amyloid.\nThis implies we are looking for an inhibitory protein or a \"brake\" on the immune system's clearance mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Cells and Location**\nWhile the question uses the general term \"macrophage,\" in the context of amyloid plaques in the brain (as seen in Alzheimer's disease), the specific resident macrophages are called **microglia**. Therefore, the search should focus on proteins on the surface of microglia.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Proteins that Regulate Microglial Activity**\nMicroglia have numerous surface receptors that control their functions, including phagocytosis (engulfment). These receptors can be either activating (promoting an immune response) or inhibitory (suppressing an immune response). The question points directly to an **inhibitory receptor**.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate Specific Inhibitory Receptors on Microglia**\nResearch into Alzheimer's disease has highlighted several key inhibitory receptors that regulate how microglia interact with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. Two prominent candidates are:\n*   **CD33:** A well-known inhibitory receptor. Genetic studies have shown that variations leading to higher CD33 expression on microglia are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Suppressing CD33 function has been shown to increase the ability of microglia to clear Aβ.\n*   **PirB (in mice) / LILRB2 (in humans):** This is another critical inhibitory receptor. It is particularly relevant because it has been identified as a direct receptor for toxic amyloid-beta oligomers.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Mechanism of PirB/LILRB2**\n1.  **Binding:** The protein PirB (Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B) on the surface of microglia directly binds to soluble amyloid-beta oligomers.\n2.  **Inhibition:** This binding event triggers an internal signaling cascade within the microglia that *inhibits* their phagocytic ability. It essentially paralyzes the cell's cleanup machinery, preventing it from engulfing amyloid. The amyloid itself actively shuts down its own removal by interacting with PirB.\n3.  **\"Breaking Down\" the Protein:** In scientific studies, when the gene for PirB is deleted in mouse models of Alzheimer's (a form of \"breaking down\" the protein's presence and function), the microglia are no longer inhibited. They regain their ability to actively engulf and clear amyloid plaques. This leads to a reduction in plaque load and an improvement in cognitive function in the animal models.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **\"Broken down\":** This term should be interpreted broadly. It can mean genetic deletion, functional inhibition by a drug or antibody, or natural degradation. In the case of PirB, genetic deletion is the most studied form of \"breakdown\" that proves its function.\n*   **Cell Type:** It is crucial to specify that the relevant macrophages in the brain are microglia.\n*   **Human vs. Mouse:** The protein is known as **PirB** in mice, where much of the foundational research was done. The human equivalent (ortholog) is **LILRB2** (Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2). Both serve the same inhibitory function.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\nBased on the evidence, the protein that directly binds amyloid and, in doing so, inhibits its own clearance by microglia is PirB (in mice) and its human equivalent, LILRB2. Removing or \"breaking down\" this protein removes the inhibitory signal, thereby allowing macrophage/microglial engulfment of amyloid.\n\n<<<PirB (in mice) / LILRB2 (in humans)>>>"
