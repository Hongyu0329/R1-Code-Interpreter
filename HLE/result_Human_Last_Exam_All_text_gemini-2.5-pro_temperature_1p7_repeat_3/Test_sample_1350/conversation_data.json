    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct character.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The request asks for the specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who has (a) visited a Roman city and (b) describes Roman religious practices in a way that clearly alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify the Context:** The story revolves around the Wolfing clan, a Gothic tribe, preparing to defend their homes in Mirkwood against an approaching Roman army. Early in the book, the tribe holds a \"Folk-mote,\" or a great assembly, to discuss the threat and decide on a course of action. It is during this assembly that various members of the tribe share their knowledge and opinions of the Romans.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The key scene occurs in **Chapter V: \"The Folk-mote of the Wolfings.\"** During this debate, an elder speaks who has direct, first-hand experience with the Romans, which sets him apart from the other Goths whose knowledge is based on hearsay or encounters in battle.\n\n4.  **Identify the Character:** The character who speaks is an old carle (a freeman) named **Otter**. He tells the assembly that his knowledge is not from stories but from his own life, stating, \"I who speak to you have been a thrall in the cities of the Romans, and have seen their manners.\" This confirms he has visited a Roman city.\n\n5.  **Examine the Character's Description:** Otter proceeds to describe the Romans, their cities of \"marble and brass,\" and their beliefs. He makes a direct comparison between the Wolfings' own wolf-kinship and a symbol he witnessed among the Romans. This is the crucial passage.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the Allusion to Romulus and Remus:** Otter states that the Romans are \"not without a wolf of their own.\" He then describes exactly what he saw in their temples, which is the key to answering the question:\n    > \"...for in their temples I have seen the image of a she-wolf giving suck to two men-children, and this they worship and call the sign of their beginnings...\"\n\n7.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** This description is an unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf sculpture, which depicts the legendary founding of Rome, where the abandoned twin infants, Romulus and Remus, are suckled and cared for by a she-wolf. Otter's speech perfectly matches all the criteria in the question: he visited a Roman city (as a thrall), and he described their religious imagery in a way that directly refers to the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices by referencing the myth of Romulus and Remus is the elder carle named **Otter**.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
