    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown\nThe \"Triple Crown\" in MLB baseball typically refers to the batting Triple Crown. To win this, a player must lead their league (either the American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List All Triple Crown Winners\nTo find the total number of winners, we need to compile a complete list of every player who has accomplished this feat in MLB history.\n\n**National League (NL) Winners:**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill*\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera\n\n*\\*Tip O'Neill won in the American Association, which is recognized by MLB as a major league for that era.*\n\n### Step 3: Count the Winners and Analyze the Data\nNow we count the number of players on the list to find the answer.\n\n*   **Counting the instances:** If we count every season a Triple Crown was won, there are 8 winners from the NL and 10 from the AL, for a total of **18 times** the feat has been accomplished.\n*   **Counting the unique players:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of individual players. We must look for any repeat winners in our list.\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** won the Triple Crown twice (1922 and 1925).\n    *   **Ted Williams** also won the Triple Crown twice (1942 and 1947).\n\nBecause two players won the award twice, the number of unique players is different from the total number of instances. By subtracting the repeat wins from the total, we find the number of unique individuals: 18 instances - 2 repeat wins = **16 unique players**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Players vs. Instances:** It is crucial to distinguish between the number of times the Triple Crown was won (18) and the number of unique players who won it (16). The question \"how many winners\" points to the number of individuals.\n2.  **Historical Statistics:** The RBI was not an official MLB statistic until 1920. However, the winners before that date (Hines, O'Neill, Duffy, Lajoie, Cobb, Zimmerman) are officially recognized by MLB, based on retroactively compiled and verified statistics.\n3.  **Batting vs. Pitching Triple Crown:** The question almost certainly refers to the more famous and much rarer batting Triple Crown. The pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts) has been won more frequently.\n4.  **Most Recent Winner:** The last player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, which was the first time the feat had been accomplished in 45 years.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, there have been 16 different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
