    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core terminology of the question.**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in International Standard and American Smooth ballroom dances that turns to the left (anti-clockwise). Each dance has its own specific version of this figure.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard amount prescribed for a specific figure. For example, if a standard figure is written to have a 3/4 turn, an overturned version might have a 7/8 or a full 1/1 turn.\n*   **Technique:** The set of rules and principles that define a dance's character. This includes footwork (e.g., heel leads, toe leads), body action (e.g., sway, rise and fall), timing, and alignment.\n*   **The Crux of the Question:** The question asks in which dance it is *impossible* to add extra rotation (overturn) to a Reverse Turn *without breaking the fundamental rules (technique)* of that dance. This implies that in the other four dances, overturning a Reverse Turn is a recognized and technically valid action.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each dance style based on its technique.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous, rapid rotation. While the standard Reverse Turn completes one full turn over six steps, the entire dance is about flowing and turning. The technique is built on rotational momentum. Overturning is not a concept that breaks the technique; the technique itself is about maximizing controlled rotation.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is a \"swing\" dance characterized by Rise and Fall, body sway, and Contra Body Movement (CBM). These technical elements create momentum and a pendulum-like swing that can be used to control the amount of turn. Overturned figures, such as the \"Overturned Reverse Turn,\" are standard, recognized variations in advanced choreography. The technique not only allows for it but provides the tools to execute it correctly.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, the Foxtrot is a quintessential \"swing\" dance. It is defined by its smooth, continuous, flowing movement. The technique is built on principles of sway and controlled momentum through the feet and body. This allows for figures to be modified. An \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a common, technically sound variation used in Foxtrot.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This dance combines the swing and sway of Foxtrot with dynamic hops, runs, and chasses. It is a high-energy dance where momentum is key. The technique allows for and encourages variations in rotation to create exciting and fast-paced choreography. Overturning a turn is a common tool used by dancers and is fully compatible with the dance's technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The technique of the Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances. It is a \"staccato\" dance, not a \"swing\" dance. Its core technical principles include:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level, moving across the floor without any vertical bounce.\n    *   **No Body Sway:** The upper body is held still and strong, without the lateral sway seen in swing dances.\n    *   **Grounded Footwork:** The feet are kept in close contact with the floor, often described as \"brushing\" or \"stroking\" the floor. Movement is sharp and clipped.\n    *   **No Momentum from Swing:** Turns are executed with precise foot placement and a strong lead from the torso, not by swinging the body or legs to create momentum.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"overturn\" test to the European Tango.**\n\nTo overturn a Tango Reverse Turn, a dancer would need to generate more rotation than the steps are designed for. Given the strict technical constraints of Tango:\n\n*   Without using sway or a pendulum swing of the body, it is extremely difficult to generate extra rotational momentum.\n*   Attempting to force the turn would likely cause the dancer to lift their feet off the floor to pivot, which violates the \"grounded\" principle of Tango footwork.\n*   It would also likely introduce unintentional sway or a breakdown in the frame as the dancers struggle to complete the extra rotation without the technical tools available in swing dances.\n\nTherefore, any attempt to overturn a reverse turn in Tango would necessitate abandoning the core, defining techniques of the dance (no sway, no rise/fall, grounded action). It is impossible to do it *without* disregarding the technique.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique of \"swing and sway\" allows for turns to be overturned as a valid variation. In Tango, the \"no swing, no sway\" technique makes overturning a turn technically impossible without violating the fundamental principles of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
