    "An analysis of the user's question, including a list of careful points and step-by-step analysis to obtain the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Objective:** Compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n2.  **Key Concept:** The \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_r\\) for a rational number \\(r = p/q\\) is a concept from the theory of Diophantine approximation and the Markov spectrum. While the terminology can vary between sources, a common definition for the object whose continued fraction we seek is a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\theta_r\\), constructed from the continued fraction of \\(r\\).\n3.  **The Construction:** The most standard construction, found in the works of Cohn, Aigner, Series, and others, is as follows:\n    *   First, represent the rational number \\(r = p/q\\) (where \\(0 < r < 1\\)) by its unique finite simple continued fraction ending with a term greater than 1. That is, \\(r = [0; c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m]\\) with \\(c_m \\ge 2\\).\n    *   Second, form a purely periodic sequence of integers \\(P\\) by creating a specific palindrome from the coefficients \\(c_i\\). The period \\(P\\) is given by the sequence:\n        \\( P = (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{m-1}, c_m-1, 1, c_{m-1}, \\ldots, c_2, c_1) \\).\n    *   The associated number, which we take to be \\(m_r\\), is the quadratic irrational whose continued fraction is given by this period. As \\(r\\) is in \\((0,1)\\), the number \\(m_r\\) will also be in \\((0,1)\\), so its continued fraction representation starts with 0. Thus, \\(m_r = [0; \\overline{P}]\\).\n4.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The representation of the rational number \\(r\\) must be correct, particularly the last term \\(c_m\\) must be greater than 1. For example, \\([0; 2, 3]\\) is correct, but \\([0; 2, 2, 1]\\) is not, as it should be simplified to \\([0; 2, 3]\\).\n    *   The construction of the period \\(P\\) must be done precisely. The sequence is formed by taking the initial part of the coefficients \\((c_1, \\ldots, c_{m-1})\\), followed by \\(c_m-1\\), then by \\(1\\), and finally by the reverse of the initial sequence \\((c_{m-1}, \\ldots, c_1)\\).\n    *   The question asks for the \"continued fraction\", which is the symbolic representation, not the numerical value of the irrational number.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nFollowing the procedure outlined above for \\( r = 4/7 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Find the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).**\nWe use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients.\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{4}{7} &= \\frac{1}{7/4} \\\\ \\frac{7}{4} &= 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ \\frac{3}{4} &= \\frac{1}{4/3} \\\\ \\frac{4}{3} &= 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\end{align*}\nCombining these, we get:\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} $$\nSo, the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nHere, the coefficients are \\(c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3\\). The number of coefficients is \\(m=3\\).\nThe condition \\(c_m \\ge 2\\) is satisfied, as \\(c_3=3\\).\n\n**Step 2: Construct the periodic part of the associated continued fraction.**\nThe formula for the period \\(P\\) is \\((c_1, \\ldots, c_{m-1}, c_m-1, 1, c_{m-1}, \\ldots, c_1)\\).\n*   The initial sequence of coefficients (excluding the last one) is \\((c_1, \\ldots, c_{m-1})\\). For \\(m=3\\), this is \\((c_1, c_2) = (1, 1)\\).\n*   The middle part of the period is formed by \\(c_m-1\\) and \\(1\\). For \\(c_3=3\\), this is \\(3-1=2\\) followed by \\(1\\). So, we have the sequence \\((2, 1)\\).\n*   The final part of the period is the reverse of the initial sequence. The reverse of \\((1, 1)\\) is \\((1, 1)\\).\n\nCombining these parts, the full period \\(P\\) is:\n$$ P = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1) $$\n\n**Step 3: Write down the final continued fraction.**\nThe generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the quadratic irrational whose continued fraction is purely periodic with the period \\(P\\) found in the previous step, and which lies in \\((0,1)\\). Therefore, its continued fraction expansion is \\([0; \\overline{P}]\\).\n\n$$ m_{4/7} = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1}] $$\nThis is the final answer, representing the continued fraction itself."
