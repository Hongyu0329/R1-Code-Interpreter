    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Condition**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of side length $AC$ for which there are two possible values for side length $AB$. We are given a triangle $ABC$ with $BC=S$ and $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B=30^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We are given $a=S$ and $\\angle B=30^{\\circ}$. We are looking for the number of integer values of $b$ for which there are two possible values for $c$.\n\nThe condition of having two possible values for a side of a triangle, given two other sides and a non-included angle (SSA case), is known as the Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines. Two distinct triangles can be formed if and only if the side opposite the given angle is shorter than the other given side but longer than the altitude from the common vertex.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Inequality**\n\nLet's draw the triangle. Place side $BC$ on the x-axis with $B$ at the origin $(0,0)$ and $C$ at $(S,0)$. The side $AB$ must lie on a ray starting from $B$ at an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ with the positive x-axis. Vertex $A$ must be on this ray.\nVertex $A$ must also be at a distance of $AC=b$ from point $C$. This means $A$ lies on a circle with center $C(S,0)$ and radius $b$.\n\nThe number of possible triangles is the number of intersection points of the ray and the circle.\nThe altitude $h$ from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$ is given by the formula $h = a \\sin B$.\nIn our case, $h = BC \\sin(\\angle B) = S \\sin(30^{\\circ})$.\n\nFor two triangles to exist, the circle must intersect the ray at two distinct points. This happens under the following conditions:\n1.  The radius $b=AC$ must be greater than the altitude $h$. If $b=h$, there is one (right) triangle. If $b<h$, there are no triangles. So, $AC > h$.\n2.  The radius $b=AC$ must be less than the side length $a=BC$. If $b \\ge a$, there is only one intersection point on the ray that forms an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ at B.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we get the inequality for the length of side $AC$:\n$h < AC < a$\n$S \\sin(30^{\\circ}) < AC < S$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Known Values and Decode S**\n\nWe are given that $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 1/2$. Substituting this into the inequality, we get:\n$\\frac{S}{2} < AC < S$\n\nThe problem states that $S = SNYWR$. This appears to be a placeholder or a puzzle. A common convention in such math problems is to assign numerical values to letters based on their alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) and then sum them up.\n*   S is the 19th letter of the alphabet.\n*   N is the 14th letter.\n*   Y is the 25th letter.\n*   W is the 23rd letter.\n*   R is the 18th letter.\n\nSo, $S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Inequality and Count the Integers**\n\nNow we substitute $S=99$ into our inequality for $AC$:\n$\\frac{99}{2} < AC < 99$\n$49.5 < AC < 99$\n\nWe are asked for the number of *integer* values of $AC$. The integers in this interval must be greater than 49.5 and less than 99.\n*   The smallest integer value for $AC$ is 50.\n*   The largest integer value for $AC$ is 98.\n\nThe set of possible integer values for $AC$ is $\\{50, 51, 52, \\dots, 98\\}$.\nTo count the number of integers in this range, we use the formula: (Last Integer) - (First Integer) + 1.\nNumber of values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49$.\n\nThus, there are 49 integer values for $AC$ for which there are two possible values for side length $AB$."
