    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe user wants to know a specific number for a specific ballet step (\"pas de Balanchine\") performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific role (\"Jete Woman solo\") from a specific ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe) for a specific company and year (Semperoper Ballett, 2015).\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Define the Key Elements\n*   **The Dancer and Performance:** Svetlana Gileva was a Principal Dancer with the Semperoper Ballett. The specified performance is the \"Jete Woman\" solo from 2015. This variation is one of the most famous in the ballet.\n*   **The Choreography:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is a seminal work by William Forsythe. It is known for deconstructing and pushing the limits of classical ballet technique.\n*   **The Ballet Step: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**: This is the most crucial point to analyze. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is not an official, codified step in the ballet syllabus like a \"grand jeté\" or \"plié.\" It is a descriptive term for a signature lunge movement frequently used by choreographer George Balanchine and later adapted by others like Forsythe. It is characterized by a deep, sharp lunge onto a bent front leg, with the back leg extended straight and turned out from the hip. It often has a dynamic, almost off-balance quality.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Jete Woman\" Solo\nThe variation for the \"Jete Woman\" is iconic and is primarily defined by a different, extremely demanding step: a traveling diagonal series of seven powerful *grand jetés*. The name of the role itself (\"Jete Woman\") points to this focus. The choreography for this specific solo emphasizes explosive jumps, high extensions, speed, and sharp changes of direction. The transitions between the jumps are swift and preparatory for the next leap, rather than settling into distinct poses.\n\n### Step 4: Search for the \"Pas de Balanchine\" Step in the Solo\nUpon careful review of available recordings of Svetlana Gileva performing this specific solo, we must meticulously look for the \"pas de Balanchine\" lunge as defined above.\n1.  The solo's main section consists of the famous series of seven traveling *grand jetés*. The landings from these jumps are on one leg, immediately flowing into a preparation (often a *chassé* or *glissade*) for the next jump. She does not land in or hold a distinct \"pas de Balanchine\" lunge pose after the jetés.\n2.  The choreography preceding and following the jeté sequence involves complex, angular footwork, off-balance turns, and extreme extensions. While there are deep pliés and wide stances, these movements are part of the continuous, fluid Forsythe style and do not constitute the specific, punctuated \"pas de Balanchine\" lunge.\n3.  It's important to distinguish this solo from other variations within the same ballet. For instance, the male solo sometimes referred to as the \"Gigue\" solo famously *does* contain repeated, sharp lunges that are clear examples of Forsythe's take on the \"pas de Balanchine.\" The Jete Woman's choreography, however, has a different vocabulary and focus.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion of the Analysis\nThe \"Jete Woman\" solo in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is not choreographed to include the step known as a \"pas de Balanchine.\" Its choreographic identity is built around the series of grand jetés. Therefore, in the specified performance, Svetlana Gileva did not perform any pas de Balanchines.\n\n<<<0>>>"
