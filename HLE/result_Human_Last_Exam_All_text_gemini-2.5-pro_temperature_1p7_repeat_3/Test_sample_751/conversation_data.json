    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality states that the problem of transforming a system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form is dual to the problem of transforming the system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)` to controllable canonical form.\n\nLet the original system be:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe transformation to observer canonical form is `z(k) = Px(k)`, which gives:\n`z(k+1) = (PAP⁻¹)z(k) = A_o z(k)`\n`y(k) = (CP⁻¹)z(k) = C_o z(k)`\n\nThe dual system is:\n`z_d(k+1) = A_d z_d(k) + B_d u(k)` where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n\nThe transformation of the dual system to controllable canonical form is `z_c(k) = T_c⁻¹ z_d(k)`, which gives:\n`z_c(k+1) = (T_c⁻¹ A_d T_c) z_c(k) + (T_c⁻¹ B_d) u(k) = A_c z_c(k) + B_c u(k)`\n\nThe duality relations are: `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`. Our goal is to find `C_o`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System**\n\nGiven:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nLet the columns of `B_d` be `b_1` and `b_2`:\n`b_1 = [0; 1; 0]`\n`b_2 = [1; 1; 0]`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nWe form the controllability matrix `W_c = [b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...]`. We need to select `n=3` linearly independent vectors.\n1. `b_1 = [0; 1; 0]`\n2. `b_2 = [1; 1; 0]` (Linearly independent from `b_1`)\n3. `A_d*b_1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`. This vector is linearly independent from `{b_1, b_2}`.\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors. The controllability indices (`µ_1`, `µ_2`) are determined by how many vectors were taken from each input's chain.\n- From the chain of `b_1` (`b_1`, `A_d*b_1`, ...), we used 2 vectors (`b_1` and `A_d*b_1`). So, `µ_1 = 2`.\n- From the chain of `b_2`, we used 1 vector (`b_2`). So, `µ_2 = 1`.\nThe controllability indices are `{2, 1}`. (Check: `µ_1 + µ_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n`).\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Transformation Matrix `T_c` for Controllable Canonical Form**\n\nTo transform the dual system into the Luenberger controllable canonical form, the transformation matrix `T_c` is constructed using the controllability indices.\n`T_c = [A_d^(µ_1-1)*b_1, ..., A_d*b_1, b_1, A_d^(µ_2-1)*b_2, ..., b_2]`\nFor our indices `{2, 1}`:\n`T_c = [A_d*b_1, b_1, b_2]`\n`T_c = [[2, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]]`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Inverse of the Transformation Matrix `T_c⁻¹`**\n\nWe need to compute the inverse of `T_c`.\n`det(T_c) = 2(1*0 - 1*0) - 0(...) + 1(1*0 - 1*1) = -1`\nThe adjugate matrix is:\n`adj(T_c) = [[0, 0, -1], [1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, 2]]`\n`T_c⁻¹ = (1/det(T_c)) * adj(T_c) = (-1) * [[0, 0, -1], [1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, 2]]`\n`T_c⁻¹ = [[0, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the `B_c` Matrix for the Controllable Canonical Form**\n\n`B_c = T_c⁻¹ * B_d`\n`B_c = [[0, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[(0*0+0*1+1*0), (0*1+0*1+1*0)], [(-1*0+1*1+1*0), (-1*1+1*1+1*0)], [(1*0+0*1-2*0), (1*1+0*1-2*0)]]`\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**Step 7: Determine the New `C` Matrix (`C_o`) Using Duality**\n\nAccording to the duality principle, `C_o = B_c^T`.\n`C_o = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]^T`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe new matrix C for the system in observer canonical form is `[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`.\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
