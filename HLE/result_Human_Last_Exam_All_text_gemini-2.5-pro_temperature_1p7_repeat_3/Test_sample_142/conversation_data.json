    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of electrons in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We sum the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom. There are 3 H atoms, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons.\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\n$N = 6 + 14 + 3 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions / spatial orbitals (K)**\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions for the 6-31G** basis set. This basis is also denoted as 6-31G(d,p), meaning it includes 'd' polarization functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and 'p' polarization functions on hydrogen atoms. We assume standard 6-component Cartesian d-functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 2 basis functions (a split-valence representation of the 1s orbital).\n    *   The 'p' polarization adds a set of 3 p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Total per H atom = $2 + 3 = 5$ basis functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: $3 \\times 5 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C), a 2nd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part (representing 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals) provides 9 basis functions.\n    *   The 'd' polarization adds a set of 6 d-functions.\n    *   Total for C = $9 + 6 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Fluorine (F), a 2nd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The count is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Total for F = $9 + 6 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Silicon (Si), a 3rd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part (representing 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p orbitals) provides 13 basis functions.\n    *   The 'd' polarization adds a set of 6 d-functions.\n    *   Total for Si = $13 + 6 = 19$ basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (which is the number of spatial orbitals, K) is the sum for all atoms:\n$K = 15 (\\text{from 3H}) + 15 (\\text{from C}) + 15 (\\text{from F}) + 19 (\\text{from Si}) = 64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the spin state (S)**\n\nA full CI calculation is performed for a specific total spin quantum number, S. For $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with 32 electrons (an even number), the ground state is a singlet state, meaning the total spin S = 0.\n\n**Step 4: Use the formula for the number of CSFs**\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with N electrons, K spatial orbitals, and a total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. For a singlet state (S=0), the formula is:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1}\\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final number**\n\nWe substitute our values (N=32, K=64, S=0) into the formula. Here, $N/2 = 16$.\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 655,005,684,550$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 213,879,407,200$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 1,849,427,815,200$\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation:\n*   $(\\binom{64}{16})^2 = (655,005,684,550)^2 = 429,032,408,704,250,280,250,000$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (213,879,407,200) \\times (1,849,427,815,200) = 395,460,596,001,004,142,400,000$\n\nFinally, we subtract the two results:\n$N_{CSF} = 429,032,408,704,250,280,250,000 - 395,460,596,001,004,142,400,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 33,571,812,703,246,137,850,000$\n\nThis number can be expressed in scientific notation as approximately $3.357 \\times 10^{22}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Electron Count:** Accurately summing the electrons from each atom is crucial.\n2.  **Basis Function Count:** The number of functions per atom depends on the basis set definition. It is important to know the conventions, such as using 6 Cartesian d-functions for the `**` or `(d,p)` notation in Pople-style basis sets and correctly counting functions for second-row vs. third-row elements.\n3.  **Spin State:** For an even-electron molecule, the question implicitly asks for the number of singlet CSFs unless otherwise specified.\n4.  **Correct Formula:** The subtraction-based formula for the number of CSFs is the most direct and robust method, as it is guaranteed to produce an integer. Other algebraically equivalent forms can be susceptible to floating-point errors or implicit assumptions that may not hold.\n5.  **Large Number Arithmetic:** The calculation involves extremely large numbers, requiring a computational tool capable of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic to avoid overflow or precision errors.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe number of CSFs in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set is 33,571,812,703,246,137,850,000.\n\n<<<3.357181270324614e+22>>>"
