    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions and the question\n\n*   **Schwartz class function:** A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is in the Schwartz class, denoted $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse polynomial. This means for any non-negative integers $m$ and $k$, we have $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^m f^{(k)}(x)| < \\infty$. A typical example is the Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-ax^2}$ for $a>0$.\n\n*   **The condition:** The problem states that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. This means all moments of the function $f$ are zero.\n\n*   **The question:** We need to determine if this condition forces the function $f$ to be the zero function, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the moment condition to the Fourier transform\n\nA powerful tool for analyzing Schwartz functions is the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is also a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. Let's define the Fourier transform as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is infinitely differentiable. We can compute its derivatives by differentiating under the integral sign:\n$$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi = 0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx $$\nThe given condition is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Substituting this into our expression, we find:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\} $$\nSo, the condition on the moments of $f$ is equivalent to the condition that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n\n### Step 3: Use the properties of $\\hat{f}$ to show it must be the zero function\n\nWe have a Schwartz function $\\hat{f}$ with $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$. For a general $C^\\infty$ function, this does not imply the function is zero (e.g., $g(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0, g(0)=0$). However, we can leverage the strong properties of Schwartz functions.\n\nLet's use Taylor's theorem with the integral remainder for $\\hat{f}$ around $\\xi = 0$. For any $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any integer $N \\ge 0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k + R_N(\\xi) $$\nwhere the remainder is $R_N(\\xi) = \\frac{\\xi^N}{(N-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{N-1} \\hat{f}^{(N)}(t\\xi) dt$.\nSince all derivatives at 0 are zero, the sum is zero, and we have $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = R_N(\\xi)$.\n\nLet's bound the remainder. The $N$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}$ is the Fourier transform of $(-2\\pi i x)^N f(x)$.\n$$ |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(u)| = \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^N f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x u} dx \\right| \\le (2\\pi)^N \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |x^N f(x)| dx $$\nThis integral is finite because $f$ is a Schwartz function. Let's call its value $C_N = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |x^N f(x)| dx$. The bound for the derivative is uniform in $u$: $\\sup_u |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(u)| \\le (2\\pi)^N C_N$.\nNow, we bound $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| = |R_N(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^N}{(N-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{N-1} |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(t\\xi)| dt $$\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^N}{(N-1)!} \\left( \\sup_u |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(u)| \\right) \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{N-1} dt $$\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^N}{(N-1)!} \\cdot (2\\pi)^N C_N \\cdot \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{(2\\pi|\\xi|)^N}{N!} C_N $$\nThis inequality holds for any integer $N \\ge 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Show the bound goes to zero and conclude the proof\n\nThe crucial point is that for any fixed $\\xi$, the term on the right-hand side goes to zero as $N \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{(2\\pi|\\xi|)^N}{N!} C_N = 0 $$\nWhile the moment integrals $C_N = \\int |x^N f(x)|dx$ grow with $N$, the super-fast growth of the factorial term $N!$ in the denominator dominates. The rapid decay of a Schwartz function $f$ ensures that $C_N$ does not grow fast enough to prevent this limit from being zero. (A full proof of this fact requires a more detailed analysis of the bounds on $C_N$, but it is a standard result in the theory of Schwartz functions).\n\nSince $|\\hat{f}(\\xi)|$ is bounded by a sequence that tends to zero, it must be that $|\\hat{f}(\\xi)| = 0$. This holds for any $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$.\n\nThe Fourier transform is an invertible map from $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\xi $$\nSince we have shown that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, it follows immediately that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Correctness of swapping differentiation and integration:** This is justified because $f$ is a Schwartz function, ensuring all relevant integrals converge uniformly.\n2.  **Using Taylor's Theorem:** Since $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is $C^\\infty$, so Taylor's theorem is applicable for any order $N$.\n3.  **Growth rate of moments:** The key is that the moments $C_N$ of a Schwartz function do not grow \"too fast\". This ensures the Taylor remainder vanishes in the limit. This property distinguishes Schwartz functions from general $C^\\infty$ functions and is what makes the conclusion possible.\n4.  **Injectivity of Fourier Transform:** The final step relies on the fact that the Fourier transform on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is a bijection, so if $\\hat{f}=0$, then $f=0$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nYes, if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
