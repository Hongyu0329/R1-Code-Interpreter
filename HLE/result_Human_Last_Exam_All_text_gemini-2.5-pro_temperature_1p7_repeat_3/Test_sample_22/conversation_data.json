    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the key terms:**\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A score that aggregates the effects of many genetic variants (SNPs) to predict an individual's phenotype. It is constructed using effect sizes (weights) for each SNP that are *estimated* from a large-scale genetic study, typically a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n    *   **Predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained:** This is the R-squared (R²) value obtained when you correlate the PGS with the actual phenotype in an independent test sample. It quantifies what proportion of the differences in the trait among people can be accounted for by the PGS. Let's call this **R²_PGS**.\n    *   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that represents the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is explained by the *additive effects of all the SNPs considered together*. It is the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling on the amount of variance that could ever be explained by a perfect linear predictor using that specific set of SNPs. It assumes you know the *true* effect size of every SNP, not the *estimated* ones.\n\n2.  **Compare the two concepts:**\n    *   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the **target**. It's the maximum possible predictive power we could ever hope to achieve with a linear model of the given SNPs. It's a theoretical maximum based on the true, underlying genetic architecture.\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS (R²_PGS) is the **achieved** predictive power. It's what we actually get when we build a model using the best available data.\n\n3.  **Identify why there is a difference:**\n    *   The core reason for the difference lies in the process of building the PGS. The weights used in the PGS are *estimates* from a discovery GWAS of a *finite* sample size.\n    *   Because the sample size is finite, these estimated effect sizes will have some degree of error (sampling noise) and will not be identical to the true effect sizes.\n    *   Other factors also contribute to this gap: imperfect statistical methods to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD), potential mismatch in the genetic ancestry between the discovery and target samples, and the fact that not all causal SNPs might be included or accurately tagged.\n    *   A model built with imperfect, noisy weights (the PGS) will inherently be less accurate than a theoretical perfect model built with the true, unknown weights (the model that h²_SNP represents).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the word \"necessarily\":**\n    *   The term \"necessarily\" implies that the R²_PGS must always be lower than h²_SNP, without exception.\n    *   In theory, if the discovery GWAS had an infinite sample size, the estimated effect sizes would converge to the true effect sizes. In this hypothetical and impossible scenario, the R²_PGS could become equal to the h²_SNP.\n    *   However, since any real-world or practically conceivable scenario involves a finite sample size, there will always be some estimation error. This error ensures that the predictive ability of the constructed PGS will be lower than the theoretical maximum.\n    *   Therefore, in any practical sense, the relationship R²_PGS < h²_SNP holds true. The variance explained by the PGS is \"necessarily lower\" because the imperfection of the input data (the estimated effect sizes) is a necessary consequence of working with finite samples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the theoretical ceiling for prediction. A polygenic score is an attempt to reach that ceiling, but it is limited by real-world constraints, most notably the finite sample size of the studies used to create it. This limitation means its predictive ability will inevitably fall short of the theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True>>>"
