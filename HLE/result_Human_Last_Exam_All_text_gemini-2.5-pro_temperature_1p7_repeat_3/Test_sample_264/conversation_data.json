    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Set up a coordinate system for the first cube.**\nLet the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, be placed in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we can define its boundaries by the inequalities:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\nThis cube has a side length of 1 and its volume is 1³.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe problem states that the second cube (Cube B) is shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first one.\n*   A \"main diagonal\" of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For Cube A placed as described, a main diagonal connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1).\n*   The vector representing this main diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   The most natural interpretation of \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is a displacement by a vector that is 1/2 of the diagonal vector **d**.\n*   Therefore, the shift vector **s** is (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nCube B is identical to Cube A but is shifted by the vector **s**. To find its boundaries, we add the components of **s** to the boundaries of Cube A:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. This means its coordinates must satisfy the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously. We find the intersection of the coordinate ranges:\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The intersection of [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The intersection of [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The intersection of [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n\nThe region of intersection is therefore a cuboid defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe shape of the intersection is a smaller cube. The side length of this cube in each dimension is the length of the intersecting intervals:\n*   Side length = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nThe volume of a cube is calculated as (side length)³.\n*   Volume = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the \"Shift\"**: This is the most crucial part of the problem.\n    *   One interpretation is the one used above: the shift vector is **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This implies a shift distance of ||**s**|| = sqrt((1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)²) = √3/2. The length of the main diagonal is √3, so this shift distance is exactly half the length of the diagonal. This makes the interpretation consistent.\n    *   Another possible interpretation is a shift *distance* of 1/2 along the diagonal's direction. This would mean a shift vector of length 1/2, which would be (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)). This leads to a much more complex calculation and an irrational answer, which is less likely for this type of problem. The chosen interpretation is standard for such questions and leads to a clean, rational answer.\n\n2.  **Choice of Main Diagonal**: A cube has four main diagonals (e.g., from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), from (1,0,0) to (0,1,1), etc.). Due to the symmetry of the cube, shifting along any of these main diagonals by the same proportional amount will result in an intersection with the same volume. For example, shifting by **s** = (-1/2, 1/2, 1/2) would lead to an intersection defined by [0, 1/2] x [1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1], which also has a volume of (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n3.  **Visualization**: The first cube (Cube A) occupies the region [0,1]³. The second cube (Cube B) occupies [1/2, 3/2]³. The intersection is the small cube at the corner of Cube A that is furthest from the origin, occupying the region [1/2, 1]³.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the volume of the intersection is the volume of a cube with side length 1/2.\nVolume = (Side Length)³\nVolume = (1/2)³\nVolume = 1/8\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
