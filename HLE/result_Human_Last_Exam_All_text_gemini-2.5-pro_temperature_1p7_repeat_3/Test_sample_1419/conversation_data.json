    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the theory and define the coupling constants**\n\nWe consider the Euclidean Lagrangian for a single scalar field $\\phi$ in $d = 4-\\epsilon$ dimensions:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_0^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nHere, $\\lambda_0$ is the bare coupling constant. From dimensional analysis, the action $S=\\int d^d x \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. The dimensions of the terms are:\n*   $[d^d x] = M^{-d}$ (where M is Mass)\n*   $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$\n*   $[\\phi] = M^{d/2-1}$\nFor the interaction term $\\int d^d x \\lambda_0 \\phi^4$ to be dimensionless, the coupling $\\lambda_0$ must have mass dimension $[\\lambda_0] = M^{4-d} = M^\\epsilon$.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) analysis is performed using a dimensionless coupling constant. We introduce an arbitrary momentum scale $\\mu$ to define a dimensionless renormalized coupling, which we denote as $u$. The physical, dimensionful, renormalized coupling $\\lambda$ is related to $u$ by:\n$$ \\lambda(\\mu) = \\mu^\\epsilon u(\\mu) $$\nThe goal is to find the beta function for $u$, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$, and then find its non-trivial fixed point $u^*$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the beta function to the renormalization constants**\n\nIn the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme, the bare coupling $\\lambda_0$ is related to the renormalized dimensionless coupling $u$ via a renormalization constant $Z_u$:\n$$ \\lambda_0 = Z_u(u, \\epsilon) \\mu^\\epsilon u $$\nThe bare coupling $\\lambda_0$ is independent of the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. Therefore, its derivative with respect to $\\mu$ must be zero.\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d\\lambda_0}{d\\mu} = 0 $$\nApplying this condition:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} (Z_u \\mu^\\epsilon u) = (\\mu \\frac{dZ_u}{d\\mu}) \\mu^\\epsilon u + Z_u (\\epsilon \\mu^\\epsilon u) + Z_u (\\mu^\\epsilon \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}) = 0 $$\nIn the MS scheme, $Z_u$ depends on $\\mu$ only implicitly through $u$. Thus, $\\mu \\frac{dZ_u}{d\\mu} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial Z_u}{\\partial u}\\frac{du}{d\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial Z_u}{\\partial u}\\beta(u)$. Substituting this and $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Z_u}{\\partial u}\\beta(u) \\mu^\\epsilon u + Z_u \\epsilon \\mu^\\epsilon u + Z_u \\mu^\\epsilon \\beta(u) = 0 $$\nDividing by $Z_u \\mu^\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\beta(u) u \\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_u}{\\partial u} + \\epsilon u + \\beta(u) = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\beta(u)$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\frac{\\epsilon u}{1 + u \\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_u}{\\partial u}} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the one-loop vertex correction and the renormalization constant $Z_u$**\n\nThe beta function depends on $Z_u$, which is determined by the divergences in the theory. At one-loop, the divergence in $\\phi^4$ theory comes from the correction to the four-point vertex function. The vertex from the Lagrangian term $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ is $-\\lambda$. The one-loop correction consists of three diagrams (s, t, u channels), giving a total correction:\n$$ \\delta\\Gamma^{(4)} = \\frac{3(-\\lambda)^2}{2} \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{k^2 (k-p)^2} $$\nUsing dimensional regularization, the integral has a pole as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. The divergent part of the integral is:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{k^2 (k-p)^2} \\Big|_{\\text{div}} = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\nSo the divergent part of the one-loop vertex correction is:\n$$ \\delta\\Gamma^{(4)}_{\\text{div}} = \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{2} \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon} = \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\nThe MS scheme introduces a counterterm $\\delta\\lambda$ to cancel this divergence. The bare coupling $\\lambda_0$ is related to the renormalized coupling $\\lambda$ by $\\lambda_0 = \\lambda + \\delta\\lambda$. The cancellation requires $\\delta\\lambda = \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}$.\nRelating this to our dimensionless coupling $u$ ($\\lambda = u\\mu^\\epsilon$), the counterterm becomes $\\delta\\lambda = \\frac{3(u\\mu^\\epsilon)^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}$.\nThe renormalization constant $Z_u$ is defined by $\\lambda_0 = Z_u \\lambda = Z_u u \\mu^\\epsilon$. To first order, we have:\n$$ \\lambda_0 = \\lambda + \\delta\\lambda = u\\mu^\\epsilon + \\frac{3(u\\mu^\\epsilon)^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\nComparing the two expressions for $\\lambda_0$, we find:\n$$ Z_u = 1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u^2) $$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the beta function**\n\nNow we can compute $\\beta(u)$ using the formula from Step 2. First, let's find the derivative term:\n$$ \\ln Z_u = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) \\approx \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_u}{\\partial u} \\approx u \\left(\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) = \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $\\beta(u)$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\frac{\\epsilon u}{1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}} $$\nWe are looking for the leading order expression for the fixed point, which is of order $\\epsilon$. We need to expand $\\beta(u)$ to order $u^2$.\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u \\left(1 - \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u^2/\\epsilon^2)\\right) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3/\\epsilon) $$\nSo, the one-loop beta function is:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\n\n**Step 5: Find the fixed point coupling $u^*$**\n\nThe fixed point $u^*$ is defined by the condition that the beta function is zero, $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial (Gaussian) fixed point $u^*=0$. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which we find by dividing by $u^*$:\n$$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nSolving for $u^*$:\n$$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\nThis is the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon = 4-d$."
