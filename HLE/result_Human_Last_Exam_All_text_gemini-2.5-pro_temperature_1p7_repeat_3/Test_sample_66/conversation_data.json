    "This problem asks for the maximal possible rank of a matrix derived from an image of the flag of Tonga. Let's analyze the structure of this matrix step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Flag of Tonga\nFirst, we need to know the design of the flag of Tonga. The flag has a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Within this white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Matrix\nWe create a matrix, let's call it `M`, from an image of this flag. Every red pixel in the image is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. The dimensions of the matrix, say `H` x `W`, depend on the resolution of the image, but we can analyze its structure regardless of the exact dimensions, as long as the resolution is high enough to capture all the flag's features.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of the Matrix\nThe matrix `M` will have a block structure that mirrors the flag's design. The flag is divided into a canton in the top-left and the main red field everywhere else. The canton itself is divided into white areas and a red cross.\n\nThis structure means that the rows of the matrix `M` can only have one of two possible patterns:\n1.  **Row Type 1:** A row that passes entirely through a red area. This includes rows in the main red field of the flag and rows that pass through the vertical bar of the red cross inside the canton. Every entry in such a row will be `a`.\n    *   Row Type 1 vector: `[a, a, a, ..., a]`\n\n2.  **Row Type 2:** A row that passes through the white part of the canton. Such a row will also pass through the horizontal bar of the red cross and the main red field to the right of the canton. This means the row will be composed of sections of `b`'s (for the white areas) and `a`'s (for the red cross and the main field). For instance, it could look like `[b,...,b, a,...,a, b,...,b, a,...,a]`.\n    *   Row Type 2 vector: A vector containing both `a`'s and `b`'s in a specific pattern.\n\nCrucially, all rows of Type 1 are identical to each other. Similarly, all rows of Type 2 are identical to each other.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Rank of the Matrix\nThe rank of a matrix is defined as the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Since the entire matrix `M` is constructed from repetitions of just two distinct row vectors (`Row Type 1` and `Row Type 2`), the row space of `M` is spanned by these two vectors.\n\nThe dimension of the row space, and thus the rank of the matrix, is the number of linearly independent vectors in the spanning set `{Row Type 1, Row Type 2}`. Therefore, the rank of `M` can be at most 2.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Maximal Possible Rank\nThe question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. This means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the number of linearly independent row types. The rank will be 2 if `Row Type 1` and `Row Type 2` are linearly independent. The rank will be 1 or 0 if they are linearly dependent.\n\n*   **When are the rows linearly dependent?**\n    `Row Type 1` and `Row Type 2` are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let `R1` be the vector for `Row Type 1` and `R2` for `Row Type 2`. They are dependent if `R2 = k * R1` for some scalar `k`.\n    *   `R1 = [a, a, ..., a]`\n    *   `R2` is a vector containing some entries equal to `a` and some equal to `b`.\n    For the equality `R2 = k * R1` to hold, we need `a = k*a` (for the positions where `R2` has an `a`) and `b = k*a` (for the positions where `R2` has a `b`).\n    *   If `a ≠ 0`, the equation `a = k*a` forces `k = 1`. Substituting this into the second equation gives `b = 1*a`, so `b = a`.\n    *   Thus, if `a ≠ 0` and `a = b`, the two row types are linearly dependent (in fact, they are identical), and the rank is 1.\n    *   If `a = 0`, then `R1` is the zero vector. The row space is spanned by `R2` alone, so the rank is 1 (as long as `b ≠ 0`, making `R2` a non-zero vector). If `a=b=0`, the rank is 0.\n\n*   **When are the rows linearly independent?**\n    The rows are linearly independent if they are not linearly dependent. Based on the above, this happens whenever `a ≠ b` (and we are not in the special case `a=0`).\n    *   **Example:** Let `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n        *   `R1 = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`\n        *   `R2` is a vector of `0`s and `1`s (e.g., `[0,...,0, 1,...,1, 0,...,0, 1,...,1]`).\n        Clearly, `R2` is not a scalar multiple of `R1`. They are linearly independent, and the rank is 2.\n    *   **Example:** Let `a = 2` and `b = 1`.\n        *   `R1 = [2, 2, 2, ..., 2]`\n        *   `R2` is a vector of `1`s and `2`s.\n        Again, `R2` cannot be a scalar multiple of `R1` because that would require `a=b`. They are linearly independent, and the rank is 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe rank of the matrix can be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the values of `a` and `b`. To achieve the maximal rank, we must choose `a` and `b` such that the two distinct row types are linearly independent. This is the case whenever `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`. Since it is possible to achieve a rank of 2, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
