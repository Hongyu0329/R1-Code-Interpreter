    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Target Cryptosystem:** The question is about **symmetric key cryptography**. In this system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. A common example is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\n2.  **Understand the Standard Attack Method (Brute-Force):** The most fundamental way to \"crack\" a symmetric key without any other vulnerability is a brute-force attack. This involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found.\n    *   For a key of length `n` bits, there are 2^n possible keys.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Attack with a Classical Computer:** A classical computer would need to perform, on average, 2^(n-1) operations to find the correct key. The \"security level\" is therefore said to be `n` bits, as the complexity of the attack is on the order of O(2^n). A 128-bit key (like AES-128) provides 128-bit security, which is considered computationally infeasible for any current or foreseeable classical computer.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Attack with a Quantum Computer:** The question specifies the threat is an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This implies the attacker has a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running known quantum algorithms.\n    *   The most relevant quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric keys is **Grover's algorithm**.\n    *   Grover's algorithm provides a **quadratic speedup** for unstructured search problems like brute-forcing a key.\n    *   Instead of O(2^n) operations, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately O(√2^n) = **O(2^(n/2))** operations.\n\n5.  **Quantify the Impact on Security Level:** This quadratic speedup means that Grover's algorithm effectively **halves the security level (in bits)** of a symmetric key.\n    *   A 128-bit key, which has 128 bits of security against classical computers, only has 128/2 = **64 bits of security** against a quantum computer. A 64-bit security level (2^64 operations) is considered potentially breakable by a sufficiently motivated adversary with significant resources, and certainly not secure for the long term.\n\n6.  **Determine the Required Post-Quantum Security Level:** To be considered secure, a cryptosystem should provide at least a **128-bit security level**, even against quantum adversaries. This means an attack should require at least 2^128 computational steps.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length:** We need to find the minimum key length `n` such that the quantum attack complexity is at least 2^128.\n    *   Quantum Attack Complexity = 2^(n/2)\n    *   We set our security goal: 2^(n/2) ≥ 2^128\n    *   Solving the inequality for `n`:\n        *   n/2 ≥ 128\n        *   n ≥ 256\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Arbitrarily Powerful\"**: This phrase doesn't mean infinitely powerful. In cryptography, it means the adversary has a machine capable of efficiently executing the best-known theoretical attacks (like Grover's algorithm). If the adversary were infinitely powerful, no finite key would be secure.\n*   **Minimum Length**: The question asks for the *minimum* required length. While a 512-bit key is also secure (providing 256 bits of quantum security), 256 bits is the minimum standard for achieving the widely accepted 128-bit security benchmark.\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography**: This analysis is specific to symmetric keys. Asymmetric cryptography (like RSA and ECC) is broken much more catastrophically by Shor's algorithm, rendering current key sizes completely insecure. They require entirely new post-quantum algorithms, not just longer keys.\n\nBased on the analysis, a symmetric key of 128 bits is insufficient. To restore the 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length must be doubled. Therefore, the minimum required key length is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
