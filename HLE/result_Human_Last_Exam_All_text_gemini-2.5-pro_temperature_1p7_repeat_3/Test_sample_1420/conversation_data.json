    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theoretical Framework**\nThe question is situated within the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory for critical phenomena. The standard model for studying such phenomena is the O(n) vector model (or Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\\phi^4$ theory). The scaling exponents are universal quantities that depend on the spatial dimension `d` and the number of spin components `n`, but not on the microscopic details of the system.\n\n**2. The Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a powerful RG technique used to calculate critical exponents. It involves performing a perturbative expansion in the parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, where $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**: For the O(n) model, the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take their mean-field theory values.\n*   **Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$)**: For this problem, the spatial dimension is $d=3$. Therefore, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**A careful point**: The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally valid for small $\\epsilon$. Applying it for $\\epsilon=1$ is an approximation, but it's a standard procedure that often yields remarkably good estimates for the true values of the exponents in $d=3$.\n\n**3. The Hyperscaling Relation**\nIn RG theory, critical exponents are not independent but are connected through scaling relations. The specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ via the hyperscaling relation:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ from the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**4. The Correlation Length Exponent ($\\nu$ )**\nA one-loop RG calculation for the O(n) model provides the following expression for the exponent $\\nu$ as a series in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**A careful point**: This result is for the general O(n) model. The number of spin components, `n`, is a parameter in the theory (e.g., $n=1$ for the Ising model, $n=2$ for the XY model).\n\n**5. Deriving the Expression for $\\alpha$**\nWe now substitute the expressions for $d=4-\\epsilon$ and $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation. We are interested in the first-order result in $\\epsilon$, so we will discard terms of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher.\n\n$2 - \\alpha = (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nExpanding the product on the right-hand side:\n$2 - \\alpha = (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + \\left( 4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon - \\left( \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nNow, we simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\alpha$:\n$2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nSolving for $\\alpha$:\n$-\\alpha = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = -\\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nThis is the general expression for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Final Value for d=3**\nWe now use the specific values for our problem: $d=3$, which means $\\epsilon = 1$.\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}$\n\n**A careful point**: The question does not specify the number of spin components, `n`. In such cases, it is conventional to consider the most fundamental and common case, which is the Ising model corresponding to $n=1$.\n\nFor the Ising model ($n=1$):\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in $d=3$ calculated to the first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the Ising model ($n=1$) is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
