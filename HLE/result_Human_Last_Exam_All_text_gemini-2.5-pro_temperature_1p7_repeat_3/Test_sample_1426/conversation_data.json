    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B♭ major, Op. 4\". We need to find the very end of the piece, which is in the 4th movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco). We must focus on the part written for the first violins (\"Violino I\").\n\n**Step 2: Consult the Orchestral Score**\nTo find the exact notes, we must refer to the full orchestral score. The symphony ends in the key of B-flat major. The final bars are very loud and energetic (*fortississimo*).\n\n**Step 3: Locate the First Violin Part in the Final Measures**\nOn the last page of the score, we trace the musical line for the first violins. The phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the last three distinct notes that are played in sequence by the first violins, leading to the final silence.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Three Notes in Sequence**\nBy reading the music backwards from the final double bar line, we can identify the last three notes the first violins play:\n\n1.  **The final note:** In the very last measure, the first violins play a single, long whole note. This note is **B♭4** (the B-flat located in the middle of the treble clef staff).\n2.  **The second-to-last note:** In the measure immediately preceding the final one, the first violins play a long, high note. This note is **B♭5** (an octave higher than the final note).\n3.  **The third-to-last note:** Just before playing the B♭5, the first violins have a quick ascending passage. The last note of this run, and therefore the third-to-last note played in the piece, is **A5**.\n\nSo, the last three notes played in chronological order are A5, then B♭5, and finally B♭4.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Pitches of the Three Notes**\nThe three notes we have identified are A5, B♭5, and B♭4. In scientific pitch notation, a higher number indicates a higher octave.\n\n*   **B♭4:** This note is in the fourth octave.\n*   **A5:** This note is in the fifth octave, making it significantly higher than B♭4.\n*   **B♭5:** This note is also in the fifth octave and is slightly higher than A5.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Lowest Note**\nComparing the three notes, B♭4 is in a lower octave than both A5 and B♭5. Therefore, B♭4 is the lowest of the three.\n\n<<<B♭ (B-flat)>>>"
