The density profile is given by the linear function \( \rho(z) = \bar{\rho} + K \cdot g \left( \frac{H}{2} - z \right) \), where \( \bar{\rho} \) is the average mass density and \( K \) is a constant determined by the thermodynamic properties and van der Waals interactions of the gas mixture. The explicit formula for \( K \) is \( K = \frac{m_A^2 C_{22} - 2 m_A m_B C_{12} + m_B^2 C_{11}}{C_{11}C_{22} - C_{12}^2} \), with \( C_{11} = \frac{k_B T}{\bar{n}_A} + 2(k_B T b'_{AA} - a'_{AA}) \), \( C_{22} = \frac{k_B T}{\bar{n}_B} + 2(k_B T b'_{BB} - a'_{BB}) \), and \( C_{12} = k_B T (b'_{AA} + b'_{BB}) - 2a'_{AB} \). All parameters in these expressions are defined in the step-by-step analysis based on the provided values.
