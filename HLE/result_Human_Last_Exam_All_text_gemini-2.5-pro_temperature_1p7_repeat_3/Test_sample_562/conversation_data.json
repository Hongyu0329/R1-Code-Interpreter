    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Character:** The character in question is 謄.\n\n2.  **Decompose the Character:** We need to break down the character 謄 into its fundamental components. This type of character, with a left-right structure, is known as a *hen-tsukuri* (偏旁) character.\n    *   The left-hand component (the *hen* or 偏) is **言**.\n    *   The right-hand component (the *tsukuri* or 旁) is **朕**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In most *hen-tsukuri* characters, the left-hand component, the *hen*, serves as the radical. The radical typically indicates the general semantic category to which the character belongs.\n    *   The left part, **言**, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n    *   The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" which is an action related to words.\n    *   Therefore, the radical of 謄 is **言**.\n\n4.  **Find the Japanese Name of the Radical:** The radical 言 has a general name and a specific name for when it appears as a left-side component.\n    *   The general name is **gen** (げん).\n    *   When it appears on the left side of a character, it is called **gonben** (ごんべん). The \"gon\" is a sound change from \"gen\", and \"ben\" is a variant reading of \"hen\" (偏).\n\n5.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn:** The question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name. Following the example \"Onnahen,\" the name that describes the radical's position is the most appropriate one.\n    *   The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is **Gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Character Recognition:** It is crucial to correctly identify and parse the character 謄. It is composed of 言 and 朕.\n*   **Radical Position:** Radicals have different names depending on their position in a character (e.g., *hen* for left, *tsukuri* for right, *kanmuri* for top). Using the correct positional name (\"Gonben\") is more precise, as indicated by the example \"Onnahen\" in the prompt.\n*   **Hepburn Romanization:** Ensure the Japanese name is transcribed correctly into Hepburn romanization. ごんべん is \"Gonben,\" not \"Gonben\" or \"Gon-ben\". Standard Hepburn for ん before b is 'n'.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe character is 謄. It is composed of the left part 言 and the right part 朕. The left part, 言, is the radical. The name for the 言 radical when it is on the left side of a character is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
