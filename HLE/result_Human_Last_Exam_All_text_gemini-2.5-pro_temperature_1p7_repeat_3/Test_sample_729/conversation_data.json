    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group**\n\nThe group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128. Let's denote it by $Q_{128}$.\nThe presentation of a generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ ($Q_{4n}$) is given by:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. The presentation becomes:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nLet's list some key properties of this group:\n*   The order of the group is 128.\n*   The elements can be written uniquely in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$, where $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   It has a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. This is a maximal subgroup and is normal in $Q_{128}$.\n*   The elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ are the 64 elements of the form $x^i y$.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Term \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is typically used to mean a **cyclic subgroup**. A subgroup $H$ is cyclic if there exists an element $g \\in H$ such that every element of $H$ is a power of $g$ (i.e., $H = \\langle g \\rangle$). We will proceed with this standard interpretation. The problem, therefore, is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n### **Step 3: Strategy for Counting Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nWe can count the cyclic subgroups by partitioning them into two disjoint sets:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are contained within the large cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nWe will count the number of subgroups in each set and then add them together.\n\n### **Step 4: Count Cyclic Subgroups within  $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, generated by the element $x$.\nFor any cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\nSo, we need to find the number of divisors of 64.\nThe prime factorization of 64 is $2^6$. The divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$.\nThese divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nThere are **7** divisors.\nThus, there are **7** cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64:\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle e \\rangle$ (order 1)\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $\\langle x^{8} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $\\langle x^{4} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $\\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\n### **Step 5: Count Cyclic Subgroups Not Contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nA cyclic subgroup not contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$ must be generated by an element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$. Such elements have the form $g = x^k y$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\nLet's find the order of such an element:\n$(x^k y)^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k(yx^k)y$.\nUsing the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\implies xy=yx^{-1} \\implies yx=x^{-1}y$, we can show $yx^k = x^{-k}y$.\nSo, $(x^k y)^2 = x^k(x^{-k}y)y = x^0y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\nSince $x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of $x^k y$ is not 2.\n$(x^k y)^4 = ((x^k y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\nSo, the order of every element of the form $x^k y$ is **4**.\n\nNow we need to count how many distinct subgroups are generated by these 64 elements of order 4.\nLet $H_k = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$. As a cyclic group of order 4, it has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators.\nThe generators are $g = x^k y$ and $g^3 = (x^k y)^3$.\nLet's compute $g^3$:\n$g^3 = (x^k y)^2 (x^k y) = x^{32} x^k y = x^{k+32} y$.\nSo, the two generators of $H_k$ are $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$. This means:\n$\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$.\n\nThis equality tells us that the 64 potential generators (for $k=0, ..., 63$) form pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup. The pairs are $(x^k y, x^{k+32} y)$.\nFor example:\n*   $\\langle y \\rangle = \\langle x^{32}y \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle xy \\rangle = \\langle x^{33}y \\rangle$\n*   ...\n*   $\\langle x^{31}y \\rangle = \\langle x^{63}y \\rangle$\n\nSince there are 64 such elements and they form pairs that generate the same subgroup, the number of distinct subgroups is $64 / 2 = 32$.\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from each other, as $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^j y \\rangle$ only if $j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\nThese 32 subgroups are also distinct from the 7 subgroups found in Step 4, because each of these contains elements ($x^k y$ and $x^{k+32}y$) that are not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nSo, there are **32** cyclic subgroups not contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Total Number**\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the counts from the two disjoint sets:\nTotal number = (Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups not within $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThe final answer is 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
