    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Candidates:** The first step is to list all the naturally occurring noble gases on Earth. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *   (Note: Oganesson is also a noble gas but is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not considered).\n\n2.  **Determine the Metric for \"Rarity\":** The question asks for the rarest gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This percentage is primarily determined by the gas's concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, as this is the largest reservoir of free noble gases. We will compare their atmospheric concentrations, which are stable and would not have been significantly different in 2002 than they are today.\n\n3.  **Gather Abundance Data:** Let's look at the typical abundance of each noble gas in the Earth's atmosphere, usually measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** ~9,340 ppm (or 0.934%). It is the third most common gas in our atmosphere.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm.\n    *   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\n4.  **Analyze Radon (Rn) Separately:** Radon is different from the other noble gases. It is radioactive and is formed by the natural radioactive decay of uranium and radium found in rocks and soil.\n    *   **Short Half-Life:** The most stable isotope of Radon (Radon-222) has a very short half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n    *   **Low Concentration:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon does not accumulate in the atmosphere. Its concentration is extremely low and varies by location. On average, its atmospheric concentration is on the order of 1 part per 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 part in 10^21).\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Now, let's compare the rarest of the stable noble gases (Xenon) with Radon.\n    *   Xenon (Xe) abundance: ~0.09 parts per million (9 x 10⁻⁸).\n    *   Radon (Rn) abundance: ~1 part in 10²¹ (1 x 10⁻²¹).\n\n    Comparing these values, Radon's concentration is drastically lower—by about a trillion times—than Xenon's. Therefore, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The year 2002:** This detail is not significant, as the atmospheric concentrations of noble gases are extremely stable over human timescales.\n*   **\"All terrestrial matter\":** While noble gases are also trapped in the Earth's crust, their relative rarity remains the same. Radon's fleeting existence due to its rapid decay ensures its status as the rarest element in any terrestrial reservoir at any given time.\n*   **Radioactivity:** The key distinguishing factor for Radon is its radioactivity and short half-life, which prevents it from building up to concentrations seen in the other stable noble gases.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
