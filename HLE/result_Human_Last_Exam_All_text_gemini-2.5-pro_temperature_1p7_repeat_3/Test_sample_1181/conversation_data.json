    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The character is defined by a particular feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a specific line of dialogue that reveals a character's inner state, combining nostalgia for Earth with a sense of shame or weakness about that feeling.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character and whether this sentiment aligns with their personality and role in the film.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist. The film opens with him on Earth, deeply connected to nature (the dacha, the rain, the trees). He is sent to Solaris to assess the situation. While he is deeply affected by his memories of Earth and his past with Hari, he is new to the station. The feeling of being *ashamed* after a long time of missing something is less likely to come from him, as his separation from Earth is still fresh. His struggle is more immediate and focused on the \"guest\" of his wife, Hari.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** She is not a human from Earth but a \"guest\" or \"neutrino-based replica\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no personal memories of Earth to miss. Her struggle is about her own identity, her artificial nature, and her love for Kris. Therefore, she could not miss the sound of leaves.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the Solaris station for a long time before Kris's arrival. He is depicted as jaded, philosophical, and weary. He often acts as a cynical guide to Kris, explaining the futility and psychological toll of their situation. A confession that mixes a deep, human longing (nostalgia for leaves) with a feeling of shame or foolishness for having such a \"pathetic\" sentiment in the face of their grand scientific mission fits his character perfectly. He has been isolated from Earth for years and has had a long time to reflect on his humanity.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist who is also a long-term resident of the station. He is portrayed as cold, rigidly scientific, and almost inhumanly detached. He views the \"guests\" as mere phenomena to be studied and controlled. He is actively trying to suppress emotion and human connection in favor of pure science. It is highly unlikely that he would admit to, let alone feel shame over, such a poetic and sentimental feeling.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A physiologist and Kris's friend who commits suicide just before Kris arrives. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris. In the video, he is in a state of utter despair and confusion, warning Kris about the \"guests.\" His focus is on the immediate horror and madness of the situation, not on a wistful, long-held nostalgia for Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken during a conversation between Kris and Snaut. Snaut is reflecting on humanity's purpose in space, suggesting that humans are not really seeking contact but are looking for a mirror. In this context of philosophical world-weariness, he makes a personal confession. He admits his very human, and what he considers almost embarrassingly simple, longing for Earth. The dialogue (in translation) is approximately: \"We're in a foolish position, Kris. When a man is unhappy, you can give him a shot of... some such stuff. But when his soul is aching... We have lost the sense of the pathetic, the ridiculous. I am ashamed to say it, Kris... I have been missing the rustling of leaves.\" This directly confirms Snaut as the character.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the character analysis and recalling the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
