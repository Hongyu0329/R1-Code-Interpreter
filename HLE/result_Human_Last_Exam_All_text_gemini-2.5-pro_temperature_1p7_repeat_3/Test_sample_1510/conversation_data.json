    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups:**\n    *   **Wallpaper groups** (or plane crystallographic groups) are the 17 distinct mathematical groups that describe all possible symmetric repeating patterns in a two-dimensional plane.\n    *   The **point group** of a wallpaper group consists of all the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It is found by considering the symmetry operations of the wallpaper group modulo its translational symmetries. There are 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups.\n    *   The **order** of a group is the number of symmetry operations (elements) it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the 2D Point Groups of Order 2:**\n    First, we list the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders:\n    *   **1** (C1): Identity only. Order = 1.\n    *   **2** (C2): 180° rotation. Order = 2.\n    *   **m** (C1v): Reflection across a line. Order = 2.\n    *   **3** (C3): 120° rotation. Order = 3.\n    *   **4** (C4): 90° rotation. Order = 4.\n    *   **2mm** (C2v): Two perpendicular reflection lines and a 180° rotation. Order = 4.\n    *   **6** (C6): 60° rotation. Order = 6.\n    *   **3m** (C3v): Three reflection lines at 60° to each other and a 120° rotation. Order = 6.\n    *   **4mm** (C4v): Four reflection lines and a 90° rotation. Order = 8.\n    *   **6mm** (C6v): Six reflection lines and a 60° rotation. Order = 12.\n\n    From this list, the point groups with an order of 2 are **2** and **m**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Wallpaper Groups with These Point Groups:**\n    Now, we need to find which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to the point groups **2** or **m**.\n\n    *   **Wallpaper groups with point group 2 (C2):**\n        This point group contains only a 180° rotation. The wallpaper groups with this point group have 2-fold rotation centers but no reflectional symmetry.\n        *   **p2**: This group is defined by translations and 2-fold rotation centers. Its point group is **2**.\n\n    *   **Wallpaper groups with point group m (C1v):**\n        This point group contains only a single reflection. The wallpaper groups with this point group have reflectional symmetry but no rotational symmetry (other than the trivial 360°). Note that wallpaper groups with glide reflections also fall into this category, as a glide reflection becomes a simple reflection in the point group.\n        *   **pm**: This group has parallel reflection lines. Its point group is **m**.\n        *   **pg**: This group has parallel glide-reflection lines. The point group of a glide reflection is just a reflection (m). So its point group is **m**.\n        *   **cm**: This group is based on a centered lattice and has reflection lines. Its point group is **m**.\n\n4.  **Count the Results:**\n    We have identified all the wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. Let's count them:\n    *   One group with point group **2**: `p2`\n    *   Three groups with point group **m**: `pm`, `pg`, `cm`\n\n    The total number of wallpaper groups is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper and Point Groups:** It is crucial not to confuse the wallpaper group (an infinite group of symmetries of the entire plane pattern) with its associated point group (a finite group of symmetries at a single point).\n*   **Glide Reflections:** A key point is that a wallpaper group with glide reflections (like `pg`) has a point group (`m`) that only contains simple reflections. This is because the point group ignores the translational component of the glide.\n*   **Completeness:** We have systematically checked all possible point groups of order 2 and matched them to the standard classification of the 17 wallpaper groups, ensuring no groups were missed.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. They are `p2`, `pm`, `pg`, and `cm`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
