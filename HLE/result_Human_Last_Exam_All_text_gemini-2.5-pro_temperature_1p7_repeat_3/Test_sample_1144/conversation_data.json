    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its actual momentum. This can be written as the fraction $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n*   **Particle:** Electron.\n*   **State:** It is in the first Bohr orbit, which means its principal quantum number is $n=1$.\n*   **Given Data:** The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10$ pm.\n*   **Required Calculation:** The ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**3. List Necessary Principles and Formulas**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) with the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ JÂ·s). For calculation purposes, we often use the minimum possible uncertainty, so we'll use the equality:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n*   **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** Bohr's model provides a way to calculate the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit. A key postulate is the quantization of angular momentum ($L$):\n    $L = mvr = n\\hbar$\n    where $m$ is the mass of the electron, $v$ is its velocity, $r$ is the radius of the orbit, and $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Find an expression for the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n*   Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we can rearrange the formula to solve for $\\Delta p$:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Point:** We must convert the given position uncertainty from picometers (pm) to the standard SI unit of meters (m).\n    $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n    So, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find an expression for the momentum of the electron ($p$)**\n*   The linear momentum of the electron is defined as $p = mv$.\n*   From Bohr's angular momentum postulate, $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. We can substitute $p$ into this equation: $pr = n\\hbar$.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$. The radius of this orbit, $r_1$, is known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n*   **Careful Point:** The Bohr radius is a physical constant. $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Substituting $n=1$ and $r=r_1$, the equation becomes: $p \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$.\n*   Solving for momentum $p$, we get:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n*   Now we can form the ratio using the expressions from the previous steps:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x})}{(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1})}$\n*   **Careful Point:** We can simplify this complex fraction. Notice that the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it will cancel out. This is advantageous as it reduces calculation steps and potential rounding errors.\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   Now, substitute the known values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$ into this simplified formula:\n    *   $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   Perform the final calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Ensure all units are consistent (convert pm to m).\n*   Use the correct form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$ for minimum uncertainty).\n*   Use the correct formula for momentum from the Bohr model, corresponding to the first orbit ($n=1$).\n*   Simplify the ratio algebraically before plugging in numbers to reduce calculation complexity and avoid rounding errors with constants like $\\hbar$.\n\nThe final ratio is a dimensionless quantity. Given the input precision, providing the answer to three significant figures is appropriate.\n\n2.645 rounds to 2.65.\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
