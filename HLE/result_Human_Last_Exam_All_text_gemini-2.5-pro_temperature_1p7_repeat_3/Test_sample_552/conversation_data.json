    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the person whose *lectures* were *cited* by Albert Einstein in his *1905 paper on Brownian motion*. Each of these components is crucial.\n\n2.  **Identify the Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's five famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miraculous Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Examine the Citations in the Paper:** A direct examination of this specific 1905 paper is the first logical step. A key characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers, including the one on Brownian motion and the one on special relativity, is their remarkable lack of formal citations, footnotes, or bibliographies. A review of the original German text or its English translations confirms that Einstein does **not explicitly cite anyone's work or lectures** in the 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Intellectual Basis of the Paper:** Although there is no direct citation, the paper's theoretical foundation is undeniable. Einstein's work on Brownian motion is a direct and powerful application of the **molecular-kinetic theory of heat** and **statistical mechanics**. The foremost pioneer and developer of these ideas was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Einstein's paper provided the first theoretical, and ultimately experimentally verifiable, evidence for the physical reality of atoms and molecules as envisioned by Boltzmann's statistical theories.\n\n5.  **Reconcile the Discrepancy (No Citation vs. Known Influence):** The question asks who was \"cited.\" While not cited in that specific paper, Einstein's reliance on Boltzmann's framework is clear. Furthermore:\n    *   In other related papers around the same time (e.g., his 1904 paper \"On the General Molecular Theory of Heat\"), Einstein *did* explicitly mention Boltzmann's work.\n    *   In later autobiographical writings, Einstein acknowledged the profound influence of reading Boltzmann's works.\n    *   Crucially, Boltzmann's most famous and comprehensive work on the topic was a two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **\"Cited\" is used loosely:** The question uses the word \"cited,\" but this should be interpreted as \"intellectually based upon\" or \"drew from the published works of,\" rather than a formal bibliographic citation within the paper.\n*   **\"Lectures\" refers to a Book:** The reference to \"lectures\" is very specific and points directly to Ludwig Boltzmann's influential book, *Lectures on Gas Theory*. It does not mean that Einstein physically attended lectures given by Boltzmann.\n*   **Synthesis:** Therefore, although a literal reading of the 1905 paper would yield the answer \"nobody,\" the clear and historically accepted answer, based on the intellectual foundation of the work and the title of Boltzmann's key text, points to Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\nBy synthesizing these points, we can conclude whose principles and published \"lectures\" formed the basis for Einstein's paper.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
