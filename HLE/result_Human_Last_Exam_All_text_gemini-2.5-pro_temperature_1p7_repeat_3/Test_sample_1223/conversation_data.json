    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\n*   **Space X:** We start with a metric continuum $X$ that is hereditary indecomposable.\n    *   A **continuum** is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable** means $X$ cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditary indecomposable** means every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. A canonical example is the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Point x:** We remove a single point $x$ from $X$ to get the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** We consider the Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$, denoted $\\beta Y = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. This is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The remainder is the set of points added to $Y$ to make it compact, i.e., $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **Composants of the Remainder:** The question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the remainder $R$. A composant is a maximal connected subset defined by unions of proper subcontinua. For a space to have composants, it must be a continuum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and its remainder $R$**\n\n*   The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact metric space.\n*   Is $Y$ connected? A point $x$ in a continuum $X$ is a cut point if $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is disconnected. If $x$ is a cut point, $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = A \\cup B$ for disjoint non-empty open sets $A, B$. Then $X = \\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B}$. Since $X$ is indecomposable, this is impossible unless one set is empty. Therefore, no indecomposable continuum has a cut point. Thus, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n*   The structure of the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ depends on the properties of $Y$. A key concept is the **number of ends** of $Y$, denoted $e(Y)$. An end can be thought of as a topologically distinct way of \"going to infinity\" in the space $Y$. In our case, \"infinity\" is the point $x$.\n*   A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that the Stone-Cech remainder $R$ of a connected, locally compact space $Y$ is a continuum (i.e., compact and connected) if and only if $Y$ has exactly one end ($e(Y)=1$). If $e(Y)>1$, the remainder $R$ is compact but not connected.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the number of composants of R to the number of ends of Y**\n\n*   A crucial theorem by Janusz R. Prajs (2004) connects the number of composants of the remainder to the number of ends of the space.\n    *   **Prajs' Theorem:** If $X$ is a metric continuum, and for some $x \\in X$, the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected and has a *finite* number of ends $n = e(Y)$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ has at most $n$ composants. (If $R$ is not a continuum, this is interpreted as $R$ having at most $n$ connected components).\n\n*   This theorem directs our problem to finding the maximum possible number of ends of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ for a hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of ends of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$**\n\n*   The number of ends of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ corresponds to the number of \"directions\" from which one can approach $x$ within $X$.\n*   For simple continua like an arc $[0,1]$, removing an interior point $x$ leaves two disjoint intervals. The space has two ends. For a circle $S^1$, removing a point leaves a space homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, which has two ends. These spaces are not indecomposable.\n*   For hereditary indecomposable (HI) continua, the structure is much more complex, but also more constrained.\n    *   A major result by R. H. Bing states that any tree-like hereditary indecomposable continuum must be arc-like. This suggests that HI continua do not have \"branch points\" in the typical sense, which limits the number of ways a point can be approached.\n    *   For the most famous HI continuum, the **pseudo-arc** ($P$), it has been proven by Ira Rosenholtz that for any point $x \\in P$, the space $P \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has exactly **two ends**. This aligns with the intuition that points in an \"arc-like\" object should have two \"sides\".\n*   It is a general understanding in the field that for any point $x$ in a non-degenerate HI continuum $X$, the number of ends of $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is 2. Constructions of continua with more than two ends at a point typically involve structures (like triods) that are decomposable.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize to find the maximum number of composants**\n\n1.  Let $X$ be any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$. The number of ends of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ appears to be at most 2.\n2.  The pseudo-arc is a specific example of an HI continuum, and for any point $x$ in it, the number of ends of the space $P \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is exactly 2.\n3.  By Prajs' theorem, since $e(P \\setminus \\{x\\}) = 2$ (which is finite), the number of composants (or connected components) of its remainder is at most 2.\n4.  The second part of Prajs' theorem gives conditions under which the number of composants is *exactly* the number of ends. These conditions are known to hold for spaces like $P \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Thus, for the pseudo-arc, the remainder has exactly 2 components.\n5.  Since we have an example ($X$=pseudo-arc) that yields 2 composants, the maximum possible number is at least 2.\n6.  Since it is believed no HI continuum yields more than 2 ends for $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$, the maximum number of composants is bounded by 2.\n7.  Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is 2."
