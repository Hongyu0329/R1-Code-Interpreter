    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the sequence**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\nOur goal is to find the pattern governing these numbers to determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern (like addition or subtraction)**\nLet's find the difference between consecutive terms (first-order difference).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious simple arithmetic pattern here.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a multiplicative pattern**\nThe numbers seem to be roughly doubling at each step, especially after the first term. This suggests a pattern of the form: `Next Term = 2 * Previous Term + some value`. Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23`\n*   From 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51`\n*   From 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119`\nThis confirms that the rule is `a_n = 2 * a_(n-1) + c_n`, where `c_n` is a sequence of constants.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sequence of constants**\nThe sequence of constants we found is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}.\nThis sequence seems irregular. A common feature in such puzzles is that the pattern might not start from the very first term. Let's exclude the first constant (7) and see if a pattern emerges from the rest: {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n**Step 5: Find the pattern within the new sequence of constants {1, 5, 17, ...}**\nLet's find the difference between consecutive terms in this new sequence.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are 4 and 12. This looks like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 (4 * 3 = 12).\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next terms based on the discovered pattern**\n*   The next difference in the sequence {4, 12, ...} should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n*   Now we can find the next term in the sequence of constants {1, 5, 17, ...}. It will be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n*   This predicted constant, 53, is the value we need to add to find the final answer in the original sequence.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer**\nThe next term in the main sequence is `2 * (previous term) + (next constant)`.\n*   Next Term = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   Next Term = 238 + 53\n*   Next Term = 291\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe pattern is that each number is twice the previous number plus a constant. The sequence of these constants, starting from the second one, follows a rule where their differences form a geometric progression with a ratio of 3. Following this logic, the number that should be in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
