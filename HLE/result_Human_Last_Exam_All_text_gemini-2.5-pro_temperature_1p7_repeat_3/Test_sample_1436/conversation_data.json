    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Feynman Diagram's Structure**\n\n*   **Question:** We need to find the symmetry factor for a diagram in a perturbative expansion.\n*   **Components Given:**\n    *   **Two vertices:** Let's call them `v1` and `v2`.\n    *   **Four field contractions:** These are the propagators or lines connecting the vertices.\n*   **Implied Interaction:** Since vertices in a Feynman diagram represent interactions, and there are four lines (contractions) originating from the set of two vertices, a common and simple model is a `φ⁴` theory. In this theory, each vertex has four \"legs\" or field operators. With two vertices, we have a total of 8 legs (`2 * 4 = 8`). A contraction (propagator) connects two legs. Four contractions, therefore, use up all 8 legs (`4 * 2 = 8`).\n*   **Diagram Topology:** All legs are contracted internally, meaning there are no external lines. The diagram is a vacuum diagram. It consists of the two vertices, `v1` and `v2`, with all four propagators running between them. This topology is often called a \"melon\" or \"figure-eight\" diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Symmetry Factor (S)**\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for the overcounting of identical diagrams that can be generated during the Wick expansion of the interaction Lagrangian. It is mathematically defined as the order of the automorphism group of the graph. In simpler terms, `S` is the number of distinct permutations of the vertices and lines that leave the diagram's structure (its connectivity) unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Symmetries of the Diagram**\n\nWe need to count all the ways we can swap the elements of our specific diagram without changing its overall appearance and connections.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry from Permuting Propagators (Lines)**\n    *   The diagram has four propagators that all connect the same two vertices, `v1` and `v2`.\n    *   Because they share the same start and end points, these four lines are indistinguishable from each other.\n    *   We can swap any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram will look identical.\n    *   The number of ways to permute four identical items is `4!` (4 factorial).\n    *   Contribution to `S` = `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symmetry from Permuting Vertices**\n    *   The diagram has two vertices, `v1` and `v2`. These vertices are connected to each other by the same set of four lines.\n    *   There is no feature that distinguishes `v1` from `v2`. If we swap the position of `v1` and `v2`, the diagram remains exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is `2!` (2 factorial).\n    *   Contribution to `S` = `2! = 2 × 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetries within a single vertex**\n    *   In `φ⁴` theory, the interaction Lagrangian term is typically written as `(λ/4!) φ⁴`. The `4!` in the denominator is there to cancel the `4!` ways you can permute the identical fields at a single vertex. When calculating the graph's overall symmetry factor `S`, this internal vertex symmetry is already accounted for by the Feynman rule for the vertex (`-iλ`). We only need to consider the symmetries of the overall graph structure (permuting whole vertices and propagators), which we have done in the two points above.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Total Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of permutations from each independent symmetry operation.\n\n*   `S = (Symmetry from permuting propagators) × (Symmetry from permuting vertices)`\n*   `S = 4! × 2!`\n*   `S = 24 × 2`\n*   `S = 48`\n\nThe symmetry factor for this diagram is 48. This value corrects for the numerical prefactors that arise from the Taylor expansion of the exponential (`1/2!` for the second-order term) and the combinatorial factors from Wick's theorem.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Identify Diagram:** Two `φ⁴` vertices connected by four propagators.\n2.  **Identify Line Symmetry:** The four propagators are identical and can be permuted. This gives a factor of `4! = 24`.\n3.  **Identify Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of `2! = 2`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Symmetry:** Multiply the factors: `S = 24 × 2 = 48`.\n\n<<<48>>>"
