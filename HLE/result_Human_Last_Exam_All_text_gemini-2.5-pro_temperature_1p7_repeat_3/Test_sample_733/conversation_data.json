    "This problem asks for the number of finite groups `G` that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Step 1: Define the key terms\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is product-free if for all `x, y ∈ S` (including `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In other words, `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`, where `S^2 = {st | s, t ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or simply, maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the conditions for a set S = {a, b}\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a set of two distinct elements in a finite group `G`.\n\n1.  **Product-Free Condition:** For `S` to be product-free, none of the products `a^2`, `ab`, `ba`, `b^2` can be equal to `a` or `b`.\n    *   This implies that `a` and `b` cannot be the identity element `e`, because if `a=e`, then `a^2 = e = a ∈ S`. So, `e ∉ S`.\n    *   So, `{a^2, ab, ba, b^2} ∩ {a, b} = ∅`.\n\n2.  **Maximality Condition:** For `S` to be maximal, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` must not be product-free.\n    *   Since `S` is already product-free, this means there must be a product of two elements from `S'` that equals an element in `S'`, where at least one of the two elements being multiplied is `g`.\n    *   Let's check the new products: `ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2`.\n    *   The maximality condition is that for every `g ∈ G \\ S`, we have `({a^2, ab, ba, b^2} ∪ {ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2}) ∩ {a, b, g} ≠ ∅`.\n    *   We can partition the condition for `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n        a) `g ∈ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`. In this case, `g` is a product of elements from `S`, so `{a,b,g}` is not product-free.\n        b) `g ∉ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`. In this case, one of `{ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2}` must be in `{a, b, g}`.\n\n### Step 3: Test small groups\n\nLet's test groups of small order to find candidates.\n\n*   `|G| < 4`: Cannot have a product-free set of size 2. `|G|=1, 2` have no subsets of size 2. `|G|=3`, `G=C_3={e,x,x^2}`. Any subset of size 2, say `{x, x^k}` with `k \\ne 1`, must contain an element and its inverse (e.g. `{x,x^2}`). The product `x*x=x^2` is in the set, so no product-free sets of size 2 exist.\n\n*   **G = C_4** (cyclic group of order 4) = `{e, x, x^2, x^3}`.\n    Let `S = {x, x^3}`.\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {x*x, x*x^3, x^3*x, x^3*x^3} = {x^2, e, e, x^2} = {e, x^2}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: `G \\ S = {e, x^2}`. For `g ∈ {e, x^2}`, `{x, x^3, g}` must not be product-free.\n        If `g=e`, `x*e=x`, so it's not product-free.\n        If `g=x^2`, `x*x=x^2`, so it's not product-free.\n    *   Yes, `S` is a maximal product-free set. So, **C_4** is a solution.\n\n*   **G = V_4** (Klein four-group) = `{e, a, b, c}` with `a^2=b^2=c^2=e, ab=c, etc.`.\n    Let `S = {a, b}`.\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2} = {e, c, c, e} = {e, c}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: `G \\ S = {e, c}`.\n        If `g=e`, `a*e=a`. Not product-free.\n        If `g=c`, `a*b=c`. Not product-free.\n    *   Yes, `S` is a maximal product-free set. So, **V_4** is a solution.\n\n*   **G = C_5** (cyclic group of order 5) = `{e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}`.\n    Let `S = {x^2, x^3}`.\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {(x^2)^2, x^2x^3, (x^3)^2} = {x^4, e, x}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: A simple sufficient condition for maximality is `G = S ∪ S^2`. Here, `S ∪ S^2 = {x^2, x^3} ∪ {x^4, e, x} = G`. This condition holds, which implies `S` is maximal. Any `g ∈ G \\ S` is in `S^2`, so `g` is a product of elements from `S`.\n    *   Yes, `S` is maximal. So, **C_5** is a solution. (Another such set is `{x, x^4}`).\n\n*   **G = C_6** (cyclic group of order 6).\n    Let `S = {x^2, x^3}`.\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {x^4, x^5, e}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: `G \\ S = {e, x, x^4, x^5}`.\n        `g=e`: not pf. `g=x^4` or `g=x^5`: in `S^2`, so not pf.\n        `g=x`: check `{x^2, x^3, x}`. The product `x^2 * x = x^3`, which is in the set. So it's not product-free.\n    *   Yes, `S` is maximal. So, **C_6** is a solution.\n\n*   **G = S_3** (symmetric group on 3 elements) = `{e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}`.\n    Let `S = {r, s}`.\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {r^2, rs, sr, s^2} = {r^2, sr^2, sr, e}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: Here, `G = S ∪ S^2`, so `S` is maximal.\n    *   Yes, `S` is maximal. So, **S_3** is a solution.\n\n*   **G = C_7** (cyclic group of order 7).\n    Let `S = {x, x^6}` (i.e., `{x, x^{-1}}`).\n    *   Product-free?: `S^2 = {x^2, e, x^5}`. `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`. Yes.\n    *   Maximal?: `G \\ S = {e, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}`.\n        `g=e, x^2, x^5`: adding these does not yield a product-free set.\n        `g=x^3`: check `{x, x^6, x^3}`. The product `(x^3)^2 = x^6`, which is in the set. Not product-free.\n        `g=x^4`: check `{x, x^6, x^4}`. The product `(x^4)^2 = x^8 = x`, which is in the set. Not product-free.\n    *   Yes, `S` is maximal. So, **C_7** is a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Proving there are no other such groups\n\nThis step is more involved and relies on some known results from group theory, as found in the solution to problem 1109 in Crux Mathematicorum by G.L. Walls. The main line of reasoning is:\n\n1.  Let `S = {a, b}` be a maximal product-free set in `G`. A key result is that for `S` to be maximal in `G`, `G` must be generated by the elements of `S`. That is, `G = <a, b>`.\n2.  This simplifies the search to 2-generator groups. We analyze two cases.\n\n    *   **Case 1: `b = a^{-1}`.** `S = {a, a^{-1}}`. The group `G = <a>` must be cyclic. We need `a^3 ≠ e` for `S` to be product-free. A detailed analysis of the maximality condition `G = S ∪ S^2 ∪ {g | g^2 ∈ S}` shows that this only holds for cyclic groups of order 4, 5, and 7.\n        - `C_4` with `S={x,x^3}`.\n        - `C_5` with `S={x,x^4}` or `{x^2,x^3}`.\n        - `C_7` with `S={x,x^6}` or `{x^2,x^5}` or `{x^3,x^4}`.\n        For `n ≥ 8`, one can always find an element `g ∉ S ∪ S^2` such that `g^2 ∉ S`, making `S ∪ {g}` product-free, so `S` would not be maximal.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `b ≠ a^{-1}`.** It has been shown that if `G = <a, b>` has such a set `S={a,b}`, then `|G| ≤ 6`. We must check all 2-generator groups of order up to 6 that are not cyclic (as those are covered in Case 1 if they satisfy the property).\n        - The non-cyclic groups of order 4 and 6 are `V_4` and `S_3`. We confirmed both work.\n        - The cyclic group `C_6` can also be generated by `{x^2, x^3}`, which is a set of the type `b ≠ a^{-1}`. We confirmed `C_6` works.\n\nCombining both cases, the list of groups is `C_4`, `C_5`, `C_7` (from Case 1) and `V_4`, `S_3`, `C_6` (from Case 2).\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nThe finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n1.  `C_4` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V_4` (Klein-four group)\n3.  `C_5` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `C_6` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  `S_3` (Symmetric group on 3 letters, or Dihedral group of order 6)\n6.  `C_7` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n\nThere are 6 such groups in total.\n\n<<<6>>>"
