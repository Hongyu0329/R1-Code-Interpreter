    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\n\nThe question refers to a \"Luxor Obelisk.\" It's crucial to understand that there are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n1.  One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  The second obelisk was given to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\nA film depicting either of these specific obelisks on-screen would satisfy the question's criteria.\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Strategy**\n\nThe most effective strategy is to review the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture in chronological order, starting from the first award in 1928. We need to look for films with scenes set in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France, specifically in a way that would likely show one of these landmarks.\n\n### **Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners**\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), and *It Happened One Night* (1934) are set in WWI battlefields, Germany, and the USA, respectively. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n    *   **Careful Point:** *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris. However, this historical drama focuses primarily on indoor scenes like courtrooms and offices. There is no prominent or memorable scene depicting the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **1940s:** Winners from this decade, such as *Rebecca* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), *Casablanca* (1942), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), are set in England, Wales, Morocco, and the American Midwest. None feature the required locations.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade brings several potential candidates.\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This musical is set entirely in Paris. The film culminates in a famous 17-minute ballet sequence. In this sequence, the main character dances through a series of stylized sets designed to look like famous Parisian locations. One of these prominent sets is the Place de la Concorde, which clearly and intentionally depicts the Luxor Obelisk and the surrounding fountains. This is a definite depiction.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film won Best Picture five years after *An American in Paris*. As the title suggests, the characters travel through many cities, including Paris. There are live-action, on-location shots of Paris that include the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. While it contains a very clear shot, it is not the *first* winner to do so.\n    *   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris, this film also features many famous locations. However, it also came after *An American in Paris*.\n\n*   **Analysis of Egypt-based films:** Films that might feature the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt, are less common among early Best Picture winners. Epics like *The Ten Commandments* (1956) and *Cleopatra* (1963) featured recreations of ancient Egypt, not the modern Luxor Temple site, and neither won Best Picture in their respective years (*Around the World in 80 Days* and *Tom Jones* won instead). Later winners like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) featured scenes in Cairo, not Luxor.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy reviewing the Best Picture winners chronologically, we can establish the following:\n1.  No winner before 1951 has a confirmed, on-screen depiction of either the obelisk in Luxor or the one in Paris.\n2.  *An American in Paris*, the winner for 1951, prominently features a stylized but unmistakable depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its finale.\n3.  Later winners, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also show the obelisk, but *An American in Paris* did it first.\n\nTherefore, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
