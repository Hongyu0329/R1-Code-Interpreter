    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:**\n    *   We have two individual systems: System A and System B.\n    *   Both are 2D Chern insulators.\n    *   The topological invariant for System A is Chern number $C_A = 1$.\n    *   The topological invariant for System B is Chern number $C_B = 1$.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning side-by-side, to form a larger 2D system.\n    *   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that electrons can move freely between the two regions, so they effectively form a single, coherent quantum system.\n\n2.  **Understand the Chern Number and its Physical Meaning:**\n    *   The Chern number ($C$) is an integer topological invariant that characterizes the band structure of a 2D material.\n    *   **Hall Conductance:** It determines the quantized Hall conductance, $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** It dictates the number of protected, one-way (chiral) conducting states on the boundary of the material. A system with Chern number $C$ has $|C|$ chiral edge states. The sign of $C$ determines the direction of propagation (chirality).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combination of the Two Systems:**\n    *   There are two main ways to think about the resulting Chern number: the additivity principle and the edge state picture. Both should yield the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: The Additivity of Topological Invariants**\n        *   The Chern number is an additive quantity. When two gapped topological systems are combined into a larger system without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n        *   Let $C_{total}$ be the Chern number of the junction (the combined system).\n        *   $C_{total} = C_A + C_B$\n        *   Substituting the given values: $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n        *   This approach is straightforward and relies on a fundamental property of topological invariants.\n\n    *   **Method 2: The Edge State Picture (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence)**\n        *   **Initial State:** System A (with $C=1$) has one chiral edge state propagating along its boundary (e.g., in a clockwise direction). System B (with $C=1$) also has one chiral edge state propagating in the same direction (clockwise) along its boundary.\n        *   **Joining the Systems:** When we place System A and System B side-by-side, the boundary where they meet becomes an internal interface. Let's trace the edge states:\n            *   On the outer, external boundary of the new combined shape, the edge state from System A and the edge state from System B are now both present, and they travel in the *same direction* (co-propagating). This gives a total of two edge states on the external boundary.\n            *   On the internal interface between A and B, the edge state from A will be moving in one direction (e.g., down), while the edge state from B will be moving in the opposite direction (e.g., up). These are two *counter-propagating* edge states.\n        *   **Effect of Tunneling:** The problem states the tunneling barrier is \"negligible\". This allows the two counter-propagating states at the internal interface to interact, or \"hybridize\". When counter-propagating states can interact, they are no longer topologically protected. They will \"gap out,\" meaning they mix and form gapped states that are no longer conducting edge modes. They effectively annihilate each other and disappear from the low-energy spectrum.\n        *   **Final State:** The internal edge states are removed. What remains are the two co-propagating edge states on the outer boundary of the combined system.\n        *   **Conclusion:** According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with a net of 2 chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of $C = 2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Negligible Tunneling:** This is the key condition that ensures the two systems form a single Hamiltonian and the edge states at the interface can interact and gap out. If the barrier were large, we would have two separate systems.\n2.  **Sign of Chern Numbers:** It is crucial that both systems have the same sign for their Chern number ($C=1$ for both). If one had $C=1$ and the other had $C=-1$, the total Chern number would be $1 + (-1) = 0$. The system would become topologically trivial. In that case, the edge states at the interface would be co-propagating and remain, while the states on the outer boundary would be counter-propagating and gap each other out.\n3.  **Maintaining the Bulk Gap:** The process of combining the systems must not close and reopen the bulk energy gap, as this could change the topological invariant. Since we are joining two systems with identical topological properties, it's a smooth process that preserves the bulk gap of the combined material.\n4.  **Final Answer is an Integer:** The Chern number is a quantized integer, so the answer must be an integer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the principle of additivity for topological numbers and the physical picture of edge states lead to the same conclusion. The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n$C_{total} = C_A + C_B = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
