    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific film with several key elements:\n1.  The film must be **Oscar-nominated**.\n2.  There is a scene involving a character **boarding a bus**.\n3.  The character says the specific words **\"Thank you\"**.\n4.  This utterance **seals their fate**, implying it leads to a significant negative turn of events for them (like capture or death).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Films and Scenarios**\nThe most likely reason for an innocuous phrase like \"Thank you\" to have dire consequences is related to identity and deception. A character is likely undercover, trying to pass as someone else (e.g., a different nationality or as a mute person), and this polite, almost automatic, response reveals their true identity or breaks their cover. This points towards genres like spy thrillers, war films, or historical dramas.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Correct Film: *Bridge of Spies* (2015)**\nThis film, directed by Steven Spielberg, fits all the criteria perfectly.\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** *Bridge of Spies* was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n*   **The Character:** The character in question is Frederic Pryor (played by Will Rogers), an American economics graduate student studying in East Berlin.\n*   **The Context:** The scene occurs in August 1961 as the Berlin Wall is being hastily constructed. Pryor tries to bring his German professor's daughter (his love interest) from East to West Berlin, but they are stopped by Stasi (East German secret police) at a checkpoint.\n*   **The Fateful Moment:** The Stasi guards question Pryor. Although suspicious, they initially appear to let him go after checking his American passport, directing him to a nearby bus. Shaken but relieved, Pryor gets on the bus. As he does, one of the guards says something to him in German. Out of sheer politeness and habit, Pryor responds in English with a simple, quiet **\"Thank you.\"**\n*   **Sealing His Fate:** Hearing him speak English confirms the Stasi's suspicions that he is a foreigner and, in their paranoid view, potentially a spy. They immediately pull him off the bus and arrest him. This single act of politeness directly leads to his imprisonment and his eventual use as a bargaining chip in the prisoner exchange for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, which is the central plot of the film.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe specific sequence of events—an Oscar-nominated film, a character boarding a bus, the fatal utterance of \"Thank you,\" and the immediate consequence of being arrested—points unequivocally to the 2015 film *Bridge of Spies*.\n\n<<<Bridge of Spies>>>"
