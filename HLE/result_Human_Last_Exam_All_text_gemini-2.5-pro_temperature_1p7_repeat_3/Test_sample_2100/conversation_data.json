    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first quote:** The phrase \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was coined by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This suggests the man in question was an explorer or navigator, likely of Russian origin, and that his life or journey had a romantic or adventurous quality that Voznesensky sought to capture.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second quote:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" clearly indicates that the burial place of this man was unknown for a significant period. It points to a historical mystery surrounding his final resting place.\n\n3.  **Identify the source:** These quotes are from the libretto of the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (`Юнона и Авось`), for which Andrei Voznesensky wrote the poems and lyrics. The opera tells the story of a Russian expedition to California.\n\n4.  **Identify the protagonist:** The central figure of \"Juno and Avos\" is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and diplomat who led a round-the-world expedition on the ships Juno and Avos. He is the \"sailor\" or explorer referred to.\n\n5.  **Connect to the lost grave:** Historically, Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from his journey. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, in the 1930s, the Soviet government demolished the cathedral and the cemetery was destroyed, causing the exact location of his grave to be lost. This historical fact perfectly matches the line \"Where is your grave...\".\n\n6.  **Analyze the final clue:** The question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (which premiered in 1981) sparked renewed public and academic interest in Rezanov's life and fate. This led to searches for his lost grave in Krasnoyarsk. In the late 1980s, the approximate location was identified, and efforts began to create a memorial, effectively \"answering\" the question of where his grave was for the modern public.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The key is linking the poet (Voznesensky) to his most famous work involving an explorer (\"Juno and Avos\").\n*   One must recognize that \"sailor\" is a poetic term for the leader of a sea expedition, not necessarily a common seaman.\n*   The detail about the grave being lost and then rediscovered/re-established in a specific timeframe (late 1980s) is the crucial puzzle piece that confirms the identity.\n*   The man's full name is Nikolai Rezanov, but the question specifically asks for his last name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov, the protagonist of Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". His grave was lost when a cathedral in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed and was symbolically re-established in the late 1980s due to the interest generated by the opera.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
