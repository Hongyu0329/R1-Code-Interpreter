    "This question asks for the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve `C` defined over a valuation field `K`, under the crucial assumption that its Jacobian variety `J(C)` has good reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the condition on the Jacobian\nThe condition that the Jacobian `J(C)` has good reduction provides a powerful constraint on the structure of the stable reduction of the curve `C`. A fundamental result in the theory of abelian varieties and curves (due to Raynaud, building on work of Serre and Tate) states that `J(C)` has good reduction if and only if the special fiber of the stable model of `C` has a dual graph that is a tree.\n\nLet `C_s` be the special fiber of the stable model of `C`. `C_s` is a stable curve of arithmetic genus `g=4`. We can decompose `C_s` into its irreducible components `C_s = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup ... \\cup C_{|V|}`. The dual graph `Γ` of `C_s` is a graph where:\n-   The vertices `V` correspond to the irreducible components `C_i`.\n-   The edges `E` correspond to the nodes (ordinary double points) where two components intersect.\n\nThe condition \"J(C) has good reduction\" is equivalent to the first Betti number of `Γ` being zero, `b_1(Γ) = 0`. For a connected graph (which the dual graph of a stable curve is), this means `|E| - |V| + 1 = 0`, or `|E| = |V| - 1`. This is the defining property of a **tree**.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Genus Formula\nThe arithmetic genus `p_a(C_s)` of the special fiber `C_s` is equal to the genus `g` of the generic fiber `C`. For a nodal curve, the genus is given by the formula:\n`g = p_a(C_s) = Σ p_a(C_i) + δ - |V| + 1`\nwhere:\n-   `p_a(C_i)` is the arithmetic genus of the component `C_i`. We'll denote this `g_i`.\n-   `δ` is the total number of nodes in `C_s`. This includes nodes where a component intersects itself and nodes where two components intersect. However, for a tree-like structure, all nodes must be intersections between different components. Thus, `δ` is equal to the number of edges `|E|` in the dual graph `Γ`.\n-   `|V|` is the number of irreducible components.\n\nWe can now substitute the \"tree\" condition `δ = |E| = |V| - 1` into the genus formula:\n`g = Σ g_i + (|V| - 1) - |V| + 1`\nThis simplifies dramatically to:\n`g = Σ g_i`\n\nSince our curve has genus `g=4`, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to form a stable curve `C_s` such that the sum of the genera of its irreducible components is 4, and its dual graph is a tree.\n\n### Step 3: The Stability Condition\nFor `C_s` to be a stable curve, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It is connected and its only singularities are ordinary double points.\n2.  Any irreducible component `C_i` that is a rational curve (a copy of `P^1`, so `g_i = 0`) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points. In terms of the dual graph `Γ`, this means any vertex corresponding to a `g=0` component must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n### Step 4: Enumerating the Types\nWe need to find all partitions of the integer 4 into non-negative integers `(g_1, g_2, ...)` and for each partition, determine the number of distinct, stable, tree-like configurations.\n\n**Case A: No rational components (`g_i > 0` for all `i`)**\n\n1.  **Partition `4`**: `Σg_i = 4`.\n    -   One component of genus 4. The dual graph has one vertex and zero edges, which is a trivial tree.\n    -   This corresponds to the curve `C` itself having good reduction (a smooth, irreducible special fiber).\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n2.  **Partition `3+1`**: `Σg_i = 3 + 1`.\n    -   One component of genus 3 and one of genus 1. `|V|=2`, so `|E|=1`. The two components are joined by a single node. This is stable.\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n3.  **Partition `2+2`**: `Σg_i = 2 + 2`.\n    -   Two components of genus 2. `|V|=2`, `|E|=1`. The two components are joined by a single node. This is stable.\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n4.  **Partition `2+1+1`**: `Σg_i = 2 + 1 + 1`.\n    -   Three components of genera 2, 1, and 1. `|V|=3`, `|E|=2`. The only tree on 3 vertices is a path (`P_3`). The genus 2 curve must be in the middle, connected to the two genus 1 curves. This is stable.\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n5.  **Partition `1+1+1+1`**: `Σg_i = 1+1+1+1`.\n    -   Four components, all of genus 1. `|V|=4`, `|E|=3`. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices:\n        a.  The path `P_4`: A chain of four elliptic curves.\n        b.  The star `K_{1,3}`: A central elliptic curve connected to three other elliptic curves.\n    -   Both configurations are stable.\n    -   **2 types**.\n\n**Case B: At least one rational component (`g_i = 0` for some `i`)**\n\nRecall: Any `g=0` component must correspond to a vertex of degree ≥ 3 in the dual graph.\n\n6.  **Partition `3+1+0`**: `Σg_i = 3+1+0=4`.\n    -   `|V|=3`, `|E|=2`. The graph is a path `P_3`. The vertex for the `g=0` component would have degree 1 (if at the end) or 2 (if in the middle). Neither is ≥ 3.\n    -   **0 types**.\n\n7.  **Partition `2+1+1+0`**: `Σg_i = 2+1+1+0=4`.\n    -   `|V|=4`, `|E|=3`. One `g=0` component. The corresponding vertex must have degree ≥ 3. In a tree with 4 vertices, the maximum possible degree is 3 (the center of the star graph `K_{1,3}`).\n    -   Therefore, the dual graph must be a star `K_{1,3}`, with the `g=0` component at the center, connected to the `g=2`, `g=1`, and `g=1` components. This is stable.\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n8.  **Partition `1+1+1+1+0`**: `Σg_i = 1+1+1+1+0=4`.\n    -   `|V|=5`, `|E|=4`. One `g=0` component, whose vertex must have degree ≥ 3. We examine the trees on 5 vertices:\n        a.  Path `P_5`: max degree is 2. Fails stability.\n        b.  Star `K_{1,4}`: max degree is 4. Placing the `g=0` component at the center (degree 4) connected to the four `g=1` components is a valid stable configuration.\n        c.  \"Fork\" tree (degree sequence 3,2,1,1,1): Placing the `g=0` component at the vertex of degree 3 is a valid stable configuration. (It is attached to 3 branches, two of which are single `g=1` components and one is a chain of two `g=1` components).\n    -   **2 types**.\n\n9.  **Partitions with two `g=0` components**: `Σg_i = g_1 + ... + 0 + 0 = 4`.\n    -   Let's check `1+1+1+1+0+0`. `|V|=6`, `|E|=5`. Two `g=0` components, whose vertices `v_a, v_b` must both have degree ≥ 3. The four `g=1` components can be leaves (degree 1).\n    -   Sum of degrees = `2|E| = 10`.\n    -   Sum of degrees of the two rational vertices = `10 - 4*(deg=1) = 6`.\n    -   Since `deg(v_a)≥3` and `deg(v_b)≥3`, the only solution is `deg(v_a)=3` and `deg(v_b)=3`.\n    -   This forces a unique structure: the two rational components are connected to each other, and each is also connected to two of the `g=1` components. This is a valid stable configuration.\n    -   **1 type**.\n\n10. **Partitions with three or more `g=0` components**:\n    -   Let there be `k` rational components and `m` non-rational components, where `Σ g_i = 4` over the `m` components (so `m≤4`).\n    -   Each rational vertex must have degree ≥ 3. The `m` non-rational vertices can have degree ≥ 1. Let's assume they are leaves (degree 1) to maximize degree budget for the rationals.\n    -   The sum of degrees of the `k` rational vertices is `2|E| - m = 2(k+m-1) - m = 2k + m - 2`.\n    -   We need `2k + m - 2 ≥ 3k`, which simplifies to `m - 2 ≥ k`.\n    -   For `k=3`, we need `m ≥ 5`. But we must have `m ≤ 4` since the sum of genera is 4 and each `g_i ≥ 1`. This is a contradiction.\n    -   Therefore, no configurations with 3 or more rational components exist.\n\n### Summary of the count\n-   Partition `4`: 1 type\n-   Partition `3+1`: 1 type\n-   Partition `2+2`: 1 type\n-   Partition `2+1+1`: 1 type\n-   Partition `1+1+1+1`: 2 types\n-   Partition `2+1+1+0`: 1 type\n-   Partition `1+1+1+1+0`: 2 types\n-   Partition `1+1+1+1+0+0`: 1 type\n\nTotal number of types = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10**.\n\n<<<10>>>"
