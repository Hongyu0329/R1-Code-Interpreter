    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Goal:**\n    *   The system is a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a'.\n    *   The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the quantum number n = 2.\n    *   We need to find the probability of locating the particle in a small interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n\n2.  **Write the Wave Function and Probability Density:**\n    *   The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n        $Ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a})$\n    *   For the state n = 2, the wave function is:\n        $Ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a})$\n    *   The probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n        $P(x) = |Ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a})$\n\n3.  **Set Up the Probability Integral:**\n    *   The probability of finding the particle between x₁ and x₂ is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n        $Prob(x_1 < x < x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} P(x) dx$\n    *   Substituting our values:\n        $Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}) dx$\n\n4.  **Handle the Integration (Approximation Method):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is very narrow (width Δx = 0.01a) and is centered at x = 0.5a. For n=2, there is a node at the center of the box (x = a/2), meaning the wave function and probability density are zero at this point. A simple approximation like `Probability ≈ P(center) * Δx` would incorrectly give 0.\n    *   We need a more accurate approximation. Let's analyze the probability density function near the node at x = 0.5a. Let $x = 0.5a + \\delta x$, where $\\delta x$ is a small displacement from the center.\n    *   Substitute this into the probability density function:\n        $P(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a + \\delta x)}{a}) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a})$\n    *   Using the identity $\\sin(\\pi + \\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n        $P(x) = \\frac{2}{a} (-\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}))^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a})$\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since the interval is small, the argument of the sine function, $\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}$, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n        $P(x) \\approx \\frac{2}{a} (\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a})^2 = \\frac{2}{a} (\\frac{4\\pi^2 (\\delta x)^2}{a^2}) = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} (\\delta x)^2$\n    *   Now, we integrate this approximate function. The interval x from 0.495a to 0.505a corresponds to $\\delta x$ from -0.005a to +0.005a.\n        $Prob \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} (\\delta x)^2 d(\\delta x)$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{(\\delta x)^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005)^3 a^3$\n    *   The $a^3$ terms cancel, as they should.\n        $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   Calculate $(0.005)^3 = (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3 = 125 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9})$\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 125}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{2000}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9}$\n    *   $Prob \\approx \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n    *   Using the value $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n        $Prob \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n        $Prob \\approx \\frac{19.7392}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n        $Prob \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle in the 1D box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
