    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the number of times Anton Chekhov described the coat of the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in the short story \"The Chameleon.\"\n2.  **Understand the Context:** The question specifies that the descriptions of the coat are symbolic, representing Otchumyelov's \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This means the analysis should focus not just on every mention of the word \"coat,\" but on the distinct moments where the coat is used to describe or symbolize his changing state of mind.\n3.  **Define \"Description\":** In this literary context, a \"description\" includes both static physical descriptions (e.g., \"a new greatcoat\") and, more importantly, the symbolic actions involving the coat (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it). Each action represents a shift in his mentality and thus serves as a form of character description.\n4.  **Methodology:** The most accurate way to answer is to read through the story and identify each distinct instance where the coat is mentioned as part of a description or a symbolic action related to Otchumyelov's mood changes.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Counting Actions vs. Mentions:** It is crucial to distinguish between simply counting every time the word \"coat\" appears and counting the number of distinct symbolic *events* or *moments* of description. For example, when Otchumyelov says, \"Unbutton my coat...\" and then \"Take my coat off...\" in the same moment of panic, this constitutes a single symbolic act of removing the coat.\n*   **Initial Description:** The first mention of the coat, which establishes his official status before the conflict begins, is also a key description and must be included in the count.\n*   **Final Action:** The final action involving the coat, which concludes the episode and shows his final state of mind, is also a critical symbolic description.\n*   **The Character's Motivation:** Each action involving the coat is directly linked to a specific trigger: feeling \"hot\" from fear of a superior's wrath or feeling \"cold\" when his authority seems secure.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough**\n\nWe will now track each distinct descriptive moment involving Otchumyelov's coat through the narrative of \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n1.  **First Description (The Baseline):** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov establishes Otchumyelov's character and official status.\n    > *\"Through the market square walks the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in a new **greatcoat**...\"*\n    This initial description sets up the coat as a symbol of his authority before it is challenged. This is our first count.\n\n2.  **Second Description (The First Shift):** When a bystander suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov panics. His authority feels threatened.\n    > *\"‘Take my **coat** off, Yeldyrin...’ said Otchumyelov. ‘It’s frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.’”*\n    He wants the coat off because he is \"hot\" with fear. This is the first time the coat is manipulated to show a change in his mentality. This is our second count.\n\n3.  **Third Description (The Second Shift):** When the policeman Yeldyrin expresses doubt that the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n    > *\"‘Help me on with my **coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad.... There’s a wind getting up.... I am cold....’”*\n    He now feels \"cold\" and puts the symbol of his authority back on as his courage returns. This is the third count.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (The Third Shift):** Another person in the crowd insists the dog *is* the General's, plunging Otchumyelov back into panic.\n    > *\"‘H’m. Help me off with my **coat**, Yeldyrin... it's confoundedly hot!’”*\n    The heat of fear returns, and he immediately reverses his previous action, shedding the coat again. This is the fourth count.\n\n5.  **Fifth Description (The Final Shift):** After it is finally clarified that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov resolves the situation by fawning over the dog. As he leaves, he reassumes his mantle of authority, however compromised it now is.\n    > *\"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his **greatcoat** and... disappears from the square.\"*\n    This final action of wrapping the coat around himself signifies the end of the conflict and his attempt to restore his official, imposing image. This is the final and fifth count.\n\nIn summary, there is one initial, static description and four subsequent descriptions of action, each symbolizing a clear shift in Otchumyelov's mentality.\n\n<<<5>>>"
