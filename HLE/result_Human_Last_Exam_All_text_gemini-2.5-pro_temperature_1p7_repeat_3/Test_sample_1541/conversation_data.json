    "### Problem Analysis\n\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers (only 1, 2, 3, and 4) and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. For example, `3+2+1` should become `1+2+3`. The final task is to write the most memory-efficient C program for this and determine the total memory `m` in bytes used by the program's variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Derivation\n\n1.  **Core Task**: The fundamental operation is to sort the numbers present in the input string.\n2.  **Choosing an Algorithm**: A general-purpose sorting algorithm (like quicksort or bubble sort) would require extracting the numbers into an array, sorting it, and then printing. This would use memory proportional to the number of summands. However, since the set of numbers is very small and fixed ({1, 2, 3, 4}), a much more efficient method is **Counting Sort**.\n3.  **Counting Sort Idea**: Instead of storing the numbers themselves, we can just count how many times each number appears in the sum. We can iterate through the input string and maintain four counters: one for the number of '1's, one for '2's, one for '3's, and one for '4's.\n4.  **Optimizing Input Processing**: To maximize memory efficiency, we should avoid reading the entire input string into a buffer (e.g., `char s[1001]`), which would consume over 1000 bytes. A better approach is to read the input character by character using `getchar()`. This way, we only need to store one character at a time while we process the input stream to update our counts.\n5.  **Printing the Result**: Once we have the counts of all numbers, we can construct the sorted sum. We will print the number '1' `count1` times, followed by '2' `count2` times, and so on. We need to place a '+' sign between the numbers but not at the very end. A simple way to manage this is to use a flag variable. The flag indicates whether the number being printed is the first one. If it is, we just print the number. For all subsequent numbers, we print a '+' before printing the number itself.\n\n### Careful Points for Memory Efficiency\n\n1.  **Input Method**: Use `getchar()` instead of `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` to avoid allocating a large buffer for the input string. This is the single most significant memory saving.\n2.  **Data Storage**: Use counting sort instead of storing the numbers in an array. This reduces memory usage from being proportional to the input size to a small, constant amount.\n3.  **Data Types**: Choose the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n    *   For counters: The maximum length of the string is 1000. The maximum number of summands is 500 (for a string like \"1+1+...+1\"). A `short int` (typically 2 bytes, range up to 32,767) is sufficient to store these counts, and is more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   For single characters: A `char` (1 byte) is the correct type.\n    *   For flags: A `char` can be used as a boolean flag (0 for false, 1 for true), consuming only 1 byte.\n\n### Step-by-Step Memory Calculation (m)\n\nWe calculate the total memory by summing the sizes of all necessary variables in our maximally efficient program. We assume a common architecture where `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **Counters for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4**: We need four variables to store the counts.\n    *   Declaration: `short count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n2.  **Input character variable**: We need one variable to store the character read from the input stream.\n    *   Declaration: `char c;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n3.  **Loop counter variable**: A loop counter is needed for the printing phase. Since the loops run at most ~500 times, a `short` is sufficient.\n    *   Declaration: `short i;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(short) = 2` bytes.\n\n4.  **Separator flag**: A flag is needed to correctly print the '+' separator. A `char` is the most memory-efficient choice for a boolean flag.\n    *   Declaration: `char plus_flag = 0;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n**Total Memory (m)**:\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\n`m = (memory for counters) + (memory for input char) + (memory for loop counter) + (memory for flag)`\n`m = 8 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12` bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated for variables on the stack for the most memory-efficient C implementation of this solution.\n\n<<<12>>>"
