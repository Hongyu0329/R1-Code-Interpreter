    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the Question in the Title**\nThe puzzle states that the title, \"The Bays,\" is a question. The title is a pun on \"The B's.\" Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\" The goal is to identify several concepts, people, or things starting with the letter 'B' that are hidden within the haiku.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku for Clues**\nThe haiku is about a storm (\"An August tempest\") and its theme is meteorology. Each line provides a clue to one of the \"B's\".\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This line sets the meteorological theme. A tempest is a violent storm, which is fundamentally a low-pressure weather system. A key concept in measuring atmospheric pressure is the **Bar** and its subdivision, the millibar. This line points to the first 'B': **Bar**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   This line contains a numerical clue: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30 (2 x 15 = 30).\n    *   In meteorology, wind speed is famously measured on a scale developed by Sir Francis Beaufort. A wind of 30 knots falls into Force 7 on the **Beaufort** scale, described as a \"Near Gale.\"\n    *   This line clearly points to the second 'B': **Beaufort**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This poetic line suggests a fundamental principle or law of nature. \"A divine one\" can be interpreted as a natural law, and this law \"yields\" a specific outcome or understanding.\n    *   In the context of tempests and wind, this points to **Buys Ballot**'s law, a crucial principle in meteorology that relates wind direction to the location of high and low-pressure systems.\n    *   This line points to the third 'B': **Buys Ballot**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Answer**\nThe three \"B's\" found in the haiku are:\n1.  **Bar**\n2.  **Beaufort**\n3.  **Buys Ballot**\n\n**Step 4: Format the Final Answer**\nThe puzzle gives a final instruction: \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\" This means the identified \"B's\" must be listed in alphabetical order.\n\nArranging the terms alphabetically gives:\nBar, Beaufort, Buys Ballot.\n\nThis list is the complete answer to the question posed by the title.\n\n<<<Bar, Beaufort, Buys Ballot>>>"
