    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl Compound):** Pivalaldehyde. This is an aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The carbonyl group (-CHO) is attached to a bulky tert-butyl group (-(C(CH₃)₃)).\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent/Ylide):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to the Ph₃P= group (where Ph is a phenyl group, C₆H₅).\n        *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)` describes the group attached to the phosphorus. This is a two-carbon chain (=CH-CH₂-), where the second carbon is attached to a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n        *   Therefore, the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), with the chlorine atom at the ortho (2-) position of the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction between an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphorus ylide is a **Wittig reaction**. The primary outcome of a Wittig reaction is the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O). The double bond is formed between the carbon atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the negatively charged carbon atom (the ylidic carbon) of the Wittig reagent.\n\n3.  **Classify the Wittig Reagent and Predict Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n    *   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups like -COOR, -CN, -C=O on the ylidic carbon) generally give the (E)-alkene (thermodynamic control).\n    *   **Unstabilized ylides** (with electron-donating groups like alkyl groups on the ylidic carbon) are more reactive and generally give the (Z)-alkene (kinetic control).\n    *   In our ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), the ylidic carbon (the one double-bonded to P) is attached to a hydrogen and a `-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` group. This is an alkyl-type substituent. There are no electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ylidic carbon to stabilize the negative charge through resonance.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is an **unstabilized ylide**. Therefore, the reaction is expected to be kinetically controlled and will yield the **(Z)-alkene as the major product**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction effectively \"swaps\" the oxygen atom of the aldehyde with the ylidic carbon group of the ylide.\n    *   From pivalaldehyde, we get the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part.\n    *   From the ylide, we get the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` part.\n    *   Combining these gives the alkene backbone: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n    *   Applying the (Z)-stereochemistry, the two larger groups on each carbon of the double bond must be on the same side.\n        *   On the first carbon of the double bond: The groups are -C(CH₃)₃ (tert-butyl) and -H. The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n        *   On the second carbon of the double bond: The groups are -CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl) and -H. The ethylphenyl group has higher priority.\n        *   For the (Z)-isomer, the tert-butyl group and the 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group are positioned on the same side of the double bond.\n\n5.  **Name the Final Product:**\n    *   To name the product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   Chain: Cl-C₆H₄-CH₂(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)=CH(4)-C(5)(CH₃)₃. No, that's incorrect numbering.\n    *   Let's re-number correctly: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethylhex-3-ene`.\n        *   Longest chain containing C=C is 6 carbons (hexane).\n        *   The double bond starts at C-3 (hex-3-ene).\n        *   There are two methyl groups at C-5 (5,5-dimethyl).\n        *   There is a 2-chlorophenyl group at C-1 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)).\n    *   Combining with the stereochemistry, the final product name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Final Product Structure:**\n```\n  (CH₃)₃C      CH₂-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)\n       \\      /\n        C = C\n       /      \\\n      H        H\n```\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethylhex-3-ene >>>"
