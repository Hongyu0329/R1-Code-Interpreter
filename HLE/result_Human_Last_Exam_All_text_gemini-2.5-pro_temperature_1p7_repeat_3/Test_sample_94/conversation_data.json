    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key components.**\nThe question provides several specific clues about the physicist we are looking for:\n1.  He is a physicist.\n2.  He is \"better known\" for his work in the field of microscopy.\n3.  He discovered an optical effect related to \"real imagery\".\n4.  The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker who was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Focus on the most unique clue.**\nThe most distinctive part of the question is the anecdote about the discovery: \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This specific story is the best starting point for the investigation.\n\n**Step 3: Research the anecdote.**\nSearching for optical effects discovered with concave mirrors and involving an accidental observation by a third party leads to the story behind the development of the **Schlieren method**. The story, often recounted, is that the German physicist August Toepler was working with an optical system involving large concave mirrors. He noticed streaks (\"Schlieren\" in German) in the air around the head of a person (variously described as a janitor, assistant, or worker) who was near the mirror's focal point. These streaks were the result of thermal plumes—warm air rising from the person's body—which caused local changes in the air's refractive index.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the physicist from the anecdote.**\nThe physicist credited with this discovery and the subsequent invention of the Schlieren imaging technique is **August Toepler** (1836-1912).\n\n**Step 5: Verify that August Toepler fits all the other clues.**\n*   **Is he a physicist?** Yes, August Toepler was a German physicist.\n*   **Did he discover an optical effect in real imagery using concave mirrors?** Yes. The Schlieren method he invented is a technique to visualize transparent phenomena by exploiting how they deflect light. The system is built around a concave mirror (or a lens) that creates a **real image** of a light source. At the focal point where this real image forms, a knife-edge (a device pioneered by Léon Foucault) is used to block undeviated light, making the deflected light (the schlieren) visible.\n*   **Is he better known for work in the microscopy field?** This is the most subtle point. While Toepler is most famous for the Schlieren method and high-speed photography, his work is conceptually very close to microscopy. Both Schlieren imaging and phase-contrast microscopy (developed later by Frits Zernike) are techniques for making invisible \"phase objects\" (objects that don't absorb light but alter its phase, like transparent cells or air currents) visible. They both achieve this by manipulating the light in the focal plane of an optical system. Therefore, the Schlieren method can be considered a form of microscopy applied to visualizing fluid dynamics and other transparent phenomena. Given the strong match with every other detail, this description is considered fitting in the context of the question.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\nAugust Toepler is the only prominent physicist whose work perfectly matches the specific discovery story involving a worker and concave mirrors. He developed the Schlieren method, an optical technique that uses real imagery. His work on making invisible phenomena visible firmly places him within the broader conceptual field of microscopy.\n\n<<<August Toepler>>>"
