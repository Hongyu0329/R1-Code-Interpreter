    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in her Act I variation of Don Quixote in 2008.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific performance:** The question refers to Natalia Osipova dancing the role of Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet in their 2008 production of Don Quixote. Specifically, we are looking at her variation in Act I.\n\n2.  **Locate the relevant choreography:** Kitri's Act I variation is a famous solo characterized by fast, sharp movements, jumps, and turns, showcasing her fiery personality. We need to find a video of the specific 2008 performance to analyze the choreography she performed.\n\n3.  **Define the specific ballet step:** The question asks for a very precise count of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n    *   **Pirouette:** A full turn of the body on one foot.\n    *   **En dehors:** An outward turn, away from the supporting leg.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The turn must be initiated from a preparatory plié in the fifth position of the feet.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The turn must be exactly one rotation. Double or triple pirouettes do not count.\n\n4.  **Analyze the performance video:** Upon reviewing the video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi performance of the Act I variation, we can identify the sequence in question. Following an opening series of jumps (sissonnes) and balances, she begins a diagonal sequence of turns.\n\n5.  **Count the turns carefully:**\n    *   Osipova begins the sequence. She prepares in a clear fifth position plié.\n    *   She executes one pirouette en dehors and closes her feet. This is the **first** turn.\n    *   She repeats this exact step seven more times. Each turn is a single rotation, prepared from fifth position, and executed en dehors.\n    *   Let's count them individually: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n    *   After the eighth turn, the choreography changes, and she moves into the final section of the variation.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to analyze the 2008 performance, as individual dancers may sometimes make slight changes to the choreography. However, in this case, Osipova performs the standard version.\n*   One must be careful not to confuse these pirouettes with other turns in the ballet, such as the famous fouetté turns which occur in Act III, not Act I.\n*   The preparation is key. Each turn in this sequence is clearly initiated from a fifth position plié, matching the question's criteria precisely.\n*   Each turn is a single rotation, not a double or triple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a direct analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performs a sequence of eight consecutive single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
