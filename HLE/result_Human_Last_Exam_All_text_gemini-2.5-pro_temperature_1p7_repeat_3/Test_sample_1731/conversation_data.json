    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (photons), which are bosons with non-conserved particle number. We can derive these using principles related to two major theorems in large deviation theory (LDT).\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem's Principle**: This level-2 LDT relates the probability of observing an empirical distribution to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the principle of maximum entropy: the equilibrium distribution is the one that is overwhelmingly the most probable, meaning it corresponds to the largest number of microscopic arrangements. This is equivalent to maximizing the statistical entropy $S=k_B \\ln \\Omega$ subject to system constraints.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem's Principle**: This level-1 LDT relates the probability of a sample mean deviating from its expected value. In statistical mechanics, this principle is embodied in the Canonical and Grand Canonical ensembles, where thermodynamic potentials like the free energy are minimized at equilibrium. The partition function, central to this approach, acts as a generating function for moments (like mean energy) and is directly related to the cumulant generating function in Cramer's theorem.\n\nWe will use the methods inspired by these theorems to find the required equilibrium values.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **System Properties**: The system consists of photons. Photons are bosons, meaning they obey Bose-Einstein statistics and multiple photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n2.  **Particle Number**: The number of photons is not conserved, as they can be emitted or absorbed by the walls of their container. This is a crucial feature, which implies that the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n3.  **Statistical Counting**: For bosons, the number of ways to arrange $n_i$ particles in $g_i$ states (the degeneracy of energy level $\\epsilon_i$) is given by $\\Omega_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$.\n4.  **Ensembles**: The Boltzmann-Sanov approach naturally aligns with the microcanonical ensemble (fixed energy, maximizing entropy). The Cramer-Chernoff approach aligns with the grand canonical ensemble (fixed temperature, variable energy and particle number), which is the most suitable for a system with non-conserved particle number. Both approaches must yield the same results at equilibrium.\n5.  **Notation**: $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of the i-th level, $g_i$ is its degeneracy, $n_i$ is the number of photons in that level, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n---\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Part 1: Analysis using the Principle of Boltzmann-Sanov (Entropy Maximization)\n\nThis method finds the equilibrium state by finding the distribution of particles $\\{n_i\\}$ that maximizes the system's entropy $S$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Entropy**\nThe entropy of a system of bosons is given by $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i = \\prod_i \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$ is the total number of microstates.\nUsing Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x\\ln x - x$), for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, the entropy can be written as:\n$S = k_B \\sum_{i} \\left[ (n_i + g_i)\\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i\\ln n_i - g_i\\ln g_i \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Constrained Maximization**\nWe need to maximize $S$ subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$. Since the photon number is not conserved, there is no constraint on $N = \\sum_i n_i$. This is equivalent to setting the chemical potential $\\mu=0$ in the general derivation. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing the functional $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta ( \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - E)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the energy constraint.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the Equilibrium Distribution**\nWe set the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_i$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_i} = \\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial n_i} - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$\nThe derivative of the entropy term is:\n$\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial n_i} = \\ln(n_i+g_i) + 1 - (\\ln n_i + 1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i+g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right)$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$\nSolving for the equilibrium occupation number $\\langle n_i \\rangle$:\n$1 + \\frac{g_i}{\\langle n_i \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} \\implies \\frac{g_i}{\\langle n_i \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1 \\implies \\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\nThis is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\n#### Part 2: Analysis using the Principle of Cramer-Chernoff (Grand Partition Function Method)\n\nThis method uses the grand canonical ensemble, which is natural for systems at fixed temperature with non-conserved particle number.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Grand Partition Function ($\\mathcal{Z}$)**\nThe grand partition function for a system of non-interacting bosons is the product of the partition functions for each energy level. For photons, the chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\left( \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta (n_i \\epsilon_i - \\mu n_i)} \\right)^{g_i} = \\prod_i \\left( \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})^{n_i} \\right)^{g_i}$\nThe sum is a geometric series, which evaluates to $1/(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$.\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\left( \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}} \\right)^{g_i}$\nThe logarithm of the partition function is simpler to work with:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Equilibrium Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$**\nThe mean energy is found by taking the negative derivative of $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{\\partial \\beta} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}) \\right)$\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i g_i \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}} \\cdot (-\\epsilon_i)(-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}) = \\sum_i g_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}}{1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}}$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}$ gives the final expression for the **Equilibrium Mean Energy**:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Equilibrium Entropy $S$**\nThe entropy is related to the energy and the grand potential ($\\Phi_G = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}$) by the thermodynamic relation $S = (E - \\Phi_G)/T$. With $\\mu=0$:\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle + k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{T} = k_B \\beta \\langle E \\rangle + k_B \\ln \\mathcal{Z}$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle E \\rangle$ and $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}$:\n$S = k_B \\beta \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}-1} + k_B \\left(-\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})\\right)$\nThis gives the final expression for the **Equilibrium Entropy**:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}-1} - \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}) \\right]$\n\nAn alternative but equivalent form for entropy can be found by substituting the equilibrium occupation index $\\langle f_i \\rangle = \\langle n_i \\rangle / g_i = 1/(e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}-1)$ into the original statistical formula for entropy:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (\\langle f_i \\rangle+1)\\ln(\\langle f_i \\rangle+1) - \\langle f_i \\rangle \\ln\\langle f_i \\rangle \\right]$\n\nBoth derivations yield the same set of expressions for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta) are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy ($E$):**\nThe mean energy is given by the sum over all energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$:\n$$E = \\sum_{i} \\frac{g_{i} \\epsilon_{i}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}-1}$$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy ($S$):**\nThe entropy is given by:\n$$S = k_{B} \\sum_{i} g_{i}\\left[\\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}-1}-\\ln \\left(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nIn these expressions, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $T$ is the equilibrium temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy ($E$):**\n$E = \\sum_{i} \\frac{g_{i} \\epsilon_{i}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}-1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy ($S$):**\n$S = k_{B} \\sum_{i} g_{i}\\left[\\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}-1}-\\ln \\left(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_{i}}\\right)\\right]$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n>>>"
