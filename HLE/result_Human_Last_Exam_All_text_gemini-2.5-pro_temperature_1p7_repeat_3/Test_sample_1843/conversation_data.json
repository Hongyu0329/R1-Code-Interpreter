    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Factor the conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**2. Structure of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of Dirichlet characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ modulo each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive** character of conductor $N$, each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a **primitive** character modulo its corresponding prime power $p^a$.\n\nThe **order** of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\n**3. Analyze the Component Characters**\n\nFor the final order to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6. So, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, since each component character must be primitive, its order cannot be 1 (as the character of order 1 is the principal character, which has conductor 1).\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ with orders that are divisors of 6. Let $n_k(m)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $k$.\n\n*   **Conductor $2^2=4$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^*$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has one character of order 1 (principal, conductor 1) and one character of order 2. The character of order 2 is primitive modulo 4. Its order, 2, is a divisor of 6.\n    So, for $\\chi_{2^2}$, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2})=2$. There is $n_2(4) = 1$ such character.\n\n*   **Conductor $3^2=9$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. Therefore, primitive characters modulo 9 have orders that divide 6 but do not divide 2. These orders are 3 and 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(9) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(9) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders, 3 and 6, are divisors of 6. So there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_{9}$.\n\n*   **Conductor $7$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders must divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $11$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters are all non-principal characters. The order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6 and also 10. Thus, its order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. Since the character must be primitive, its order is greater than 1.\n    -   The only possible order is 2. Number of characters is $n_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    There is only 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Conductor $13$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide 6 and also 12. Thus, its order must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**4. Combine the Results**\n\nWe need to find the number of combinations of these component characters such that their lcm of orders is exactly 6. Let the chosen orders be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n- We know $k_4 = 2$ and $k_{11} = 2$. This ensures that the lcm will be a multiple of 2.\n- For $\\chi_9$, the order $k_9$ must be in $\\{3, 6\\}$. This ensures that the lcm will be a multiple of 3.\n- All possible orders for all components are divisors of 6.\n\nAny combination of the allowed primitive component characters will have an order lcm that is:\na) A multiple of 2 (due to $\\chi_4$).\nb) A multiple of 3 (due to $\\chi_9$).\nc) A divisor of 6 (since all component orders divide 6).\n\nA number that is a multiple of 2 and 3 is a multiple of 6. If this number must also be a divisor of 6, it must be exactly 6.\nTherefore, any combination of the allowed primitive characters will result in a character of order 6. We simply need to count the total number of possible combinations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\n-   Number of choices for $\\chi_{2^2}$: 1 (the one of order 2).\n-   Number of choices for $\\chi_{3^2}$: 4 (2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n-   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n-   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (the one of order 2).\n-   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_{2^2}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{3^2}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$"
