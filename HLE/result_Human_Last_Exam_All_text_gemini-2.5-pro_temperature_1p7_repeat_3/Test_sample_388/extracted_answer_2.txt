The pharmacist should advise Allison that the aspirin in her Excedrin, when combined with her Fluoxetine (an SSRI), significantly increases the risk of stomach bleeding. It would be safer to treat her headaches with a product containing only acetaminophen (like Tylenol). The pharmacist could also mention that headaches can be a side effect of Fluoxetine or Junel Fe, and if they continue, she should discuss it with her doctor.
