    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core of the Question:**\nThe request is for the \"earliest known date recorded\" in an \"aboriginal writing system\". This has several key requirements:\n*   It must be a **date**, not just an example of writing.\n*   This date must be **specific and absolute**, not a repeating day name in a cycle.\n*   It must be **recorded** on a physical artifact (like stone or ceramic).\n*   The artifact must be from a **pre-Columbian** civilization in the Americas.\n*   The writing system must be **indigenous** to the Americas.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Calendar System:**\nMesoamerican civilizations developed several calendar systems. The one best suited for recording specific, non-repeating historical dates is the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythological starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE. Because it is a cumulative count, any Long Count date pinpoints a unique day in history. Other calendar systems, like the 260-day sacred calendar (*Tzolk'in*) or the 365-day solar calendar (*Haab'*), are cyclical, and their dates repeat (every 52 years for a combined \"Calendar Round\" date). While there is evidence of these cyclical calendars being used earlier, they do not record a unique historical date without the anchor of the Long Count.\n\n**3. Examine the Candidates for the Earliest Recorded Long Count Date:**\nArchaeologists have discovered several monuments with very early Long Count dates. The primary contenders are:\n\n*   **San Jos√© Mogote Monument 3 (Zapotec, c. 600 BCE):** This monument displays a glyph for \"1 Earthquake,\" a day name from the 260-day calendar.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While this is the earliest known use of a calendar glyph, it is not a specific, absolute date like one from the Long Count. \"1 Earthquake\" is a repeating day name, much like \"Tuesday\". Therefore, this is not the answer.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec, Veracruz):** For many years, this was considered the holder of the earliest date. One side of the stela is inscribed with a Long Count date. The first digit is damaged, but based on the surrounding art style and other numbers, it was reconstructed by its discoverer, Matthew Stirling.\n    *   **Date:** 7.16.6.16.18\n    *   **Correlation:** This date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Maya/Zoque, Chiapas):** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment contains the lower part of a date inscription. Unlike the Tres Zapotes Stela, the numbers are clear.\n    *   **Date:** 7.16.3.2.13\n    *   **Correlation:** This date corresponds to **December 9, 36 BCE**.\n\n**4. Compare the Candidates and Determine the Earliest Date:**\nTo find the earliest recorded date, we compare the correlated Gregorian calendar dates:\n\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **32 BCE**\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **36 BCE**\n\nThe year 36 BCE occurred before 32 BCE.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe earliest known specific, absolute date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is the Long Count date found on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. This date is **7.16.3.2.13**, which correlates to **December 9, 36 BCE**.\n\n<<<December 9, 36 BCE>>>"
