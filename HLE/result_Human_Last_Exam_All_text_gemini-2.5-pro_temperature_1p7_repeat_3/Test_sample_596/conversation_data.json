    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Objects\nThe question is about \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a specific simplicial complex, which is the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". Let's denote this complex by $K$. A higher dimensional rooted forest is a pair $(F, R)$, where $F$ is a subcomplex of $K$ and $R$ is a subset of the vertices of $F$, called the roots.\n\nThe question asks for the number of such forests $(F,R)$ that fail a specific condition: \"the forest $F$ simplicially collapses onto the root $R$\".\n\n### Step 2: Define the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Simplicial Complex (K):** A collection of simplices (vertices, edges, triangles, etc.) that is closed under taking faces. Here, $K$ is a triangulation of a Möbius band. The exact structure of this triangulation will be discussed later, but it is a 2-dimensional complex.\n\n2.  **Root Set (R):** A specified subset of the vertices of $K$, $R \\subseteq V(K)$.\n\n3.  **Simplicial Collapse:** A simplicial complex $F$ is said to simplicially collapse to a subcomplex $A \\subseteq F$ (denoted $F \\searrow A$) if $A$ can be obtained from $F$ through a sequence of elementary simplicial collapses. An elementary collapse involves removing a pair of simplices $(\\sigma, \\tau)$ from the complex, subject to specific conditions:\n    *   $\\sigma$ is a *maximal simplex* (it's not a face of any other simplex in the complex).\n    *   $\\tau$ is a *free face* of $\\sigma$ (it is a codimension-1 face of $\\sigma$ and is not a face of any other simplex in the complex).\n\n4.  **Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest (F,R):** This is the most critical concept. In the field of algebraic and topological combinatorics, there are several equivalent ways to define this object. The standard homological definition, established in the works of Kalai, and Duval, Klivans, and Martin, is as follows:\n    A subcomplex $F$ of $K$ is an **R-forest** if it satisfies:\n    *   **1-Skeleton Property:** Each connected component of the graph $F^{(1)}$ (the 1-skeleton of F) contains exactly one vertex from the root set $R$.\n    *   **Higher Acyclicity Property:** For each connected component $C$ of $F^{(1)}$ and for each dimension $i \\geq 1$, the $(i-1)$-th reduced homology group of the $i$-skeleton of $F$ (restricted to the vertices of $C$) is trivial. In symbols: $\\tilde{H}_{i-1}(F^{(i)}[V(C)]; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: State the Fundamental Theorem\n\nThe definition of a higher dimensional forest might seem technical, but it was formulated to capture a precise topological behavior. The connection between the homological definition (Step 2.4) and the property of collapsibility (Step 2.3) is established by a fundamental theorem in the subject.\n\n**Theorem:** A subcomplex $F$ of a simplicial complex $K$ is a higher dimensional rooted forest with root set $R$ if and only if $F$ simplicially collapses onto $R$.\n\nThis theorem is general and holds for any simplicial complex $K$. The properties of the ambient space, such as being a Möbius band (which is non-orientable and not Cohen-Macaulay over $\\mathbb{Z}$), do not affect the validity of this equivalence.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Question in Light of the Theorem\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$\" which **fail** the condition that \"$F$ simplicially collapses onto the root $R$\".\n\nLet's rephrase this using set theory:\n*   Let $S_{forest}$ be the set of all pairs $(F,R)$ that are higher dimensional rooted forests by the standard definition.\n*   Let $S_{collapse}$ be the set of all pairs $(F,R)$ where $F$ is a subcomplex of $K$ that simplicially collapses onto the vertex set $R$.\n\nThe theorem from Step 3 states that these two sets are identical: $S_{forest} = S_{collapse}$.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of elements in the set difference $S_{forest} \\setminus S_{collapse}$. Since the two sets are equal, their difference is the empty set.\n$S_{forest} \\setminus S_{collapse} = \\emptyset$\n\nThe number of elements in the empty set is 0.\n\n### Step 5: Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **The definition is key:** The central point of the problem is that the property of \"simplicially collapsing to the root set\" is not an arbitrary condition to check; it is equivalent to the definition of a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\".\n*   **Irrelevance of the specific space:** The problem specifies the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". While calculating the *total number* of such forests would require the specific structure of this triangulation (using a Matrix Tree Theorem generalization), answering the question posed does not. The equivalence theorem holds for all simplicial complexes, so the answer is independent of the particular complex used. The specific details of the Möbius band are extraneous information.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are no higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to collapse to their root set, because the collapsibility property is a defining characteristic of these objects.\n\nTherefore, the number of such forests is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
