    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular philosophical school and is known for a specific conceptual analysis.\n*   **Philosophical School:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Conceptual Analysis:** The decomposition of the notion of \"hallmark\". A \"hallmark\" is a general term for a sign or indicator of something else.\n*   **Specific Components:** The notion of \"hallmark\" is broken down into two distinct categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Philosopher and Their Contribution\nWe need to search through the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School and their key philosophical contributions to find the one who made this specific distinction.\n\n*   The philosopher responsible for this analysis is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   This distinction is a central part of his work in epistemology and his \"pragmatic theory of meaning\". He was deeply interested in the rules that govern language, thought, and inference.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Concepts (Careful Points)\n\n1.  **The Notion of \"Hallmark\" (Polish: *cecha*)**: For Ajdukiewicz, a hallmark is any object, event, or property (A) that reliably indicates the existence of another object, event, or property (B). It's a broad, overarching category for any kind of sign or indicator. For example, smoke can be a hallmark of fire, and the word \"dog\" can be a hallmark of the concept of a dog.\n\n2.  **Decomposition into Symptoms and Signals**: Ajdukiewicz saw that these \"hallmarks\" function in fundamentally different ways. He divided them to clarify the nature of the relationship between the sign and what is signified.\n\n    *   **Symptom (or Indication)**:\n        *   **Nature of Relationship**: A symptom has a **natural, causal, or correlational** relationship with what it signifies. The connection exists independently of human rules or intentions.\n        *   **Example**: Dark clouds are a *symptom* of impending rain. The relationship is based on meteorological laws. Smoke is a *symptom* of fire because fire causally produces smoke. A fever is a *symptom* of an illness due to a biological connection.\n        *   **Key Point**: The inference from a symptom to what it signifies is based on an understanding of natural laws or observed regularities in the world.\n\n    *   **Signal (or Sign proper)**:\n        *   **Nature of Relationship**: A signal has a **conventional** relationship with what it signifies. The link is created by humans through agreement, rules, or habit for the purpose of communication.\n        *   **Example**: A red traffic light is a *signal* to stop. There is no natural law connecting the color red to the act of stopping; it's a rule we have created and agreed upon. The word \"tree\" is a *signal* for the concept of a tree; this is an arbitrary convention of the English language.\n        *   **Key Point**: The inference from a signal to what it signifies is based on knowledge of a shared code or set of rules (e.g., the rules of a language, the traffic code). The signal is produced with a communicative intention.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nKazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a hallmark (an indicator) into symptoms (natural signs based on causality) and signals (conventional signs based on rules and communicative intent). This distinction was fundamental to his pragmatic analysis of language and meaning.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
