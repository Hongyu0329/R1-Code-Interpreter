    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of an Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices. It possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a center of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank. A key property of the icosahedron is that for any given face, there is an opposite face that is perfectly parallel to it. Therefore, the \"top\" of the tank is also a horizontal equilateral triangle, parallel to the base.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\n\"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. The surface of the water will be a horizontal plane. Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane passing through this center divides the volume into two equal halves. The horizontal plane that is exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces passes through this center of symmetry. Therefore, the water surface when the tank is half-full corresponds to the cross-section of the icosahedron made by this central horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Central Cross-Section**\nWe need to determine the shape formed by slicing the icosahedron with a plane that is parallel to the base and passes through the center.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The orientation (standing on a face) gives the icosahedron a principal axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry (a C₃ axis) that passes perpendicularly through the center of the base and top triangular faces. The horizontal cutting plane is perpendicular to this C₃ axis.\n*   The icosahedron also has C₂ (2-fold) rotational symmetry axes that pass through the midpoints of opposite edges. In this orientation, three of these C₂ axes lie within the central horizontal plane.\n*   A 2D shape (the cross-section) that has both a 3-fold symmetry axis and a 2-fold symmetry axis passing through its center must have 6-fold symmetry.\n*   **Edge Intersection Argument:** Let's consider the edges that the central plane intersects. The plane lies between the \"upper half\" and \"lower half\" of the icosahedron. It will cut through all the edges that connect the lower half to the upper half. In this face-down orientation, there is a \"belt\" or \"equator\" of 6 edges that zigzag around the middle of the icosahedron. The central plane slices through the midpoint of each of these 6 edges.\n*   These 6 intersection points form the vertices of the shape of the water's surface. Because of the high symmetry of the icosahedron, these 6 edges are all identical in relation to the center and the principal axis. Consequently, their midpoints will form the vertices of a regular polygon.\n*   A regular polygon with 6 vertices is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on one face is filled to half its volume, the water surface forms a horizontal plane that cuts through the center of the icosahedron. This central cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Orientation is key:** The result depends on the icosahedron standing on a face. If it were standing on a vertex, the shape would be a pentagon.\n2.  **Symmetry is the most reliable tool:** Physical or coordinate-based constructions can be complex. Relying on the known symmetry properties of a regular polyhedron simplifies the problem significantly.\n3.  **Half-full means central plane:** The existence of a center of symmetry is crucial for relating the half-volume condition to the central geometric plane.\n\nFinal Answer: The shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
