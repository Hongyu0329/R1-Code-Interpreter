    "This problem asks for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during one step of randomized uniform gossiping. We will break down the problem into understanding the graph structure, the gossiping process, and then calculating the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, called a bridge or a bottleneck edge.\n*   The total number of nodes is 10. For a symmetric barbell graph, we divide the nodes as evenly as possible between the two cliques. Therefore, the graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (denoted as $K_5$).\n*   Let's call the two cliques Clique A and Clique B, each with 5 nodes.\n*   A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. Let's say node $u$ from Clique A is connected to node $v$ from Clique B. The edge $(u,v)$ is the bottleneck edge.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Relevant Nodes**\n\nThe probability calculation depends on the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n\n*   Consider node $u$ in Clique A, which is part of the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Within Clique A (a $K_5$), node $u$ is connected to all other 4 nodes.\n    *   Node $u$ is also connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of node $u$ is $\\text{deg}(u) = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5$.\n*   By symmetry, consider node $v$ in Clique B.\n    *   Within Clique B, node $v$ is connected to all other 4 nodes.\n    *   Node $v$ is also connected to node $u$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of node $v$ is $\\text{deg}(v) = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a two-stage random process for selecting an edge:\n\n1.  **Node Selection:** A node is selected uniformly at random from all $N$ nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is $1/N$. Here, $N=10$, so the probability is $1/10$.\n2.  **Neighbor Selection:** The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to \"gossip\" with. If the chosen node is $x$, the probability of it selecting a specific neighbor $y$ is $1/\\text{deg}(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nThe bottleneck edge $(u,v)$ is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n\n*   **Event 1:** Node $u$ is chosen first, and it then selects node $v$.\n*   **Event 2:** Node $v$ is chosen first, and it then selects node $u$.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1:**\n    *   The probability of choosing node $u$ first is $P(\\text{select } u) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $u$ is chosen, the probability of it selecting its neighbor $v$ is $P(\\text{select } v | u) = 1/\\text{deg}(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability for Event 1 is $P(\\text{Event 1}) = P(\\text{select } u) \\times P(\\text{select } v | u) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2:**\n    *   The probability of choosing node $v$ first is $P(\\text{select } v) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $v$ is chosen, the probability of it selecting its neighbor $u$ is $P(\\text{select } u | v) = 1/\\text{deg}(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability for Event 2 is $P(\\text{Event 2}) = P(\\text{select } v) \\times P(\\text{select } u | v) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   $P(\\text{sample bottleneck}) = P(\\text{Event 1}) + P(\\text{Event 2}) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** Correctly model the 10-node barbell graph as two $K_5$ cliques connected by a single edge.\n2.  **Degree Calculation:** Accurately calculate the degrees of the two nodes forming the bottleneck. A common mistake is to forget to add the bottleneck edge itself to the count, which increases the degree by 1 for both nodes.\n3.  **Process Definition:** Understand that gossiping is a two-step process (select node, then select neighbor), not a single-step process of picking an edge from all possible edges.\n4.  **Probability Summation:** Recognize that the bottleneck edge can be activated from either direction and that these are mutually exclusive events, so their probabilities must be added together.\n\nThe final probability is $1/25$, which can also be expressed as 0.04.\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
