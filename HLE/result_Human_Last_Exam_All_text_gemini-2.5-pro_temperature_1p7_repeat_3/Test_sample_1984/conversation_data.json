    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**1. Understand the problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we must calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points. Setting each factor to zero gives us:\n$$ x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1 $$\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**3. Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at $x_0$. This is called the linearization method or the first derivative test for stability.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    -   Consider a value slightly greater than 1, for example, $x = 1.1$.\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$ for $x > 1$, the solution $x(t)$ will decrease and move towards $x=1$.\n    -   Consider a value slightly less than 1, for example, $x = 0.9$.\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$ for $x < 1$, the solution $x(t)$ will decrease and move away from $x=1$.\n\n    For an equilibrium to be stable, solutions starting on both sides must approach it. Since solutions starting just below $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is **not a stable** equilibrium. (It is a semi-stable equilibrium).\n\n**4. Count the number of stable equilibrium points ($m$)**\nBased on our stability analysis, only one equilibrium point, $x=0$, is stable.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is:\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**5. Calculate the final expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
