    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **4-polytope:** A four-dimensional geometric object with vertices, edges, 2-faces (polygons), and 3-faces (cells or polyhedra).\n*   **f-vector:** A vector `(f0, f1, f2, f3)` where `fi` is the number of i-dimensional faces of the polytope.\n*   **f0 = 6:** The polytope has exactly 6 vertices.\n*   **Non-simplicial:** A polytope is simplicial if all its faces (of all dimensions) are simplices. A d-simplex is the convex hull of `d+1` points. For a 4-polytope, being non-simplicial means that it has at least one 2-face that is not a triangle or at least one 3-face (cell) that is not a tetrahedron.\n*   **Maximal number of 2-faces:** We are looking for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices that has the highest possible value for `f2`.\n\n### Step 2: Apply fundamental polytope relations\nThe Euler-Poincar√© formula for any 4-polytope states:\n`f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0`\nGiven `f0 = 6`, the equation becomes:\n`6 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0`, which can be rearranged to `f1 - f2 + f3 = 6`.\nAny valid f-vector for a 4-polytope with 6 vertices must satisfy this equation.\n\n### Step 3: Use the known classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices\nThe combinatorial types of convex polytopes with a small number of vertices are fully classified. For 4-dimensional polytopes (`d=4`) with 6 vertices (`f0=6`), it is known that there are exactly three distinct combinatorial types. Let's analyze each type to see if it matches the problem's criteria.\n\nThe three combinatorial types are:\n\n1.  **The neighborly simplicial polytope `M_6^4`:**\n    *   This polytope is **simplicial**. As such, it is not the polytope we are looking for.\n    *   For the record, its f-vector is `(6, 15, 20, 11)`. (Check Euler: `6 - 15 + 20 - 11 = 0`).\n\n2.  **The stacked 4-polytope, `S_4 \\# S_4`:**\n    *   This polytope is formed by taking two 4-simplices and gluing them together along a common facet (a tetrahedron).\n    *   All facets of this polytope are tetrahedra, which are 3-simplices. Therefore, this polytope is also **simplicial**. It is not the one we are looking for.\n    *   Its f-vector is `(6, 14, 16, 8)`. (Check Euler: `6 - 14 + 16 - 8 = 0`).\n\n3.  **The pyramid over a square pyramid, `Pyr(Pyr_sq)`:**\n    *   This polytope is constructed by taking a square pyramid (a 3D shape) as a base and building a 4D pyramid over it.\n    *   Let's determine if it's non-simplicial. A 3-face (cell) of `Pyr(Pyr_sq)` is either the base itself (`Pyr_sq`) or a 4D pyramid over a 2-face of the base. Since the base is a square pyramid, which is not a simplex (a tetrahedron), the resulting 4-polytope is **non-simplicial**. This is a candidate for our problem.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the f-vector of the non-simplicial candidate\nWe need to find the f-vector for `Pyr(Pyr_sq)`. First, let's list the f-vector for the base, a square pyramid (`P = Pyr_sq`):\n*   `f0(P) = 5` (4 vertices on the base, 1 apex)\n*   `f1(P) = 8` (4 edges on the base, 4 edges to the apex)\n*   `f2(P) = 5` (1 square base, 4 triangular sides)\n*   `f3(P) = 1` (the single 3D cell)\n\nThe f-vector of a pyramid over a `d`-polytope `P` is given by the formula `f_k(Pyr(P)) = f_k(P) + f_{k-1}(P)`.\nLet's apply this to our 4-polytope:\n*   `f0 = f0(P) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`\n*   `f1 = f1(P) + f0(P) = 8 + 5 = 13`\n*   `f2 = f2(P) + f1(P) = 5 + 8 = 13`\n*   `f3 = f3(P) + f2(P) = 1 + 5 = 6`\n\nSo, the f-vector is `(6, 13, 13, 6)`. Let's verify it with the Euler formula:\n`6 - 13 + 13 - 6 = 0`. The formula holds.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nAccording to the complete classification, there is only one combinatorial type of non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices. This means the condition \"with the maximal number of 2-faces\" is trivially satisfied, as there are no other non-simplicial candidates to compare against.\n\nThe f-vector of this unique non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is the one we calculated.\n\nFinal answer acquisition:\n*   The question asks for the f-vector of a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximum number of 2-faces.\n*   From the established classification of 4-polytopes, there is only one such non-simplicial polytope with 6 vertices.\n*   This polytope is the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n*   Its f-vector is `(6, 13, 13, 6)`.\n\nFinal Answer: The f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is (6, 13, 13, 6)."
