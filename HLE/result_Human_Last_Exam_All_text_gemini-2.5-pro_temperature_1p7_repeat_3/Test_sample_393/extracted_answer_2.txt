The number of Tverberg partitions is given by the formula $\frac{n!}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^{r} a_i!\right) \left(\prod_{j=1}^{k} m_j!\right)}$, where $a_1, \dots, a_r$ are the parts of the partition of $n$, and $m_j$ is the multiplicity of the $j$-th distinct part size among the $a_i$'s, for $j=1, \dots, k$.
