The following are the specific residues in the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, isoform 1, UniProt P54283-1, 599 amino acids) that act as hotspots.

**1) Hotspots for Interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the core of the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) binding pocket.
*   **W417 (Tryptophan-417):** A critical "linchpin" residue making extensive hydrophobic contacts deep within the binding pocket.
*   **I434 (Isoleucine-434):** A key hydrophobic residue lining the binding pocket.
*   **F467 (Phenylalanine-467):** An aromatic residue contributing to the hydrophobic interactions within the pocket.
*   **R519 (Arginine-519):** A charged residue at the rim of the pocket that forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the AID.

**2) Hotspots for Fine-tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
These residues are involved in allosterically modifying the channel's function after the initial binding event.
*   **Y300 (Tyrosine-300):** Located in the flexible linker between the SH3 and GK domains, this residue is a key modulator of the channel's inactivation kinetics.
*   **K551, K553, K555, R557 (Lysine-551, Lysine-553, Lysine-555, Arginine-557):** This cluster of basic residues in the distal C-terminus is essential for modulating the voltage-dependence of channel activation.
*   **I434 (Isoleucine-434):** This residue serves a dual role. While being a primary interaction hotspot, its precise orientation is also critical for transmitting the modulatory signal to the channel's gating machinery, particularly affecting inactivation.
