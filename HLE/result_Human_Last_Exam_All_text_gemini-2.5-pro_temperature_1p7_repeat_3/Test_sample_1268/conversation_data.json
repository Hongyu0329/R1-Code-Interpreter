    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the notation and the problem statement.**\n\n*   **Squarefree natural number $(N)$**: This specifies the `level` $N$ of the modular group. A number $N$ is squarefree if no prime factor is repeated in its prime factorization (e.g., $30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$).\n*   **Congruence Subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$**: This is the context in which the other objects are defined. It's a subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ consisting of matrices $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ where $c$ is a multiple of $N$.\n*   **Covolume $(V)$**: This is the volume of the quotient space (a Riemann surface) $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the PoincarÃ© upper half-plane. The formula for the covolume is:\n    $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}):\\Gamma_0(N)]$.\n    For a squarefree $N$, the index of the subgroup is $[SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}):\\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n    So, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n*   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$**: This notation, in the context of modular forms of level $N$, is best interpreted as the sup-norm of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke newform of weight $k$.\n    Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic Hecke newform of weight $k$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$. We normalize it to have unit $L^2$-norm, defining $\\hat{f}(z) = f(z)/\\|f\\|_2$. The quantity of interest is the sup-norm of the function $y^{k/2}\\hat{f}(z)$, which is invariant under the action of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n    $k_{k,\\infty} := \\sup_{z=x+iy \\in \\mathbb{H}} |y^{k/2}\\hat{f}(z)|$.\n    The question asks for an upper bound on this norm as a function of the covolume $V$. This is a famous problem in number theory known as the **sup-norm problem** in the level aspect.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the covolume $(V)$ to the level $(N)$.**\n\n*   We have $V = c \\cdot N \\cdot P(N)$, where $c = \\pi/3$ and $P(N) = \\prod_{p|N} (1+1/p)$.\n*   The term $P(N)$ is always greater than 1. It can also be bounded above. By results related to Gronwall's theorem, we know that $P(N) = O(\\log \\log N)$.\n*   This implies that $V$ is not strictly proportional to $N$, but their relationship is very close: $V \\asymp N \\log\\log N$.\n*   However, for the purpose of finding an upper bound of the form $O(V^\\alpha)$, the $\\log\\log N$ factor is \"weak\" enough that it can be absorbed into an arbitrarily small power of $V$. Specifically, since $\\log\\log N \\ll_\\delta N^\\delta$ for any $\\delta>0$, a bound of the form $N^{\\alpha+\\epsilon}$ is equivalent to a bound of the form $V^{\\alpha+\\epsilon'}$ for any $\\epsilon' > \\epsilon$. Therefore, we can find the best bound in terms of $N$ and then express it in terms of $V$ with the same exponent.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the best known upper bound for the sup-norm.**\n\nThe sup-norm problem is an active area of research. We are looking for the best known (i.e., smallest) exponent $\\alpha$ in the bound $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{\\alpha+\\epsilon}$.\n\n*   **Trivial Bound**: Basic estimates from the pre-trace formula yield an exponent of $\\alpha = 1/2$.\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_k N^{1/2} (\\log N)^{O(1)}$.\n*   **Subconvex Bounds**: A major goal is to find an exponent $\\alpha < 1/2$.\n*   **Iwaniec-Sarnak Bound (1995)**: For squarefree $N$, they established the bound with exponent $\\alpha = 5/24$.\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{5/24+\\epsilon}$. (Note: $5/24 \\approx 0.2083$).\n*   **Templier's Bound (2010)**: This result was improved by Nicolas Templier. For the more general case of cubefree $N$ (which includes squarefree $N$), he proved the bound with an exponent of $\\alpha = 1/5$.\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{1/5+\\epsilon}$. (Note: $1/5 = 0.2$).\n    Since $1/5 < 5/24$, this is a stronger bound and represents the current record for this general setting.\n\n**Step 4: Combining the results to formulate the final answer.**\n\n1.  The best known upper bound for the maximum norm in terms of the level $N$ is:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{1/5+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. The implied constant depends on the weight $k$ and on $\\epsilon$.\n2.  Using the relationship $N = O(V)$, we can directly substitute this into the inequality:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} (C \\cdot V)^{1/5+\\epsilon} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} V^{1/5+\\epsilon}$.\n3.  Therefore, the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $O_{k,\\epsilon}(V^{1/5+\\epsilon})$.\n\nThis represents the state-of-the-art result for the general class of forms on $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is a squarefree integer.\n\n<<<The upper bound is given by the relation $k_{k,\\infty} \\le C_{k,\\epsilon} V^{1/5+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, where $C_{k,\\epsilon}$ is a constant that depends only on the weight $k$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$. In Big O notation, this is written as $O_{k,\\epsilon}(V^{1/5+\\epsilon})$.>>>"
