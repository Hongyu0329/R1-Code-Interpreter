The primary reason a functional MRI receive coil may show no resonance is due to its **active detuning circuit**. This safety mechanism is designed to make the coil non-resonant during the scanner's high-power transmit pulse to prevent component damage and patient burns. This is typically achieved with PIN diodes that are controlled by a DC voltage from the scanner. When the coil is on the bench without this control voltage, it defaults to a "safe," detuned (non-resonant) state. A secondary cause is that the coil's integrated preamplifier is unpowered, presenting an incorrect impedance load to the resonant element and thereby preventing it from resonating as designed.
