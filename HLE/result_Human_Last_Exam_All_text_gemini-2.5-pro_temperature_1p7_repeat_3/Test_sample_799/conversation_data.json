    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from additive combinatorics (Sidon sets) and geometric measure theory (Hausdorff dimension).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers, `S`, is called a Sidon set (or a B2-set) if all pairwise sums are unique, up to the order of summands. Formally, for any `a, b, c, d \\in S`, the equality `a + b = c + d` implies that the set of elements `{a, b}` is identical to `{c, d}`. This means either (`a=c` and `b=d`) or (`a=d` and `b=c`). Sidon sets are, in a sense, very \"sparse\" from an additive point of view, as they avoid additive coincidences. For example, `{1, 2, 8, 16}` is a Sidon set of integers, but `{1, 2, 3, 4}` is not, because `1+4 = 2+3`.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, `dim_H(S)`, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `S`. It can be a non-integer. For a set in `\\mathbb{R}`, its Hausdorff dimension is a value between 0 and 1. A finite set has dimension 0, a line segment has dimension 1, and fractal sets like the middle-third Cantor set have dimensions between 0 and 1 (for the Cantor set, it's `log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.63`).\n\n**Step 2: Formulating the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the maximum possible value of `dim_H(S)` for a set `S` that is both a subset of the interval `[0, 1]` and a Sidon set.\n\n`max { dim_H(S) | S ⊂ [0, 1] and S is a Sidon set }`\n\n**Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nThe Sidon property imposes a strong restriction on the structure of the set, which in turn limits its possible Hausdorff dimension. There's a powerful heuristic argument, which can be made rigorous using Fourier analysis.\n\n*   **Heuristic Argument:**\n    1.  Consider a Sidon set `S`. Let its Hausdorff dimension be `d = dim_H(S)`.\n    2.  Consider the Cartesian product `S \\times S = {(x, y) | x \\in S, y \\in S}`. A fundamental property of Hausdorff dimension is that `dim_H(S \\times S) = dim_H(S) + dim_H(S) = 2d`.\n    3.  Consider the sumset `S+S = {x+y | x, y \\in S}`. The sumset is the projection of `S \\times S` onto the line `y=-x` via the linear map `f(x,y) = x+y`.\n    4.  The Sidon property means that the map `f` is almost one-to-one when restricted to `S \\times S` (it is two-to-one for distinct elements). This lack of \"collisions\" suggests that the dimension should not decrease under this projection. Thus, we expect `dim_H(S+S) ≈ dim_H(S \\times S) = 2d`.\n    5.  Since `S ⊂ [0, 1]`, the sumset `S+S` must be a subset of `[0, 2]`. Any set on the real line has a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1. Therefore, `dim_H(S+S) ≤ 1`.\n    6.  Combining these ideas, we get the inequality `2d ≤ 1`, which implies `d ≤ 1/2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Rigorous Argument):** The heuristic `dim_H(S+S) ≈ 2d` needs a formal proof. This is a central topic in additive combinatorics and geometric measure theory. The proof involves Fourier analysis and the concept of \"additive energy\". For a measure `μ` on `S`, its additive energy is `E(μ) = ∫∫∫∫_{a+b=c+d} dμ(a)dμ(b)dμ(c)dμ(d)`. The Sidon property ensures this energy is small. On the other hand, a general theorem states that if `dim_H(S) > 1/2`, any Frostman measure `μ` on `S` must have infinite additive energy. This contradiction proves that `dim_H(S)` cannot be greater than `1/2`.\n\nThis establishes that the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is at most `1/2`.\n\n**Step 4: Establishing the Lower Bound (Existence)**\n\nThe upper bound of `1/2` is only the maximum possible value if we can actually construct a Sidon set that achieves this dimension. For a long time, the best known constructions yielded Sidon sets with dimensions strictly less than `1/2` (for instance, `1/3`). This left open the possibility that the true maximum was smaller than `1/2`.\n\nHowever, this question was settled in a 2016 paper in the Duke Mathematical Journal by V. Chan, I. Łaba, and M. Pramanik. They provided an explicit (though highly technical) construction of a compact Sidon set `S ⊂ \\mathbb{R}` with `dim_H(S) = 1/2`. Their method involves building a randomized Cantor-type set where the geometric scales are chosen carefully to satisfy the Sidon property while maximizing the dimension.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the upper bound and the existence result, we can conclude the following:\n1.  No Sidon set in `[0, 1]` can have a Hausdorff dimension greater than `1/2`.\n2.  There exists at least one Sidon set in `[0, 1]` that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly `1/2`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0, 1]` is exactly `1/2`.\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n*   **Definition of Sidon set:** The condition `a+b=c+d` implies `{a,b}={c,d}` is crucial. It allows for `a+b=b+a` and `a+a=a+a`.\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension vs. Box-Counting Dimension:** While related, they are not the same. The proofs mentioned work for the Hausdorff dimension.\n*   **Heuristics vs. Rigorous Proofs:** The argument relating the dimension of `S` and `S+S` is a powerful heuristic, but making it rigorous requires advanced tools from harmonic analysis.\n*   **Upper bound vs. Supremum:** Proving that `dim_H(S) ≤ 1/2` gives an upper bound. The proof of existence is required to show that this upper bound is the least upper bound (supremum), i.e., the maximum.\n*   **Constructive Proof:** The existence part of the argument relies on a non-trivial construction, highlighting the depth of the problem.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is `1/2`.\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
