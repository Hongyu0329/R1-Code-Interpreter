    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe need to find the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nFirst, we try to factor $f(x)$. By rearranging and grouping terms, we can find a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo the roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's call them $K_g$ and $K_h$ respectively.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors**\n\n*   **Analysis of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The degree of this extension is $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    1.  **Irducibility:** We check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's consider the polynomial modulo a prime. Modulo 2, $h(x) \\equiv x^5 - x + 1 = x^5+x+1$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. (It has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and is not a product of an irreducible quadratic $x^2+x+1$ and an irreducible cubic $x^3+x^2+1$ or $x^3+x+1$). Therefore, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Alternatively, using Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted polynomial: Let's consider $h(x+1) = (x+1)^5 - 9(x+1) + 3 = (x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1) - 9x - 9 + 3 = x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 4x - 5$. All coefficients except the leading one are divisible by the prime $p=5$. The constant term, -5, is not divisible by $p^2=25$. Thus, by Eisenstein's criterion, $h(x+1)$ is irreducible, and so is $h(x)$.\n\n    2.  **Galois Group:** Let $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $h(x)$ is an irreducible quintic, $G_h$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which one, we examine the number of real roots.\n    The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points. This implies $h(x)$ has at most 3 real roots.\n    *   $h(\\infty) \\to \\infty$\n    *   $h(-\\infty) \\to -\\infty$\n    *   At the local maximum $x = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $h(x) = (\\frac{36}{5})\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$.\n    *   At the local minimum $x = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $h(x) = -(\\frac{36}{5})\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 < 0$ since $36/5 > 1$ and $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 1$.\n    Since the function changes sign between its local extrema, and goes to $\\pm \\infty$, there are exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    A theorem states that for an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\n    Here, $p=5$, so $G_h = S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the compositum**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $G_g \\times G_h \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. The order of the extension is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\n\nWe need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$. Since $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension with group $S_5$, its only quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n + ax + b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (1-n)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_h = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (1-5)^{4}(-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nWe need to check if this is the same field as $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This would require $-14863419 = 2 \\cdot r^2$ for some $r \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This is impossible, as the left side is negative and the right side is positive.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis implies that $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] \\cdot [K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\nThe Galois group is the direct product: $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of normal sub-extensions**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means the corresponding subgroup $H$ must be a proper non-trivial normal subgroup, i.e., $H \\neq \\{e\\}$ and $H \\neq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nLet $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $G_2 = S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G_1$ are $\\{0\\}$ and $G_1$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G_2=S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\nA normal subgroup $H$ of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ is not necessarily a product of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. A complete classification (using Goursat's Lemma or direct analysis) gives the following possibilities for a normal subgroup $H \\unlhd G_1 \\times G_2$:\n\n1.  **Product Subgroups:** $H = N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$.\n    *   $H = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H|=2$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n    *   $H = \\{0\\} \\times A_5$. $|H|=60$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n    *   $H = \\{0\\} \\times S_5$. $|H|=120$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n    *   $H = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$. $|H|=2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n\n2.  **Skew Subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors.\n    Let $\\phi: S_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ be the sign homomorphism, sgn. This is a surjective group homomorphism with kernel $A_5$.\n    The subgroup $H = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$ is a normal subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. The map $\\sigma \\mapsto (\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma)$ is an isomorphism from $S_5$ to $H$, so $|H|=|S_5|=120$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n\nThese are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. Now we compute the corresponding degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$.\n\n*   For $H = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$ ($|H|=2$), the degree is $240/2 = 120$. This corresponds to $L = K_h$.\n*   For $H = \\{0\\} \\times A_5$ ($|H|=60$), the degree is $240/60 = 4$. This corresponds to $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$.\n*   For $H = \\{0\\} \\times S_5$ ($|H|=120$), the degree is $240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to $L = K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   For $H = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$ ($|H|=120$), the degree is $240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$.\n*   For $H = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$ ($|H|=120$), the degree is $240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta_h})$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is the set of these calculated values.\nThe possible degrees are $\\{120, 4, 2\\}$.\n\nFinal Answer Listing: The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
