    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Qudit:** A quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n*   **Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$):** A quantum channel that maps a qudit density matrix $\\rho$ to another one, defined as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger$\n    where:\n    *   $U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system. They are unitary operators and form an operator basis for $d \\times d$ matrices.\n    *   $p_{jk}$ are probabilities, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ for all $j,k$, and $\\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} = 1$. These conditions ensure the map is completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP).\n*   **Complementary Channel ($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$):** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a unitary interaction $U$ with an environment, initially in a pure state $|e_0\\rangle$. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the resulting state of the environment. If $\\Lambda$ maps states on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to states on $\\mathcal{H}_S$, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ maps states on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to states on the environment's Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n*   **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix, $J(\\Lambda)$. This matrix is obtained by sending one-half of a maximally entangled state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ through the channel:\n    $J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id}_S \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|)$, where $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_S \\otimes |i\\rangle_S$.\n    The Choi matrix is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ positive semi-definite matrix.\n\n**2. Relate the Ranks of the Channel and its Complement**\n\nA fundamental theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of a channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel.\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$\nwhere the rank is understood as the Choi rank.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This theorem is crucial as it simplifies the problem. We no longer need to explicitly construct the complementary channel. The problem is reduced to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n\n**3. Compute the Choi Matrix of the Pauli Channel**\n\nLet's compute $J(\\Lambda)$:\n$J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|) = \\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{jk}) |\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi| (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{jk})^\\dagger$\n\nLet's define a set of vectors $|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle = (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{jk}) |\\Phi\\rangle$. Then the Choi matrix can be written as:\n$J(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} |\\psi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{jk}|$\n\n**4. Analyze the Vectors $|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle$**\n\nThe rank of $J(\\Lambda)$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the set $\\{|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle \\mid p_{jk} > 0\\}$. To find the maximal rank, we need to find the number of linearly independent vectors in the full set $\\{|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$.\n\nLet's check if these vectors are orthogonal. We compute their inner product:\n$\\langle \\psi_{ab} | \\psi_{jk} \\rangle = \\langle\\Phi| (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{ab})^\\dagger (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{jk}) |\\Phi\\rangle = \\langle\\Phi| (\\text{id} \\otimes U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{jk}) |\\Phi\\rangle$\n\nThere is a useful identity for any operator $V$: $\\langle\\Phi| (I \\otimes V) |\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\text{Tr}(V)$. Using this, we get:\n$\\langle \\psi_{ab} | \\psi_{jk} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\text{Tr}(U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{jk})$\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product:\n$\\text{Tr}(U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{jk}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{aj} \\delta_{bk}$\n\nSubstituting this into our inner product calculation:\n$\\langle \\psi_{ab} | \\psi_{jk} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} (d \\cdot \\delta_{aj} \\delta_{bk}) = \\delta_{aj} \\delta_{bk}$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This result is central to the solution. It shows that the set of $d^2$ vectors $\\{|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ is an orthonormal set.\n\n**5. Determine the Rank of the Choi Matrix**\n\nSince the vectors $\\{|\\psi_{jk}\\rangle\\}$ form an orthonormal basis for the $d^2$-dimensional space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_S$, the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} |\\psi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{jk}|$ is a diagonal matrix in this basis. The diagonal entries are the probabilities $\\{p_{jk}\\}$.\n\nThe rank of a diagonal matrix is equal to the number of its non-zero entries.\n$\\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda)) = \\text{Number of } (j,k) \\text{ such that } p_{jk} > 0$\n\n**6. Find the Maximal Rank**\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the channel $\\Lambda$, we need to choose the probabilities $p_{jk}$ to maximize the number of non-zero entries, subject to the constraints $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum p_{jk}=1$.\n\nWe can choose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. A simple choice is the uniform distribution:\n$p_{jk} = \\frac{1}{d^2}$ for all $j,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\n\nThis choice of probabilities corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel, which is a valid Pauli channel. For this channel, all $d^2$ probabilities are positive. Therefore, the rank of its Choi matrix is $d^2$.\n\nThe Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix, so its rank can be at most $d^2$. Since we found a specific Pauli channel for which the rank is exactly $d^2$, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n**7. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Since the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the rank of $\\Lambda$, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is also $d^2$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional system is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
