A detailed methodology for designing a tightly secure, two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme involves three main phases: key generation, a two-round signing protocol, and signature aggregation.

**Phase 1: Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**
A robust DKG protocol, such as Pedersen VSS, is run as a one-time setup. This generates a single master public key `PK` for the group and distributes a private key share `sk_i` and a corresponding public verification key `PK_i` to each of the `n` parties, without any single party learning the master private key `sk`.

**Phase 2: Two-Round Signing Protocol**
This is the core interactive protocol, based on the Schnorr signature scheme, and is executed by a group `S` of `t` signers for a message `m`.

*   **Round 1: Commitment**
    1.  Each participant `P_i` in `S` secretly generates two random one-time nonces, `d_i` and `e_i`.
    2.  Each `P_i` computes public commitments `D_i = d_i * G` and `E_i = e_i * G` (where `G` is the group generator).
    3.  Each `P_i` broadcasts the pair `(D_i, E_i)` to all other `t-1` participants in `S`.

*   **Round 2: Response**
    1.  After receiving all commitment pairs, each `P_i` assembles the full set of session commitments, `B = {(ID_j, D_j, E_j)}_{j∈S}`.
    2.  Each `P_i` computes a binding factor `ρ_j` for each participant by hashing the session's full context: `ρ_j = H_bind(PK, m, B)`. This is the critical step for tight security, as it links each party's contribution to the specific message and participant set.
    3.  Each `P_i` computes the group's public nonce commitment `R = Σ_{j∈S} (D_j + ρ_j * E_j)`.
    4.  Each `P_i` computes the signature challenge `c = H_chal(PK, R, m)`.
    5.  Each `P_i` calculates its final partial signature `z_i` using its private nonces, private key share `sk_i`, its Lagrange coefficient `λ_i`, the binding factor, and the challenge:
        `z_i = d_i + (e_i * ρ_j) + (c * λ_i * sk_i)`
    6.  Each `P_i` broadcasts `z_i`.

**Phase 3: Signature Aggregation and Verification**
This final phase is non-interactive.

1.  **Reconstruction:** An aggregator (who could be any party) collects the `t` partial signatures `z_i`. For robustness, each share can be individually verified before use.
2.  **Aggregation:** The aggregator computes the final signature response `s = Σ_{i∈S} z_i`.
3.  **Final Signature:** The output is a standard Schnorr signature `σ = (R, s)`, which can be publicly verified against the master key `PK` using the equation `s*G = R + c*PK`.

This design is tightly secure because the two-nonce commitment scheme combined with context-dependent binding factors prevents linear combination attacks across signing sessions, allowing for a security proof that does not degrade with the number of queries an adversary makes.
