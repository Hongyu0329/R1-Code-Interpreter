    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the query are:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Creation Date:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Acquisition Year:** 1967\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research Strategy:** A direct search for `\"Kurt Günther\" \"The Radionist\" 1967 acquisition` is a good starting point. It's also helpful to use the original German title, \"Der Radionist,\" as it may yield more specific results from European or art-historical sources.\n\n3.  **Executing the Search and Finding the Owning Institution:**\n    *   Searching for the artwork quickly reveals that it is held in the collection of the **Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)**. Multiple sources, including the museum's own online collection, art databases, and exhibition catalogs, confirm this.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Acquisition Year:**\n    *   The most crucial step is to confirm the specific year of acquisition was 1967. Museum records are the most reliable source for this information.\n    *   We can check the artwork's entry on the official LACMA collections website.\n    *   The museum provides an **accession number** for each piece in its collection. The accession number for \"The Radionist\" is **M.67.65**.\n    *   Museum accession numbers are standardized codes, and the format often begins with a letter followed by the year of acquisition. In this case, \"M.67\" stands for Museum acquisition, year 1967. The \".65\" indicates it was the 65th object acquired that year.\n    *   The credit line on the museum's website also states: \"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Gerhart Liebmann,\" and sources confirm this gift was made in 1967.\n\n5.  **Synthesizing the Findings:**\n    *   The painting \"The Radionist\" (1927) by Kurt Günther is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).\n    *   The museum's official accession number for the painting is M.67.65.\n    *   The number \"67\" in the accession number definitively confirms the year of acquisition was 1967.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **German Title:** Using \"Der Radionist\" in searches is important for accuracy.\n*   **Accession Number:** The accession number is the primary piece of evidence for confirming the acquisition date. Understanding how to read it is key.\n*   **Primary Source:** Always prioritize information from the owning institution (in this case, LACMA) over third-party sites, as it is the most authoritative source.\n\n<<<Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)>>>"
