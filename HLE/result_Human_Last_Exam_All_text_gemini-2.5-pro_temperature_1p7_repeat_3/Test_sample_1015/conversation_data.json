    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the primary technical difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) between two major ballet methodologies: Vaganova and Balanchine.\n\n2.  **Define Cambré Derrière:** This is a ballet term for bending the torso backward from the waist. The dancer keeps their legs in a stable position on the floor while the upper body arches back. The goal is to create a graceful and controlled arc with the spine.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova, prioritizes strength, core control, and precise, clean lines. It builds flexibility upon a foundation of stability.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Hips:** The hips must remain perfectly square to the front. They act as a stable anchor. The dancer pushes the pelvis slightly forward for counterbalance, but the two hip bones stay on the same horizontal plane.\n        *   **Spine:** The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum toward the ceiling to create the arc. The lower back is supported and not crunched.\n        *   **Overall Aesthetic:** The look is one of controlled, epicene grace, where the backbend is achieved purely through spinal flexibility while maintaining strict pelvic alignment.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, musicality, and neoclassical aesthetic, which often involves pushing classical lines to their extremes.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Hips:** This is the key point of divergence. The Balanchine style allows for a more \"broken\" line to achieve a deeper and more dramatic bend. Often, the hip of the front or working leg is allowed to push forward and lift, taking the pelvis out of its square alignment.\n        *   **Spine:** This release of the hip facilitates a deeper backbend that can appear more extreme or angled.\n        *   **Overall Aesthetic:** The look is often more dynamic, angular, and visually dramatic, prioritizing the creation of a spectacular line over the strict, squared-off torso of the Vaganova style.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there may be subtle differences in *port de bras* (carriage of the arms), the fundamental arm positions (e.g., fifth *en haut*) for a cambré are similar. This is not the primary distinguishing factor.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This directly addresses the core difference identified in the analysis. Vaganova insists on square hips, while Balanchine allows the hip to release forward to achieve a deeper bend. This is the most significant and defining technical difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often faster, a cambré can be performed at any tempo in either style depending on the musicality of the exercise or choreography. Speed is a general characteristic, not a specific technical rule for this movement.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The greater degree of backbend often seen in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the different hip placement. The hip release is what *allows* for the deeper bend. Therefore, hip placement is the cause, and the degree of the bend is the effect. The more fundamental answer is the cause.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both techniques, the head follows the line of the spine during the bend. While Vaganova has very specific rules for head positioning and focus (*épaulement*), the fundamental difference in the mechanics of the *cambré* itself lies in the torso and hips, not the head.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most fundamental and defining difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the use of the hips. Vaganova demands square, stable hips, while Balanchine allows a hip to press forward, \"breaking the line\" to facilitate a more extreme bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
