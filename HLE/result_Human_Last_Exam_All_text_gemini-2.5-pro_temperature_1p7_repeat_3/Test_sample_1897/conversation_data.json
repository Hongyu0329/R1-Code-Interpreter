    "**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical form of the product.**\n    The infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n    Let's define a variable $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be rewritten in terms of $q$ as:\n    $$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots $$\n    This form is known in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions. It corresponds to the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the product to standard mathematical functions.**\n    The product $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$ is related to the full q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q)_{\\infty}$ which is defined as $(q;q)_{\\infty} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. We can split the product for $(q;q)_{\\infty}$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n    $$ (q;q)_{\\infty} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})\\right) $$\n    This can be written using q-Pochhammer symbols as:\n    $$ (q;q)_{\\infty} = (q^2; q^2)_{\\infty} (q; q^2)_{\\infty} $$\n    Our product $P$ is $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$, so we have:\n    $$ P = \\frac{(q;q)_{\\infty}}{(q^2; q^2)_{\\infty}} $$\n\n3.  **Introduce Ramanujan's Class Invariants.**\n    A very powerful tool for evaluating such products at specific values of $q$ is Ramanujan's theory of class invariants.\n    Ramanujan defined the function $G(q)$ as:\n    $$ G(q) = q^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = q^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) $$\n    Our product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. Comparing this with the definition of $G(q)$, we see:\n    $$ P = q^{1/24} G(q) $$\n    The class invariants $G_n$ are the values of the function $G(q)$ at $q = e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$:\n    $$ G_n = G(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}) $$\n    In our problem, $q = e^{-\\pi}$, which corresponds to the case $n=1$. So, we can write our product $P$ in terms of the class invariant $G_1$:\n    $$ P = (e^{-\\pi})^{1/24} G(e^{-\\pi}) = e^{-\\pi/24} G_1 $$\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the value of $G_1$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the class invariant $G_1$.**\n    The class invariants $G_n$ are related to the singular values of the elliptic modulus $k$. The elliptic modulus $k_n$ corresponding to the invariant $G_n$ is the value of $k$ that satisfies the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{K(\\sqrt{1-k_n^2})}{K(k_n)} = \\sqrt{n} $$\n    where $K(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n    For $n=1$, we need to find $k_1$ such that $K(\\sqrt{1-k_1^2}) = K(k_1)$. The function $K(k)$ is strictly increasing for $k \\in [0,1)$, so this equality holds only if the arguments are equal: $\\sqrt{1-k_1^2} = k_1$. Squaring both sides gives $1-k_1^2 = k_1^2$, which leads to $2k_1^2 = 1$, or $k_1 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The complementary modulus is $k'_1 = \\sqrt{1-k_1^2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    Ramanujan provided a formula that connects $G_n$ to the corresponding elliptic modulus $k_n$:\n    $$ G_n = (2k_n k'_n)^{-1/12} $$\n    Now we can substitute the values of $k_1$ and $k'_1$ to find $G_1$:\n    $$ G_1 = \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{-1/12} = \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-1/12} = (1)^{-1/12} = 1 $$\n    So, the value of the first class invariant is $G_1=1$. This is a well-established result in the theory of modular forms.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final expression for the product.**\n    Now we substitute the value $G_1=1$ back into our expression for $P$:\n    $$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} G_1 = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 1 = e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly identifying the product with the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$ for $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n*   Relating this product to Ramanujan's G-function and identifying the specific class invariant needed ($G_1$).\n*   Using the correct framework to determine the elliptic modulus $k_1$ corresponding to $G_1$, which is based on the modular ratio $K'/K = \\sqrt{n}$.\n*   Using a standard formula relating $G_n$ to $k_n$ and $k'_n$. There are variations in definitions in the literature, but the chosen one is standard and correctly reproduces known values like $G_1=1$.\n*   Carefully performing the algebraic substitutions to arrive at the final result.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for the infinite product is $e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<e^(-\\pi/24)>>>"
