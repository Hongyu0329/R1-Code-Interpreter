    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) indicates the specific 3D arrangement of the bromo and methyl groups. On adjacent carbons in a ring, an S,R (or R,S) relationship means the two substituents are *trans* to each other.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KO^tBu$) in tert-butyl alcohol ($^tBuOH$). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   We have a secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong, bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n*   Substitution reactions (SN2) are disfavored due to the steric bulk of the tert-butoxide nucleophile.\n*   E1/SN1 reactions are disfavored because a strong base is present, which will promote the bimolecular E2 pathway over the formation of a carbocation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement translates to a **trans-diaxial** orientation. Both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   Since the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* in (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, there are two possible chair conformations that are in equilibrium.\n    1.  **Diequatorial Conformer:** The more stable conformation, where the bulky bromo and methyl groups occupy equatorial positions to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). In this conformation, the axial positions are occupied by hydrogen atoms.\n    2.  **Diaxial Conformer:** The less stable conformation, where both the bromo and methyl groups occupy axial positions. This conformer is much higher in energy due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric interactions.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Reactive Conformation and Identify the Product**\n*   **Analysis of the Diequatorial Conformer:** In this more stable conformer, the bromine atom is in an equatorial position. There are no β-hydrogens that are trans-diaxial to an equatorial bromine. Therefore, **this conformer is unreactive in an E2 reaction.**\n*   **Analysis of the Diaxial Conformer:** For the E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must adopt the less stable diaxial conformation, where the bromine atom is in an axial position. Let's assume the Br is axial-up. The trans methyl group on the adjacent carbon (C2) will be axial-down.\n*   **Identifying the β-hydrogens:** The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has the axial-down methyl group. The other substituent is a hydrogen, which must be in the equatorial-up position. This hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial-up bromine atom. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is axial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is axial-down. This hydrogen *is* anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial-up bromine atom at C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The E2 elimination is forced to occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6. This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 is unaffected. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is sometimes called the Hofmann product because it is the less substituted alkene, but in this case, its formation is dictated by stereoelectronics, not sterics.\n\n**Summary**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism, which requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group and a beta-proton. Only the less stable diaxial conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane can achieve this geometry. In that conformer, the only beta-proton that is trans-diaxial to the bromine is on C6, not C2. Therefore, elimination must occur to form the double bond between C1 and C6, yielding 3-methylcyclohexene as the sole product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
