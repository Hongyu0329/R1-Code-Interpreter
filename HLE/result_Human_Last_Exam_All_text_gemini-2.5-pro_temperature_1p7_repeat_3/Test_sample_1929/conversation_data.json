    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1: Butadiene**. Its chemical structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene, which means it has alternating double and single bonds. In reactions, it often acts as the \"diene\" component.\n    *   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is a substituted alkene and can act as a \"dienophile\" (a diene-loving species).\n    *   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition. It involves the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile.\n\n2.  **Understand the Mechanism of a Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted, one-step reaction that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   The four carbon atoms of the diene and the two carbon atoms of the dienophile's double bond combine to form a new cyclohexene ring.\n    *   During this process:\n        *   Two new carbon-carbon single bonds (sigma bonds) are formed.\n        *   The two double bonds in the diene and the one double bond in the dienophile are broken.\n        *   One new carbon-carbon double bond (pi bond) is formed within the new ring, between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original diene.\n\n3.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Product:**\n    *   Let's number the carbons of butadiene as C1-C2-C3-C4 (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Let's denote the carbons of the dienophile as Ca=Cb (CCl₂=CF₂).\n    *   The new sigma bonds will form between C1 of the diene and one of the dienophile carbons (e.g., Ca), and between C4 of the diene and the other dienophile carbon (Cb).\n    *   The new double bond will be between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n    *   This forms a cyclohexene skeleton, where the carbons from the dienophile now bear the chlorine and fluorine substituents.\n\n4.  **Consider Potential Isomers (Regiochemistry):**\n    *   **Careful Point**: We must consider if different orientations of the reactants can lead to different products. This is known as regioselectivity.\n    *   The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical.\n    *   There are two ways the dienophile can align with the diene before the reaction:\n        *   **Orientation A:** The CCl₂ group aligns to form a bond with C1, and CF₂ aligns with C4.\n        *   **Orientation B:** The CF₂ group aligns to form a bond with C1, and CCl₂ aligns with C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the resulting structures. If we number the final cyclohexene ring so the double bond is between positions 1 and 2, the substituents will be at positions 4 and 5.\n        *   **Product from Orientation A:** This would place the CCl₂ group at one position (e.g., C4) and the CF₂ group at the adjacent position (C5). This gives 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n        *   **Product from Orientation B:** This would place the CF₂ group at C4 and the CCl₂ group at C5. The initial name might be 4,4-difluoro-5,5-dichlorocyclohex-1-ene.\n    *   **Resolution**: According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the alphabetically prior substituent the lower number. \"Chloro\" comes before \"Fluoro\". Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be at position 4. This means the product from Orientation B must be renumbered, and its correct name is also **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   Since both orientations lead to products that are identical (they are the same molecule and have the same IUPAC name), there is no regioselectivity to consider. Only one product is formed.\n\n5.  **Final Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   A cyclohexene ring is formed.\n    *   There is a double bond between what were C2 and C3 of the butadiene.\n    *   On the two saturated carbons adjacent to each other (that came from the dienophile), one carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms, and the other is bonded to two fluorine atoms.\n    *   The IUPAC name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. The reaction forms a single product, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe chemical equation is:\nCH₂=CH-CH=CH₂ + CCl₂=CF₂ → 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\n\n<<<The product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.>>>"
