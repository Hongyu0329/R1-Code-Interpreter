After the gate Q is applied to the first ququint (A) of the entangled pair and ququint A is subsequently measured in the computational basis, the final state of the system is probabilistic. It collapses into one of the following five configurations, with the specified probability and resulting state for the second ququint (B):
1.  **Outcome $|0\rangle_A$**: Occurs with probability **1/5**. The state of ququint B becomes $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  **Outcome $|1\rangle_A$**: Occurs with probability **1/5**. The state of ququint B becomes $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  **Outcome $|2\rangle_A$**: Occurs with probability **3/10**. The state of ququint B becomes $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  **Outcome $|3\rangle_A$**: Occurs with probability **1/5**. The state of ququint B becomes $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  **Outcome $|4\rangle_A$**: Occurs with probability **1/10**. The state of ququint B becomes $|2\rangle_B$.
