    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Name\nThe name \"perfluoronanocar\" can be broken into two parts:\n*   **\"Perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It signifies that all the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms in the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n*   **\"-nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific type of molecule designed at the nanoscale to resemble a car, typically with a chassis, axles, and wheels. It is not a single, universally defined molecule but a class of molecules.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Parent \"Nanocar\" Molecule\nSince \"nanocar\" can refer to several different complex molecules synthesized by various research groups, we must choose the most representative or original one. The term \"nanocar\" was popularized by the research group of Professor James M. Tour at Rice University. Their first buckyball-wheeled nanocar, detailed in a 2005 publication in the *Journal of Organic Chemistry*, is arguably the most canonical example. We will use this molecule as the basis for our analysis.\n\nThis nanocar consists of two main parts:\n1.  A hydrocarbon **chassis** which includes the frame, axles, and bearings.\n2.  Four **wheels** made of C₆₀ fullerene (buckyballs).\n\nThe \"perfluoro-\" prefix applies to C-H bonds. Since C₆₀ fullerenes are all-carbon allotropes and contain no hydrogen atoms, we only need to count the hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon chassis.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Nanocar Chassis\nThe structure of the chassis for the original Tour nanocar (referred to as Nanocar **1** in the paper) is complex. We must break it down into its constituent parts to count the number of hydrogen atoms accurately.\n\nThe chassis is composed of:\n*   **A central aromatic core**: This is a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring. A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with four substituents has two remaining hydrogen atoms. So, this part contributes **2 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Two spacer groups**: Attached to the central ring are two para-phenylene groups (-C₆H₄-). Each of these spacer groups contains **4 hydrogen atoms**. The total from these two groups is 2 * 4 = **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Four axle/bearing groups**: The axles and their bearings are made from adamantane. Adamantane (C₁₀H₁₆) is a bulky, rigid hydrocarbon. In the nanocar structure, each of the four adamantane units is attached to the rest of the chassis at two points (specifically, it is 1,3-disubstituted). This means two hydrogen atoms are removed from the base adamantane molecule. Therefore, each adamantyl group in the structure is a C₁₀H₁₄ unit, contributing **14 hydrogen atoms**. With four such groups, the total is 4 * 14 = **56 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nTo find the total number of hydrogen atoms in one nanocar molecule, we sum the hydrogens from each part of the chassis:\n*   Hydrogens from the central ring: 2\n*   Hydrogens from the phenylene spacers: 8\n*   Hydrogens from the adamantyl groups: 56\n\nTotal Hydrogen Atoms = 2 + 8 + 56 = **66**\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms in a Perfluoronanocar\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that every hydrogen atom in the original molecule is replaced by a fluorine atom. Since we calculated that the parent nanocar molecule contains 66 hydrogen atoms, the corresponding perfluoronanocar would have each of these 66 positions occupied by a fluorine atom.\n\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain **66 fluorine atoms**.\n\n<<<66>>>"
