    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group (-C(=O)NH₂).\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, making it a tertiary amide: -C(=O)N(Et)₂. This group is at position 1 of the ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring substituted at position 1 with an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group and at position 3 with a dimethylamino group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Reaction**\nThe reagents are `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (tetrahydrofuran) solvent.\n*   **`sec-BuLi`**: A very strong organolithium base used to deprotonate weakly acidic C-H bonds.\n*   **`TMEDA`**: A chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it a much more reactive base. It also plays a crucial role in coordinating to the lithium ion, which in turn coordinates with a Lewis basic group on the substrate. This process is known as **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n*   **The Reaction**: This is a deprotonation (or lithiation) reaction. We need to identify the most acidic proton that will be removed by the strong base.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Site of Deprotonation**\nIn a Directed ortho-Metalation reaction, a \"directing group\" on the aromatic ring coordinates to the lithium ion and directs the deprotonation to an adjacent (ortho) position. Our substrate has two powerful directing groups:\n1.  **The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CON(Et)₂) at C1**: The carbonyl oxygen is a strong Lewis base and coordinates strongly to Li⁺. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n2.  **The dimethylamino group (-N(Me)₂) at C3**: The nitrogen atom has a lone pair and is also a good directing group. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C4.\n\nNow let's evaluate the available aromatic protons:\n*   **H at C2**: This position is ortho to *both* the amide group at C1 and the amino group at C3. The two directing groups work cooperatively, making the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic compared to the others.\n*   **H at C4**: This position is ortho to the amino group but meta to the amide group. It is activated, but less so than C2.\n*   **H at C6**: This position is ortho to the amide group but meta to the amino group. It is also activated, but less so than C2.\n*   **H at C5**: This position is meta to both groups and is the least acidic aromatic proton.\n\nDue to the powerful synergistic effect of the two directing groups, the `sec-BuLi`/TMEDA reagent will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step**\nThe aryllithium intermediate is then treated with methyl iodide (`CH₃I`).\n*   **Aryllithium Intermediate**: This species has a highly nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position where the lithium is attached.\n*   **Methyl Iodide**: This is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electrophilic.\n*   **The Reaction**: The nucleophilic carbon at C2 of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction that forms a new carbon-carbon bond and displaces the iodide ion (I⁻) as a leaving group.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\nThe overall process results in the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n*   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Transformation: Substitution of H at C2 with a CH₃ group.\n*   Final Product: The amide group remains at C1, the new methyl group is at C2, and the dimethylamino group is at C3. The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that sec-BuLi/TMEDA is a classic reagent system for Directed ortho-Metalation.\n*   Identify all directing groups on the aromatic ring (`-CON(Et)₂` and `-N(Me)₂`).\n*   The key to regioselectivity is the **cooperative effect** of the two directing groups, making the C2 position uniquely reactive.\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed is a potent nucleophile.\n*   The reaction with methyl iodide is an electrophilic trapping step that installs a methyl group at the lithiated position.\n*   Name the final product correctly based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
