    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the terms:**\n    *   **Left-hand trefoil knot:** This is a specific knot, the mirror image of the standard right-hand trefoil. It is denoted as 3_1*.\n    *   **Grid diagram:** A representation of a knot on an n x n grid using n 'X' markers and n 'O' markers, where each row and column has exactly one of each. The knot is formed by connecting X's and O's in rows with horizontal segments and in columns with vertical segments, with the convention that vertical segments always cross over horizontal segments.\n    *   **Minimal grid number:** The smallest integer 'n' for which an n x n grid diagram of a given knot exists. For the trefoil knot (both left- and right-handed), the minimal grid number is n=3.\n    *   **Up to translation and rotation:** We need to count the number of equivalence classes of these diagrams, where two diagrams are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by cyclic shifts of rows/columns (translation) or by rotating the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.\n\n2.  **Representing the Grid Diagrams:**\n    A grid diagram on an n x n grid can be represented by a pair of permutations (π, σ) of {1, 2, ..., n}.\n    *   π represents the positions of the 'X's: an 'X' is at row `i` and column `π(i)`.\n    *   σ represents the positions of the 'O's: an 'O' is at row `i` and column `σ(i)`.\n    The type of knot is determined by the permutation α = σ⁻¹π.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Knot Permutation:**\n    *   For the minimal grid number n=3, the trefoil knot corresponds to a permutation α that is a 3-cycle.\n    *   The two 3-cycles in the symmetric group S₃ are c₁ = (2,3,1) and c₂ = (3,1,2).\n    *   By convention, one corresponds to the left-hand trefoil and the other to the right-hand trefoil (they are inverses of each other: c₁⁻¹=c₂). Let's designate α = c₁ = (2,3,1) for the **left-hand trefoil**.\n\n4.  **Enumerating All Minimal Diagrams:**\n    We need to find all pairs of permutations (π, σ) in S₃ such that σ⁻¹π = c₁. This is equivalent to π = σc₁. We can list them by choosing each of the 6 permutations in S₃ for σ:\n    The elements of S₃ are: e=(1,2,3), c₁=(2,3,1), c₂=(3,1,2), t₁=(1,3,2), t₂=(3,2,1), t₃=(2,1,3).\n    *   If σ = e, then π = ec₁ = c₁. Diagram D1 = (c₁, e).\n    *   If σ = c₁, then π = c₁c₁ = c₂. Diagram D2 = (c₂, c₁).\n    *   If σ = c₂, then π = c₂c₁ = e. Diagram D3 = (e, c₂).\n    *   If σ = t₁, then π = t₁c₁ = t₂. Diagram D4 = (t₂, t₁).\n    *   If σ = t₂, then π = t₂c₁ = t₃. Diagram D5 = (t₃, t₂).\n    *   If σ = t₃, then π = t₃c₁ = t₁. Diagram D6 = (t₁, t₃).\n    There are exactly 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Symmetries (Translation and Rotation):**\n    We need to partition these 6 diagrams into equivalence classes.\n    *   **Translation:** Cyclic shifts of rows or columns are known to preserve the knot invariant α.\n        *   Let's check the effect of translation on D1=(c₁, e). Shifting rows cyclically is equivalent to right-multiplying π and σ by a cyclic permutation. Shifting columns is equivalent to left-multiplying.\n        *   Applying column shifts to D1: (c₁*D1, c₁*e) = (c₂, c₁) = D2. Applying another shift: (c₁*D2, c₁*c₁) = (e, c₂) = D3. So, {D1, D2, D3} form an equivalence class under translation.\n        *   Applying column shifts to D4=(t₂, t₁): A similar calculation shows that {D4, D5, D6} also form an equivalence class under translation.\n        *   So far, we have two classes: Class A = {D1, D2, D3} and Class B = {D4, D5, D6}.\n\n    *   **Rotation:** A rotation of the grid is an allowed equivalence *only if* it transforms a diagram of a left-hand trefoil into another diagram of a left-hand trefoil.\n        *   Let's consider a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This operation transforms a grid diagram (π, σ) into a new diagram (π', σ'). The transformation rule for the permutations is (π', σ') = (w₀π⁻¹, w₀σ⁻¹), where w₀ is the reversal permutation (w₀(i) = n+1-i). For n=3, w₀ = (3,2,1) = t₂.\n        *   A key point is that for this rotation to be a valid equivalence for this problem, the knot type of the resulting diagram must also be the left-hand trefoil. It has been shown that a 90-degree rotation preserves the knot type if and only if σ² = π².\n        *   Let's check diagram D4=(t₂, t₁). Here π=t₂ and σ=t₁. We have π² = t₂² = e and σ² = t₁² = e. So π²=σ², and rotating D4 by 90 degrees will yield another diagram for the left-hand trefoil.\n        *   Let's apply the rotation to D4=(t₂, t₁):\n            π' = w₀π⁻¹ = t₂(t₂⁻¹) = t₂t₂ = e.\n            σ' = w₀σ⁻¹ = t₂(t₁⁻¹) = t₂t₁ = (3,2,1)(1,3,2) = (3,1,2) = c₂.\n            The new diagram is (e, c₂), which is exactly diagram D3.\n        *   So, rotation by 90 degrees maps D4 to D3.\n\n6.  **Counting the Equivalence Classes:**\n    *   We started with two apparent classes under translation: A = {D1, D2, D3} and B = {D4, D5, D6}.\n    *   We found that a rotation maps D4 (from Class B) to D3 (from Class A).\n    *   This means D4 is equivalent to D3 (D4 ~ D3).\n    *   Since all diagrams in Class A are equivalent, and all diagrams in Class B are equivalent, and there is a link between the two classes, all 6 diagrams must belong to a single equivalence class.\n    *   Therefore, all 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are equivalent to each other up to translation and rotation.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The number of unique diagrams is the number of equivalence classes, which is 1."
