In a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \phi, z)$ with the z-axis along the cylinder's axis, the Poynting vector is given by:
For inside the rod ($r < R$):
$$ \vec{S}(r) = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4\epsilon_0} \hat{k} $$
For outside the rod ($r > R$):
$$ \vec{S}(r) = -\frac{E \rho v R^2}{2r} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v R^4}{4\epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{k} $$
where $\hat{r}$ is the radial unit vector and $\hat{k}$ is the axial unit vector (direction of motion).
