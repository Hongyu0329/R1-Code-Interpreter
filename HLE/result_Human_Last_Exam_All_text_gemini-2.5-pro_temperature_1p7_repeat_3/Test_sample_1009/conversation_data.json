    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n2.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n3.  **First-Countable:** There is a countable local base at every point. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element, $e$. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is at most $\\aleph_0$.\n4.  **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  **Potentially Non-Hausdorff:** The group is not required to be a Hausdorff ($T_2$) space.\n\nWe need to determine the **largest possible weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the role of the Hausdorff axiom\nA crucial step is to determine if $G$ can be Hausdorff.\n*   There is a fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii which states that for any compact Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$, where $\\chi(X)$ is the character and $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number.\n*   For any compact space, its Lindelöf number is $L(X)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   For our group $G$, it is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n*   If $G$ were Hausdorff, Arhangel'skii's theorem would apply, giving:\n    $|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)L(G)} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   However, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $2^{2^\\frak c} > \\frak c$, there is a contradiction.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group $G$ cannot be Hausdorff. This is not just a possibility but a necessary condition based on the other properties.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound for the Weight\nWe need to find an upper limit for $w(G)$.\n*   For any topological group $G$, there is a general inequality relating its weight, cardinality, and character: $w(G) \\le |G| \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n*   **Proof Sketch:** Let $\\mathcal{B}_e$ be a local base at the identity element $e$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_e| = \\chi(G)$. The collection of sets $\\{gB \\mid g \\in G, B \\in \\mathcal{B}_e\\}$ forms a base for the topology of $G$. The cardinality of this collection is at most $|G| \\cdot |\\mathcal{B}_e| = |G| \\cdot \\chi(G)$. Thus, the minimal size of a base, $w(G)$, is less than or equal to this value.\n*   Applying this inequality to our group $G$:\n    *   $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$\n    *   $\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$ (since G is first-countable)\n*   Therefore, $w(G) \\le |G| \\cdot \\chi(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n*   Since $2^{2^\\frak c}$ is an infinite cardinal, multiplying by $\\aleph_0$ does not change its value: $2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** We have an upper bound for the weight: $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Show that the Upper Bound is Attainable\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* weight, which suggests we should investigate if this upper bound can be achieved. To do this, we need to show that there exists a group satisfying all the given properties and having a weight equal to this upper bound.\n*   We can appeal to a known, powerful existence theorem in the theory of topological groups. A result by W. W. Comfort and Jan van Mill states:\n    > For any infinite cardinal number $\\alpha$ that satisfies the condition $\\alpha^{\\aleph_0} = \\alpha$, there exists a compact, first-countable, abelian topological group $G$ such that its cardinality is $|G| = \\alpha$ and its weight is $w(G) = \\alpha$.\n\n*   Let's check if our target cardinal, $\\alpha = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, satisfies the condition $\\alpha^{\\aleph_0} = \\alpha$.\n    *   $\\alpha^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{2^\\frak c})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{2^\\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0}$.\n    *   The cardinal $\\frak c$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is strictly greater than $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, $2^\\frak c$ is also strictly greater than $\\aleph_0$.\n    *   The product of an infinite cardinal with a smaller infinite cardinal is just the larger cardinal. So, $2^\\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^\\frak c$.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get $\\alpha^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{2^\\frak c} = \\alpha$.\n*   The condition is satisfied. Therefore, by the Comfort-van Mill theorem, there exists a group $G$ that is:\n    1.  Abelian (and thus a topological group).\n    2.  Compact.\n    3.  First-countable.\n    4.  Has cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    5.  Has weight $w(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   This constructed group meets all the requirements of the problem (as shown in Step 2, it must be non-Hausdorff).\n*   Since we have found an example where the weight reaches the upper bound derived in Step 3, this must be the largest possible weight.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ is $2^{2^\\frak c}$."
