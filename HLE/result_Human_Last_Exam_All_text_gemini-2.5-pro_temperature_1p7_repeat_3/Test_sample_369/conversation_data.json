    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line.\n\n**The line:** \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Basic Rules\n\nThe goal is to divide the line into six metrical feet, identifying each as either a Dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, — U U) or a Spondee (two long syllables, — —).\n\n**Key Rules of Hexameter:**\n*   **Feet 1-4:** Can be Dactyls or Spondees.\n*   **Foot 5:** Almost always a Dactyl.\n*   **Foot 6:** Always treated as a Spondee.\n*   **Syllable Length:** A syllable is long if its vowel is naturally long (e.g., `ā`) or if its vowel is \"long by position\" (a short vowel followed by two or more consonants, or by `x` or `z`). Otherwise, it's short.\n*   **Elision:** If a word ends in a vowel (or a vowel + m) and the next word begins with a vowel (or h + vowel), the first word's final syllable is typically dropped or \"elided\" in pronunciation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider for This Line\n\nThis particular line from Lucretius is famously difficult to scan using only standard rules, and its analysis often requires acknowledging poetic licenses.\n\n1.  **Natural Quantities:** It's crucial to know the inherent length of vowels. For example, the `e` in `vērum` is long, while the `e` in `equi` and the vowels in `hominis` are short. The vowels in the ablative `cāsū` are both long. The `ē` in `convēnit` (perfect tense) is long.\n2.  **Elisions:** There are two clear points of elision: `verum‿ubi` and `equi‿atque`.\n3.  **Positional Lengthening:** A key interaction happens at `hominis casu`, where the `-nis` (naturally short) is followed by the `c` of `casu`, making the syllable `-nis` long by position.\n4.  **Poetic License:** As we will see, a standard, rule-based scansion runs into contradictions. The most accepted scansion requires assuming Lucretius used one or more licenses, which was not uncommon. The most likely points of license are in the difficult phrase `equi atque hominis`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Scansion\n\nWe will work from both ends of the line, where the meter is most predictable.\n\n1.  **Analyze Feet 6 and 5 (from right to left):**\n    *   The end of the line is `...convenit imago.`\n    *   **Foot 6:** The last two syllables are `imāgō`. The `ā` is long by nature, and the final `-ō` is treated as long (a rule called *syllaba anceps*). This gives us **— —**, a **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 5:** This foot must be a Dactyl (— U U). Looking at the syllables before `māgō`, we have `convēnit i-`. The first part of Foot 5 comes from `convēnit` and the end from `imago`. The syllables are `vē-nit-i`. The `vē` is long by nature. The `-nit` has a short `i`. The `i-` from `imago` is also short. This gives us **— U U**, a perfect **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Foot 1 (from left to right):**\n    *   The line begins `verum ubi...`. The final `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u` of `ubi`.\n    *   The syllables we scan are effectively `vē-r(um)-u-bi` -> `vē-ru-bi`.\n    *   The `ē` in `vērum` is long. The `u` and `i` in `ubi` are both short.\n    *   This gives us **— U U**, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Middle (Feet 2, 3, and 4):**\n    *   This is the challenging part. We are left with the segment: `equi atque hominis casu con-`. The `con-` is the first syllable of `convenit`, left over from our analysis of Foot 5.\n    *   The consensus scansion for this difficult section resolves to **Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee**. Let's see how.\n    *   **Foot 2 (Spondee):** The syllables are from `equi atque`. The `-i` elides: `equ'atque`. To get a spondee (`— —`), we must assume a poetic license where the first syllable, `e-`, which is naturally short, is scanned as long. The next syllable, `-quat-`, is long by position (the short vowel `a` is followed by two consonants, `t` and `q`). So, with license, we get `ē-quāt-`, or **— —**, a **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 3 (Dactyl):** The syllables are from `-que hominis`. The `-que` from `atque` is short (U). The first two syllables of `hominis` (`ho-` and `mi-`) are also short (U U). This gives `U U U`. For this to form a dactyl (`— U U`), another license must be assumed: that the first syllable, `-que`, is lengthened, or more commonly, that `hominis` is scanned `hōminis` (`— U U`). While its `o` is naturally short, this makes `hominis` a self-contained dactyl. This creates `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 4 (Spondee):** What remains is `casu`. The form is `cāsū` (ablative of a 4th declension noun), where both vowels are long. This gives **— —**, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the analysis of each foot gives the following pattern:\n\n*   **Foot 1:** Dactyl (D)\n*   **Foot 2:** Spondee (S)\n*   **Foot 3:** Dactyl (D)\n*   **Foot 4:** Spondee (S)\n*   **Foot 5:** Dactyl (D)\n*   **Foot 6:** Spondee (S)\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
