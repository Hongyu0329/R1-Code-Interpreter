    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group (Θ₃ᴴ) that can be obtained by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the condition for an integral surgery to produce a homology sphere.**\n\nA 3-manifold Y is a homology 3-sphere if its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere S³, which means H₁(Y; ℤ) = 0.\n\nAn integral surgery on a knot K is specified by an integer coefficient `n`. The resulting manifold is denoted S³_n(K). The first homology group of this manifold, H₁(S³_n(K); ℤ), is a cyclic group whose order is given by the formula:\n`Order(H₁(S³_n(K); ℤ)) = |n · Δ_K(-1)|`\nwhere `Δ_K(t)` is the Alexander polynomial of the knot K, and `Δ_K(-1)` is its evaluation at t=-1. The absolute value of `Δ_K(-1)` is also known as the determinant of the knot, `det(K)`.\n\nFor S³_n(K) to be a homology sphere, its first homology group must be trivial (have order 1). Therefore, we must have:\n`|n · Δ_K(-1)| = 1`\n\nSince `n` is an integer for an integral surgery, and K is a knot (not the unknot, usually), `Δ_K(-1)` is also an integer. For the product of two integers to have an absolute value of 1, both integers must have an absolute value of 1.\nThis gives two necessary conditions:\n1.  `|n| = 1`, which means the surgery coefficient `n` must be either +1 or -1.\n2.  `|Δ_K(-1)| = 1`, which means the determinant of the knot must be 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify all knots with at most four crossings and check if they satisfy the condition.**\n\nWe need to list all prime knots up to four crossings and calculate their determinants.\n*   **0 Crossings:** The unknot, `0₁`.\n    *   Alexander polynomial: `Δ_{0₁}(t) = 1`.\n    *   Determinant: `|Δ_{0₁}(-1)| = |1| = 1`.\n    *   This knot satisfies the condition.\n\n*   **3 Crossings:** The trefoil knot, `3₁`. (The Alexander polynomial is the same for the right-handed and left-handed versions).\n    *   Alexander polynomial: `Δ_{3₁}(t) = t² - t + 1`.\n    *   Determinant: `|Δ_{3₁}(-1)| = |(-1)² - (-1) + 1| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3`.\n    *   This knot does not satisfy the condition `|Δ_K(-1)| = 1`.\n\n*   **4 Crossings:** The figure-eight knot, `4₁`.\n    *   Alexander polynomial: `Δ_{4₁}(t) = t² - 3t + 1`.\n    *   Determinant: `|Δ_{4₁}(-1)| = |(-1)² - 3(-1) + 1| = |1 + 3 + 1| = 5`.\n    *   This knot does not satisfy the condition `|Δ_K(-1)| = 1`.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only knot with at most four crossings that can produce a homology sphere via integral surgery is the **unknot (0₁)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the homology spheres produced by surgery on the unknot.**\n\nThe knot is K = `0₁`. The allowed surgery coefficients are `n = +1` and `n = -1`.\n*   **+1 surgery on the unknot (S³_{+1}(0₁)):** Surgery on the unknot with coefficient `n` yields the lens space L(n, 1). So, +1 surgery gives L(1, 1), which is diffeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere, S³.\n*   **-1 surgery on the unknot (S³_{-1}(0₁)):** Similarly, -1 surgery gives L(-1, 1), which is also diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere, S³.\n\nBoth possible surgeries on the only qualifying knot produce the 3-sphere, S³.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.**\n\nThe homology cobordism group, Θ₃ᴴ, consists of equivalence classes of homology 3-spheres. The group's identity element is the class represented by the standard 3-sphere, `[S³]`.\n\nIn Step 3, we found that all possible integral surgeries on knots with at most four crossings that result in a homology sphere yield only one manifold: S³. This manifold represents the identity element in Θ₃ᴴ.\n\nTherefore, only one element of the homology cobordism group can be represented in this way.\n\n**Final Careful Points Check:**\n*   The condition for an integral surgery to be a homology sphere is correctly identified as `|n|=1` and `|det(K)|=1`.\n*   The list of knots with up to four crossings (`0₁`, `3₁`, `4₁`) is complete.\n*   The calculation of the determinants (`|Δ_K(-1)|`) for these knots is correct (1, 3, 5).\n*   The identification of `±1` surgery on the unknot as yielding `S³` is correct.\n*   The conclusion that `S³` represents a single element (the identity) in Θ₃ᴴ is correct.\n\nThe analysis is consistent and leads to a single conclusion."
