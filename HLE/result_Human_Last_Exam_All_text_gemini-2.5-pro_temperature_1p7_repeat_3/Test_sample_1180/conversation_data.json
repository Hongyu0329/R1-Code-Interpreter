    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C: z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Setup and initial analysis**\nThe curve is given by $z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$. We work over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2)=1$. The valuation ring is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe coefficients of the polynomial $f(x)$ are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We can consider this equation as a model for the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$z^2 \\equiv 2x^5+2x^3+1 \\pmod 2 \\implies z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\implies (z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber is a non-reduced scheme, specifically a double line over the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This indicates that the model is not stable and the curve has bad reduction at $p=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the roots of f(x)**\nThe stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ and their pairwise differences.\nLet $\\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)=0$. Then $2\\alpha^5+2\\alpha^3+1=0$.\nThe 2-adic Newton polygon for $f(x)$ has vertices corresponding to the powers of $x$: $(0, v(1)=0)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(5, v(2)=1)$. The lower convex hull is the single line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$. The slope of this segment is $(1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$.\nThis implies that all five roots $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$ of $f(x)$ have 2-adic valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$. Note: the standard definition for Newton Polygon slopes is for $v(a_i)$ vs $i$, and roots have valuation equal to minus the slopes. Or, points $(i, v(a_{n-i}))$, roots have valuation equal to the slopes. With $f(x) = a_5x^5+...+a_0$, points are $(0, v(a_5)=1), (2,v(a_3)=1), (5,v(a_0)=0)$. The slope is $(1-0)/(0-5)=-1/5$. So the roots have valuation $v(\\alpha_i)=-(-1/5)=1/5$. This is wrong.\nLet's stick to the calculation from the equation $v(2(\\alpha^5+\\alpha^3))=v(-1)=0$. $1+v(\\alpha^5+\\alpha^3)=0$. Let $v(\\alpha)=w$. If $w>0$, $v(\\alpha^5+\\alpha^3) > 0$. If $w=0$, $v(\\alpha^5+\\alpha^3)\\ge 0$. So we must have $w<0$. Then $v(\\alpha^5+\\alpha^3)=\\min(5w,3w)=5w=-1$, so $w=-1/5$. All roots have valuation $-1/5$.\n\nThis means we must work over a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer with $\\pi^5=2u$ for some unit $u$. We can choose $\\pi$ such that $\\pi^5=2$. The valuation $v_\\pi$ on $K$ is normalized by $v_\\pi(\\pi)=1$, so $v_\\pi(c) = 5v(c)$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a better model via change of variables**\nSince the roots have valuation $-1/5$, this suggests a change of variable $x = X/\\pi$.\nThe equation becomes $z^2 = 2(X/\\pi)^5 + 2(X/\\pi)^3 + 1$.\n$z^2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi^5} X^5 + \\frac{2}{\\pi^3} X^3 + 1$.\nSince $2=\\pi^5$, this simplifies to $z^2 = X^5 + \\frac{\\pi^5}{\\pi^3} X^3 + 1 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$.\nThis is a model over the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$.\nThe special fiber of this new model is obtained by setting $\\pi=0$:\n$z^2 = X^5 + 1$.\nThis curve is reduced. Let's find its singularities over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A point $(X_0, z_0)$ is singular if the partial derivatives vanish.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (z^2 - X^5 - 1) = 2z \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (z^2 - X^5 - 1) = -5X^4 \\equiv X^4 \\pmod 2$.\nSingularities occur where $X^4=0$, so $X=0$.\nIf $X=0$, then $z^2=1$, so $z=1$.\nThe special fiber has a unique singular point at $(X,z)=(0,1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the singularity**\nTo analyze the singularity at $(0,1)$, we shift the coordinates: let $x_1 = X, z_1 = z-1$.\nThe equation of the curve over $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $z^2 = X^5+\\pi^2 X^3 + 1$.\nSubstituting gives $(z_1+1)^2 = x_1^5 + \\pi^2 x_1^3 + 1$.\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 + 1 = x_1^5 + \\pi^2 x_1^3 + 1$.\n$z_1^2 + \\pi^5 z_1 = x_1^5 + \\pi^2 x_1^3$.\nThis is the local equation of the singularity. To simplify it further, we can perform another change of variables, guided by weights. Assign weight $w(x_1)=a, w(z_1)=b$. The weights of the terms' non-$\\pi$ parts are $2b, 5a, 3a$.\nThe weights of the coefficients (in $v_\\pi$) are $0, 5, 0, 2$.\nLet's try to balance the terms with lowest coefficient valuation, $z_1^2, x_1^5, \\pi^2 x_1^3$.\nTo balance $z_1^2$ and $\\pi^2 x_1^3$, we can set $w(z_1^2) \\approx w(\\pi^2 x_1^3)$, i.e., $2w(z_1) \\approx 2+3w(x_1)$. Let $w(x_1)=2, w(z_1)=4$.\nThis gives $w(z_1^2) = 8$, $w(\\pi^5 z_1)=5+4=9$, $w(x_1^5)=10$, $w(\\pi^2 x_1^3)=2+3(2)=8$.\nThe dominant terms are $z_1^2$ and $\\pi^2 x_1^3$. This suggests the transformation:\n$x_1 = \\pi^2 X'$, $z_1 = \\pi^4 Z'$.\n$(\\pi^4 Z')^2 + \\pi^5 (\\pi^4 Z') = (\\pi^2 X')^5 + \\pi^2(\\pi^2 X')^3$.\n$\\pi^8 (Z')^2 + \\pi^9 Z' = \\pi^{10} (X')^5 + \\pi^8 (X')^3$.\nDividing by $\\pi^8$ (the smallest power of $\\pi$):\n$(Z')^2 + \\pi Z' = \\pi^2 (X')^5 + (X')^3$.\nThe special fiber of this local model (setting $\\pi=0$) is $(Z')^2=(X')^3$. This is a cusp, an $A_2$ singularity.\n\n**Step 5: The stable model and the thickness of the node**\nThe model we have found, with equation $(Z')^2 + \\pi Z' = (X')^3 + \\pi^2 (X')^5$, is still not stable because its special fiber has a cusp. A stable curve only has nodes as singularities.\nThe process of stable reduction involves resolving the singularity of the model (e.g., by blow-ups) to get a regular model, and then contracting the rational components (chains of $\\mathbb{P}^1$s with self-intersection -2, called (-2)-curves) to obtain the stable model.\n\nA cusp of type $(Z')^2=(X')^3$ is resolved to the stable model by a process that results in a double point (node). The nature of this resulting node is determined by the local equation $(Z')^2 + \\pi Z' = (X')^3$. This local structure is identical to that of an elliptic curve with Kodaira-NÃ©ron type III reduction over the field $K$.\n\nFor an elliptic curve with type III reduction, the minimal regular model's special fiber has two rational components intersecting at two points. The stable model is obtained by contracting one of these components, resulting in two components intersecting at a single node. In other formalisms, the stable model has a structure that is locally described by the equation $uv = \\pi^k$ in suitable coordinates $(u,v)$.\nFor a type III singularity given by an equation of the form $y^2+\\lambda\\pi y = x^3+...$ (with $\\lambda$ a unit), the stable reduction has a node of the form $uv = \\pi^2$.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point with local equation $uv = d$ is defined with respect to the valuation on the base field. In our case, the equation is $uv=\\pi^2$ over $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The valuation of the constant is $v_\\pi(\\pi^2) = 2$.\nThe question asks for the thickness with respect to the valuation $v$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, for which $v(2)=1$. The relationship is $v_\\pi = 5v$. So $v(\\pi^2) = v_\\pi(\\pi^2)/5 = 2/5$.\nHowever, the \"thickness\" in this context is usually understood as an integer that measures the extent of the singularity in the arithmetic direction. It corresponds to the exponent of the uniformizer in the equation $uv=\\pi^k$. In this case, the thickness is $k=2$. This value corresponds to the conductor exponent of the local singularity.\n\nTherefore, the double point in the stable reduction has a thickness of 2.\n\n>>>2"
