    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several precise criteria:\n1.  **A Christian theologian:** The figure must be a recognized thinker within the history of Christian theology.\n2.  **First developed:** This implies we are looking for the originator of a particular idea or set of terms, not just someone who discussed it later.\n3.  **Specialized terminology:** The theologian didn't just talk about the concepts in general terms; they created a specific vocabulary or formal distinction to describe them.\n4.  **Describes changes in the laws of nature:** The terminology must address the idea that the fundamental rules governing the physical world can be, or have been, altered.\n5.  **Applicable to two specific cases:** The framework must be able to explain both:\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A specific, localized miracle that appears to suspend or bypass normal biological laws.\n    *   **The Fall:** A primordial event believed to have caused a systemic, ongoing alteration of the natural world (e.g., introducing death, decay, suffering).\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and Elimination of Common Candidates\n*   **Early Church Fathers (e.g., Augustine of Hippo):** Augustine discussed miracles extensively. He argued that miracles are not \"against nature\" but are events that follow a higher, hidden order of nature known only to God. He also strongly linked the Fall to the introduction of death and suffering. However, he did not create a formal, specialized terminology that distinguished between two different sets of \"natural laws\" (e.g., pre-Fall vs. post-Fall laws). His language is more about God's will working outside the *usual course* of nature.\n*   **Medieval Scholastics (e.g., Thomas Aquinas):** Aquinas developed a highly sophisticated system of primary and secondary causality. For him, a miracle occurs when God (the Primary Cause) acts directly, bypassing the natural secondary causes. This provides a framework for understanding miracles like the virgin birth. Regarding the Fall, Aquinas saw physical death not as a change in natural law, but as the loss of a preternatural (superadded) gift of immortality. So, for Aquinas, humanity's biological nature was always mortal, but this was overcome by a gift, which was then lost. He did not posit a change in the fundamental laws of nature themselves.\n*   **Modern Thinkers (e.g., C.S. Lewis):** In his book *Miracles*, Lewis argues that a miracle is the introduction of a supernatural reality into the natural system, which then proceeds to obey natural law. This explains specific events well, but he doesn't focus on creating a specialized terminology for a systemic change in those laws due to the Fall.\n\n### Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Criteria\nThe key is the combination of \"specialized terminology\" and its application to both a specific miracle and a systemic change at the Fall. This level of systematic classification points toward the era of post-Reformation scholasticism (late 16th and 17th centuries), when theologians were deeply engaged in creating precise and comprehensive theological systems.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Correct Theologian\nThe theologian who fits these criteria is the Dutch Reformed scholastic **Franciscus Junius** (1545â€“1602).\n\n*   **Contribution:** In his theological works, Junius was one of the first to systematically articulate a distinction between the laws of nature as they were originally created and as they exist after the Fall.\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** He developed the following specific terms:\n    1.  ***Lex Naturae in Statu Integro***: This translates to \"the law of nature in the state of integrity.\" This refers to the original physical laws governing the created order before the Fall, in a state of perfection and without corruption, death, or decay.\n    2.  ***Lex Naturae in Statu Corrupto***: This translates to \"the law of nature in the state of corruption.\" This refers to the current laws of nature that we observe, which were altered by the Fall to include principles of death, enmity, and futility.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Terminology to the Question's Cases\n1.  **The Fall:** The Fall is precisely the event that marks the transition from the *lex naturae in statu integro* to the *lex naturae in statu corrupto*. This terminology was specifically created to describe this systemic change in the natural order.\n2.  **The Virgin Birth:** Miracles like the virgin birth can be understood within this framework as a divine act where God suspends the operations of the *lex naturae in statu corrupto* and acts directly. It is a manifestation of His creative and restorative power, an intrusion of the principles of the original or new creation into the fallen order.\n\nTherefore, Franciscus Junius is the theologian who first developed this specialized vocabulary to analyze changes in the laws of nature, making it applicable to both a specific miracle and the systemic consequences of the Fall.\n\n<<<Franciscus Junius>>>"
