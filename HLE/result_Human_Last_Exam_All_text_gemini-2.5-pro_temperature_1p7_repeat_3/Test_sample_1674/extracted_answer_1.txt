Yes, this theory will not hold. The original theory is based on a scalar model of light, where only the spatial profile is considered and can be inverted by reversing the effects of propagation (`P`) and the random medium (`T`). A birefringent medium fundamentally alters the polarization state of light, a property that is not accounted for in the scalar model. The original inversion procedure does not contain an operation to reverse the effect of the birefringent plate. Therefore, when applied to the output of the new system, it will fail to recover the original input beam because the polarization change is left uncorrected.
