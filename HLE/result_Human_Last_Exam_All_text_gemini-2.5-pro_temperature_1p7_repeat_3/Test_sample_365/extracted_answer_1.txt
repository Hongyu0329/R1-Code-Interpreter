The product is a complex tricyclic ketone. Using the atom numbering from the starting material, its structure results from the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond and the formation of a new C-C single bond between C5 and C2'. The alcohol at C2 is converted to a ketone, and the double bond moves from C5=C6 to C1=C6. The spectator groups, the 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and the TBDMS ether, remain intact. The stereochemistry at centers C4 and C4' is retained from the starting material.
