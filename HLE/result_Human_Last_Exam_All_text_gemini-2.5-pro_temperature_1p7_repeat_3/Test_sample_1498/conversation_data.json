    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:** The request asks for the specific range of verses (*abyāt*), from start to end, in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed by name.\n\n2.  **Context of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a didactic poem that systematically lays out the fundamental tenets of Islamic creed according to the Ash'ari school. Its structure is logical: it begins with Allah and His attributes, then moves to the Prophets (Rusul), their attributes, and then lists their names.\n\n3.  **Locating the Preceding Verses:** Before listing the names, the poem first establishes the obligation to believe in the prophets and outlines their four necessary attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence). The verses immediately before the list set the stage for it. For example, Bayt 27 often introduces the list, stating that knowledge of the names is necessary.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Starting Verse (Bayt):** The enumeration begins in the verse that starts with the first prophet, Adam (عليه السلام). This verse is widely recognized as **Bayt 28**.\n    *   **Bayt 28:** هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   *Translation:* They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with... Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\n\n5.  **Following the Sequence:** The subsequent verses continue this list without interruption.\n    *   **Bayt 29:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Ending Verse (Bayt):** The list concludes in the verse that mentions the final prophets in the sequence, ending with Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), who is referred to as \"Taha\" (طه) and \"Khatim\" (the Seal). This is **Bayt 31**.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   *Translation:* Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya... 'Isa and Taha, the Seal; leave misguidance.\n\n7.  **Confirming the End of the Section:** The verse that follows, Bayt 32, changes the topic. It bestows blessings upon the prophets and their families (\"عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ... وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\"), confirming that the list of names has concluded in Bayt 31.\n\n8.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** The list of the prophets' names begins at Bayt 28 and ends at Bayt 31, spanning a total of four verses.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** While the content is standard, the verse numbering can have minor variations (+/- 1 verse) in different manuscripts or printed editions depending on how introductory lines are counted. However, the four-verse block containing the names is a consistent and identifiable section. The 28-31 numbering is the most common and widely accepted one.\n*   **Name \"Taha\" (طه):** In Bayt 31, the poet uses \"Taha\" to refer to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This is a common practice in devotional poetry, referencing the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an. The word \"Khatim\" (Seal) in the same line makes the reference explicit.\n*   **Completeness:** These four verses collectively name the 25 prophets whom Muslims are generally required to know and believe in by name.\n\nBy following this analysis, the precise range of verses is clearly identified.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
