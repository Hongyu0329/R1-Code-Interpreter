    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical phonological development of the PIE form `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### **Analysis of the PIE Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` ('to track down, seek out')\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-`, a present tense suffix. Verbs with this suffix become Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`, the 3rd person singular present indicative active ending.\n*   **Phonemes:**\n    *   `s`: Voiceless alveolar sibilant.\n    *   `e`: Front mid vowel (the \"e-grade\" of the root).\n    *   `h₂`: A laryngeal consonant. Its primary effects are to color an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a` and to lengthen a preceding vowel. `*eh₂` results in a long `*ā`.\n    *   `g`: Voiced velar stop.\n    *   `ie`: Suffix composed of a semivowel `i` and thematic vowel `e`.\n    *   `t`: Voiceless alveolar stop.\n    *   `i`: Final vowel of the ending.\n\n### **Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe will trace the development of the infinitive form, which would be `*seh₂g-ie-ono-m` -> `*sākjaną` -> `*sōkijaną`. The evolution of the root `*seh₂g-` and the suffix `*-ie-` is key.\n\n1.  **Vowel and Laryngeal change:** The sequence `*eh₂` in the root `*seh₂g-` develops into a long low back vowel, PGmc `*ā` (/ɑː/).\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → `*sāg-`\n\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This is a series of shifts affecting PIE stop consonants.\n    *   The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   `*sāg-` → PGmc `*sāk-`\n    *   *(Note: Verner's Law does not apply here as it affects voiceless fricatives produced by Grimm's law, not the stops produced from PIE voiced stops.)*\n\n3.  **North-West Germanic Vowel Shift:** In the North and West Germanic dialects (the ancestors of ON, OE, and OHG), the PGmc long vowel `*ā` shifts to a long mid-back vowel `*ō` (/oː/).\n    *   `*sāk-` → NW-Gmc `*sōk-`\n\n4.  **Suffix Development:** The PIE suffix `*-ie-` forms Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. The infinitive suffix is reconstructed as `*-janą`.\n    *   Combining the root and suffix gives the PGmc infinitive: `*sōkijaną`.\n\n5.  **Proto-Germanic Result:** The reconstructed infinitive for Proto-Germanic (specifically, the North-West Germanic dialect area) is **`*sōkijaną`**.\n\n### **Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages**\n\nWe will now trace the development of `*sōkijaną` into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. The `*j` in the suffix will trigger sound changes in the root vowel (i-mutation/umlaut) and sometimes the preceding consonant.\n\n#### **Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-mutation:** The `*j` (or the `*i` in other forms like the 2nd/3rd person singular) causes the back vowel `*ō` to become the front rounded vowel `*œ` (/øː/).\n2.  **Syncope of `*j`:** In Old Norse, `*j` is lost after a heavy syllable (a syllable with a long vowel or a short vowel followed by two consonants). The syllable `*sōk-` is heavy.\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n    *   `*sōkijaną` → `*sōkjan` → (i-mutation) `*sœkjan` → (loss of `j`) `sœkja`.\n*   **Result in Old Norse:** **`sœkja`**\n\n#### **Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-mutation:** The `*j` causes the back vowel `*ō` (/oː/) to front to `*ē` (/eː/).\n2.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` was palatalized to the affricate `ċ` (/tʃ/) when it came before a front vowel or the semivowel `*j`. This happened before the `*j` was lost.\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-janą` becomes `-an`. The `*j` is dropped after the heavy syllable `*sēċ-`.\n    *   `*sōkijaną` → pre-OE `*sōkjan` → (i-mutation) `*sēkjan` → (palatalization) `*sēċjan` → `sēċan`.\n*   **Result in Old English:** **`sēcan`**\n\n#### **Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Vowel Shift:** PGmc `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` becomes the long voiceless fricative `hh` (/xx/) when it is between vowels.\n3.  **Ending:** As in other West Germanic languages, `*j` is dropped after a heavy syllable, and the infinitive ending becomes `-an` (often written `-en`).\n    *   `*sōkijaną` → pre-OHG `*sōkjan` → (vowel shift) `*suokjan` → (consonant shift) `*suohhjan` → `suohhan`.\n    *   *(Note: While the `*j` caused i-mutation (`uo` → `üe`) in some forms of the verb paradigm (e.g., 2nd/3rd person singular), it was often leveled out in the infinitive.)*\n*   **Result in Old High German:** **`suohhen`** (or `suochen`)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną, Old Norse: sœkja, Old English: sēcan, Old High German: suohhen>>>"
