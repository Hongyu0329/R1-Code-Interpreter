    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeat, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n*   Positions **`a`** and **`d`** are the **core positions**. They are typically hydrophobic and pack against each other at the interface between helices, forming the \"knobs-into-holes\" structure. These residues are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n*   Positions `e` and `g` flank the core and are often charged or polar, contributing to stability and specificity through electrostatic interactions.\n*   Positions `b`, `c`, and `f` are generally solvent-exposed.\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe must find the correct \"phasing\" of the `abcdefg` repeat on this sequence. The most critical rule is that the core positions (`a` and `d`) must be predominantly hydrophobic. Let's test the possible phasings by assigning different starting residues to the `a` position.\n\n*   **Testing Phasing Options:**\n    *   If we start with `G(1)` or `K(8)` at the `a` position, we find that other `a` positions are also occupied by Lysine (`K`). Lysine is a large, charged residue, and placing it in the hydrophobic core would be extremely unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion and poor packing. This phasing is incorrect.\n    *   A careful search reveals the most chemically sensible phasing starts with `A(4)` at an `a` position.\n        *   This places **Alanine (A)** at all `a` positions: A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25).\n        *   This places **Leucine (L)** at all `d` positions (which are 3 residues after `a`): L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28).\n\nThis `A(a) / L(d)` pattern provides a consistent and highly hydrophobic core, which is the hallmark of a stable coiled-coil.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This phasing places the Tryptophan (`W`) residue at position 19. This corresponds to a `b` position (`a` is at 18, so `b` is at 19). A large, hydrophobic residue like `W` at a solvent-exposed position is unusual. However, when determining the fundamental oligomeric state from a sequence, the identity of the core `a` and `d` residues is the most powerful determinant. The `W` might be a distractor or a feature for further interaction, but our analysis should focus on the core packing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Residue Pattern (A at `a`, L at `d`) for Packing Efficiency**\n\nNow we evaluate how this specific pattern (`a`=Alanine, `d`=Leucine) influences the oligomeric state based on knobs-into-holes packing.\n\n*   **Residue Sizes:** Alanine (`A`) has a very small side chain (a methyl group). Leucine (`L`) has a larger, bulky isobutyl side chain.\n\n*   **Evaluating Oligomeric States:**\n    *   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** Dimeric coiled-coils often have a \"perpendicular\" packing geometry. While an `A(a) / L(d)` pattern can form a dimer, the small \"knob\" of Alanine might not pack as optimally as a larger residue like Isoleucine or Valine, which are commonly found at the `a` position in dimers.\n    *   **Trimer (3-helix bundle):** Trimers have a larger core than dimers. The small Alanine side chain at the `a` position would likely be too small to fill the space efficiently, leading to an unstable \"under-packed\" core. Trimers are often stabilized by larger hydrophobic residues like Leucine or Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   **Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** This is the most likely state. In a parallel tetramer, the helices pack together such that the four `a` residues form a central layer, and the four `d` residues form another. The layer of `a` positions is extremely crowded. If a large residue like Leucine were at the `a` position, the four side chains would clash sterically, destabilizing the structure. However, the small side chain of Alanine fits perfectly into this crowded interface, relieving steric hindrance and allowing the four helices to pack tightly. The `d` positions are less constrained and can easily accommodate the larger Leucine side chains. This `small residue at a / large residue at d` pattern is a known strong determinant for forming tetramers.\n    *   **Pentamer (5) and higher:** These oligomers are less common and often require specific features not present here, such as polar residues (e.g., Glutamine) in the core to form a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds. This sequence has a purely hydrophobic core.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency, the repeating pattern of a small amino acid (Alanine) at the `a` positions and a large amino acid (Leucine) at the `d` positions is most compatible with the formation of a **tetramer**.\n\nFinal Answer is **4**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
