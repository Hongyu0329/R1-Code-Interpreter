    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Identify the central concept:** The question is about Isaac Newton's color circle, which famously links the visual spectrum of light to the notes of a musical scale.\n    *   **Identify the first color boundary:** The question states \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of subtractive color mixing (like pigments, which is conceptually similar to how colors are arranged on a wheel), yellow and blue combine to create **green**.\n    *   **Identify the second color boundary:** The second boundary is simply the color **blue**.\n    *   **Determine the specified range:** The question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the range \"between\" green and blue. On Newton's color circle, the colors are arranged in the order of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). The color that lies between the end of yellow and the start of blue is **green**. Therefore, the question is asking for the note that corresponds to the color green.\n\n2.  **Recall Newton's Color-Music Analogy:**\n    *   Newton observed the seven colors of the spectrum when he passed white light through a prism. He named them Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet (ROYGBIV).\n    *   He sought a mathematical or harmonic relationship between these colors and other phenomena, which led him to connect them to the seven notes of a Western musical scale.\n    *   He divided his circular diagram into seven sectors, with the size of each sector corresponding to the width of the color band in the spectrum. He then associated these sectors with the notes of a musical scale.\n    *   The most commonly accepted mapping, reflecting the intervals of the Dorian mode that Newton favored, is as follows (starting the scale on D):\n        *   Red → D\n        *   Orange → E\n        *   Yellow → F\n        *   **Green → G**\n        *   Blue → A\n        *   Indigo → B\n        *   Violet → C\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information to Find the Answer:**\n    *   From Step 1, we established that the color range in question is **Green**.\n    *   From Step 2, we established that in Newton's system, the color **Green** corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n    *   Therefore, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the combination of yellow and blue (Green) and blue itself is G.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Color Mixing:** It's important to correctly interpret \"combining yellow and blue\" as producing green in this context.\n*   **Newton's Specific System:** The answer depends specifically on Newton's analogy, not just any color-music system. The mapping of the seven ROYGBIV colors to the seven notes of a scale is crucial.\n*   **Interpreting \"the range between\":** On a continuous circle ordered ROYGBIV, the color \"green\" is the one that occupies the space between yellow and blue. The question essentially just asks for the note associated with the color green.\n\n<<<G>>>"
