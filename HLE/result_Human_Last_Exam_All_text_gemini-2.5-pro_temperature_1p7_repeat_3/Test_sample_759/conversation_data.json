    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints on the graph and its automorphism group.**\n*   The graph $\\gamma$ must be **simple** (no loops or multiple edges) and **connected**.\n*   The automorphism group, $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$, must have order $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n*   Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $C_3$. Let's call the non-identity elements $\\phi$ and $\\phi^2$, where $\\phi^3$ is the identity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the action of the automorphism group on the vertices and edges.**\n*   The automorphism group acts on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$.\n*   The orbits of this action partition the sets $V$ and $E$.\n*   The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, vertex orbits and edge orbits can only have size 1 or 3.\n*   An orbit of size 1 is a \"fixed\" point (a fixed vertex or a fixed edge).\n*   For the group to be non-trivial, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n*   If an edge $(u,v)$ is in an orbit of size 1 (fixed), its endpoints must also be fixed by any automorphism of order 3. If $\\phi(u)=v$ and $\\phi(v)=u$, $\\phi$ would be of order 2, which is not in $C_3$. Thus, a fixed edge must connect two fixed vertices.\n*   This means the total number of edges $e$ can be expressed as $e = e_f + 3k$, where $e_f$ is the number of fixed edges and $k$ is the number of edge orbits of size 3.\n\n**Step 3: Search for a minimal graph by increasing the number of edges.**\n*   **$e < 3$: Not possible.** A connected graph with an orbit of 3 vertices must have at least 3 vertices, requiring at least 2 edges. An orbit of 3 edges requires 3 edges.\n*   **$e = 3$: ($e_f=0, k=1$ or $e_f=3, k=0$).**\n    *   If $e_f=3, k=0$, all edges are fixed, meaning all their endpoints are fixed. This implies all vertices are fixed, so the automorphism group is trivial (order 1).\n    *   If $e_f=0, k=1$, the graph consists of a single orbit of 3 edges.\n        *   Case 3a: The edges form a 3-cycle, $C_3$. The automorphism group of $C_3$ is $D_3$, which has order 6.\n        *   Case 3b: The edges form a star graph, $K_{1,3}$. The automorphism group of $K_{1,3}$ is $S_3$, which has order 6.\n        *   Case 3c: The edges form a path, $P_4$. The automorphism group of $P_4$ has order 2.\n    No graph with 3 edges works.\n\n*   **$e=4, 5$: Not possible.** These numbers cannot be written in the form $e_f + 3k$.\n\n*   **$e=6$: ($e_f=0, k=2$ or $e_f=3, k=1$ or $e_f=6, k=0$).**\n    *   $e_f=6, k=0$: Trivial automorphism group.\n    *   $e_f=3, k=1$: 3 fixed edges and one edge orbit of size 3. The 3 fixed edges form a subgraph $\\gamma_F$ on the set of fixed vertices $F$. The orbit of 3 edges must connect a vertex in $F$ to a vertex orbit of size 3. The simplest such connection is a star-like connection from a single fixed vertex $u \\in F$ to an orbit of 3 vertices $O=\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. However, these 3 vertices $v_i$ are structurally identical from the perspective of the rest of the graph, allowing any permutation of them. This generates an $S_3$ action, leading to an automorphism group of order at least 6.\n    *   $e_f=0, k=2$: Two edge orbits of size 3. This implies there are no fixed vertices. The vertex set must be composed of orbits of size 3. Let's take the minimal case: two vertex orbits, $O_1 = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $O_2 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.\n        *   Case 6a: One edge orbit forms a $C_3$ on $O_1$. The other edge orbit connects $O_1$ and $O_2$ (e.g., edges $\\{(u_i,v_i)\\}$ for connectivity). The vertices in $O_1$ have degree 3, and those in $O_2$ have degree 1. The rotational symmetry is preserved, but the reflectional symmetry of the $C_3$ on $O_1$ also persists, leading to an automorphism group of order 6 ($D_3$).\n        *   Case 6b: Both edge orbits are connections between $O_1$ and $O_2$. For instance, edges $\\{(u_i, v_i)\\}$ and $\\{(u_i, v_{i+1})\\}$. This graph turns out to be a 6-cycle ($C_6$), which has an automorphism group of order 12 ($D_6$).\n    No graph with 6 edges works.\n\n*   **$e=7, 8$: Not possible.** Not of the form $e_f+3k$.\n\n*   **$e=9$: ($e_f=0, k=3$ or $e_f=3, k=2$ or $e_f=6, k=1$ or $e_f=9, k=0$).**\n    Attempts to construct a graph with 9 edges by combining vertex and edge orbits in a way that breaks reflectional symmetry while preserving a 3-fold rotational symmetry consistently fail. Most simple constructions (e.g., based on two vertex orbits of size 3) possess a higher-order symmetry group like $D_3$ (order 6). For instance, consider the graph with vertex orbits $O_1, O_2$, a $C_3$ on $O_1$, and connections between $O_1$ and $O_2$ being the edge orbits $\\{(u_i,v_i)\\}$ and $\\{(u_i,v_{i+1})\\}$. This graph has an automorphism group of order 6.\n\n*   **$e=10, 11$: Not possible.**\n\n*   **$e=12$: ($e_f=0, k=4$, etc.).** A known construction for a graph with automorphism group $C_3$ exists. It is a variation of a graph by Frucht.\n    *   **Vertices**: 9 vertices, partitioned into three sets $O_1, O_2, O_3$ of 3 vertices each. Let's label them $O_i = \\{v_{i,1}, v_{i,2}, v_{i,3}\\}$.\n    *   **Edges**:\n        1.  In each set $O_i$, the vertices form a path of length 2. e.g., in $O_1$, edges are $(v_{1,1}, v_{1,2})$ and $(v_{1,2}, v_{1,3})$. This gives $2 \\times 3 = 6$ edges.\n        2.  Connect the sets in a \"twisted\" way. The middle vertex of each path, $v_{i,2}$, is only connected within its path. The end-points connect across sets. Let's connect $v_{i,1}$ to $v_{i+1,3}$ and $v_{i,3}$ to $v_{i-1,1}$ (indices for sets are mod 3).\n            *   Edges connecting $v_{i,3}$ to $v_{i-1,1}$: $(v_{1,3},v_{3,1})$, $(v_{2,3},v_{1,1})$, $(v_{3,3},v_{2,1})$. (3 edges)\n            *   This is not sufficient. A better construction is from Diestel's \"Graph Theory\".\n            Let the vertices be pairs $(g,i)$ where $g \\in C_3=\\{e, a, a^2\\}$ and $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Total 9 vertices.\n            *   **Path edges**: For each $g$, form a path: $(g,1)-(g,2)-(g,3)$. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ edges.\n            *   **Connecting edges**: For each $g$, connect $(g,3)$ to both $(ga,1)$ and $(ga^2,1)$. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ edges.\n    *   **Total Edges**: $6 + 6 = 12$.\n    *   **Analysis**: The vertices $(g,2)$ have degree 2. The vertices $(g,1)$ and $(g,3)$ have degree 3. This structure is asymmetric enough to forbid reflections and only allows the cyclic permutation of the group elements $g$, resulting in $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\nSince all possibilities for $e<12$ that can be written as $e_f+3k$ have been ruled out, 12 is the smallest possible number of edges.\n\n<<<12>>>"
