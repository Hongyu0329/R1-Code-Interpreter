    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. The question provides context about a \"Markov quiver\" and a value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\). However, it then explicitly defines the matrix `A` to be used for the calculation.\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe key point here is that the matrix `A` is given. The phrase \"where A = ...\" specifies the exact matrix for which we need to compute the determinant. The information about the Markov quiver serves as context for the origin of this matrix but does not alter the computation itself. Therefore, the task is to compute `det(A)`.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant**\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use the formula of cofactor expansion (also known as the Leibniz formula for 3x3) or Sarrus's rule. We will use the cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n`M = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is:\n`det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula to Matrix A**\n\nOur matrix is:\n`A = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]] = [[2, -1, -1], [-1, 2, -1], [-1, -1, 2]]`\n\nLet's substitute the values into the formula:\n*   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n*   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n*   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\n`det(A) = 2 * det([[2, -1], [-1, 2]]) - (-1) * det([[-1, -1], [-1, 2]]) + (-1) * det([[-1, 2], [-1, -1]])`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Determinants of the 2x2 Minors**\n\n*   `det([[2, -1], [-1, 2]]) = (2 * 2) - (-1 * -1) = 4 - 1 = 3`\n*   `det([[-1, -1], [-1, 2]]) = (-1 * 2) - (-1 * -1) = -2 - 1 = -3`\n*   `det([[-1, 2], [-1, -1]]) = (-1 * -1) - (2 * -1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Minor Determinants Back into the Main Formula**\n\n`det(A) = 2 * (3) - (-1) * (-3) + (-1) * (3)`\n\n**Step 6: Perform the Final Arithmetic**\n\n`det(A) = 6 - (3) - 3`\n`det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 0`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Matrix:** It is crucial to use the matrix explicitly defined in the question, rather than trying to construct a different one from the contextual information.\n*   **Sign Convention:** In the cofactor expansion, the signs alternate (+, -, +, -, ...). For the first row, this is `+a(...)`, `-b(...)`, `+c(...)`. Careful handling of the negative numbers in both the formula and the matrix itself is essential.\n*   **Arithmetic:** Double-checking the multiplication and subtraction steps prevents simple errors. For example, `(-1)*(-1) = 1`, and subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive.\n\n**Verification using another property:**\nThe given matrix `A` is the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph on 3 vertices (\\(K_3\\)). A property of the Laplacian matrix for any connected graph is that its determinant is always 0. Since \\(K_3\\) is a connected graph, the determinant of its Laplacian matrix must be 0, which confirms our calculation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
