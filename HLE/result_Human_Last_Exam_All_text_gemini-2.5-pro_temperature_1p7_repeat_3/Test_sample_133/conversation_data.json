    "This is a game of Connect 4. It is player O's turn to move. The objective is to find all the optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible. An optimal move is one that leads to a guaranteed win in the minimum number of turns.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the board state:**\n    Let's identify the positions of O's and X's pieces and the available moves. The available moves are the lowest empty spots in each column: `a4`, `b5`, `c4`, `d3`, `e3`, `f4`, `g4`.\n\n    ```\n        a b c d e f g\n    1   . . . . . . .\n    2   . . . . . . .\n    3   . . . . . . .  <- d3, e3 are available here\n    4   . . . O O . .  <- a4, c4, f4, g4 are available here\n    5   O . X O X X X  <- b5 is available here\n    6   X O O X X O X\n    ```\n\n2.  **Search for an immediate win (Win-in-1):**\n    A win-in-1 move would complete a line of four for 'O'. We need to check if there is any existing line of three 'O's that can be completed.\n    *   **Horizontal:** The longest line of adjacent 'O's is two (`d4`, `e4`). No three 'O's exist.\n    *   **Vertical:** The longest line is also two (`d5`, `d4`). No three 'O's exist.\n    *   **Diagonal (up-right /):** There is a line of three 'O's: `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. The potential winning squares to complete this line are `b7` (off the board) and `f3`. To play in `f3`, the space `f4` must be filled. Currently, the next available space in column f is `f4`. Therefore, playing in `f3` is not a legal move on this turn.\n    *   **Diagonal (down-right \\):** The longest line of 'O's is two (`a5`, `b6`). No three 'O's exist.\n\n    Conclusion: There is no move for 'O' that results in an immediate win.\n\n3.  **Search for a forced win on the next turn (Win-in-2):**\n    The next best strategy is to make a move that creates an unstoppable threat, guaranteeing a win on O's next turn. This usually involves creating two threats simultaneously (a \"fork\"), where the opponent can only block one.\n\n    *   **Analyze Row 4:** Notice that 'O' has two pieces side-by-side at `d4` and `e4`. The spaces on both sides, `c4` and `f4`, are currently available. This setup is the key to victory.\n\n    *   **Consider Move `c4`:**\n        *   If 'O' plays in `c4`, it creates a horizontal line of three: `O-O-O` at `c4, d4, e4`.\n        *   This line now threatens to become a line of four by playing at either `b4` or `f4`.\n        *   Both `b4` and `f4` are available. Player 'X' can only make one move, so they can block either `b4` or `f4`, but not both.\n        *   If 'X' blocks `b4`, 'O' will play in `f4` and win.\n        *   If 'X' blocks `f4`, 'O' will play in `b4` and win.\n        *   Therefore, playing `c4` guarantees a win for 'O' on their next move.\n\n    *   **Consider Move `f4`:**\n        *   Similarly, if 'O' plays in `f4`, it creates a horizontal line of three: `O-O-O` at `d4, e4, f4`.\n        *   This line now threatens a win at `c4` or `g4`.\n        *   Both `c4` and `g4` are available. Player 'X' can only block one of these.\n        *   'O' is guaranteed to play in the unblocked space on the next turn and win.\n        *   Therefore, playing `f4` also guarantees a win for 'O' on their next move.\n\n4.  **Evaluate other moves:**\n    *   **Move `d3`:** This creates a vertical threat (`O` at `d5, d4, d3`). 'X' is forced to block by playing at `d2`. After 'X' plays `d2`, it is 'O's turn again. At this point, 'O' can play `c4` or `f4` to set up the same guaranteed horizontal win as described above. However, this sequence takes one extra turn for both players compared to playing `c4` or `f4` immediately. Thus, it is a slower path to victory.\n    *   Other moves like `a4`, `b5`, `e3`, and `g4` do not create an immediate, unstoppable threat and allow 'X' more freedom to counter, making them sub-optimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fastest possible win for 'O' is a guaranteed win on their next turn (a win-in-2). The moves that create this forced win are by playing in `c4` or `f4`, which leverage the existing `O-O` pair in row 4 to create an unstoppable horizontal threat. These are the only optimal moves.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
