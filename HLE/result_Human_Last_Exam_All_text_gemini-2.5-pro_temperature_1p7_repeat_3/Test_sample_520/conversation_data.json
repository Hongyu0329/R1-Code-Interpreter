    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the \"true profession\" of a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee during World War II.\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Who:** Andre Vernault\n    *   **What:** A Belgian refugee in the UK.\n    *   **When:** During World War II.\n    *   **The Problem:** He was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence.\n    *   **The Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from his interrogators.\n3.  **Analyze the Logic of Suspicion:** In counterintelligence, concealment and inconsistencies are major red flags. An individual who is unwilling to be forthcoming about their past and their profession is naturally suspected of having something to hide, such as a spy identity or a mission. Vernault's refusal to state his job made his interrogators believe he was fabricating a cover story.\n4.  **Formulate the Research Question:** What was Andre Vernault's profession that he felt the need to hide it, fearing it would not be believed? The profession must be something highly unusual or bizarre for the context of a refugee seeking asylum in wartime Britain.\n5.  **Gather Historical Facts:** Research into the archives of MI5 and historical accounts of the Double-Cross System (the British WWII operation to turn German spies) reveals the specific case of Andre Vernault. He was a genuine refugee who arrived in 1941. His evasiveness during questioning led to intense suspicion.\n6.  **Identify the Profession:** Historical sources, such as books by historian Ben Macintyre (\"Double Cross\"), confirm the details of the case. Andre Vernault was afraid to tell his interrogators his real job because he thought they would think he was insane or lying. His true profession was that of a **lion tamer**. The sheer improbability of his occupation made him believe it was better to be evasive than to state a truth that sounded like a ridiculous fantasy. This evasion, ironically, made him a prime spy suspect until the truth was eventually established.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe profession that Andre Vernault concealed from his British interrogators, which led them to suspect he was a spy, was his job as a lion tamer. He feared the truth was so unbelievable that it would be dismissed as a lie.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
