    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solution and calculate the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to compare two strings lexicographically. The key rules are:\n1.  The comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is treated as equal to 'A'.\n2.  The strings are guaranteed to have the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters.\n3.  The input consists of two lines, each containing one string.\n4.  The output should be -1 if the first string is less than the second, 1 if it's greater, and 0 if they are equal.\n5.  We need to find the total memory `m` in bytes used for variables in the *most memory-efficient* C program that solves this.\n\n**Step 2: Devising a Solution Algorithm**\nA direct lexicographical comparison works from left to right. We can iterate through both strings simultaneously, character by character, from the first character to the last.\n\nAt each position `i`:\n1.  Take the character `c1` from the first string and `c2` from the second string.\n2.  Because the comparison is case-insensitive, convert both `c1` and `c2` to a common case (either both lowercase or both uppercase). The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this. Let's call the converted characters `lc1` and `lc2`.\n3.  Compare `lc1` and `lc2`:\n    *   If `lc1 < lc2`, the first string is lexicographically smaller. We can immediately determine the result is -1, print it, and terminate the program.\n    *   If `lc1 > lc2`, the first string is lexicographically larger. The result is 1. Print it and terminate.\n    *   If `lc1 == lc2`, the strings are equal up to this point. We must continue to the next character.\n4.  If the loop completes without finding any difference, it means the strings are identical in a case-insensitive comparison. The result is 0.\n\n**Step 3: C Implementation and Memory Optimization**\n\nTo implement this in C, we first need to handle the input.\n*   **Input Buffers:** The standard way to read strings is using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` or `fgets()`. Since the strings are on separate lines, `scanf` is straightforward. To store a string with a maximum length of 100, we need a character array of size 101 to account for the null terminator (`\\0`). As there are two strings, we need two such arrays.\n    *   `char string1[101];`\n    *   `char string2[101];`\n    *   Memory for buffers = `101 * sizeof(char) + 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 + 101 = 202` bytes.\n\n*   **Looping and Comparison:** We need a loop to iterate through the strings. This requires a loop counter variable.\n    *   The loop will run from index 0 up to `length - 1` (maximum 99).\n    *   An `int` type (typically 4 bytes) is standard for a loop counter. However, to be maximally memory-efficient, we should choose the smallest data type that can hold the required range of values (0 to 99).\n    *   An `unsigned char` has a range of 0 to 255 and uses only 1 byte. This is sufficient and the most memory-efficient choice.\n    *   `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory for counter = `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n*   **Minimizing Variables:** The comparison can be done directly within `if` conditions, and the program can print the result and exit as soon as a difference is found. This avoids the need for an extra variable to store the result.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating Total Memory (m)**\n\nWe sum the memory allocated for all the variables declared in our optimized program.\n1.  First string buffer: `char s1[101];` -> 101 bytes\n2.  Second string buffer: `char s2[101];` -> 101 bytes\n3.  Loop counter: `unsigned char i;` -> 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of these values.\n`m = 101 (for s1) + 101 (for s2) + 1 (for i)`\n`m = 203` bytes.\n\nThis configuration represents the most memory-efficient C program because:\n*   Buffering both strings is necessary given the input format. `scanf` requires pre-allocated buffers.\n*   The buffer sizes are minimal (`100 chars + 1 null`).\n*   The loop counter uses the smallest possible standard integer type (`unsigned char`).\n*   No other variables are needed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis concludes that the most memory-efficient program requires two character buffers of size 101 each and one `unsigned char` variable for the loop counter.\n\nTotal memory `m` = (Memory for string 1) + (Memory for string 2) + (Memory for loop counter)\n`m = 101 bytes + 101 bytes + 1 byte = 203` bytes.\n\n<<<203>>>"
