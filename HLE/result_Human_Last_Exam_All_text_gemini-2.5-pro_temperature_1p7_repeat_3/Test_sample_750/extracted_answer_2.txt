The solutions for $z$ are given by the set $z = i \frac{W_n(-(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi))}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi}$ for all integers $n$ and $k$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions for $n=0$ and $k \le -1$, and an infinite set of other complex solutions.
