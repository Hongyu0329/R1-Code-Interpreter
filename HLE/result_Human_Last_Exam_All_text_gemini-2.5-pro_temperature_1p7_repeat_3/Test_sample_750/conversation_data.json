    "An analysis of the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ is performed step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Equation using the Definition of Complex Exponentiation**\n    The equation involves a complex number $z$ as a base and an exponent. We must use the general definition of complex exponentiation, $a^b = e^{b \\log(a)}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\n    The complex logarithm $\\log(a)$ is a multi-valued function:\n    $\\log(a) = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$, for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    For $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n    So, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    Let's define the constant $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The logarithm is $\\log(i) = iC_k$.\n\n    Substituting this into the term $i^z$:\n    $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z(iC_k)} = e^{izC_k}$.\n\n    Now the original equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ becomes:\n    $z\\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$, for some integer $k$.\n\n2.  **Solve the Transcendental Equation**\n    The equation $z\\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$ is a transcendental equation. We can solve it by rearranging it into the standard form for the Lambert W function, which is defined by the solutions to $u e^u = c$.\n\n    Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $w = izC_k$.\n    We need to express the $z$ on the left side in terms of $w$. From the substitution, we have:\n    $z = \\frac{w}{iC_k} = \\frac{-iw}{C_k}$.\n\n    Substitute this expression for $z$ back into the equation $z\\cdot i = e^w$:\n    $(\\frac{-iw}{C_k}) \\cdot i = e^w$\n    $\\frac{-i^2 w}{C_k} = e^w$\n    $\\frac{w}{C_k} = e^w$\n\n    Now, rearrange this to fit the Lambert W function form ($u e^u = \\text{constant}$):\n    $w = C_k e^w$\n    $w e^{-w} = C_k$\n\n    To match the form $ue^u=c$, we make one more substitution. Let $u = -w$. Then $w = -u$.\n    $(-u)e^{-(-u)} = C_k$\n    $-u e^u = C_k$\n    $u e^u = -C_k$\n\n3.  **Express the Solution using the Lambert W Function**\n    The solutions for $u$ in the equation $u e^u = -C_k$ are given by the branches of the Lambert W function, $W_n$, where $n$ is an integer representing the branch index.\n    $u = W_n(-C_k)$.\n\n    Now we back-substitute to find $z$:\n    First, find $w$: $w = -u = -W_n(-C_k)$.\n    Next, find $z$: $z = \\frac{-iw}{C_k} = \\frac{-i(-W_n(-C_k))}{C_k} = i\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n    Substituting back $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we get the general form for all solutions:\n    $z_{n,k} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for integers $n, k$.\n\n### Characterization of Solutions\n\nThis single formula represents all possible solutions. We can classify them into different types based on the properties of the Lambert W function.\n\n1.  **Real Solutions**\n    For $z$ to be a real number, $i\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$ must be real. This implies that $W_n(-C_k)$ must be a purely imaginary number.\n    By analyzing the condition $ue^u = -C_k$ for $u=ib$, we find this occurs for two sets of conditions, leading to two real solutions.\n    -   **$z = 1$**: This solution is found by setting $W_n(-C_k) = -iC_k$. This holds for any integer $k$ by choosing the appropriate branch $n$. Checking in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$.\n    -   **$z = -1$**: This solution is found by setting $W_n(-C_k) = iC_k$. This also holds for any integer $k$ by choosing the appropriate branch $n$. Checking in the original equation: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$.\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**\n    For $z$ to be purely imaginary, $i\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$ must be purely imaginary. This implies that $W_n(-C_k)$ must be a real number.\n    The Lambert W function $W_n(x)$ produces real values only for branches $n=0$ and $n=-1$.\n    -   $W_0(x)$ is real for $x \\ge -1/e$.\n    -   $W_{-1}(x)$ is real for $-1/e \\le x < 0$.\n\n    Let's check the argument $x = -C_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)$.\n    The condition $x \\ge -1/e$ becomes $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) \\ge -1/e$, which simplifies to $k \\le -0.19...$. So, this condition holds for any integer $k \\le -1$. For these values of $k$, $W_0(-C_k)$ is real.\n    The condition for $W_{-1}$ to be real, $-1/e \\le -C_k < 0$, has no integer solutions for $k$.\n\n    Therefore, we have an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions given by the principal branch $n=0$ for all integers $k \\le -1$:\n    $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$.\n\n3.  **Other Complex Solutions**\n    For all other pairs of integers $(n, k)$ not covered above, the value of $W_n(-C_k)$ is a non-zero complex number with both real and imaginary parts. These give rise to an infinite number of complex solutions of the form $z=x+iy$ where $x\\neq0$ and $y\\neq0$.\n    This happens for:\n    -   All branches $n$ when $k \\ge 0$ (since $-C_k < -1/e$).\n    -   All branches $n \\notin \\{0, -1\\}$ when $k \\le -1$. (Note: For $k\\le-1$, $-C_k > -1/e$. $W_{-1}$ would give a complex value here.)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ is given by the formula:\n$z_{n,k} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ represents the choice of branch for the logarithm, and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ represents the choice of branch for the Lambert W function ($W_n$).\n\nThese solutions can be categorized as follows:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions: $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n3.  An infinite number of other complex solutions given by all other pairs of $(n,k)$.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z$ are given by the set $z = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $n$ and $k$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions for $n=0$ and $k \\le -1$, and an infinite set of other complex solutions.>>>"
