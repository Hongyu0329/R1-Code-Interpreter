    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to find the second-tallest real-world (historical) mountain that is mentioned by name in Homer's *Iliad*.\n\n2.  **List All Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad:** First, we must compile a list of specific, named mountains that appear in the text. The most prominent ones are:\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy, in the region known as the Troad. Zeus famously sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Saos/Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\"\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned as the source of the ash-wood for the spear that Chiron gave to Peleus, which was then used by Achilles.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in a simile in Book 14, where the goddess Hera's powerful voice is compared to a great shout traveling over the sea.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a landmark for the Maeonian forces, who came from the land \"under snowy Tmolus.\"\n\n3.  **Confirm \"Historical\" Status and Find Elevations:** Next, we confirm these are all real mountains and find their modern names and elevations.\n    *   **Mount Olympus** (Greece): 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n    *   **Mount Tmolus** (Modern Turkey, now called Bozdağ): 2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n    *   **Mount Athos** (Greece): 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida** (Modern Turkey, now called Kaz Dağı): 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n    *   **Mount Pelion** (Greece): 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace** (Greece, the mountain is named Saos or Fengari): 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n4.  **Compare and Rank the Mountains:** Now, we rank these mountains by elevation to find the tallest one *after* Mount Olympus.\n\n| Mountain         | Modern Name     | Location       | Elevation        | Rank |\n| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---- |\n| Mount Olympus    | Mount Olympus   | Greece         | 2,918 m (9,573 ft) | 1    |\n| **Mount Tmolus** | **Bozdağ**      | **Turkey**     | **2,159 m (7,083 ft)** | **2**    |\n| Mount Athos      | Mount Athos     | Greece         | 2,033 m (6,670 ft) | 3    |\n| Mount Ida        | Kaz Dağı        | Turkey         | 1,774 m (5,820 ft) | 4    |\n| Mount Pelion     | Mount Pelion    | Greece         | 1,624 m (5,328 ft) | 5    |\n| Mount Samothrace | Saos / Fengari  | Greece         | 1,611 m (5,285 ft) | 6    |\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Plot Importance vs. Mention:** While Mount Ida and Mount Samothrace play more active roles in the narrative (gods watching battles from them), the question is simply about which mentioned mountain is tallest. Mount Tmolus, though only mentioned once in the Catalogue of Ships, is explicitly named and is a real, tall mountain.\n*   **The Two Mount Idas:** There is another famous Mount Ida in Crete, associated with the birth of Zeus. However, the context of the *Iliad* makes it clear that the mountain being referenced is the one in the Troad, overlooking Troy.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevation:** The elevations are based on modern geographical surveys. The ranking is definitive based on this data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
