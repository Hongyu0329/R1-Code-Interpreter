    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Given Value 1:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`.\n    *   **Given Value 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This represents the membership degree of a specific value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule.\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Terminology and Context:**\n    *   **Rule Activation Level (Firing Strength):** Strictly speaking, this is the value calculated from the rule's antecedent part only. In this case, it would be `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   **Implication Step:** In a fuzzy inference system, the firing strength is used to modify the consequent fuzzy set. This process is called implication. The result is the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. This step almost always uses a t-norm to combine the firing strength with the consequent membership function.\n    *   **T-norm:** A t-norm is a type of function used to model fuzzy logic AND operations. The two most common t-norms are the **minimum** operator (`min(a, b)`) and the **product** operator (`a * b`).\n\n3.  **List Careful Points:**\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Ambiguity of \"Rule Activation Level\"**: The question is slightly ambiguous. While the activation level is technically just the antecedent's firing strength (0.7), the question provides a value from the consequent (0.9) and explicitly asks to use a \"t-norm operation\". This strongly suggests that the question uses the term \"rule activation level\" loosely to refer to the result of the implication step, which is the membership grade of the final output fuzzy set for that rule. This is a common convention in fuzzy logic problems. We will proceed with this interpretation as it utilizes all the given information.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Simplification of Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set**: An IT3 FS is highly complex, where membership grades are themselves Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets. The problem simplifies this by providing single, crisp numbers (`0.7` and `0.9`). These values should be interpreted as specific, relevant points from the complex IT3 structure (for example, the upper bounds of the primary membership at a specific slice). This simplification allows us to perform the calculation as if it were a standard Type-1 fuzzy system.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Choice of T-norm**: The problem states to use \"a t-norm\" but does not specify which one. In fuzzy logic, when a t-norm is not specified, the `minimum` operator is the most standard and common choice. We will use the `minimum` operator for this calculation.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the question asks for the result of the implication step, combining the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership using a `min` t-norm.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the antecedent firing strength (`τ_k`).\n    `τ_k = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Step 2:** Identify the original membership in the consequent set (`μ_G`).\n    `μ_G = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n*   **Step 3:** Apply the `minimum` t-norm to these two values to find the resulting membership in the rule's output fuzzy set.\n    `Result = t-norm(τ_k, μ_G)`\n    `Result = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n*   **Step 4:** Calculate the final value.\n    `Result = 0.7`\n\nThe result of the operation, which is what the question is asking for, is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
