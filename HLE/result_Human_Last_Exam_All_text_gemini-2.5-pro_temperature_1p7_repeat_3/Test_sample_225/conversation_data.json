    "Step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve C defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**1. Define a Self-Intersection Point**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two different parameter values, t1 and t2.\nThis means we need to find pairs (t1, t2) such that:\n(x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2))\nwith t1 ≠ t2.\n\n**2. Determine the Parameter Interval**\nThe function x(t) = cos(9t) has a period of 2π/9.\nThe function y(t) = sin(5t) has a period of 2π/5.\nTo trace the entire curve, we need the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods.\nLCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π.\nSo, the entire curve is traced once for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**3. Analyze the Symmetry of the Curve**\nLet P(t) = (x(t), y(t)). Let's examine the point P(t + π):\nx(t + π) = cos(9(t + π)) = cos(9t + 9π) = -cos(9t) = -x(t)\ny(t + π) = sin(5(t + π)) = sin(5t + 5π) = -sin(5t) = -y(t)\nSo, P(t + π) = -P(t). This indicates that the part of the curve traced in the interval [π, 2π) is a reflection through the origin of the part traced in [0, π).\n\nThis symmetry implies that the total number of self-intersections is twice the number of self-intersections that occur for t values within the interval [0, π), provided the curve does not pass through the origin (which would be a point of intersection between the two halves). The curve passes through the origin (0,0) only if x(t)=0 and y(t)=0 for the same t. cos(9t)=0 implies 9t=(k+1/2)π and sin(5t)=0 implies 5t=nπ. This would mean 5(2k+1)/9 = 2n, which is impossible since the left side is odd and the right is even. Thus, the curve never passes through the origin.\n\nSo, we can find the number of intersections for t1, t2 in [0, π) and multiply it by 2.\n\n**4. Set Up and Solve the Intersection Equations for t in [0, π)**\nWe need to find t1, t2 in [0, π) with t1 ≠ t2 such that:\n1) cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)  =>  9t1 = ±9t2 + 2kπ\n2) sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)  =>  5t1 = 5t2 + 2mπ  or  5t1 = π - 5t2 + 2mπ\n\nThis gives four possible combinations of cases:\nCase A: 9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 - t2) = 2mπ. This implies 5k=9m. Since 5 and 9 are coprime, k must be a multiple of 9. However, for t1,t2 in [0,π), |t1-t2|<π, so |2kπ/9|<π => |k|<4.5. The only multiple of 9 in this range is k=0, which means t1=t2, not an intersection.\n\nCase B: 9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 + t2) = (2m+1)π. This implies 10k = 9(2m+1), which is impossible (even = odd).\n\nCase C: 9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 + t2) = (2m+1)π.\nWe solve for t1 and t2. From these equations, and since t1, t2 ∈ [0, π), we derive the constraints on the integers k and m.\n- |t1-t2| < π => |2kπ/9| < π => |k| < 4.5. So k ∈ {±1, ±2, ±3, ±4}.\n- 0 < t1+t2 < 2π => 0 < (2m+1)π/5 < 2π => 0 <= m <= 4.\n- t1, t2 < π. Solving for t1, t2 gives t1 = (1/2) * (2kπ/9 + (2m+1)π/5) and t2 = (1/2) * ((2m+1)π/5 - 2kπ/9). The condition t1,t2 < π simplifies to 9(2m+1) >= 10|k| and 9(2m+1) < 90 - 10|k|.\nWe count the integer pairs (k, m) satisfying these conditions.\n- For m=0 or m=4: No solutions for k.\n- For m=1: |k|={1,2}. We count these as 2 points because (k,m) and (-k,m) pairs generate the same intersection point.\n- For m=2: |k|={1,2,3,4}. This gives 4 points.\n- For m=3: |k|={1,2}. This gives 2 points.\nTotal intersections in this case = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n\nCase D: 9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 - t2) = 2mπ.\nAgain, we establish constraints for t1, t2 ∈ [0, π).\n- 0 < t1+t2 < 2π => 0 < 2kπ/9 < 2π => 1 <= k <= 8.\n- |t1-t2| < π => |2mπ/5| < π => |m| < 2.5. So m ∈ {±1, ±2}.\n- The conditions t1, t2 < π and t2 >= 0 require 9|m| <= 5k < 45 - 9|m|.\nWe count the number of points, which correspond to pairs (k, |m|).\n- For |m|=1: 9 <= 5k < 36 => 1.8 <= k < 7.2 => k ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7}. (6 points)\n- For |m|=2: 18 <= 5k < 27 => 3.6 <= k < 5.4 => k ∈ {4,5}. (2 points)\nTotal intersections in this case = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe number of self-intersections in the interval t ∈ [0, π) is the sum of intersections from Case C and Case D.\nN_half = 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nThe total number of self-intersections for the full curve (t ∈ [0, 2π)) is twice this amount.\nTotal N = 2 * N_half = 2 * 16 = 32.\n\nThis result is consistent with the known formula for Lissajous curves of the form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) where a and b are odd coprime integers, which gives the number of intersections as N = (a-1)(b-1).\nFor a=9, b=5, the formula gives N = (9-1)(5-1) = 8 * 4 = 32.\n\n>>>32"
