    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Metric**\n\nThe spacetime geometry outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, we can use natural units where $G=c=1$. Let's define the function $f(r) = 1 - \\frac{2M}{r}$. The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal and its components are:\n*   $g_{00} = -f(r) = -(1 - 2M/r)$\n*   $g_{11} = f(r)^{-1} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components that are the reciprocals of the corresponding $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ components.\n\n**2. The Christoffel Symbol Formula**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are calculated from the metric tensor using the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\nwhere $\\partial_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}$.\n\n**3. Simplifications based on the Metric's Properties**\n\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula collapses to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$.\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$ (Note: no summation over $\\rho$).\n*   **Symmetries:** The metric components depend only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^2$). They are independent of $t$ ($x^0$) and $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n    *   $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ (static spacetime)\n    *   $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ (axially symmetric spacetime)\n    This implies that any Christoffel symbol with a derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ will be simplified.\n*   **Coordinate Dependencies:**\n    *   $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n\n**4. Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe will go through each possible value of the upper index $\\rho$. We must remember that Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices, i.e., $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. We count these as a single symbol.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 0$ (t-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ and $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, this is only non-zero if one lower index is 0 and the derivative is non-zero. $g_{00}$ depends on $r$, so $\\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    **Result for $\\rho=0$: 1 non-zero symbol.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 1$ (r-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. For this to be non-zero, the term in parentheses must be non-zero. This happens when we take the $r$-derivative ($\\partial_1$) of metric components that depend on $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$ (since $g_{00}$ depends on $r$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{11}) \\neq 0$ (since $g_{11}$ depends on $r$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$ (since $g_{22}$ depends on $r$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$ (since $g_{33}$ depends on $r$).\n    **Result for $\\rho=1$: 4 non-zero symbols.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. We need derivatives of $g_{22}$ or $\\theta$-derivatives ($\\partial_2$) of other components. $g_{22}=r^2$ depends on $r$, and $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    **Result for $\\rho=2$: 2 non-zero symbols.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since no component depends on $\\phi$, $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$. The formula simplifies to $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{33} \\delta_{\\nu3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{33} \\delta_{\\mu3})$. For this to be non-zero, one index must be 3, and the derivative must be non-zero. $g_{33}$ depends on $r$ ($\\partial_1$) and $\\theta$ ($\\partial_2$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    **Result for $\\rho=3$: 2 non-zero symbols.**\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Metric Choice:** The Schwarzschild metric is the correct description for the given physical situation.\n2.  **Symmetry in Lower Indices:** The Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ is symmetric with respect to its lower indices $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. This means $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. When counting the number of *distinct* symbols, a pair like $\\Gamma_{12}^2$ and $\\Gamma_{21}^2$ is counted as one symbol.\n3.  **Coordinate Dependencies:** A Christoffel symbol can only be non-zero if the metric components have derivatives with respect to the coordinates. The analysis crucially relies on correctly identifying that $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ depends only on $r$ and $\\theta$.\n4.  **Diagonal Metric:** The diagonal nature of the metric greatly simplifies the general formula, making the calculation tractable and systematic. For a component $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ to be non-zero, at least one of the derivatives $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho}$, $\\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho}$, or $\\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu}$ must be non-zero.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the number of distinct symbols found for each value of the upper index $\\rho$:\n*   For $\\rho = 0$: 1 symbol ($\\Gamma_{10}^0$)\n*   For $\\rho = 1$: 4 symbols ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)\n*   For $\\rho = 2$: 2 symbols ($\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)\n*   For $\\rho = 3$: 2 symbols ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3$)\n\nTotal number of non-zero symbols = $1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
