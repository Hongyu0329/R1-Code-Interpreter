    "An internal adjunction in a locally posetal 2-category is a specific instance of an adjunction in a 2-category. We will analyze this structure in the context of the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context and definitions**\n\n*   **The Simplex Category, $\\Delta$**: The objects of $\\Delta$ are the non-empty finite ordinals, denoted by $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **Locally Posetal 2-Category**: When we view $\\Delta$ as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$ (the category of posets), we can enrich its structure. A \"locally posetal 2-category\" means that for any two objects $X, Y$, the set of morphisms between them, $\\mathrm{Hom}(X, Y)$, is itself a poset. The 2-morphisms are given by this order. For two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$. The order is the pointwise order: $f \\le g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n*   **Internal Adjunction**: An internal adjunction from an object $X$ to an object $Y$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms, $L: X \\to Y$ (the left adjoint) and $R: Y \\to X$ (the right adjoint), along with two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_X \\to R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_Y$, which must satisfy the triangle identities.\n*   **Applying to $\\Delta$**: In our specific case, $X=[23]$ and $Y=[37]$.\n    *   $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ are order-preserving maps.\n    *   The unit $\\eta$ corresponds to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$. This means for all $i \\in [23]$, $i \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$.\n    *   The counit $\\varepsilon$ corresponds to the inequality $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This means for all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le j$.\n    *   In a Pos-enriched category (like this one), these two inequalities are sufficient to define an adjunction; the triangle identities are automatically satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Relate to a known concept**\n\nThe conditions on the order-preserving maps $L$ and $R$ are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. So, the question asks for the number of Galois connections from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\n\nFor a pair of posets, an adjunction $(L, R)$ is uniquely determined by either $L$ or $R$. This is because:\n*   A map $L$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\n*   A map $R$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nLet's count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$. The poset $[m]$ is a finite chain, and thus a complete lattice. For a map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema.\n\n1.  **Supremum of the empty set**: The supremum of the empty set in a complete lattice is its minimum element. So, $L$ must map the minimum element of $[m]$ to the minimum element of $[n]$. This gives the condition:\n    $L(\\sup(\\emptyset_{\\subseteq [m]})) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset_{\\subseteq [n]}))$\n    $L(0) = \\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n    So, any left adjoint $L: [23] \\to [37]$ must satisfy $L(0) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Suprema of non-empty sets**: For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is its maximum element, $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$. An order-preserving map $L$ between two chains automatically preserves maxima: for any $s \\in S$, we have $s \\le \\max(S)$, so $L(s) \\le L(\\max(S))$. This means $L(\\max(S))$ is the maximum element of the image set $L(S)$. Thus, $L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$.\n\nTherefore, a map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and satisfies $L(0) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate and solve the counting problem**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\nThe values $L(i)$ are in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nWith the condition $L(0)=0$, our problem reduces to finding the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\". We are choosing 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, with replacement allowed, and the order is fixed by the non-decreasing condition.\n\n*   Number of items to choose: $k = 23$.\n*   Number of options to choose from: The set is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $n = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ elements.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ options with replacement (a multiset) is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nSubstituting our values, we get:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a check, we could have counted the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. These are the order-preserving maps satisfying $R(37)=23$. This would require choosing the 37 values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This gives $\\binom{(23+1)+37-1}{37} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, the results match.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<60 \\choose 23>>>"
