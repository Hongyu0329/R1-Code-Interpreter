    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Queen Attacks\n\n*   **The Board:** A 5x5 grid that is \"toroidal\". This means the edges wrap around. For example, the square to the right of column 4 is column 0, and the square below row 4 is row 0.\n*   **The Pieces:** 4 queens.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the number of ways to place these 4 queens so that no two queens attack each other.\n*   **Queen's Attack on a Toroidal Board:** A queen at position `(r, c)` attacks all squares in:\n    1.  The same row `r`.\n    2.  The same column `c`.\n    3.  The same \"diagonals\". On a toroidal board, diagonals are defined by squares `(x, y)` where `(x - y)` is constant (mod 5) or `(x + y)` is constant (mod 5).\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Constraints\n\nLet the positions of the four queens be `(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, `(r3, c3)`, and `(r4, c4)`. The \"non-attacking\" condition implies the following must all be distinct:\n1.  The rows: `r1, r2, r3, r4`.\n2.  The columns: `c1, c2, c3, c4`.\n3.  The main diagonal indices: `(r1-c1) mod 5`, `(r2-c2) mod 5`, `(r3-c3) mod 5`, `(r4-c4) mod 5`.\n4.  The anti-diagonal indices: `(r1+c1) mod 5`, `(r2+c2) mod 5`, `(r3+c3) mod 5`, `(r4+c4) mod 5`.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nSolving this directly by trying all combinations would be very complex. A more elegant approach is to relate this problem to the well-known 5-queens problem on the same 5x5 toroidal board.\n\n*   A solution to the 5-queens problem is a set of 5 positions that satisfy the non-attacking constraints. This means the 5 rows are distinct {0,1,2,3,4}, the 5 columns are distinct {0,1,2,3,4}, the 5 main diagonal indices are distinct {0,1,2,3,4}, and the 5 anti-diagonal indices are distinct {0,1,2,3,4}.\n*   It is a known result from recreational mathematics that the number of solutions to the 5-queens problem on a 5x5 toroidal board is **10**.\n\nNow, let's establish a connection between the 4-queen solutions and the 5-queen solutions.\n\n**From a 5-queen solution to a 4-queen solution:**\nIf you have a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens, you can simply remove any one of them. The remaining 4 queens will still not attack each other.\nSince there are 10 distinct 5-queen solutions, and from each solution you can remove any of the 5 queens, this process generates `10 * 5 = 50` potential 4-queen solutions.\n\n**From a 4-queen solution to a 5-queen solution:**\nThe crucial question is: Is this mapping one-to-one? Or could different 5-queen solutions lead to the same 4-queen solution? Or can a 4-queen solution not be extended to a 5-queen solution?\n\nLet's prove that any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens can be extended to a full 5-queen solution in **exactly one way**.\n\nAssume we have a valid 4-queen placement `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}`.\n1.  **Finding the position of the 5th queen:**\n    *   Since the 4 queens are in 4 different rows, there is exactly one empty row. Let's call it `r5`.\n    *   Since the 4 queens are in 4 different columns, there is exactly one empty column. Let's call it `c5`.\n    *   Therefore, if a 5th queen can be added, its position must be `(r5, c5)`.\n\n2.  **Checking if the 5th queen is non-attacking:**\n    We already know the queen at `(r5, c5)` is in a unique row and column. We only need to check the diagonals.\n    *   The 4 placed queens occupy 4 distinct main diagonal indices, `d1, d2, d3, d4`, where `di = (ri-ci) mod 5`. There is exactly one main diagonal index `d5` that is not used.\n    *   Similarly, there is exactly one anti-diagonal index `s5` that is not used.\n    *   The question is: does the queen at `(r5, c5)` occupy these exact diagonals? In other words, is `(r5 - c5) mod 5 = d5` and `(r5 + c5) mod 5 = s5`?\n\n    Let's use a property of modular arithmetic on the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The sum is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10`, which is `0 mod 5`.\n    For a full 5-queen solution, we must have:\n    `Σri = Σci = Σ(ri-ci) = Σ(ri+ci) ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n\n    For our 4-queen solution, we can find the missing elements:\n    *   `r5 = (0 - (r1+r2+r3+r4)) mod 5`\n    *   `c5 = (0 - (c1+c2+c3+c4)) mod 5`\n    *   `d5 = (0 - (d1+d2+d3+d4)) mod 5`\n    *   `s5 = (0 - (s1+s2+s3+s4)) mod 5`\n\n    Now, let's check the diagonals of the queen at `(r5, c5)`:\n    *   `r5 - c5 ≡ -(Σri) - (-(Σci)) ≡ -(Σri - Σci) ≡ -(Σdi) ≡ d5 (mod 5)`\n    *   `r5 + c5 ≡ -(Σri) + (-(Σci)) ≡ -(Σri + Σci) ≡ -(Σsi) ≡ s5 (mod 5)`\n\n    This proves that the uniquely determined 5th queen `(r5, c5)` will indeed occupy the unique remaining main diagonal and anti-diagonal. Thus, it completes a valid 5-queen solution.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nWe have established a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between:\n*   The set of all valid 4-queen placements.\n*   The set of all pairs `(S, q)`, where `S` is a valid 5-queen placement and `q` is one of the queens in `S`.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is equal to the size of the second set.\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions: 10\n*   Number of ways to choose one queen to remove from each solution: 5\n*   Total number of 4-queen placements = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nThe question \"how many ways\" typically asks for the number of distinct placements (i.e., distinct sets of coordinates), not the number of configurations up to symmetry, so 50 is the correct interpretation.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly interpret the \"toroidal\" constraint on diagonals.\n*   Recognize that for `k` queens on an `N x N` board (where `k<N`), the queens must occupy `k` distinct rows, columns, and toroidal diagonals.\n*   The key insight is to relate the problem for `k=N-1` queens to the full `N`-queen problem.\n*   The argument relies on properties of modular arithmetic over a prime `N` (here `N=5`), specifically that `Σ(0...N-1) ≡ 0 (mod N)`.\n*   Ensure that the number of `N`-queen solutions is known or can be derived. For 5 queens on a 5x5 torus, the number is a standard result (10).\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to a final answer of 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
