    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the book and the main character.**\nThe book is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Polish science fiction author Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who is cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the 29th century.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the main character's relationships.**\nUpon his revival, Adam Zamoyski is a primitive anomaly in a post-human world. He is guided and tutored by an advanced AI being called an \"inklinacja\" (inclination), or \"ink\" for short. This entity's name is Angelika.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the nature of their relationship and the concept of \"marriage\".**\nThe relationship between Adam and Angelika evolves from a guide-and-student dynamic into a deep personal, political, and strategic alliance. In the context of the highly advanced civilization portrayed in the novel, their formal union is the equivalent of a marriage. It's a merging of their goals, assets, and legal standing. This union is a pivotal plot point, solidifying Adam's position in this new world.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the character Adam Zamoyski marries.**\nBased on the evolution of their relationship and their formal union within the novel's plot, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries the \"ink\" named Angelika.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **The nature of \"character\":** Angelika is not a biological human but a sophisticated artificial intelligence. However, in the context of the story, she is a fully realized character with her own agency and personality.\n*   **The definition of \"marriage\":** The union is not a traditional 21st-century marriage ceremony but a formal, binding contract and partnership that serves the same function within the society of the novel. For the purpose of the question, it is accurate to say they marry.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
