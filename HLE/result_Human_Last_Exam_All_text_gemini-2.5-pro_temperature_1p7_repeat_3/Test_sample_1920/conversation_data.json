    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Nature of the Conductor:** The first step is to understand the conductor $d$. We need its prime factorization. The properties of Dirichlet characters heavily depend on whether the conductor is a prime power, square-free, or a general integer.\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** For a conductor $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Primitivity Condition:** A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is *primitive* if it is not induced by a character modulo a proper divisor of $d$. When the conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes (square-free), say $d=p_1 \\cdots p_k$, the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is non-principal (i.e., not the trivial character).\n4.  **Order of a Character:** The order of the product character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n5.  **Group Structure:** The group of Dirichlet characters modulo $m$ is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^*$. For a prime $p$, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k|n$, and 0 otherwise.\n6.  **Counting Strategy:** To count characters with a specific order, we can't just count the number of components with that order. We must use a combinatorial principle like Inclusion-Exclusion. We count the number of primitive characters whose order *divides* 6, then subtract those whose order is a *proper divisor* of 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor $d=53599$.**\n\nWe test for small prime factors:\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2 or 5.\n*   The sum of digits is $5+3+5+9+9 = 31$, which is not divisible by 3.\n*   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   Now we factor $7657$: $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   Now we factor $589$: $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\n*   31 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes, it is square-free.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the character and apply conditions.**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$ can be written uniquely as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p$.\n\n*   **Primitivity:** For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal. This means $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) \\neq 1$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n*   **Order:** For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, we must have $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies that the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the component character groups.**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.\n*   For $p=7$: The group is cyclic of order $7-1=6$.\n*   For $p=13$: The group is cyclic of order $13-1=12$.\n*   For $p=19$: The group is cyclic of order $19-1=18$.\n*   For $p=31$: The group is cyclic of order $31-1=30$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of primitive characters using Inclusion-Exclusion.**\n\nLet $N^*(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order *exactly* $k$. Let $C(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ whose order *divides* $k$.\n\nA primitive character $\\chi=\\prod \\chi_p$ has order dividing $k$ if and only if each component $\\chi_p$ has order dividing $k$ (and is non-principal). The number of characters modulo $p$ with order dividing $k$ is $\\gcd(k, p-1)$. To be non-principal, we subtract 1.\nSo, $C(k) = \\prod_{p|d} (\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1)$.\n\nThe number of characters of order exactly 6 can be found by the inclusion-exclusion principle on the divisors of 6 (which are 1, 2, 3, 6):\n$N^*(6) = C(6) - C(3) - C(2) + C(1)$.\n\nLet's calculate $C(k)$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$:\n\n*   **$C(6)$**: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 6.\n    $C(6) = (\\gcd(6, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 30)-1)$\n    $C(6) = (6-1) \\times (6-1) \\times (6-1) \\times (6-1) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n\n*   **$C(3)$**: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 3.\n    $C(3) = (\\gcd(3, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 30)-1)$\n    $C(3) = (3-1) \\times (3-1) \\times (3-1) \\times (3-1) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n*   **$C(2)$**: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 2.\n    $C(2) = (\\gcd(2, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 30)-1)$\n    $C(2) = (2-1) \\times (2-1) \\times (2-1) \\times (2-1) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n*   **$C(1)$**: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 1.\n    $C(1) = (\\gcd(1, 6)-1) \\times \\dots = (1-1) \\times \\dots = 0$. This is expected, as a primitive character cannot have order 1.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n$N^*(6) = C(6) - C(3) - C(2) + C(1)$\n$N^*(6) = 625 - 16 - 1 + 0$\n$N^*(6) = 608$\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
