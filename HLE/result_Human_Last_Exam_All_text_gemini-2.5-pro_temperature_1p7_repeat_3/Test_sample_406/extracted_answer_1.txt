The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a product space. The two primary conditions are:
1.  **Completeness:** The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.
2.  **Contraction:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a combined contraction condition. This is typically achieved if they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to their variables, such that `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1,x2) + a2*d_Y(y1,y2) + a3*d_Z(z1,z2)`, `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b2*d_X(x1,x2) + (b1+b3)*d_Y(y1,y2)`, and `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c3*d_X(x1,x2) + c2*d_Y(y1,y2) + c1*d_Z(z1,z2)`, and the non-negative constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` satisfy `max((a1 + b2 + c3), (a2 + b1 + b3 + c2), (a3 + c1)) < 1`.
Under these conditions, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists.
