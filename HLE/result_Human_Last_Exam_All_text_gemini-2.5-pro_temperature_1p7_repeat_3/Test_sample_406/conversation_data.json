    "This question asks for the conditions that guarantee the existence of a special type of fixed point, called an FGH-tripled fixed point, for three functions F, G, and H. The core of the analysis involves applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a combined operator on a product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem and Terminology**\n\nFirst, let's formally define all the components of the problem.\n\n*   **Spaces:** Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three metric spaces.\n*   **Functions:** We are given three functions with the following domains and codomains:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *(Note: The question listed the second and third functions both as 'G'. Based on the context of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" and the distinct signatures, it is a standard assumption to interpret the third function as H.)*\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n    1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n**Step 2: Formulate as a Single Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nThe problem of finding three points `x, y, z` satisfying three separate equations can be simplified by treating it as a single fixed-point problem in a larger space.\n\n*   **Product Space:** We construct a product space `W = X × Y × Z`. An element in this space is a triplet `w = (x, y, z)`.\n*   **Product Metric:** We define a metric `d_W` on this product space. A common and convenient choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   **Combined Operator:** We define a single operator `T: W → W` that combines the actions of F, G, and H:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   **Equivalence:** A point `w = (x, y, z)` is a fixed point of `T` if `T(w) = w`. Expanding this equation gives:\n    `(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    This is exactly the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, finding an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding a fixed point for the operator `T`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem provides powerful conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. The theorem states:\n*If `(W, d_W)` is a non-empty complete metric space and `T: W → W` is a contraction mapping, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `W`.*\n\nThis leads to two primary conditions we need to impose on our problem.\n\n**Condition 1: Completeness of the Space**\n\n*   For the Banach theorem to apply, the space `W` must be complete. The product space `W = X × Y × Z` (with the sum metric `d_W`) is complete if and only if each of the component spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` is complete.\n*   **First Condition:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n\n**Condition 2: The Contraction Mapping**\n\n*   The operator `T` must be a contraction mapping. This means there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `w2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d_W(w1, w2)`\n*   Let's expand this inequality using the definitions of `T` and `d_W`:\n    `d_W(T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2))`\n*   To ensure this is a contraction, we impose Lipschitz-like conditions on F, G, and H. Assume there exist non-negative constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` such that for all relevant points:\n    1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2) + b3*d_Y(y1, y2)`\n        `= b2*d_X(x1, x2) + (b1 + b3)*d_Y(y1, y2)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n*   Now, we sum these three inequalities to bound `d_W(T(w1), T(w2))`:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ (a1*d_X + a2*d_Y + a3*d_Z) + (b2*d_X + (b1+b3)*d_Y) + (c3*d_X + c2*d_Y + c1*d_Z)`\n*   Collecting terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ (a1 + b2 + c3)*d_X(x1, x2) + (a2 + b1 + b3 + c2)*d_Y(y1, y2) + (a3 + c1)*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   To relate this back to `d_W(w1, w2) = d_X + d_Y + d_Z`, we can find a common factor:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ max( (a1+b2+c3), (a2+b1+b3+c2), (a3+c1) ) * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)`\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ max( (a1+b2+c3), (a2+b1+b3+c2), (a3+c1) ) * d_W(w1, w2)`\n*   The operator `T` is a contraction if the factor `k = max( (a1+b2+c3), (a2+b1+b3+c2), (a3+c1) )` is less than 1.\n*   **Second Condition:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy Lipschitz-type conditions with constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` such that `max( (a1+b2+c3), (a2+b1+b3+c2), (a3+c1) ) < 1`. A simpler but more restrictive condition that also works is that the sum of all individual constants is less than 1: `(a1+a2+a3) + (b1+b2+b3) + (c1+c2+c3) < 1`.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nThe existence (and uniqueness) of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the given functions is guaranteed by the following conditions, derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be equipped with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z` respectively, forming non-empty complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Combined Contraction:** The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants `a1, a2, a3`, `b1, b2, b3`, and `c1, c2, c3` such that for any points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2) + b3*d_Y(y1, y2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n    And these constants must satisfy the inequality:\n    \n    **`max( (a1 + b2 + c3), (a2 + b1 + b3 + c2), (a3 + c1) ) < 1`**\n\nUnder these two main conditions, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z)` in `X × Y × Z` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a product space. The two primary conditions are:\n1.  **Completeness:** The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Contraction:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a combined contraction condition. This is typically achieved if they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to their variables, such that `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1,x2) + a2*d_Y(y1,y2) + a3*d_Z(z1,z2)`, `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b2*d_X(x1,x2) + (b1+b3)*d_Y(y1,y2)`, and `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c3*d_X(x1,x2) + c2*d_Y(y1,y2) + c1*d_Z(z1,z2)`, and the non-negative constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` satisfy `max((a1 + b2 + c3), (a2 + b1 + b3 + c2), (a3 + c1)) < 1`.\nUnder these conditions, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists.>>>"
