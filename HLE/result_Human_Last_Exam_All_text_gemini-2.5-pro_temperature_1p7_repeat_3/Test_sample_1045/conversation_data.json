    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atomic composition of Toluene.\nToluene has a chemical formula of C₇H₈. This means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set for each type of atom.\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze its meaning for both Carbon and Hydrogen.\n\n**For a second-row atom like Carbon (C):**\n*   **\"6-\"**: The core orbitals (in this case, the 1s orbital) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). This CGF is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). This contributes **1 CGF**.\n*   **\"-31\"**: This describes the valence orbitals (the 2s and 2p orbitals). The \"split-valence\" representation means they are described by two sets of CGFs.\n    *   **\"3\"**: The \"inner\" part of the valence shell. It uses one CGF for the 2s orbital and one set of CGFs for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). Each of these CGFs is built from **3** PGFs. This contributes 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **\"1\"**: The \"outer\" part of the valence shell. It uses one CGF for the 2s orbital and one set of CGFs for the 2p orbitals. Each of these is a single, uncontracted PGF. This contributes 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**For a first-row atom like Hydrogen (H):**\n*   Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals. The notation is applied only to the valence shell.\n*   **\"-31\"**: The 1s valence orbital is split into two CGFs.\n    *   **\"3\"**: The \"inner\" part, represented by one CGF built from **3** PGFs. This contributes **1 CGF**.\n    *   **\"1\"**: The \"outer\" part, represented by one CGF which is a single PGF. This contributes **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C₇H₈).\nNow, we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total for Toluene:** 63 CGFs + 16 CGFs = 79 CGFs\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Correctly count atoms:** Ensure the correct atom count from the formula C₇H₈.\n2.  **Distinguish Core vs. Valence:** The notation applies differently. Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the \"6-\" part does not apply to it.\n3.  **Count p-orbitals:** Remember that for second-row elements, the \"p\" designation implies three separate orbitals (px, py, pz), and thus three basis functions are needed for each p-shell representation.\n4.  **Distinguish PGFs from CGFs:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (basis functions), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussian functions.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in the calculation.\n\n<<<79>>>"
