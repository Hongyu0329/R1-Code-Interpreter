    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula gives an explicit expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^X e^Y = e^Z$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The solution $Z$ is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = X + Y + Z_2(X,Y) + Z_3(X,Y) + \\dots + Z_n(X,Y) + \\dots$\nHere, $Z_n(X,Y)$ is the \"term of order n\", which is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree $n$. The degree of a term is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it.\n\n*   **Order 1:** $Z_1 = X+Y$\n*   **Order 2:** $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$\n*   **Order 3:** $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]]$\n\n**2. Interpret the Question: \"Number of Nonzero Coefficients\"**\n\nThe term $Z_n(X,Y)$ is an element of the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$. This algebra can be viewed as a vector space, and we can choose a basis for it. For any given order $n$, there is a set of linearly independent nested commutators that form a basis for all possible commutators of that order. For example, for order 3, a basis is $\\{[X,[X,Y]], [Y,[X,Y]]\\}$.\n\nA crucial mathematical result is that when $Z_n(X,Y)$ is expressed as a linear combination of these basis elements, all the coefficients are non-zero rational numbers.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10?\" is equivalent to asking: **\"What is the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10?\"** This is the same as finding the dimension of the 10th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators ($X$ and $Y$).\n\n**3. The Correct Tool: Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n$$ d_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d} $$\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate $d_{10}$ with $n=10$ and $k=2$.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Find the divisors of n=10.**\n    The divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Find the values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor.**\n    The Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ is defined as:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = (-1)^m$ if $d$ is a product of $m$ distinct prime numbers.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n    For our divisors:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate each term in the sum $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.**\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    *   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Sum the terms.**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\n*   **Step 4.5: Complete the calculation using Witt's formula.**\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times (\\text{Sum}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th graded piece of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
