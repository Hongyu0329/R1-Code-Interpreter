    "This is an excellent question that requires a careful analysis of the definitions of crystallographic symmetry properties.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions simultaneously:\n    1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique direction with a net electric dipole moment.\n    3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Condition in Terms of Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity, it must be **chiral**. This is the fundamental symmetry requirement. A chiral object is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In the language of point group symmetry, a crystal class is chiral if and only if it **lacks all rotoinversion axes**. Rotoinversion axes include the center of inversion (symboled as **ī**) and the mirror plane (symboled as **m**, which is equivalent to a 2-fold rotoinversion axis, **2̄**).\n    *   **Achiral:** For a crystal to be achiral, its structure must be superimposable on its mirror image. This means the crystal class **must possess at least one rotoinversion axis** (e.g., a center of inversion **ī** or a mirror plane **m**).\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Contradiction:**\n    *   The third condition states that the crystal class must have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity,\" which, as established above, means it **must be chiral**.\n    *   The first condition states that the crystal class **must be achiral**.\n\n    An object or a symmetry group cannot be both **chiral** and **achiral** at the same time. These two properties are, by definition, mutually exclusive.\n    *   **Chiral = Lacks** rotoinversion axes.\n    *   **Achiral = Possesses** at least one rotoinversion axis.\n\n4.  **Conclusion based on the Contradiction:**\n    Because a crystal class must be chiral to be optically active, it cannot also be achiral. The conditions presented in the question are contradictory. Therefore, there are no crystal classes that can satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. The set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is the empty set.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Clarity of Definitions:** The core of this problem lies in the precise definitions of chirality and optical activity in the context of crystal symmetry. The link between chirality (a geometric property) and optical activity (a physical property) is fundamental.\n*   **The Non-polar Condition:** While the non-polar condition is also part of the question, the contradiction between the \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" requirements makes it unnecessary to even consider this third condition to arrive at the answer. No matter which classes are non-polar, they cannot be both chiral and achiral.\n*   **Avoiding Misconceptions:** One must not confuse natural optical activity (an intrinsic property of the material's symmetry) with other phenomena like the Faraday effect, where an external magnetic field can induce optical rotation even in achiral substances. The question is strictly about the crystal class symmetry.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe requirement for optical activity is chirality. The requirement for being achiral is the absence of chirality. Since a crystal class cannot be both chiral and not chiral simultaneously, there are no crystal classes that fit the description.\n\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions. A crystal class must be chiral to be optically active, but the question specifies that the class must also be achiral. These two conditions are mutually exclusive.>>>"
