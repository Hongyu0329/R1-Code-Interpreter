    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the objects involved:**\n*   **C:** A genus 3 Riemann surface. In algebraic geometry terms, this is a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus $g=3$ over the complex numbers.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted $X = C^{(15)}$ or $Sym^{15}(C)$. This is the variety parametrizing effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** This is the group of divisor classes on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, is an important birational invariant called the Picard number.\n\n**2. Relate the Picard number of the symmetric power to the Jacobian of the curve.**\nThe key to understanding the geometry of symmetric powers of a curve C is its Jacobian variety, J(C). J(C) is an abelian variety of dimension $g=3$.\n\nThere is a canonical map called the Abel-Jacobi map:\n$u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$\nwhich sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree $d$ to the linear equivalence class of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - dP_0)$, where $P_0$ is a fixed base point on C.\n\nFor degrees $d$ large enough, this map has a very nice structure. Specifically, for $d \\ge 2g-1$, the Abel-Jacobi map $u_d$ exhibits $C^{(d)}$ as a projective bundle over $J(C)$.\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. We check the condition: $15 \\ge 2(3) - 1 = 5$. The condition holds.\nThe fibers of this map are the projective spaces parametrizing the effective divisors within a given linear equivalence class. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a generic divisor $D$ of degree 15, the dimension of the complete linear series $|D|$ is $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - 1 = (d-g+1) - 1 = d-g$.\nSo, the dimension of the fiber is $d-g = 15 - 3 = 12$. The fibers are isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\nThus, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$.\n\nFor a projective bundle $p: P \\to B$, where P is the total space and B is the base, the rank of the Neron-Severi group (the Picard number) is given by the formula:\n$\\rho(P) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nApplying this to our situation, where $P = X = C^{(15)}$ and $B = J(C)$, we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**3. Determine the range of the Picard number of the Jacobian.**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a curve C of genus 3. The Picard number of an abelian variety is determined by its endomorphism algebra.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$:**\n    For a *generic* curve C of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Such Jacobians are simple abelian varieties. In this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n    Therefore, the rank is $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    Such generic curves of genus 3 exist (for instance, a generic smooth plane quartic).\n    So, the minimum possible value is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$:**\n    The Picard number of an abelian variety A of dimension $g$ is bounded by $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$. For $J(C)$, this means $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n    This maximum is achieved when the abelian variety has a large endomorphism ring, a property known as Complex Multiplication (CM). The maximum value $\\rho(A)=g^2$ is achieved if and only if A is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of a CM elliptic curve, i.e., $A \\sim E^g$ where E is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication.\n\n    We need to know if there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian is of this type. The answer is yes. A classical example is the Fermat quartic curve:\n    $F_4: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$.\n    This is a smooth plane quartic curve, so its genus is $g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = 3$.\n    It is a well-known result that the Jacobian of this curve, $J(F_4)$, is isogenous to the product of three copies of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve E has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n    So, for this curve $C=F_4$, we have $J(C) \\sim E \\times E \\times E$.\n    Since the rank of the Neron-Severi group is invariant under isogeny, $\\rho(J(C)) = \\rho(E^3)$.\n    The rank of the Neron-Severi group of $E^3$, where E has CM by an order $\\mathcal{O}$ in an imaginary quadratic field, is the rank of the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrices with entries in $\\mathcal{O}$.\n    -   The 3 diagonal entries must be real, so they are integers. This contributes $3 \\times 1 = 3$ to the rank.\n    -   The 3 upper-triangular off-diagonal entries can be any element of $\\mathcal{O}$, which has rank 2 as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module. This contributes $3 \\times 2 = 6$ to the rank.\n    The total rank is $\\rho(E^3) = 3 + 6 = 9$.\n    So, the maximum possible value is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**4. Calculate the smallest and largest ranks for X.**\nUsing the formula $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$:\n\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X corresponds to a generic genus 3 curve, and the largest possible rank corresponds to a very special curve with maximal complex multiplication, like the Fermat quartic.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2, and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
