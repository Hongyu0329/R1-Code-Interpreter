    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and Identify the Key Behavior**\n\nWe are asked to find an analytical approximation for the integral\n$$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$$\nfor the regime where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The integral is over the interval $[0, 15]$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ will become very large if the term $g(x)$ becomes very small. This is a singular perturbation problem. The dominant contribution to the integral will come from the region(s) where $g(x)$ is at its minimum.\n\n**2. Locate the Dominant Point(s)**\n\nWe need to find the minimum of $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ on the interval $[0, 15]$.\nLet's compute the derivative of $g(x)$:\n$$g'(x) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + 72x^7 = x^4(45 + 30x + 72x^3)$$\nFor $x > 0$, all terms in the parenthesis are positive, so $g'(x) > 0$. This means that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function on the interval $[0, 15]$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $g(x)$ occurs at the left endpoint of the interval, $x=0$, where $g(0) = 0$.\n\nThis means the integrand peaks sharply near $x=0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, and the value of the integral will be dominated by the contribution from a small neighborhood around $x=0$.\n\n**3. Approximate the Integrand**\n\nSince the dominant contribution comes from the region where $x$ is small, we can approximate the function $g(x)$ by its lowest-order term in its Taylor expansion around $x=0$.\nFor $x \\to 0$:\n$$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$$\nThe higher-order terms ($5x^6$ and $9x^8$) are negligible compared to $9x^5$ when $x$ is very small.\n\nSo, we can approximate the integral as:\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$$\n\n**4. Simplify the Integral by Extending the Integration Limit**\n\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ decreases rapidly as $x$ increases. For any fixed $\\epsilon$, the contribution from the tail of the integral (e.g., from $x=1$ to $x=15$) is much smaller than the contribution from the region near $x=0$. The error introduced by extending the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ is a lower-order effect in $\\epsilon$. This simplification allows for an exact analytical evaluation of the leading term.\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Approximate Integral**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables to absorb $\\epsilon$ and the coefficient 9 into the integration variable. Let's use a scaling transformation. We want the two terms in the denominator to be of the same order. Let $9x^5 = \\epsilon u^5$. This suggests the substitution:\n$$x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} u$$\nThen the differential is:\n$$dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du$$\nThe limits of integration do not change: when $x=0$, $u=0$; when $x \\to \\infty$, $u \\to \\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} u\\right)^5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du\\right)$$\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9} u^5\\right)} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du$$\nFactor out $\\epsilon$ from the denominator:\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + u^5)} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$$\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$$\n\n**6. Use the Standard Integral Formula**\n\nThe resulting integral is a standard form. The general formula is:\n$$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$$\nThis can be proven using contour integration or the Beta function. For our case, $n=5$. So:\n$$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$$\n\n**7. Assemble the Final Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$$\nCombining the constants, we arrive at the final analytical formula:\n$$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$$\n\nThis formula describes the leading-order behavior of the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. The integral scales as $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nFinal check of all points:\n- The identification of $x=0$ as the critical point is correct.\n- The approximation $g(x) \\approx 9x^5$ is the correct one for the leading term.\n- Extending the integration limit to infinity is a valid step in asymptotic analysis for this type of integral.\n- The substitution and scaling are performed correctly.\n- The use of the standard integral formula for $\\int 1/(1+u^n) du$ is correct.\n- All constants are accounted for.\n\nThe result is the required analytical formula.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
