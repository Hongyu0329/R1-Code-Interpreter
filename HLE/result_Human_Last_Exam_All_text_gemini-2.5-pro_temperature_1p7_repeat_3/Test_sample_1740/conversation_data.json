    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The core of the question is to find the total number of unique members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified in *Homo sapiens* (humans) up to the present day.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 family\"**: The let-7 family is a group of small, non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs). A family of miRNAs is typically defined by a shared \"seed sequence\"â€”a short, highly conserved sequence of nucleotides (usually positions 2-8 from the 5' end of the miRNA). This seed sequence is critical as it determines which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) the miRNA can bind to and regulate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Primary Source**: The most authoritative and widely used database for microRNA data, including sequences and family classifications, is **miRBase**. Scientific literature, such as review articles, provides context and corroboration.\n\n4.  **Identify the Members**: We need to find all unique human miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family. In miRBase nomenclature, human miRNAs are prefixed with \"hsa\". The let-7 family consists of several members distinguished by a letter suffix (e.g., let-7a, let-7b).\n    *   The canonical members are: `let-7a`, `let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7f`, `let-7g`, and `let-7i`. (Note: a `let-7h` has not been identified in humans).\n    *   Another microRNA, `miR-98`, shares the same seed sequence and functional properties as the let-7 members and is universally considered part of the family.\n    *   Counting these gives: **let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i (8 members) + miR-98 (1 member) = 9 members.**\n\n5.  **Careful Points & Refinements**:\n    *   **Distinguishing \"Members\" from \"Genes\"**: It is crucial to differentiate between the number of mature miRNA *members* and the number of *genes* that encode them. Some let-7 members are encoded by multiple genes at different locations in the genome. For example, the mature `hsa-let-7a` miRNA is produced from three different genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`). The question asks for \"members\", which refers to the distinct functional miRNA molecules. In total, the 9 distinct mature let-7 family members are encoded by 12 different genes.\n    *   **Distinguishing Sequence Variants**: Although some members are very similar (e.g., `hsa-let-7a-5p` and `hsa-let-7g-5p` differ by only one nucleotide), they are cataloged as distinct mature miRNAs in miRBase and are thus counted separately.\n    *   **Expanded Family Definitions**: Some newer classifications and databases might group additional miRNAs (like `miR-202` or `miR-4500`) into a broader \"let-7 superfamily\" due to some sequence similarities or shared evolutionary history. However, the classical and most widely cited \"let-7 family\" consists of the 9 core members. This count is the most standard and accepted answer in textbooks and the majority of scientific literature.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the canonical definition used in most scientific literature and the primary data from miRBase, the human let-7 family consists of 9 distinct mature miRNA members. These are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n\n<<<9>>>"
