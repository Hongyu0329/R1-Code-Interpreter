    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an open-chain polyene with a conjugated system of 8 π-electrons (four double bonds). An 8 π-electron system is a 4n system where n=2. The reaction is a ring closure that produces two diastereomeric products, a \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer (A) and a \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer (B), which are derivatives of dimethyl-cyclooctatriene.\n\n2.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory:** For a thermal pericyclic reaction, we analyze the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the π-system.\n    *   For an 8 π-electron linear polyene, there are 8 molecular orbitals (ψ₁ to ψ₈). The 8 electrons fill the lowest four orbitals.\n    *   Therefore, the HOMO is ψ₄.\n    *   The symmetry of the terminal p-orbitals in ψₙ is antisymmetric when n is even. Since n=4, the HOMO (ψ₄) is antisymmetric. This means the p-orbital lobes on the termini (C2 and C9) that are on the same face of the molecule have opposite phases.\n\n3.  **Determine the Mode of Ring Closure:** To form a new σ-bond, the terminal p-orbitals must rotate to allow for in-phase (bonding) overlap.\n    *   For an antisymmetric HOMO, the orbitals must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to achieve bonding overlap. This type of rotation is called **conrotatory**.\n    *   This matches the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for a 4n system under thermal conditions, which predict a conrotatory closure. Disrotatory closure is symmetry-forbidden and would have a much higher activation energy.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome:** The formation of two diastereomers (cis-A and trans-B) indicates that there are at least two competing pathways for the allowed conrotatory reaction. These pathways typically arise from different ground-state conformations of the flexible polyene chain. The stereochemistry of the final product depends on the relative orientation of the substituents (H and Methyl groups) at the termini (C2 and C9) in the reactive conformation. We can classify these substituents as pointing \"inward\" (into the concave side of the U-shape needed for cyclization) or \"outward\".\n\n5.  **Apply Stereochemical Rules for Conrotation:** For a conrotatory cyclization, the steric outcome follows a simple mnemonic:\n    *   Two \"outward\" groups end up \\(\\textit{trans}\\) to each other.\n    *   Two \"inward\" groups end up \\(\\textit{trans}\\) to each other.\n    *   One \"inward\" and one \"outward\" group end up \\(\\textit{cis}\\) to each other.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Transition States for Products A and B:**\n    *   **To form \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer B:** We need a conformation where both methyl groups are \"out\" (or both are \"in\"). Let's assume the more stable conformation places the bulky methyl groups \"out\". So, the conformation leading to B has [Me(out), H(in)] at C2 and [Me(out), H(in)] at C9. The transition state for this reaction involves the two \"inward\" hydrogen atoms rotating towards each other. The steric clash between two hydrogen atoms is minimal.\n    *   **To form \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A:** We need a conformation where one methyl group is \"out\" and the other is \"in\". For example, [Me(out), H(in)] at C2 and [Me(in), H(out)] at C9. This likely corresponds to a higher-energy ground state conformer. The transition state for this pathway involves an \"inward\" hydrogen from C2 rotating towards an \"inward\" methyl group from C9. This leads to a significant steric clash between a hydrogen and a much bulkier methyl group.\n\n7.  **Predict the Major Product:** According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the ratio of products in a kinetically controlled reaction is determined by the difference in the free energies of the transition states.\n    *   The transition state leading to the \\(\\textit{trans}\\) product B (TS<sub>B</sub>) has a small H-H steric interaction.\n    *   The transition state leading to the \\(\\textit{cis}\\) product A (TS<sub>A</sub>) has a larger H-Me steric interaction.\n    *   Therefore, ΔG<sup>‡</sup>(TS<sub>A</sub>) > ΔG<sup>‡</sup>(TS<sub>B</sub>).\n    *   The reaction pathway with the lower activation energy will be faster and yield the major product. Thus, the **\\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer B is the major product**, and the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A is the minor product.\n\n8.  **Predict the Ratio of A to B:** The qualitative analysis shows that A:B < 1. To predict a specific numerical ratio, we look for clues in the reactant's structure.\n    *   The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. It has **three Z-configured double bonds** and **one E-configured double bond**.\n    *   The presence of this 3:1 ratio in the structure is a strong hint that the problem expects this ratio to be reflected in the products.\n    *   Combining this hint with our conclusion that B is the major product, we predict the ratio of the products B:A to be 3:1.\n    *   The question asks for the ratio of A and B (implying A:B). Therefore, the predicted ratio of A:B is 1:3.\n\nFinal Calculation: The ratio of A to B is A/B. Since B:A = 3:1, then A:B = 1:3. The numerical value of the ratio A/B is 1/3."
