    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the functions**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined as follows:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral V:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand has the form f'(x) / f(x). The antiderivative of f'(x) / f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\nSo, let f(x) = F₃(x). The integral is:\nV = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nUsing the fundamental theorem of calculus, the definite integral is:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] (evaluated from x=0 to x=1)\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\nV = ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)\n\n**Step 4: Check the sign of F₃(x) on the interval [0, 1]**\nWe need to determine if the absolute value is necessary.\nF₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\nFor x in the interval [0, 1] (in radians):\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   sin(0) ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1) => 0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1) ≈ 0.841\n*   e⁰ ≤ e^(sin(x)) ≤ e^(sin(1)) => 1 ≤ e^(sin(x)) ≤ e^(sin(1))\n*   The argument of the logarithm, 1 + e^(sin(x)), is always greater than or equal to 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   Since the argument is always ≥ 2, the logarithm, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))), will always be greater than or equal to ln(2), which is positive.\nTherefore, F₃(x) is positive on the interval [0, 1], and we can drop the absolute value signs.\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0)**\n*   F₀(0) = 0\n*   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n*   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n**Step 6: Calculate F₃(1)**\n*   F₀(1) = 1\n*   F₁(1) = sin(1)  (Note: 1 is in radians)\n*   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the value of V**\nNow substitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) into the formula for V:\nV = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / ln(2) )\n\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.319777\n3.  1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.319777 = 3.319777\n4.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319777) ≈ 1.199853\n5.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n6.  F₃(1) / F₃(0) ≈ 1.199853 / 0.693147 ≈ 1.731034\n7.  V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.731034) ≈ 0.548713\n\n**Step 8: Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548713 = 5487.13\nThe closest integer to 5487.13 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
