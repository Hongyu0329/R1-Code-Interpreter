Yes. The Generality Constraint implies that your understanding of the proposition Fa is compositional, meaning you grasp the predicate F as a general concept that can be applied to other subjects. The second premise states you understand the concept of universal quantification (∀x). The principle of systematic compositionality, which is the foundation of the Generality Constraint, dictates that a thinker who possesses the conceptual components (the predicate F and the universal quantifier) must be able to combine them to form a new, more complex thought. Therefore, you should be able to understand the proposition ∀x Fx.
