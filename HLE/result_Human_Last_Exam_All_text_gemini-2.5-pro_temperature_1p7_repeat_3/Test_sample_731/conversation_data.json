    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^k$, denoted $SD_{2^k}$, is defined for $k \\ge 3$. The question specifies a size of 512, which is $2^9$. So, we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{2^9}$, which means $k=9$.\n    The presentation of this group is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{k-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{k-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $k=9$, the presentation becomes:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$.\n    So, $r^{256} = 1$, $s^2=1$, and $srs = r^{127}$.\n    The group $G$ has $512$ elements: $\\{r^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\} \\cup \\{sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$. The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is cyclic of order 256.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $n$ such that $H$ is the set of all $n$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^n = \\{g^n \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Problem**\n\nThe group $G = SD_{512}$ is a finite 2-group (its order is a power of the prime 2). For any finite $p$-group $G$, it is a known result that the set of its power subgroups is exactly the set $\\{ G^{p^k} \\mid k \\ge 0 \\}$. In our case, $p=2$.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of power subgroups, we only need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\dots$, which is $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Power Subgroups $G^{2^j}$**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^{2^j} = \\{g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for $j = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe elements $g$ of $G$ are of two types: $r^i$ or $sr^i$.\n\n*   **For $j=0$:**\n    $G^{2^0} = G^1 = \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$. So, the group $G$ itself is the first power subgroup.\n\n*   **For $j \\ge 1$:**\n    We need to compute the $2^j$-th powers for both types of elements.\n    1.  **Elements of the form $r^i$:**\n        $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i \\cdot 2^j}$.\n        As $i$ ranges from $0$ to $255$, the set of these elements forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$. For $j \\ge 8$, $r^{2^j} = 1$, so this becomes the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n\n    2.  **Elements of the form $sr^i$:**\n        First, we find the square of $sr^i$:\n        $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = (s r^i s^{-1}) r^i$. Since $s=s^{-1}$, we use the relation $srs = r^{127}$, which implies $srs^{-1}=r^{127}$.\n        $s r^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n        So, $(sr^i)^2 = (r^{127i}) r^i = r^{127i+i} = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n        Now we can find the $2^j$-th power for $j \\ge 1$:\n        $(sr^i)^{2^j} = ((sr^i)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{128i})^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{i \\cdot 2^7})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}$.\n        As $i$ ranges from $0$ to $255$, the set of these elements forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n\n    Combining these two sets of powers, for $j \\ge 1$, we get:\n    $G^{2^j} = \\{r^{i \\cdot 2^j}\\} \\cup \\{r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n    Since $j+6 > j$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$. For instance, $r^{2^{j+6}} = (r^{2^j})^{2^6}$.\n    Thus, their union is simply the larger subgroup:\n    $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: List and Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nNow we can list the distinct power subgroups by evaluating $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n\n*   $j=0: \\quad G^{1} = G = SD_{512}$ (Order 512)\n*   $j=1: \\quad G^{2} = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (Order $256/2 = 128$)\n*   $j=2: \\quad G^{4} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (Order $256/4 = 64$)\n*   $j=3: \\quad G^{8} = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (Order $256/8 = 32$)\n*   $j=4: \\quad G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (Order $256/16 = 16$)\n*   $j=5: \\quad G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (Order $256/32 = 8$)\n*   $j=6: \\quad G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (Order $256/64 = 4$)\n*   $j=7: \\quad G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (Order $256/128 = 2$)\n*   $j=8: \\quad G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup of order 1)\n*   For any $j > 8$: $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, since $r^{256}=1$. These are not new subgroups.\n\nTo confirm these subgroups are distinct, we can look at their orders. The orders are 512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Since all the orders are different, the subgroups are all distinct.\n\nCounting the distinct subgroups in the list, we find there are 9 of them.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$.\n<<<9>>>"
