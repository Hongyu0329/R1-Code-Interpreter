    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting: a self-portrait by Curt Querner, painted in 1933 after escaping the Gestapo. The core of the question is to identify the object he holds in his hand and its symbolic meaning as an act of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific painting.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled *\"Selbstbildnis mit spitzer Feder\"* (Self-Portrait with a Quill Pen). This painting is well-documented and was indeed created in 1933 after Querner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany, was arrested and interrogated by the National Socialist regime.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object in the painting.**\nAs the German title suggests, in the portrait Querner holds a quill pen (or a sharp-nibbed pen). He holds it upright and prominently, almost like a weapon or a scepter.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\n*   **Context is crucial:** The painting was made immediately after Querner's traumatic experience with the Gestapo. This was the beginning of a regime that would brutally suppress dissent, artistic freedom, and intellectual expression.\n*   **The Pen as a Tool:** The quill pen is the primary tool of a draftsman and artist like Querner. By holding it, he is reaffirming his identity as an artist.\n*   **\"Spitze Feder\" - a double meaning:** This is a careful point. The German title \"mit spitzer Feder\" literally means \"with a sharp pen.\" However, it is also an idiom that means \"with a sharp/critical tongue\" or \"with a satirical/critical style.\" Querner is therefore making a pun. He is not just holding a physical pen; he is declaring his intent to continue using his \"sharp\" artistic commentary to criticize and resist.\n*   **The Pen vs. The Sword:** Holding the pen as one might hold a weapon is a clear visual representation of the concept that art, ideas, and intellectual expression are powerful forms of resistance against physical force and tyranny (\"the pen is mightier than the sword\").\n*   **An Act of Defiance:** In the face of a regime that sought to silence him, Querner paints himself not as a broken victim, but as a defiant artist, holding the very instrument of the free expression they tried to crush. It symbolizes his unbroken spirit and his commitment to continue his work as a form of intellectual and political resistance.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\nAfter escaping the Gestapo in 1933, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait where he holds a quill pen. This pen symbolizes his defiance and resistance against the Nazi regime. It represents the power of art and intellectual expression (\"the sharp pen\") as a weapon against tyranny and a declaration of his unbroken will to continue his critical work as an artist.\n\n<<<He holds a quill pen (in German, a \"spitze Feder\").>>>"
