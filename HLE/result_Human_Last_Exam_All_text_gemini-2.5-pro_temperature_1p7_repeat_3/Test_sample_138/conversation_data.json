    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the theory of integral quadratic forms and lattices. Let's analyze the properties of the lattice in question step by step.\n\n**1. Understand the given properties:**\n*   **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{17}$ that spans it.\n*   **Positive definite:** The quadratic form associated with the lattice, $q(x) = (x, x)$, is positive for all non-zero vectors $x$. This means the signature of the lattice is $(17, 0)$, so the signature $\\sigma = n_+ - n_-$ is $17 - 0 = 17$.\n*   **Even lattice:** The squared norm of every vector in the lattice is an even integer. That is, $(x, x) \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $x \\in L$.\n*   **Dimension:** The dimension of the vector space spanned by the lattice is $n=17$.\n*   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix of any basis for the lattice is $\\det(L)=2$.\n\n**2. Check for necessary conditions and constraints:**\nThe existence of integral lattices with specific properties is constrained by several mathematical theorems that relate their invariants (dimension, determinant, signature, type). A key aspect of this theory is the behavior of lattices over the 2-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, because the \"even\" property is a condition related to the prime 2.\n\nWe can use two well-established theorems concerning even lattices to check if a lattice with the given properties can exist.\n\n**Method 1: The van der Blij Congruence**\nA theorem by van der Blij provides a congruence condition for the determinant of an even lattice.\n**Theorem:** For any even lattice $L$ of dimension $n$, its determinant must satisfy the following congruence:\n$\\det(L) \\cdot (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{ or } 4 \\pmod 8$.\n\nLet's apply this to our case:\n*   $n = 17$\n*   $\\det(L) = 2$\nFirst, calculate the exponent of $(-1)$:\n$n(n-1)/2 = 17(17-1)/2 = 17 \\cdot 16 / 2 = 17 \\cdot 8 = 136$.\nSince the exponent is even, $(-1)^{136} = 1$.\nThe congruence condition simplifies to:\n$\\det(L) \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{ or } 4 \\pmod 8$.\nFor our lattice, $\\det(L)=2$. We check if $2$ satisfies the condition:\n$2 \\pmod 8$ is 2.\nThe number 2 is not in the set $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\nThis violates the necessary condition from van der Blij's theorem. Therefore, a lattice with these properties cannot exist.\n\n**Method 2: The Signature Congruence**\nAnother set of constraints, found in the work of N. Elkies and others, relates the signature of an even lattice to its determinant.\n**Theorem:** For an even lattice $L$ with signature $\\sigma$ and determinant $d$:\n*   If $d$ is odd, then $\\sigma \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n*   If $v_2(d)=1$ (i.e., $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$), then $\\sigma \\equiv 0, \\pm 2 \\pmod 8$.\n*   If $v_2(d)=2$ (i.e., $d \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$), then $\\sigma$ must be even.\nHere $v_2(d)$ is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides $d$.\n\nLet's apply this to our case:\n*   $\\sigma = 17$\n*   $d = 2$\nFirst, we find the 2-adic valuation of the determinant:\n$v_2(2) = 1$. This means we are in the second case of the theorem.\nThe theorem states that the signature $\\sigma$ must be congruent to $0, \\pm 2 \\pmod 8$. This means $\\sigma \\pmod 8$ must be in the set $\\{0, 2, 6\\}$.\nNow, we calculate the signature modulo 8:\n$\\sigma = 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nThe value $1$ is not in the set $\\{0, 2, 6\\}$.\nThis also violates a necessary condition for the existence of such a lattice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods show a contradiction. The properties given (dimension 17, determinant 2, positive definite, even) are inconsistent with the fundamental theorems governing the structure of even lattices. Therefore, no such lattice can exist.\n\nThe number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is 0."
