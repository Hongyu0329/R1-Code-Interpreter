    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the music theory terms used in the question:\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is the first chord in the scale, denoted by the Roman numeral \"I\" in a major key (e.g., C major in the key of C) or \"i\" in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. It's also called the dominant chord.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The question specifies a *minor* fifth chord. This is a crucial detail.\n    *   In a major key, the naturally occurring fifth chord is major (V). For example, in the key of A major, the fifth note is E, and the V chord is E major (E-G#-B). A *minor* fifth chord (v) would be E minor (E-G-B). Using a minor v chord in a major key is a technique called \"modal mixture\" or \"borrowing,\" as the chord is taken from the parallel minor key (A minor).\n    *   In a natural minor key, the fifth chord is naturally minor (v). For example, in A minor, the v chord is E minor (E-G-B).\n*   **Chord Jump:** This simply means a direct progression from one chord to the next.\n*   **Starts with:** This implies the progression happens at the very beginning of the song, or at the start of the main vocal/melodic section.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with the progression **I -> v** (in a major key) or **i -> v** (in a minor key). The progression from a major tonic to a minor dominant (I -> v) is more distinctive and emotionally evocative.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Candidates\n\nLet's examine some Beatles songs and their opening chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is in the key of F minor. Its tonic chord is **F minor (i)**. The song begins with the verse, starting on this Fm chord. However, the progression does not immediately jump to the minor fifth, C minor (v). Instead, the harmony is more complex, involving a descending bass line. The C minor chord features prominently as the *starting chord of the French-lyric bridge* (\"Sont les mots qui vont trÃ¨s bien ensemble...\"), not at the start of the song itself. So, \"Michelle\" is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\"**: This song is in A minor. It starts with the tonic chord **A minor (i)**. However, the very next chord is **E major (V)**, which is a *major* fifth chord, not a minor one. The raised G-sharp in the E major chord creates a strong pull back to the A minor tonic, but it doesn't match the \"minor fifth\" criterion.\n\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"**: This song is the final track on the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   The song's primary key is **A major**. Therefore, the tonic chord (I) is **A major**.\n    *   The minor fifth chord (v) in this key would be **E minor**.\n    *   The song begins with a somber acoustic guitar intro that is in A *minor*. However, this serves as a lead-in to the main song.\n    *   The verse begins immediately after the intro with the lyric \"You know, if you break my heart I'll go...\".\n    *   The chord played on \"You know...\" is **A major (I)**, the tonic.\n    *   The very next chord, played on \"...I'll go...\", is **E minor (v)**.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe progression at the very beginning of the verse of **\"I'll Be Back\"** is a direct jump from the tonic A major chord to the minor fifth E minor chord (I -> v). This perfectly matches all the criteria in the question. The shift from the expected E major chord to the borrowed E minor chord creates the song's signature wistful and melancholy feel right from the start of the main theme.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
