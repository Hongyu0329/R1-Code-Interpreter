    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to analyze the notation for a specific atom. The number of functions depends on the element. Typically, such questions refer to a representative second-row non-hydrogen (heavy) atom, like Carbon. Let's perform the analysis for both a second-row atom and a hydrogen atom.\n\n**Analysis for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)**\n\nA second-row atom like Carbon has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n\n**1. Step-by-step breakdown of the `6-311G` part:**\n\n*   **`6-`**: This refers to the core orbitals. The 1s core orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Number of PGFs for the 1s core = **6**.\n\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p). The basis set is a \"triple-split valence\" basis. This means the valence shell is described by three separate functions. For Pople basis sets, the exponents for s-type and p-type valence functions are shared (these are called `sp` shells).\n    *   **Inner valence (`-3-`)**: The first CGF for the 2s orbital is made from 3 s-type PGFs. The first CGFs for the 2p orbitals are made from 3 p-type PGFs. As they share exponents, this corresponds to a shell of 3 `sp` primitives.\n        *   Number of PGFs = 3 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **6**.\n    *   **Middle valence (`-1-`)**: The second CGF for the valence shell is uncontracted, meaning it is a single PGF. This adds one s-type PGF and one p-type PGF.\n        *   Number of PGFs = 1 (for 2s) + 1 (for 2p) = **2**.\n    *   **Outer valence (`-1-`)**: The third CGF for the valence shell is also uncontracted (a single PGF). This adds another s-type PGF and another p-type PGF.\n        *   Number of PGFs = 1 (for 2s) + 1 (for 2p) = **2**.\n\n*   **Subtotal for `6-311G` on Carbon**: 6 (core) + 6 (inner valence) + 2 (middle valence) + 2 (outer valence) = **16** primitive Gaussians.\n\n**2. Step-by-step breakdown of the `**` (polarization functions) part:**\n\n*   **First `*`**: This adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. This is a single, uncontracted set. A standard set of d-functions consists of **6** Cartesian primitive Gaussians ($d_{x^2}, d_{y^2}, d_{z^2}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n    *   Number of d-type PGFs = **6**.\n\n*   **Second `*`**: This adds polarization functions to hydrogen atoms only. It does not apply to Carbon.\n\n**3. Final Calculation for a Second-Row Atom (e.g., Carbon):**\n\nTotal PGFs = (PGFs from 6-311G) + (PGFs from `*`)\nTotal PGFs = 16 + 6 = **22**.\n\n***\n\n**Analysis for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n\nHydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` prefix does not apply. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n\n**1. Step-by-step breakdown of the `311G` part for H:**\n\n*   The valence 1s orbital is split according to the `-311` scheme.\n    *   The inner part is a CGF made of **3** s-type PGFs.\n    *   The middle part is a single **1** s-type PGF.\n    *   The outer part is a single **1** s-type PGF.\n*   **Subtotal for `311G` on Hydrogen**: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n\n**2. Step-by-step breakdown of the `**` (polarization functions) part for H:**\n\n*   **First `*`**: Applies to heavy atoms only, so not to Hydrogen.\n*   **Second `*`**: Adds a set of p-type polarization functions to Hydrogen. A set of p-functions consists of **3** primitive Gaussians ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Number of p-type PGFs = **3**.\n\n**3. Final Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom:**\n\nTotal PGFs = (PGFs from 311G) + (PGFs from `*`)\nTotal PGFs = 5 + 3 = **8**.\n\nSince the question asks for a single number, it is most likely referring to the standard case of a second-row heavy atom.\n\n<<<22>>>"
