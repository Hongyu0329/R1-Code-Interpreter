    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Graph:** A graph $G$ consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. We are given that the number of vertices is $|V| = n = 128$.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. A clique with $k$ vertices is denoted as $K_k$.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices $W \\subseteq V$, the induced subgraph $G[W]$ has $W$ as its vertex set, and its edge set consists of *all* edges from $E$ that have both endpoints in $W$.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that a single graph on 128 vertices can contain. A graph \"contains\" a clique of size $k$ if there is some set of $k$ vertices that induces a $K_k$.\n\n**2. Formalizing the Problem**\n\nLet $G$ be a graph on 128 vertices. Let $S(G)$ be the set of all integers $k \\ge 1$ for which there exists a subset of vertices $W \\subseteq V(G)$ with $|W| = k$ such that the induced subgraph $G[W]$ is isomorphic to a complete graph $K_k$. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $|S(G)|$ over all possible graphs $G$ on 128 vertices.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Set of Clique Sizes $S(G)$**\n\nThis step contains the most critical point of the analysis. Let's examine the structure of the set $S(G)$.\n\n*   Let $\\omega(G)$ be the **clique number** of the graph $G$. The clique number is defined as the size of the largest clique in $G$. By definition, this means that the maximum value in the set $S(G)$ is $\\omega(G)$.\n*   **Key Property:** If a graph $G$ contains an induced clique of size $k$ (i.e., $k \\in S(G)$), does it necessarily contain an induced clique of any smaller size $j < k$?\n*   **Proof:** Let's assume $k \\in S(G)$ for some $k > 1$. By definition, there exists a set of vertices $W$ with $|W| = k$ such that $G[W]$ is a complete graph ($K_k$). This means that for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in W$, the edge $(u, v)$ exists in $G$.\n    Now, let $j$ be any integer such that $1 \\le j < k$. We can choose any subset $W'$ of $W$ with $|W'|=j$.\n    The induced subgraph $G[W']$ is formed by the vertices of $W'$ and all edges of $G$ between them. Since $W' \\subset W$, any two vertices in $W'$ are also in $W$. Because $G[W]$ is a clique, every pair of vertices in $W$ is connected. Therefore, every pair of vertices in $W'$ must also be connected.\n    This means that $G[W']$ is a complete graph of size $j$, i.e., a $K_j$.\n    Thus, we have shown that if $k \\in S(G)$, then $j \\in S(G)$ for all $1 \\le j < k$.\n*   **Conclusion on the structure of S(G):** The set of possible clique sizes in any graph $G$ is not just an arbitrary set of numbers. It must be a set of consecutive integers starting from 1. Specifically, $S(G) = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\n**4. Reframing the Question**\n\nBased on the analysis in the previous step, the number of different clique sizes that can appear in a graph $G$ is $|S(G)| = \\omega(G)$.\nSo, the problem is simplified to: What is the maximum possible clique number, $\\omega(G)$, for a graph $G$ with 128 vertices?\n\n**5. Finding the Maximum Clique Number**\n\n*   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, a clique is a subset of these vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. For $n=128$, we must have $\\omega(G) \\le 128$.\n*   We now need to determine if this maximum value of 128 is achievable. A clique number of 128 can be achieved by the **complete graph** $K_{128}$. A complete graph on 128 vertices has all $\\binom{128}{2}$ possible edges.\n\n**6. Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet's consider the graph $G = K_{128}$.\n*   The number of vertices is 128.\n*   What is the clique number $\\omega(K_{128})$? The entire graph is a clique of size 128, so $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n*   According to our key property, the set of induced clique sizes in $K_{128}$ must be $S(K_{128}) = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 128\\}$.\n*   Indeed, for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 128\\}$, we can select any subset of $k$ vertices from $K_{128}$. Since all vertices are connected to all other vertices, this subset induces a clique of size $k$.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is $|S(K_{128})| = 128$.\n\nSince we have found a graph on 128 vertices that has 128 different clique sizes, and we know that no graph on 128 vertices can have more than 128 different clique sizes (as a clique size must be a positive integer no greater than 128), the maximum possible number is 128.\n\n**Careful Points Summary**\n\n*   The term \"induced subgraph\" is critical, but for cliques, it turns out to be equivalent to a regular subgraph on the same vertex set. This is because if a set of vertices has all possible edges between them (as in a clique subgraph), the induced subgraph can't have any fewer edges and already has the maximum possible.\n*   A potential ambiguity exists with the term \"clique\" possibly meaning \"maximal clique.\" However, in standard graph theory, \"clique\" refers to any complete subgraph. The maximal clique interpretation leads to a more complex problem (partitioning an integer), resulting in an answer of 16. But without explicit instruction, the standard definition should be used. The fact that the standard interpretation leads to a simple, demonstrable proof is strong evidence for its correctness. The key step is proving that the set of clique sizes is always $\\{1, ..., \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition: The number of different clique sizes in any graph G is equal to its clique number, $\\omega(G)$. We want to maximize this number for a graph on 128 vertices. The maximum possible clique number in a graph on 128 vertices is 128, which is achieved by the complete graph $K_{128}$.\n\n<<<128>>>"
