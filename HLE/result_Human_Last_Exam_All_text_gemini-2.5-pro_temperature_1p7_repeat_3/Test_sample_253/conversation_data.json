    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the binary pattern for Rule 110 after 20 steps starting from a single '1'.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each with a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. This group of three cells is called the neighborhood.\n\nRule 110 is defined by the following state transitions for each possible 3-cell neighborhood. The name \"Rule 110\" comes from the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. Each bit in this number corresponds to the output for a specific neighborhood pattern, ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\nHere is the explicit rule table:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | New State for Center Cell |\n|:------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n| `111`                                      |             0             |\n| `110`                                      |             1             |\n| `101`                                      |             1             |\n| `100`                                      |             0             |\n| `011`                                      |             1             |\n| `010`                                      |             1             |\n| `001`                                      |             1             |\n| `000`                                      |             0             |\n\n### Step 2: Define the Initial State and Simulation Process\n\n*   **Initial State (Generation 0):** The automaton starts with an infinite row of 0s and a single cell in state 1. The pattern is simply `1`.\n*   **Simulation Process:** To get the pattern for the next generation, we apply Rule 110 to every cell. We only need to consider the cells from one position to the left of the current pattern's first '1' to one position to the right of its last '1', as all other cells are in the `000` neighborhood and will remain 0. The resulting sequence of 0s and 1s is then trimmed of any leading or trailing zeros to form the new pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Simulation\n\nLet's trace the evolution of the pattern for 20 generations.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** We calculate based on the padded pattern `010`. The relevant neighborhoods are `001` (left), `010` (center), and `100` (right). The new states are `1`, `1`, `0`. The pattern is `11`.\n*   **Gen 2:** From pattern `11` (padded: `0110`). New states from `001`, `011`, `110`, `100` are `1`, `1`, `1`, `0`. The pattern is `111`.\n*   **Gen 3:** From `111`. The pattern becomes `1101`.\n*   **Gen 4:** From `1101`. The pattern becomes `11111`.\n*   **Gen 5:** From `11111`. The pattern becomes `110001`.\n*   **Gen 6:** From `110001`. The pattern becomes `1110011`.\n*   **Gen 7:** From `1110011`. The pattern becomes `11010111`.\n*   **Gen 8:** From `11010111`. The pattern becomes `11111101`.\n*   **Gen 9:** From `11111101`. The pattern becomes `110000111`.\n*   **Gen 10:** From `110000111`. The pattern becomes `1110001101`.\n*   **Gen 11:** From `1110001101`. The pattern becomes `1101001111`.\n*   **Gen 12:** From `1101001111`. The pattern becomes `1111101001`.\n*   **Gen 13:** From `1111101001`. The pattern becomes `11000111011`.\n*   **Gen 14:** From `11000111011`. The pattern becomes `11100101111`.\n*   **Gen 15:** From `11100101111`. The pattern becomes `11010111001`.\n*   **Gen 16:** From `11010111001`. The pattern becomes `11111101011`.\n*   **Gen 17:** From `11111101011`. The pattern becomes `110000111111`.\n*   **Gen 18:** From `110000111111`. The pattern becomes `111001100001`.\n*   **Gen 19:** From `111001100001`. The pattern becomes `110101100011`.\n*   **Gen 20:** From `110101100011`. We compute the final state. The new neighborhoods generate the sequence `1111111001110`. After trimming the trailing zero, we get the final pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nAfter applying Rule 110 for 20 generations, starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is `111111100111`.\n\n<<<111111100111>>>"
