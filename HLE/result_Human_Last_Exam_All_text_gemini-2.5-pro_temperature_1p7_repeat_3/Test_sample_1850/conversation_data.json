    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, we must conduct a careful analysis of the text, defining our terms and systematically searching for specific names.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"\nFor the purpose of this analysis, a \"historical saint\" will be defined as a pre-eminent holy figure from the Old Testament, New Testament, or subsequent Church history who is recognized as such within Christian tradition. This includes patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and later figures canonized by the church. The key criterion is that they are historical individuals (within the context of the tradition) renowned for their holiness.\n\n### Step 2: Defining \"Mentioned by Name\"\nThis is a strict criterion. A figure is only counted if their proper name (e.g., \"Peter,\" \"Moses\") or a direct adjectival form that is unmistakably tied to them (e.g., \"Franciscan\") is used in the text. Clear descriptions or periphrasis without the use of the actual name (e.g., referring to Enoch as \"the seventh from Adam\") do not qualify for this count.\n\n### Step 3: A Systematic Search of *Paradise Lost*\n\nWe will examine the epic book by book, looking for figures who meet our criteria. The most fruitful sections for this are the prophetic visions of the future shown to Adam by the Archangel Michael in Books XI and XII, and the description of the \"Limbo of Vanity\" in Book III.\n\n**Book III:**\nIn his description of the Limbo of Vanity, Milton critiques what he sees as the follies of the Roman Catholic Church. In this passage, he names three saints:\n1.  **Saint Peter**: Milton describes friars and pilgrims who, arriving at the gate of Heaven, find that `Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems / To wait them with his Keys` (Book III, lines 484-485). Peter is explicitly named.\n2.  **Saint Dominic**: Milton mocks those who believe they can get into heaven by being buried in the habit of a monastic order: `And they who to be sure of Paradise / Dying put on the weeds of Dominic` (Book III, lines 478-479). Dominic de Guzmán, founder of the Dominican order, is named.\n3.  **Saint Francis**: Immediately following the mention of Dominic, Milton adds, `Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd` (Book III, line 480). \"Franciscan\" is the adjectival form derived from St. Francis of Assisi. This is a direct naming by association with the order he founded.\n\n**Book XI:**\nMichael shows Adam a vision of future events, starting with the children of Adam and Eve.\n4.  **Abel**: Adam sees the first murder and Michael explains, `...for the blood of just Abel / Cries from the ground...` (Book XI, lines 445-446). Abel, considered the first martyr and a saint, is named.\n*Careful Point*: Figures like **Enoch** and **Noah** are clearly described in this book—Enoch as \"the seventh from thee [Adam]\" who \"was translated\" and Noah as the \"one just man\" who builds the ark. However, their proper names are not used in the text, so they are not included in the count.\n\n**Book XII:**\nMichael continues his narration of history to Adam.\n5.  **Abraham**: Describing the calling of the patriarch from Ur, Michael names him: `This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth / Shall in his Seed be blessed...This Patriarch blest, / Whom after-ages Abram call'd, the Friend of God` (Book XII, lines 147-152). Abraham is named (as Abram).\n6.  **Moses**: Michael narrates the giving of the Law on Sinai and explicitly names the prophet: `...so law can discover sin, but not remove, / Save by those shadowy expiations weak, / The bloud of Bulls and Goats, transferr'd to faith in him / Whose weakness is their strength; that Law that was giv'n them by **Moses** he will fulfill...` (Lines from an online version; line numbers may vary slightly, but the name **Moses** appears several times). Moses is named.\n7.  **Joshua**: Speaking of the one who will lead the Israelites into the promised land after Moses, Michael names him: `...him Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His Name and Office bearing...` (Book XII, lines 310-311). Joshua is named.\n*Careful Point*: Figures like **David** (described as \"a man / After his own heart\") and **Solomon** (his son, \"the wonder of the World\") are clearly referenced but not explicitly named. Likewise, **Mary** is referred to as \"a Virgin\" but not named. The **Apostles** are mentioned collectively as \"his Disciples\" but not individually named (with the exception of Peter in Book III).\n\n### Final Tally\n\nBased on a strict reading of the text and the criterion \"mentioned by name,\" we can list the following seven historical saints:\n\n1.  **Peter**\n2.  **Dominic**\n3.  **Francis** (via \"Franciscan\")\n4.  **Abel**\n5.  **Abraham** (as Abram)\n6.  **Moses**\n7.  **Joshua**\n\n<<<7>>>"
