    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the careful points to consider.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the First Product:** The first product is the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule.\n2.  **Find the Imprint:** Using pharmaceutical identification databases, we search for the specific markings on this capsule. The imprint code for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule consists of the brand name \"TEVA\" on one part and a unique number on the other part.\n3.  **Extract the Number for 10mg:** The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is **3108**.\n4.  **Identify the Second Product:** The second product is the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule.\n5.  **Find the Imprint:** We repeat the search for this second product. The imprint code for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule also has the brand name \"TEVA\" on one part and a unique number on the other.\n6.  **Extract the Number for 20mg:** The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is **3109**.\n7.  **Compare and Finalize:** The final step is to state the different numbers found, ensuring adherence to all the negative constraints in the prompt (no colors, sizes, or the word \"PLIVA\").\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Brand Specificity:** It is essential to ensure the imprint codes are specific to the \"Teva\" brand, as other manufacturers of generic fluoxetine use different numbers.\n*   **Dosage Specificity:** The numbers are unique to the dosage. The number for the 10mg capsule (3108) is different from the 20mg capsule (3109). It's important not to confuse them with other strengths like 40mg.\n*   **Formulation:** The query specifies \"capsules\". The imprints on tablets, even from the same manufacturer and of the same strength, would be different.\n*   **Exclusion of Prohibited Information:** Careful attention must be paid to the instructions to *not* mention color, size, or the brand name \"PLIVA,\" which is a subsidiary of Teva and has its own set of imprints for fluoxetine (e.g., PLIVA 647 and PLIVA 648). The answer must focus only on the requested numbers from the \"TEVA\" branded line.\n\n<<<The Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the number 3108 and the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the number 3109.>>>"
