    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving the elements of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### **2. Decomposing the New Sequence**\n\nWe can express the new 8-point sequence `y(n)` in terms of the original 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are the elements of `x(n)`:\n    `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed elements of `y(n)` are the elements of `h(n)`:\n    `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### **3. Deriving the 8-Point DFT Formula**\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The definition of the N-point DFT is:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{N-1} y(n) * W_N^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j2π/N)`.\n\nFor our case, N=8. So,\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`.\n\nWe can split this summation into even and odd terms of `n`. Let `n = 2m` for the even part and `n = 2m+1` for the odd part.\n\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nNow, substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nFactor out `W_8^k` from the second summation:\n\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^(2mk)`\n\nNow, use the twiddle factor property `W_N^(2k) = W_(N/2)^k`. In our case, `W_8^(2mk) = W_4^(mk)`.\n\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nThe summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`. So we can replace them with `X(k)` and `H(k)`. Note that for `k >= 4`, `X(k)` and `H(k)` are periodic with period 4, so we use `X(k mod 4)` and `H(k mod 4)`.\n\nThe final formula is:\n**`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`**\n\nThis is the core formula used in the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n\n### **4. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Correctly identifying `y(n)`:** The sequence is formed by interleaving, not concatenation.\n*   **Splitting the DFT sum:** This is the key step to relate `Y(k)` back to `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n*   **Twiddle factor `W_8^k`:** Calculations must be done carefully. `W_8^k = e^(-jπk/4)`.\n*   **Periodicity of DFT:** Remember `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-periodic, so `X(4)=X(0)`, `X(5)=X(1)`, etc.\n*   **Complex arithmetic:** Addition and multiplication of complex numbers must be accurate.\n\n### **5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's list the required twiddle factors `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-jπ/4) = cos(π/4) - jsin(π/4) = (1-j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - jsin(3π/4) = (-1-j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^(-jπ) = -1`\n*   `W_8^5 = e^(-j5π/4) = (-1+j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^(-j3π/2) = j`\n*   `W_8^7 = e^(-j7π/4) = (1+j)/√2`\n\nNow we calculate `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n*   **Y(0):**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **Y(1):**\n    `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + ((1-j)/√2) * (1+j) = j + (1 - j^2)/√2 = j + 2/√2 = √2 + j`\n\n*   **Y(2):**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * (1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Y(3):**\n    `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + ((-1-j)/√2) * (1-j) = -j + (-(1+j)(1-j))/√2 = -j - (1-j^2)/√2 = -j - 2/√2 = -√2 - j`\n\n*   **Y(4):**\n    `Y(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **Y(5):**\n    `Y(5) = X(1) + W_8^5 * H(1) = j + ((-1+j)/√2) * (1+j) = j + (-1 -j + j + j^2)/√2 = j + (-2)/√2 = -√2 + j`\n\n*   **Y(6):**\n    `Y(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2) = -1 + (j) * (1) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **Y(7):**\n    `Y(7) = X(3) + W_8^7 * H(3) = -j + ((1+j)/√2) * (1-j) = -j + (1-j^2)/√2 = -j + 2/√2 = √2 - j`\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe resulting 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`, is the collection of these values.\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
