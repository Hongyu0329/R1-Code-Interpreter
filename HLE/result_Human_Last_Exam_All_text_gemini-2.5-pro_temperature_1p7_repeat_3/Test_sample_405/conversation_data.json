    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of different colors observed in the **pure allotropes** of phosphorus. The keywords here are \"colors\" and \"pure allotropes.\" This means we need to identify the distinct allotropic forms of phosphorus and their intrinsic colors, excluding colors that arise from impurities or mixtures of allotropes.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the major allotropes of phosphorus.**\nPhosphorus is an element well-known for existing in multiple structural forms called allotropes. The principal and well-characterized allotropes are:\n*   White Phosphorus\n*   Red Phosphorus\n*   Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n*   Black Phosphorus\n*   Blue Phosphorus\n\n**Step 3: Determine the color of each *pure* allotrope.**\nWe need to be careful to identify the color of the allotrope in its pure state.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form and when protected from light, this allotrope is a colorless or **white**, waxy solid. It is commonly sold as \"yellow phosphorus,\" but this yellow hue is a result of surface degradation upon exposure to light, where it partially transforms into red phosphorus. Since the yellow color indicates a mixture of allotropes, it is not the color of a *pure* allotrope. Therefore, the color for pure white phosphorus is **white**.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymeric allotrope. As its name indicates, its characteristic color is **red**. The exact shade can range from orange-red to dark red depending on the preparation method and particle size, but the fundamental color is red.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** This is a crystalline, polymeric form of phosphorus, structurally distinct from amorphous red phosphorus. It has a distinct **violet** or purple hue.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus under standard conditions. It has a layered structure similar to graphite and is a **black**, flaky solid with a metallic luster.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, which exists as a single layer of atoms. Similar to other 2D materials, it has unique electronic and optical properties, and as its name suggests, it has a characteristic **blue** color.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct colors.**\nLet's list the distinct colors we have identified for the pure allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n1.  **White** (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  **Violet** (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n5.  **Blue** (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors, we arrive at a total of five.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the distinct, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus and their intrinsic colors in their pure state, we identify five unique colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
