    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the premise of the question\n\nThe question asks for the Modern English word for a female sibling if the historical interaction between the Norse (Vikings) and the Anglo-Saxons had not occurred between the 7th and 12th centuries. This requires us to understand the linguistic impact of this interaction on the specific word for \"sister\" and then trace the hypothetical evolution of the original English word without that external influence.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the etymology of the current word \"sister\"\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is not a direct descendant of the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.\n\n*   **Modern English:** sister\n*   **Origin:** Old Norse *systir*\n*   **Old English (Anglo-Saxon):** The native word was *sweostor*.\n*   **Conclusion:** Our current word \"sister\" is a loanword borrowed from Old Norse. It entered the language during the period of Viking settlement in England (the Danelaw) and eventually displaced the native word *sweostor* in most dialects, becoming the standard form we use today.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the word that would have evolved\n\nSince the Norse influence gave us \"sister\", we must ignore it and instead focus on the native Old English word: ***sweostor***. The question then becomes: how would *sweostor* have evolved into a Modern English word if it had followed the natural course of sound changes within the English language?\n\n### Step 4: Trace the likely evolution of *sweostor* from Old to Middle English\n\nWe can trace this evolution by looking at dialects of Middle English that were less influenced by Old Norse, particularly in the south and southwest of England. In these regions, the native word did survive for a time.\n\n*   **Old English:** *sweostor* (pronounced roughly 'sweh-os-tor')\n*   **Phonetic Changes:**\n    1.  **Vowel Change:** The diphthong `eo` in Old English often simplified in various ways. In the case of *sweostor*, it commonly became a short 'u' sound (/ʊ/, as in \"put\" or \"foot\").\n    2.  **Consonant Cluster Simplification:** The initial consonant cluster `sw-` was often simplified to `s-`. We see this in other words, such as Old English *swelc* becoming Middle English *sich* (Modern \"such\"), and the silent 'w' in \"sword\" and \"answer\" (from OE *andswaru*).\n*   **Resulting Middle English Form:** These changes led to the form ***suster***. This form is well-attested in Middle English literature from southern writers who were outside the area of heaviest Norse influence, including Chaucer and Wycliffe's Bible.\n\n### Step 5: Project the evolution of *suster* into Modern English\n\nNow we take the common Middle English form, *suster*, and apply the major sound changes that occurred between Middle and Modern English.\n\n*   **Middle English:** *suster* (pronounced roughly 'soos-ter' with the vowel of \"foot\")\n*   **The Great Vowel Shift:** This famous sound change primarily affected long vowels, so the short `u` (/ʊ/) in *suster* would not have been directly part of it.\n*   **The FOOT-STRUT Split:** This is the key sound change. Starting in the 17th century, the short /ʊ/ vowel split into two different sounds in most English accents. In words like \"put\" and \"foot,\" it remained /ʊ/. But in words like \"cup,\" \"luck,\" and \"strut,\" it unrounded and lowered to become the /ʌ/ vowel. *Suster* would almost certainly have followed this common path.\n*   **Final Pronunciation:** The pronunciation of *suster* would have changed from /'sʊstər/ to /'sʌstər/.\n*   **Final Spelling:** English spelling was standardized largely between the 16th and 18th centuries. Given that the spelling *suster* was already established in Middle English, it is the most likely form that would have been retained.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   This analysis assumes the southern Middle English form (*suster*) would have become the standard, which is highly likely as the London dialect (the basis for Standard English) was predominantly southern.\n*   The evolution from *sweostor* to *suster* is not just a guess; it is supported by historical evidence from Middle English texts.\n*   The final sound change from the vowel in \"foot\" to the vowel in \"strut\" is a regular and widespread feature in the history of English phonology.\n*   A comparison with other West Germanic languages supports this conclusion. The Dutch word is *zuster*, showing a very similar development path (though with a different vowel quality).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have naturally evolved through the Middle English form *suster*. Following standard English sound changes, this would have resulted in a Modern English word spelled **suster** and pronounced with the same vowel sound as \"cup\" or \"fun\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
