    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the equation for fixed points**\nA fixed point of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\nSo, we are looking for the maximum number of real solutions to the equation:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. We can write them as:\n$f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe leading term of $h(x)$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3 x^9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\nSince $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the constraints on the derivatives**\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n$f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$\n\nFor a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, it must be a parabola opening upwards ($A>0$) that does not cross the x-axis (discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$).\n1. For $f'(x) > 0$: We need $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$, and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0$.\n2. For $g'(x) > 0$: We need $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$, and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0$.\n\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ means $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\nThe condition $g'(x) > 0$ means $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\nThe composition of two strictly increasing functions is also strictly increasing. Let $h(x)=f(g(x))$, then its derivative is $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any $y$ (including $y=g(x)$) and $g'(x) > 0$, it follows that $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This confirms that $f(g(x))$ is strictly increasing.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the maximum of 9 is achievable**\nFor the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, Rolle's Theorem implies that its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have at least $9-1=8$ distinct real roots.\nLet's find $P'(x)$:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nWe need to check if the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ can have 8 distinct real roots, given the constraints on $f$ and $g$.\nLet's analyze the polynomial $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n- $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n- $f'(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n- The composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $\\text{deg}(f') \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n- Therefore, $Q(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation $P'(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $Q(x) = 1$. Since $Q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, the equation $Q(x)=1$ can have at most 8 real roots.\n\nSo, for $f(g(x))$ to have 9 fixed points, its derivative $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must be equal to 1 for 8 distinct values of $x$. This is theoretically possible for a degree-8 polynomial.\n\nWe need to argue that this is achievable for a polynomial of the form $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ with the given constraints.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $Q(x)$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\nThe leading term of $g'(x)$ is $3b_3x^2$ (with $b_3>0$).\nThe leading term of $g(x)$ is $b_3x^3$.\nThe leading term of $f'(y)$ is $3a_3y^2$ (with $a_3>0$).\nThe leading term of $f'(g(x))$ is $3a_3(b_3x^3)^2 = 3a_3b_3^2x^6$.\nThe leading term of $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is $(3a_3b_3^2x^6)(3b_3x^2) = 9a_3b_3^3x^8$.\nSince $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, the leading coefficient $9a_3b_3^3$ is positive.\n\nThis means $Q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 that tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. Such a polynomial can have up to 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. To have 8 distinct real roots for $Q(x)=1$, the horizontal line $y=1$ must be positioned between the local maxima and minima values. Specifically, the value 1 must be greater than all the local minimum values and less than all the local maximum values.\n\nThe coefficients of $f$ and $g$ provide enough degrees of freedom to control the positions and values of these extrema. By choosing appropriate functions $f$ and $g$ (for example, by making their derivatives have minima very close to zero and controlling the inflection points), it is possible to construct a function $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ that oscillates in a way that it intersects the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n\nSince there's no apparent contradiction, the maximum number of roots is indeed the degree of the polynomial equation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n1. The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n2. The degree of this polynomial is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n3. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n4. The constraints imposed on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are consistent with the scenario where the maximum of 9 roots is achieved. Specifically, the derivative of $f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 8, which can have the 8 distinct real roots required for $f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
