    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify Key Information\n*   **Board:** A standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Target Squares:** Only the \"edge squares\" of the board.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops.\n*   **Constraint:** The placed bishops cannot attack each other. This means no two bishops can be on the same diagonal.\n*   **Objective:** To place the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares under the given constraint.\n*   **Final Question:** How many edge squares would be empty (lack bishops) after achieving this objective?\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n1.  **Counting the Edge Squares:** An 8x8 board has four edges. The top row (rank 8), bottom row (rank 1), leftmost column (file 'a'), and rightmost column (file 'h').\n    *   There are 8 squares on the top row and 8 on the bottom row.\n    *   There are 8 squares on the left column and 8 on the right column.\n    *   To avoid double-counting the 4 corner squares, the total is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28. Alternatively, 8 (top) + 8 (bottom) + 6 (left side) + 6 (right side) = 28 edge squares.\n2.  **Bishop's Attack:** A bishop attacks along diagonals. A critical property is that bishops are color-bound. A bishop placed on a light-colored square can *only* attack other pieces on light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark square only threatens other dark squares.\n3.  **Independent Problems:** Because of the color-bound nature of bishops, the problem of placing bishops on light squares is completely independent of the problem of placing them on dark squares. We can solve for each color separately and combine the results.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Analysis for Light-Colored Squares**\n1.  **Count Light Edge Squares:** First, we need to count how many of the 28 edge squares are light-colored.\n    *   Each of the four edge rows/columns (rank 1, rank 8, file 'a', file 'h') has 4 light squares and 4 dark squares.\n    *   A direct count reveals there are **14 light-colored edge squares**.\n2.  **Maximize Bishops on Light Squares:** To maximize the number of non-attacking bishops, we need to identify the sets of squares that are on the same diagonals.\n    *   The 14 light edge squares form 7 distinct pairs of mutually attacking squares. For example, the corner square `a8` (light) is on the same diagonal as corner `h1` (light). You can only place a bishop on one of these two squares.\n    *   The pairs are: {a8, h1}, {c8, h3}, {e8, h5}, {g8, h7}, {a2, b1}, {a4, d1}, and {a6, f1}.\n    *   To place the maximum number of bishops, we must choose exactly one square from each of these 7 pairs.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on light-colored edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Analysis for Dark-Colored Squares**\n1.  **Count Dark Edge Squares:** The board is symmetrical. Of the 28 edge squares, if 14 are light, then the remaining **14 must be dark-colored**.\n2.  **Maximize Bishops on Dark Squares:** The situation is perfectly symmetrical to the light squares.\n    *   The 14 dark edge squares also form 7 distinct pairs of mutually attacking squares.\n    *   The pairs are: {a1, h8}, {c1, h6}, {e1, h4}, {g1, h2}, {a3, f8}, {a5, d8}, and {a7, b8}.\n    *   To place the maximum number of bishops, we must choose exactly one square from each of these 7 pairs.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on dark-colored edge squares is also **7**.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n1.  **Total Bishops Placed:** The total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the bishops on the light squares and the dark squares.\n    *   Total Bishops = 7 (on light squares) + 7 (on dark squares) = **14 bishops**.\n2.  **Calculate Empty Edge Squares:** The question asks for the number of edge squares that will lack a bishop.\n    *   Total Edge Squares = 28\n    *   Bishops Placed = 14\n    *   Empty Edge Squares = Total Edge Squares - Bishops Placed\n    *   Empty Edge Squares = 28 - 14 = **14**.\n\nThe two players succeeded in placing 14 bishops on the 28 edge squares, leaving 14 of those squares empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
