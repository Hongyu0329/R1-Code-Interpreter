    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the anatomical feature and the dinosaur species.**\nThe question focuses on a specific anatomical detail: the \"lacrimal recess\". This is a depression or cavity located in the lacrimal bone (a bone in front of the eye socket). The species is *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the authoritative scientific description.**\nTo find this specific detail, we must consult the primary paleontological literature that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most detailed and definitive description is based on the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022) and was published by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott in their 2002 paper, \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone in the key scientific paper.**\nIn the 2002 paper by Sues et al., the authors provide a detailed osteology (description of the bones) of the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they state the following:\n*   The side surface of the lacrimal has a large antorbital fossa (a major depression in front of the eye).\n*   Posterior to this fossa, there is a large, \"pocket-like\" cavity, which is the lacrimal recess.\n*   The critical sentence is: \"This lacrimal recess is subdivided by a thin vertical septum of bone into **two large pneumatic chambers**, an anterior and a posterior one.\"\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the findings.**\nThe \"pneumatic chambers\" described are air-filled cavities within the bone. In anatomical terms, these chambers are the \"depressions\" the question asks about. The scientific paper clearly states that the single lacrimal recess is divided internally into two such depressions or chambers.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm with other sources.**\nSubsequent research on spinosaurids corroborates this finding. For instance, the 2017 review by Sales and Schultz, \"Spinosaurid paleoecology and feeding habits: a review,\" also notes that \"The lacrimal recess, for instance, contains two large pneumatic chambers in *Irritator* and *Baryonyx*...\". This confirms the initial finding from the primary description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the definitive scientific literature describing the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*, its lacrimal recess is internally divided into two distinct depressions or chambers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
