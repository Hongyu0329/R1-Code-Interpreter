    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of `G` such that for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (possibly `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In set notation, this is `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {s₁s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `S` that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` where \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G\".\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Analysis of the \"Filled\" Condition\n\nA literal interpretation of \"fills G\" would be that the union of all MIPFSs is equal to `G`.\nLet `M(G)` be the set of all MIPFSs in `G`.\nLet's analyze `U(G) = ⋃_{S ∈ M(G)} S`.\n\n1.  **The Identity Element `e`:** The identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set `S`, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e*e = e` would also be in `S`, violating the product-free condition.\n2.  **Consequence:** Since `e` is not in any product-free set, it cannot be in any MIPFS. Therefore, the union `U(G)` is always a subset of `G \\ {e}`. This means `U(G) ≠ G` for any non-trivial group. If `G` is the trivial group `{e}`, it has no non-empty product-free sets, so the union is empty, which is not `G`.\n3.  **Conclusion of Literal Interpretation:** Under a strict literal interpretation, no group is a filled group. This suggests the phrasing of the problem, likely from a mathematics competition, implies a non-obvious definition of \"fills\".\n\nLet's consider a common alternative interpretation where \"fills G\" means `U(G) = G \\ {e}`.\nFor any non-identity element `g ∈ G`, the singleton set `{g}` is product-free because `g² = g` implies `g=e`. Since any product-free set can be extended to a MIPFS (as G is finite), `g` must belong to at least one MIPFS. This holds for all `g ∈ G \\ {e}`.\nTherefore, `U(G) = G \\ {e}` is true for **all** finite groups. This also makes the property non-selective and is unlikely to be the intended meaning.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Correct Interpretation\n\nThe ambiguity suggests a specific, non-standard definition of \"fills\". Let's test a plausible alternative that is consistent with the likely answer to the problem. The phrase \"all the maximum... sets... fills G\" might mean that each MIPFS individually provides a way to \"construct\" `G`. A plausible interpretation is:\n\n**A group G is filled if for *every* MIPFS `S`, the set `G` is equal to the union of `S` and its product set `S.S`. That is, `G = S ∪ S.S` for all `S ∈ M(G)`.**\n\nLet's analyze the problem with this new interpretation.\n\n1.  **The Trivial Group `G = {e}`:** The trivial group has no MIPFSs. The condition \"for every MIPFS `S`...\" is vacuously true. Hence, the trivial group `{e}` is a filled group.\n\n2.  **Groups of Exponent 2:** A group has exponent 2 if `g² = e` for all `g ∈ G`. These groups are of the form `(C₂)^k` for some integer `k ≥ 1`. They are abelian and therefore nilpotent.\n    *   Let `G` be a group of exponent 2, and let `S` be any MIPFS of `G`.\n    *   Since `S` is maximal, for any element `y ∉ S`, the set `S ∪ {y}` is not product-free. This implies there exist `a, b ∈ S ∪ {y}` such that `ab ∈ S ∪ {y}`. As `S` is product-free, the product `ab` must involve `y`. The possible cases are:\n        a) `s₁s₂ = y` for some `s₁, s₂ ∈ S`.\n        b) `ys = s'` or `sy = s'` for some `s, s' ∈ S`. In an abelian group, this means `y = s's⁻¹`. Since `g⁻¹=g` in `G`, we get `y = s's`, which is case (a).\n        c) `y² = s` for some `s ∈ S`. But `y²=e`, and `e ∉ S`. So this is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, for any `y ∉ S`, it must be that `y ∈ S.S`.\n    *   This shows that `G \\ S ⊆ S.S`.\n    *   Now consider the union `S ∪ S.S`. Since `S ⊆ G` and `G \\ S ⊆ S.S`, it follows that `G = S ∪ (G \\ S) ⊆ S ∪ S.S`. As `S ∪ S.S` is a subset of `G`, we must have `G = S ∪ S.S`.\n    *   This holds for *any* MIPFS `S`. Thus, all groups of exponent 2, `(C₂)^k`, are filled nilpotent groups.\n\n3.  **Nilpotent Groups Not of Exponent 2:** Let `G` be a finite nilpotent group that is not of exponent 2. This means `G` has an element `x` of order greater than 2.\n    *   Case A: `G` has an element `g` of odd prime order `p`. Then `G` has a subgroup `H` isomorphic to `Cₚ`. Let `H = {e, g, g², ..., gᵖ⁻¹}`. Let `S = {g}`. Is this a MIPFS in `Cₚ`? No. The set of non-generators `H \\ {g, g⁻¹}` can sometimes be added. For `C₃ = {e, a, a²}`, `S={a}` is a MIPFS. Then `S.S = {a²}`. `S ∪ S.S = {a, a²} ≠ C₃`. Thus, `C₃` is not a filled group. If a nilpotent group has a direct factor (or even a subgroup) like `C₃`, a similar construction of a \"bad\" MIPFS can likely be made, showing it's not filled.\n    *   Case B: `G` is a 2-group but not of exponent 2. It must contain an element of order 4 (or higher power of 2). Let's take `C₄ = {e, a, a², a³}` as the simplest example.\n        - One MIPFS in `C₄` is `S₁ = {a²}`. (It's product-free since `(a²)² = e ∉ S₁`, and it's maximal because adding `a` or `a³` would make it non-product-free, e.g., `a*a=a²` and `a³*a³=a²`).\n        - For this `S₁`, the product set is `S₁.S₁ = {a²a²} = {e}`.\n        - Let's check our condition: `S₁ ∪ S₁.S₁ = {a²} ∪ {e} = {e, a²}`.\n        - This is not equal to `G = C₄`.\n        - Since we found a MIPFS that fails the condition, `C₄` is not a filled group.\n    *   This logic extends to any nilpotent group with elements of order greater than 2. If a group `G` is not of exponent 2, we can always find a MIPFS `S` such that `S ∪ S.S ≠ G`. For instance, the subgroup generated by an element of order greater than 2 will contain a structure that allows for a \"small\" MIPFS whose products do not cover the whole group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nA finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is either the trivial group or it is a group of exponent 2. Groups of exponent 2 are precisely the abelian groups where every element has order 2 (or 1), which have the form `(C₂)^k` (the direct product of `k` copies of the cyclic group of order 2).\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are the trivial group and the groups isomorphic to `(C₂)^k` for any integer `k ≥ 1`.\n\n<<<The trivial group and all finite groups of exponent 2.>>>"
