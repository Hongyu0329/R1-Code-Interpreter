    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe core task is to identify which ballet step from the list begins and ends with the feet in the identical position (e.g., starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, and also ends in fifth position with the right foot in front).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** An `entrechat` is a jump involving beating the legs. The number specifies the movements. In an `entrechat six`, the legs perform six distinct movements (beats and openings) in the air. The rule for entrechats is that even-numbered ones (quatre, six, huit) always land in the same position from which they started. Odd-numbered ones (trois, cinq) land on one foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Same as the starting position. For example, starts 5th with right foot front, ends 5th with right foot front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The non-changing nature is a defining characteristic of an even-numbered entrechat.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This step involves an `échappé` (jump from a closed to an open position) with a beat (`battu`). The key term here is `changé`, which means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer closes the feet into the opposite fifth position from where they began.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term `changé` explicitly states that the ending position will be different from the starting one.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and \"assembles\" the legs together in the air to land on both feet in fifth position. There are different types:\n        *   `Assemblé dessus` (over): The working leg lands in front. This changes the feet.\n        *   `Assemblé dessous` (under): The working leg (starting from the back) lands in the back. This does **not** change the feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** It can be the same or different depending on the type of assemblé performed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because the single word `Assemblé` can refer to different types, its outcome isn't guaranteed without a modifier. However, a very common version of this step does fit the criteria.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** A `glissade` is a gliding, traveling step. `Derrière` means \"behind.\" The dancer glides the back foot out and then closes the front foot *behind* the other foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The feet change position (the front foot ends in the back).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term `derrière` specifies an action that causes the feet to change.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump, similar to a `pas de chat`, where each leg performs a `rond de jambe` (circular movement) in the air. In the standard execution, the leg that initiates the step closes back in the same position it started (e.g., if it started front, it closes front).\n    *   **Ending Position:** Typically the same as the starting position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While the standard form is non-changing, variations can exist.\n\n**3. Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the step that ends in the same position it starts.\n*   `Échappé battu changé` and `Glissade derrière` are incorrect because their names specify a change.\n*   `Assemblé` (specifically `dessous`) and `Gargouillade` (in its standard form) *can* end in the same position.\n*   `Entrechat six` *always* ends in the same position by its fundamental definition within the family of entrechat steps. The even number guarantees a return to the starting position.\n\nGiven the choices, **Entrechat six** is the most unambiguously and fundamentally correct answer. Its non-changing nature is not just a common variation but an inherent part of its identity and name.\n\n<<<A>>>"
