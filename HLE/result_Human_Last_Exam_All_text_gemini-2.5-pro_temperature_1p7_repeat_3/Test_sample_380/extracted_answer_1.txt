The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. Due to the Sun's rotation and the outward flow of the solar wind, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral. At 1 AU (the location of L1), the IMF typically makes an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction.

Therefore, calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of field-aligned AIC waves using magnetic components perpendicular to the *radial* direction is physically incorrect under typical conditions. Such a calculation would only be valid for the specific, and less common, case of a "radial IMF" event. A rigorous analysis requires transforming the magnetic field data into a local Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, where one axis is parallel to the local average magnetic field, and then calculating the helicity from the two components perpendicular to that field direction. Using a radial system otherwise leads to projection effects that distort the true polarization properties of the wave.
