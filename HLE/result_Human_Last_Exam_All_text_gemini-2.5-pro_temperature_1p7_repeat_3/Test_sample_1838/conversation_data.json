    "Of course. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to find the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Initial Parameters**\n\nThe goal is to find the central pixel on the line segment from the starting point (x1, y1) to the ending point (x2, y2).\n*   Start Point (x₁, y₁): (1, 1)\n*   End Point (x₂, y₂): (11, 5)\n\n**2. Calculate Deltas and Determine Driving Axis**\n\nWe first calculate the change in x and y to understand the line's slope and direction.\n*   **dx** = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   **dy** = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We compare the absolute values of `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` (10) > `dy` (4), the x-axis is the \"driving axis.\" This means that for every step, we will increment `x` by 1 and decide whether to increment `y`. The slope is less than 1.\n\n**3. Initialize Bresenham's Algorithm**\n\nWe need to calculate the initial decision parameter, `p`. For a line with a slope between 0 and 1, the formula is:\n*   **p = 2 * dy - dx**\n*   p₀ = (2 * 4) - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2\n\nThe algorithm starts at the first pixel (1, 1).\n\n**4. Iterate to Generate All Pixels**\n\nWe will loop `dx` times (10 times) to find the next 10 pixels. The rules for updating the decision parameter `p` and the coordinates are:\n*   If **p < 0**: The next pixel is (x+1, y). Update `p` with `p = p + (2 * dy)`.\n*   If **p ≥ 0**: The next pixel is (x+1, y+1). Update `p` with `p = p + (2 * dy) - (2 * dx)`.\n\nLet's trace the algorithm's execution, starting with the first pixel (1, 1) and initial p = -2.\n\n*   **Start:** Pixel is **(1, 1)**.\n\n*   **k=1:**\n    *   Current p = -2 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (1+1, 1) = **(2, 1)**.\n    *   Update p: p = -2 + (2 * 4) = -2 + 8 = 6.\n\n*   **k=2:**\n    *   Current p = 6 (which is ≥ 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (2+1, 1+1) = **(3, 2)**.\n    *   Update p: p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n\n*   **k=3:**\n    *   Current p = -6 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (3+1, 2) = **(4, 2)**.\n    *   Update p: p = -6 + 8 = 2.\n\n*   **k=4:**\n    *   Current p = 2 (which is ≥ 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (4+1, 2+1) = **(5, 3)**.\n    *   Update p: p = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n\n*   **k=5:**\n    *   Current p = -10 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (5+1, 3) = **(6, 3)**.\n    *   Update p: p = -10 + 8 = -2.\n\n*   **k=6:**\n    *   Current p = -2 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (6+1, 3) = **(7, 3)**.\n    *   Update p: p = -2 + 8 = 6.\n\n*   **k=7:**\n    *   Current p = 6 (which is ≥ 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (7+1, 3+1) = **(8, 4)**.\n    *   Update p: p = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n\n*   **k=8:**\n    *   Current p = -6 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (8+1, 4) = **(9, 4)**.\n    *   Update p: p = -6 + 8 = 2.\n\n*   **k=9:**\n    *   Current p = 2 (which is ≥ 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (9+1, 4+1) = **(10, 5)**.\n    *   Update p: p = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n\n*   **k=10:**\n    *   Current p = -10 (which is < 0).\n    *   Next pixel is (10+1, 5) = **(11, 5)**.\n    *   This is our final pixel.\n\n**5. Find the Central Pixel**\n\nFirst, let's list all the pixels we found in order:\n1.  (1, 1)\n2.  (2, 1)\n3.  (3, 2)\n4.  (4, 2)\n5.  (5, 3)\n6.  **(6, 3)**\n7.  (7, 3)\n8.  (8, 4)\n9.  (9, 4)\n10. (10, 5)\n11. (11, 5)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to find the total number of pixels to locate the center. The total number of pixels is `dx + 1` = 10 + 1 = 11.\n*   Since there is an odd number of pixels (11), there is a single, unique central pixel. Its position in the list is `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n\nLooking at our ordered list, the 6th pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{(6, 3)}$.\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
