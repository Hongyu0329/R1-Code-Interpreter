    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source material and specific episode.**\nThe question specifies the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\" and the exact episode, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the event within the episode.**\nThe question asks about the Junior prom, which is the main setting and event of this particular issue of Teen Girl Squad.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the key detail of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a *fictional singer* whose *cardboard cutout* performs at the prom. This means we are looking for a name mentioned in the cartoon, not a real-world singer, and we need to pay attention to the scene where the prom's musical guest is revealed.\n\n**Step 4: Recall or research the specific scene.**\nIn the episode, the Teen Girl Squad arrives at the Junior prom. They are excited to see the musical guest. The \"performance\" is revealed to be a simple cardboard cutout on the stage.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the dialogue that reveals the singer's name.**\nCheerleader looks at the stage and exclaims, \"Look! It's indie-rock crooner 'twice-over' Thompkins!\"\n\n**Step 6: Extract the name from the dialogue.**\nThe dialogue explicitly names the fictional singer as \"'twice-over' Thompkins\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The \"performer\" is not a live character, but specifically a cardboard cutout. This is a common type of joke in the series.\n*   The full name given is \"'twice-over' Thompkins\". The name \"Thompkins\" is likely a parody of musicians like Thom Yorke of Radiohead.\n*   The description \"indie-rock crooner\" provides context for the character's genre but is not part of his name.\n*   The character who says the name is Cheerleader.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer from the dialogue in the specified scene.\n\n<<<\"twice-over\" Thompkins>>>"
