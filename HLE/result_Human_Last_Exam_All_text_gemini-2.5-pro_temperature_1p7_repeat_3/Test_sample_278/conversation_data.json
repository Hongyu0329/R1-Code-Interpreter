    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two separate pieces based on the parameter `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   The parameter `b` is 1.\n    *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   This is the standard parametrization of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin. Squaring and adding the equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    *   Since $t$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$. This means this part of the curve traces the upper half of the unit circle.\n    *   Let's find the range of coordinates for this part:\n        *   The maximum value of $x = \\cos t$ is 1 (at $t=0$).\n        *   The minimum value of $x = \\cos t$ is -1 (at $t=\\pi$). So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   The maximum value of $y = \\sin t$ is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$).\n        *   The minimum value of $y = \\sin t$ is 0 (at $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$). So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   The parameter `b` is 5.\n    *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    *   We can write this as $x/1 = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives $(x/1)^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$.\n    *   This ellipse is centered at the origin, with a horizontal semi-axis of length 1 and a vertical semi-axis of length 5.\n    *   Since $t$ is in the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t < 0$. This means this part of the curve traces the lower half of the ellipse.\n    *   Let's find the range of coordinates for this part:\n        *   The range of $x = \\cos t$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ is $(-1, 1]$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   The maximum value of $y = 5\\sin t$ is close to 0 (as $t \\to \\pi$ or $t \\to 2\\pi$).\n        *   The minimum value of $y = 5\\sin t$ is $5 \\times (-1) = -5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$). So, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure**\n\nTo find the smallest enclosing square, we first need to determine the overall minimum and maximum coordinates of the entire figure by combining the ranges from both parts.\n\n*   **x-range:** The x-values for the entire figure range from the minimum of all x-values to the maximum of all x-values.\n    *   $x_{min} = \\min(-1, -1) = -1$.\n    *   $x_{max} = \\max(1, 1) = 1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **y-range:** The y-values for the entire figure range from the minimum of all y-values to the maximum of all y-values.\n    *   $y_{min} = \\min(0, -5) = -5$.\n    *   $y_{max} = \\max(1, 0) = 1$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is entirely contained within an axis-aligned rectangle defined by $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ and $-5 \\le y \\le 1$. This rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6.\n\n**Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square**\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest square that can enclose this figure. Any square that encloses the figure must also be able to enclose its bounding box (the $2 \\times 6$ rectangle we just found).\n\n*   Let the side length of the square be $S$.\n*   To enclose the rectangle, the side of the square must be at least as large as the rectangle's width and at least as large as its height.\n*   Therefore, $S \\ge 2$ and $S \\ge 6$.\n*   To satisfy both conditions, the smallest possible value for $S$ is the maximum of the two dimensions: $S = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nA square with a side length of 6 can indeed enclose the figure. For example, the square defined by $-3 \\le x \\le 3$ and $-5 \\le y \\le 1$ has a side length of 6 in the x-direction and 6 in the y-direction, and it contains our figure's bounding box.\n\n**Careful Point:** Does a rotated square allow for a smaller side length? The side length of any enclosing square (regardless of its orientation) must be at least the \"width\" of the shape. The width of our shape in the vertical direction is 6. This means the distance between any two parallel horizontal lines that bound the shape must be at least 6. If a square encloses the shape, the distance between its two parallel sides must be at least this width. Therefore, the side length of any enclosing square must be at least 6. Since we found an enclosing square with a side length of 6, this is the minimum possible side length.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe side length of the smallest enclosing square is $S=6$.\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = S^2$.\n\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$."
