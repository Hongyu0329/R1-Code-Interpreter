    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify which of the given peptides is known or highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor. Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Recognition Motif:** A crucial piece of knowledge in this context is the recognition sequence for many integrins. The tripeptide sequence Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid, or **RGD**, is the most famous and well-studied minimal recognition motif for a large subset of integrins.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. RGDMAA\n    *   B. RGDSPSS\n    *   C. RGDLTTP\n    *   D. RGDQVSK\n    *   E. RGDARGG\n\n    All five options contain the core RGD sequence. This indicates that the RGD motif alone is not the deciding factor. The specificity and affinity of binding are heavily influenced by the amino acids flanking the RGD core.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Role of Flanking Amino Acids:**\n    *   The conformation of the RGD sequence within a peptide is critical for its presentation to the integrin binding pocket. The surrounding amino acids dictate this conformation.\n    *   Specific sequences from natural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which are the native ligands for integrins, are known to be potent binders. The first RGD sequence identified as a cell attachment site was found in the ECM protein **fibronectin**.\n    *   The specific sequence in the cell-binding domain of human fibronectin is Gly-**Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro** (GRGDSP). Peptides containing the **RGDSP** motif are widely used in cell biology as competitive inhibitors of fibronectin binding to integrins, particularly α5β1 and αvβ3.\n    *   The proline (P) residue immediately C-terminal to the serine (S) is particularly important. It is known to induce a **β-turn conformation** in the peptide chain. This turn structure is thought to present the arginine and aspartic acid side chains in an optimal orientation and distance for high-affinity binding to the integrin receptor.\n\n5.  **Compare the Options to the Canonical Sequence:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** Does not contain the key residues (like S and P) from the fibronectin sequence.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the **RGDSP** motif derived from fibronectin. The presence of this specific, well-characterized sequence makes it an extremely strong candidate for integrin binding. It has been extensively validated in numerous *in vitro* assays to bind integrins and block cell adhesion. The additional \"SS\" at the end are common flanking residues in synthetic peptides and do not interfere with the core binding motif.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** While it contains a proline, its position and the surrounding residues (LTT) do not match the canonical high-affinity fibronectin motif.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** This sequence is not a known high-affinity motif from a major ECM protein.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** This sequence also lacks the specific conformational-directing residues found in the fibronectin motif.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the established biological literature, the peptide containing the **RGDSP** sequence from fibronectin is a classic and potent binder of integrin receptors. This sequence has been used as a standard positive control in countless *in vitro* binding and cell adhesion assays. Among the given choices, only peptide B (RGDSPSS) contains this well-documented, high-affinity binding motif.\n\n<<<B>>>"
