    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n2.  **System Matrices**: The given matrices are `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]` (the state matrix) and `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]` (the input matrix). This represents a system with 2 states and 2 inputs.\n3.  **Feedback Gain Matrix `F`**: Since there are 2 states (`n=2`) and 2 inputs (`m=2`), the gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`.\n4.  **Closed-Loop System**: The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A_cl = A + BF`. It is important to adhere to this form, which corresponds to a feedback law `u = Fx`. (Note: The more common control law `u = -Kx` would result in a closed-loop matrix `A - BK`).\n5.  **Desired Eigenvalues and Characteristic Polynomial**: The desired eigenvalues (poles) are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. The corresponding desired characteristic polynomial is:\n    `p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n    `p(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2 = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) + 1`\n    `p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n6.  **Method**: The eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. For a 2x2 matrix `M`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M) = 0`. We will find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl = A + BF` and equate its coefficients to the coefficients of the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n7.  **Degrees of Freedom**: We will be solving for the four elements of `F` (`f11, f12, f21, f22`). However, equating the characteristic polynomials yields only two equations (one for the `λ` coefficient and one for the constant term). This means the problem is underdetermined, and there is no unique solution for `F`. We can simplify the problem by assigning values to two of the elements of `F` (e.g., setting them to zero) to find one particular solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\n\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f11, f12; f21, f22] = [1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22; 1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22] = [f11 + 2f21, f12 + 2f22; f11, f12]`\n\nNext, calculate `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f11 + 2f21, f12 + 2f22; f11, f12]`\n`A_cl = [-1 + f11 + 2f21, 1 + f12 + 2f22; 1 + f11, f12]`\n\n**Step 2: Find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `λ^2 - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl) = 0`.\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2f21) + f12 = f11 + f12 + 2f21 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2f21)f12 - (1 + f12 + 2f22)(1 + f11)`\n\n**Step 3: Equate the coefficients with the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`**\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get two equations:\n1.  `-trace(A_cl) = 2`  => `-(f11 + f12 + 2f21 - 1) = 2` => `f11 + f12 + 2f21 = -1`\n2.  `det(A_cl) = 2`  => `(-1 + f11 + 2f21)f12 - (1 + f12 + 2f22)(1 + f11) = 2`\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations**\n\nSince there are two equations and four unknowns, we can find a particular solution by setting two variables to zero. Let's set `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nThe system of equations simplifies to:\n1.  `f11 + f12 = -1`\n2.  `(-1 + f11)f12 - (1 + f12)(1 + f11) = 2`\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express `f11` as `f11 = -1 - f12`.\nSubstitute this expression for `f11` into equation (2):\n`(-1 + (-1 - f12))f12 - (1 + f12)(1 + (-1 - f12)) = 2`\n`(-2 - f12)f12 - (1 + f12)(-f12) = 2`\n`(-2f12 - f12^2) - (-f12 - f12^2) = 2`\n`-2f12 - f12^2 + f12 + f12^2 = 2`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nNow, substitute `f12 = -2` back into the expression for `f11`:\n`f11 = -1 - f12 = -1 - (-2) = 1`\n\n**Step 5: State the final gain matrix `F`**\n\nWith `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, and `f22 = 0`, the resulting state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\nThis is one possible solution.\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
