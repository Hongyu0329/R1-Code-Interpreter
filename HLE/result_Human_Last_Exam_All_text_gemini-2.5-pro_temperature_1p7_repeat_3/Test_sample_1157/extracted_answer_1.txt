The appropriate management begins with an **urgent referral to a physician** to control her diabetes mellitus, as an HbA1c of 7.5% poses a high risk for infection and poor healing. Emergency dental care involves cleaning the wound, ruling out alveolar fractures via radiographs, and prescribing antibiotics and analgesics.

The definitive and most appropriate long-term treatment is a **removable partial denture**. A fixed bridge is contraindicated due to the long span and unfavorable forces from her Skeletal Class III profile (SNB 88Â°). Implants are a high-risk option due to the uncontrolled diabetes and complex occlusion.

The **cells of interest** in the healing process are **platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts**. The function of immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages is compromised by uncontrolled diabetes.

If a denture is chosen, the recommended type is a **Cast Partial Denture** with a **Chromium-Cobalt alloy framework** and **acrylic** teeth and base. The **abutment teeth** would be:
*   **#25 (Left Second Premolar)** and **#21 (Left Central Incisor)** as the primary abutments adjacent to the gap, providing direct support and retention.
*   **#16 or #17 (Right First or Second Molar)** as a secondary abutment to provide crucial **cross-arch stabilization and indirect retention**, preventing damaging rotational forces and ensuring the longevity and stability of the prosthesis.
