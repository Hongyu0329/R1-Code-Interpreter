The expression for the z-component of the magnetic field is given by the sum of the applied field and the induced field from the stack. For a point $(x, z)$ satisfying $|x| \gg w$:
$H_z(x, z) = H_a - \frac{\pi^2 H_0 (w^2 - a^2)}{D^2} \frac{\cosh(\frac{2\pi x}{D})\cos(\frac{2\pi z}{D})-1}{\left(\cosh(\frac{2\pi x}{D}) - \cos(\frac{2\pi z}{D})\right)^2}$
The position of the flux front, $a$, depends on the applied field $H_a$ according to the expression:
$a = \frac{D}{\pi} \arcsin\left[ \sin\left(\frac{\pi w}{D}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{H_a}{H_0}\right) \right]$
