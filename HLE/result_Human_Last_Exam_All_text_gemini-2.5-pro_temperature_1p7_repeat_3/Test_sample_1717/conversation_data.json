    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. According to the game's data, for a single player in Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of **3,640 HP**.\n\n2.  **Understand the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer, and the scaling is more significant in Expert Mode. The health calculation involves a multiplier applied to the base health. This multiplier is determined by two factors:\n    *   **Per-Player Bonus:** The health multiplier increases by `0.35` (or 35%) for each player in the game beyond the first one. This can be expressed as `0.35 * (N_total - 1)`, where `N_total` is the total number of players.\n    *   **Eligible Player Bonus:** There is an additional bonus for each player who meets certain criteria (specifically, having more than 200 maximum health and more than 10 defense). For the Eye of Cthulhu, this bonus is `0.30` (or 30%) per eligible player. This can be expressed as `0.30 * N_eligible`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Full Health Equation:**\n    To find the total health, we multiply the base health by a total multiplier, which starts at 1 (for the first player) and includes both bonuses.\n    `Total Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (N_total - 1) + 0.30 * N_eligible`\n\n    The question asks for the *theoretical maximum* health. To achieve this, we must assume that every player is an \"eligible\" player to maximize the bonus. Therefore, we set `N_eligible = N_total`. Let's use the variable `N` to represent the number of players.\n\n    The health formula becomes:\n    `Health(N) = 3,640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1) + 0.30 * N)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    Let's simplify the multiplier part of the equation:\n    `Multiplier(N) = 1 + 0.35N - 0.35 + 0.30N`\n    `Multiplier(N) = 0.65 + 0.65N`\n\n    So, the simplified health equation is:\n    `Health(N) = 3,640 * (0.65 + 0.65N)`\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question specifies an \"infinite number of players\". Mathematically, this means we need to evaluate the limit of the `Health(N)` function as `N` approaches infinity.\n    `lim (N → ∞) [3,640 * (0.65 + 0.65N)]`\n\n    Since `Health(N)` is a linear function of `N` with a positive coefficient, the health value increases without bound as `N` increases. The mathematical limit is **infinity**.\n\n6.  **Incorporate the \"According to the Source Code\" Constraint:**\n    An answer of \"infinity\" is not a finite number that a computer can store. The phrase \"According to the source code\" is a crucial hint that we must consider the technical limitations of the game's implementation. In Terraria's code, the health of an NPC (Non-Player Character) is stored in a variable, `NPC.lifeMax`. This variable is a **32-bit signed integer** (an `int` in C#).\n\n7.  **Determine the Technical Maximum:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer can only store values within a specific range. The maximum positive value it can hold is `2^31 - 1`. If a calculation results in a number larger than this, it will cause an \"integer overflow,\" leading to incorrect (often negative) values. Therefore, the highest possible health the game can theoretically assign to any NPC is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n    Calculating this value:\n    `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula for the Eye of Cthulhu would mathematically lead to infinite health with infinite players, the game's source code imposes a hard limit based on the data type used to store the health value. The theoretical maximum health is therefore capped at the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
