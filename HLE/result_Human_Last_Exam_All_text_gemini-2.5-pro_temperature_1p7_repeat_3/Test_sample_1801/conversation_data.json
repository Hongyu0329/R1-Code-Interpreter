    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   The commercial was for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was part of a campaign from the year 2000.\n    *   The campaign's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** In 2000, Enron launched a high-profile, expensive advertising campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The goal was to rebrand Enron from a simple energy pipeline company to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation dealing in complex markets like bandwidth, weather derivatives, and risk management. The commercials featured intellectuals and thinkers discussing abstract concepts.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** We need to find a list of the people who were featured in this specific ad campaign and then check their credentials as Nobel laureates. The campaign featured several notable individuals. By searching for the cast or featured people in the \"Enron Ask Why commercial,\" we can find the names.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Candidate:** One of the most frequently mentioned participants is **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   **Was he in the commercial?** Yes, Krugman, then an MIT professor, appeared in a spot discussing the exponential growth of bandwidth.\n    *   **Is he a Nobel laureate?** Yes, Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is important to note that at the time the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman had *not yet* won the Nobel Prize. However, the question asks which two Nobel laureates *were* featured, and he fits this description as he is one now.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Candidate:** Another prominent economist featured in the campaign was **Merton Miller**.\n    *   **Was he in the commercial?** Yes, Miller, then a professor at the University of Chicago, appeared in a spot discussing the concept of risk.\n    *   **Is he a Nobel laureate?** Yes, Merton Miller was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Unlike Krugman, Merton Miller *was already* a Nobel laureate at the time he appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial, having won the prize a decade earlier.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The two individuals who appeared in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and are also Nobel laureates are Paul Krugman and Merton Miller. Both were Nobel Memorial Prize winners in Economic Sciences, though only Miller held the title at the time the ad aired. The campaign became infamous due to Enron's spectacular collapse into scandal and bankruptcy just a year later in 2001, making the ads' high-minded tone deeply ironic in retrospect.\n\n***\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
