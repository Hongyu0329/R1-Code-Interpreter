    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the user's query into key elements.**\nTo find the correct film, we must identify one that meets all of the following criteria:\n1.  It must be a Hollywood feature film.\n2.  It must be produced by a major film studio.\n3.  The scene must feature a character who is a teenager.\n4.  This teenager must be riding a pink bike.\n5.  This teenager must pedal the bike directly toward an oncoming car (or similar large vehicle).\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate common but incorrect suggestions.**\nSeveral films feature iconic bike scenes, but they do not match all the criteria.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** While it features a famous bike, the character is an adult man-child, not a teenager, and the bike is red, not pink.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** The character is a child, not a teenager, the bike is not pink, and he flies over the roadblock, not into it.\n*   ***Better Off Dead...* (1985):** The main character is a teenager, but the memorable scenes do not involve him on a pink bike riding toward a car.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** The central item is a pink car, not a pink bike.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the genre.**\nThe action of pedaling directly toward an oncoming vehicle is extremely dramatic and dangerous. This suggests the scene might occur in a genre that embraces surreal, heightened, or horrific situations, such as a horror film or a dark comedy.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise.**\nThis horror series is well-known for its surreal and inventive dream-based death scenes. Let's examine the later films in the series, which became progressively more bizarre.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the specific film and scene.**\nThe film that precisely matches all the criteria is **\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\" (1991)**.\n*   **Hollywood Feature Film / Major Studio:** It was produced and distributed by New Line Cinema, which at the time was a major and highly successful studio, particularly in the horror genre.\n*   **Teenager:** The scene involves a character named Carlos, a troubled teenager at a youth shelter who has a hearing impairment.\n*   **Pink Bike:** In his death scene, which takes place in a dream, Freddy Krueger torments Carlos. He transforms Carlos's motorcycle into a small, bright pink child's tricycle.\n*   **Pedals Toward an Oncoming Car:** Freddy uses a chalk-board-scraping sound to torture Carlos through his hearing aid. In his agony, Carlos loses control and is shown pedaling the pink tricycle straight into the path of an oncoming truck, which is being driven by Freddy.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\nThe scene from \"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\" is the only one that matches every specific detail mentioned in the question: a major studio Hollywood horror film where a teenager (Carlos) rides a pink bike (a tricycle in a dream) and pedals it directly toward an oncoming vehicle (a truck driven by Freddy).\n\n<<<Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare>>>"
