The post-reset covariance Σ' is computed from the pre-reset covariance Σ and the pre-reset attitude deviation estimate δ_est using the following expression:
Σ' = R(δ_est) * J_r(δ_est) * Σ * J_r(δ_est)^T * R(δ_est)^T

where:
- R(δ_est) is the rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation vector δ_est, given by the matrix exponential R(δ_est) = exp(hat(δ_est)).
- J_r(δ_est) is the right Jacobian of the SO(3) group evaluated at δ_est.
- Σ is the pre-reset covariance matrix of the attitude deviation.
