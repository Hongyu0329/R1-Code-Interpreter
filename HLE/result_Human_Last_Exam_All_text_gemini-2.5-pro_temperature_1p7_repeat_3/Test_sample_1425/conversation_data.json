    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir. The reservoir is characterized by a temperature $T$ (or inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/k_B T$) and a chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, $Z$, for a system with a Hamiltonian $K$ and particle number operator $N$ is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(K - \\mu N)} \\right]$\nHere, the trace (Tr) is taken over the entire Fock space, which includes states with all possible particle numbers. The operator $H_{GC} = K - \\mu N$ is often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem states that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. In the context of the grand canonical partition function, the \"Hamiltonian\" usually refers to the part of the energy operator independent of the chemical potential term, which we denoted as $K$. Therefore, we identify:\n$K = \\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nNow we substitute this specific $K$ into the general formula for the grand canonical partition function $Z$:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(K - \\mu N)} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta((-\\mu N) - \\mu N)} \\right]$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu N)} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu N} \\right]$\n\nOur task is to evaluate this expression using the path integral formalism. This is equivalent to finding the partition function for an effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff} = -2\\mu N$.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Path Integral Action**\n\nThe partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta H_{eff}}]$ can be expressed as a functional integral over fields $\\psi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\psi^*(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is imaginary time ($0 \\le \\tau \\le \\beta$):\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nThe Euclidean action $S_E$ is given by:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi + \\mathcal{H}_{eff})$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{eff}$ is the Hamiltonian density corresponding to $H_{eff} = -2\\mu N$.\n\nThe particle number operator $N$ is the spatial integral of the number density operator $n = \\psi^*\\psi$. So, $N = \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*\\psi$.\nThe effective Hamiltonian density is $\\mathcal{H}_{eff} = -2\\mu \\psi^*\\psi$.\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi - 2\\mu \\psi^* \\psi)$\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^* (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Notice that the action lacks a spatial derivative term (like $\\nabla^2$). This is because the given Hamiltonian $H=-\\mu N$ contains no kinetic energy term, meaning the energy of a particle is independent of its momentum.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, so the path integral is Gaussian. The result of a Gaussian path integral is given by the determinant of the operator in the action.\n$Z \\propto [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^{-s}$\nwhere $s=1$ for bosons (commuting fields) and $s=-1$ for fermions (anti-commuting fields).\n\nTo evaluate the determinant, we find the eigenvalues of the operator $\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu$. The operator acts on the space of functions on the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$ with appropriate boundary conditions. The fields are expanded in a basis of single-particle states (e.g., momentum eigenstates indexed by $k$). Since the operator is diagonal in this basis, the total determinant is a product over all modes $k$:\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k$\n\nFor each mode $k$, we need to evaluate the determinant of the operator $\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu$ acting on the time-dependent part of the field. The eigenvalues of the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ are given by $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n$ are the Matsubara frequencies.\n*   **For Bosons**, the fields are periodic in $\\tau$, so $\\psi(\\beta) = \\psi(0)$. This leads to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ for integer $n$.\n*   **For Fermions**, the fields are anti-periodic, $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$. This leads to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi / \\beta$ for integer $n$.\n\nThe determinant for a single mode $k$ is the product of its eigenvalues: $\\det_k(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) = \\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$.\n\nThis infinite product can be evaluated using standard techniques, yielding a well-known result:\n*   **For Bosons:** $\\det_B(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\propto 1 - e^{-2\\beta\\mu}$\n*   **For Fermions:** $\\det_F(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\propto 1 + e^{-2\\beta\\mu}$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is getting the sign in the exponent wrong. The path integral for the grand canonical partition function for a system with single particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ and chemical potential $\\mu_{eff}$ yields $Z_B = \\prod_k (1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k-\\mu_{eff})})^{-1}$ and $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k-\\mu_{eff})})$. Our effective problem corresponds to $\\epsilon_k=0$ and an effective chemical potential of $\\mu_{eff}=2\\mu$. Plugging this in gives $e^{-\\beta(0-2\\mu)} = e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nWe now assemble the results for the partition function $Z_k$ for each mode $k$.\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $Z_k = [\\det_B(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^{-1} \\propto (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$\n    The total partition function is the product over all single-particle states $k$:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n    (This is physically meaningful for $\\mu < 0$ to ensure convergence).\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $Z_k = \\det_F(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\propto 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n    The total partition function is:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\nThe answer should encompass both possibilities since the particle statistics are not specified.\n\n---\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe problem is to find the grand canonical partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(H - \\mu N)}]$ for a system with Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu N$.\nThe operator in the trace is $e^{-\\beta(-\\mu N - \\mu N)} = e^{2\\beta \\mu N}$.\nThe path integral corresponds to an effective system with single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k=0$ and effective chemical potential $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\mu$.\nThe standard path integral result for the partition function is $Z = \\prod_k [1 - s \\cdot e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu_{eff})}]^{-s}$, where $s=1$ for bosons and $s=-1$ for fermions.\nSubstituting $\\epsilon_k=0$ and $\\mu_{eff}=2\\mu$:\n$Z = \\prod_k [1 - s \\cdot e^{-\\beta(0 - 2\\mu)}]^{-s} = \\prod_k [1 - s \\cdot e^{2\\beta\\mu}]^{-s}$.\n\nFor Bosons ($s=1$): $Z_B = \\prod_k [1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}]^{-1}$.\nFor Fermions ($s=-1$): $Z_F = \\prod_k [1 - (-1) \\cdot e^{2\\beta\\mu}]^{-(-1)} = \\prod_k [1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}]^{1}$.\n\nThese are the final results.\n\n<<<The partition function depends on the statistics of the particles. The product is over all single-particle states, indexed by $k$.\nFor a system of bosons:\n$Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nFor a system of fermions:\n$Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$>>>"
