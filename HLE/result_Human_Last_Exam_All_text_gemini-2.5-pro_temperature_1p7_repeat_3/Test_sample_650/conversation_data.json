    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Function:**\n    The algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and computes the representation of `n` in that base. It does this by repeatedly taking the input number, dividing it by the base `c`, and recording the remainder as a digit. The quotient from the division then becomes the new number for the next iteration. This process continues until the quotient becomes zero.\n    *   For example, if `n=13` and `c=2`:\n        *   `13 mod 2 = 1` (`a_0`) -> Quotient is `6`\n        *   `6 mod 2 = 0` (`a_1`) -> Quotient is `3`\n        *   `3 mod 2 = 1` (`a_2`) -> Quotient is `1`\n        *   `1 mod 2 = 1` (`a_3`) -> Quotient is `0`. The algorithm stops.\n        *   The result is `(1101)_2`.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Cost of Each Step:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        This step consists of a few assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. Assuming these basic arithmetic operations take constant time, the complexity of this step is O(1).\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** This is the core of the algorithm. We need to analyze the cost of the loop body and the number of times the loop executes.\n        *   **Loop Body (Step 2.1):** `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n          Similar to Step 1, the operations inside the loop (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction) are all considered to take constant time, O(1).\n        *   **Number of Iterations:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`.\n            *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   In the first iteration, the value of `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. This is roughly `n/c²`.\n            *   In the second iteration, the new `q` will be roughly `n/c³`.\n            *   In general, after `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be approximately `n / c^(k+1)`.\n            *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when the value being divided by `c` (`x` in the loop body) is less than `c`. This occurs after `n` has been divided by `c` a number of times until the result is less than 1.\n            *   Let `k` be the number of times the loop runs. This corresponds to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`, minus one (since the first digit, `a_0`, is calculated before the loop).\n            *   The number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `d = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `d-1 = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n            *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. For a large `n`, the number of iterations is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of each part of the algorithm.\n    *   Time(Total) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n    *   Time(Step 2) = (Number of Iterations) × (Time of Loop Body)\n    *   Time(Total) = O(1) + ( O(log_c(n)) × O(1) ) + O(1)\n    *   Time(Total) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)\n    *   The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Final Complexity Expression:**\n    The computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`. According to the change of base formula for logarithms (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), and since `c` is a constant `(c ≥ 2)`, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, we can ignore constant factors. Therefore, the complexity can also be written as `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Cost of Arithmetic Operations:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers the size of `n` or smaller can be performed in constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption in algorithm analysis unless multi-precision arithmetic is specified, where the cost of operations would depend on the number of bits in the operands.\n2.  **Input Value vs. Input Size:** The complexity is expressed in terms of the value of the input `n`. Often, complexity is expressed in terms of the \"size\" of the input, which for a number `n` would be the number of bits required to represent it, i.e., `k = log_2(n)`. In this case, the complexity `O(log n)` is linear in the size of the input (`O(k)`), which signifies an efficient algorithm.\n3.  **Logarithm Base:** In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm is typically omitted because a change of base only introduces a constant multiplicative factor, which is absorbed by the O-notation. Thus `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n4.  **Edge Cases:** The analysis holds for edge cases. For `n=0`, `q` is initially 0, the loop is skipped, and the algorithm correctly returns `(0)`. The time taken is O(1), which is consistent with the `O(log n)` bound (considering `n+1` for the logarithm).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final time complexity is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
