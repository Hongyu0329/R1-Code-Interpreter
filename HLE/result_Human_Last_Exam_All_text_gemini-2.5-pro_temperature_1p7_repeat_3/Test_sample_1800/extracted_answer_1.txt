The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for maximizing catalytic performance depends on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.4. For thermochemical water splitting (WS), a higher ratio in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 is generally ideal.
