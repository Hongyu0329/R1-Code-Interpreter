    "This question asks to identify the most likely mechanism responsible for keeping duplicated genes in a genome (retention) and for them to become different from each other (divergence). Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding Gene Duplication and its Fates:** When a gene is duplicated, the organism has two copies of the same gene. One copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function. This makes the second copy redundant and less constrained by selective pressure, allowing it to accumulate mutations. The most common fates are:\n    *   **Loss (Pseudogenization):** The duplicate copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. This is the most frequent outcome.\n    *   **Retention:** The duplicate copy is preserved in the genome due to some selective advantage. The question focuses on mechanisms leading to this outcome.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"corrected\" or replaced by the sequence of the other copy. This process leads to homogenization (making the genes more similar), which is the opposite of divergence. Therefore, it does not explain the divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional. While it represents divergence of a sort (one functional, one non-functional), it is fundamentally a mechanism of gene *loss*, not the *retention* of two functional, divergent genes. The question asks for a mechanism that explains retention.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy retains the ancestral function, while the other accumulates mutations that lead to a completely new function. This new function provides a selective advantage, leading to the *retention* of the second copy. The development of a new function inherently means the gene sequences have *diverged*. This is a valid and important mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times (i.e., it had multiple \"subfunctions\"). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, causing each to lose a different subfunction. For example, copy 1 loses subfunction B but retains A, while copy 2 loses subfunction A but retains B. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's roles. This creates strong selection for the *retention* of both copies. This partitioning of functions is a form of *divergence*.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism of gene evolution at the molecular level. It operates on the level of species and populations.\n\n3.  **Comparing Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization:**\n    *   Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain both the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   The question asks for the \"*most likely*\" mechanism. This requires comparing their relative probabilities.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare event: a beneficial gain-of-function mutation must occur in the redundant copy before it's silenced by a much more common loss-of-function mutation (pseudogenization).\n    *   **Subfunctionalization**, in contrast, is driven by the very common loss-of-function mutations. It provides a passive \"ratchet-like\" mechanism. As soon as the two copies have lost complementary subfunctions by chance, selection locks them both in, preventing their loss.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization relies on more frequent types of mutations (loss-of-function) and does not require the immediate evolution of a new beneficial function, many scientists believe it is a more common and thus \"*more likely*\" route for the initial preservation of duplicate genes from pseudogenization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a robust and common mechanism for preserving duplicate genes by making them both indispensable, thereby allowing them to be retained and to diverge. It is often considered a more probable initial fate for duplicates than the rarer event of neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
