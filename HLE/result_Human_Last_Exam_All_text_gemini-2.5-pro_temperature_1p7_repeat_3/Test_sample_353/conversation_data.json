    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The BDF4 Method Formula:**\n    The k-step Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) is defined by its first characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j} \\xi^{k-j}(\\xi-1)^j$. For BDF4 (k=4), we have:\n    $\\rho(\\xi) = \\xi^3(\\xi-1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\xi^2(\\xi-1)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\xi(\\xi-1)^3 + \\frac{1}{4}(\\xi-1)^4$\n    Expanding and collecting terms gives:\n    $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    The second characteristic polynomial is $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$.\n\n2.  **The Stability Region Boundary:**\n    The region of absolute stability is determined by applying the method to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. The characteristic equation for the method is $\\rho(\\xi) - z \\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $z=h\\lambda$. The boundary of the stability region is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which this equation has a root on the unit circle, i.e., $\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n    Solving for $z$, we get the boundary curve:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})} = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{e^{i4\\theta}} = e^{-i4\\theta} \\left(\\frac{25}{12}e^{i4\\theta} - 4e^{i3\\theta} + 3e^{i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$\n\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability:**\n    A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the infinite wedge $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. This is equivalent to the region of instability not intruding into this wedge. For BDF methods with $k>2$, the region of instability is a bounded lobe. For BDF4, this lobe is in the left half-plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to this lobe. The angle of this ray, $\\phi$, defines the boundary of the stability wedge, so $\\phi = \\pi - \\alpha$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Tangent Point:**\n    To find the point of tangency on the lobe, a common approach (as described in numerical analysis literature, e.g., Hairer & Wanner) is to find the point on the boundary where the real part is at a minimum, i.e., where the tangent to the curve is vertical. This is found by solving $\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\text{Re}(z(\\theta)) = 0$.\n    Let $x(\\theta) = \\text{Re}(z(\\theta))$.\n    $x(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4\\cos\\theta + 3\\cos(2\\theta) - \\frac{4}{3}\\cos(3\\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(4\\theta)$\n    Differentiating with respect to $\\theta$:\n    $x'(\\theta) = 4\\sin\\theta - 6\\sin(2\\theta) + 4\\sin(3\\theta) - \\sin(4\\theta)$\n    Using trigonometric identities (e.g., $\\sin(n\\theta) = \\text{Im}((\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta)^n)$) and setting $c=\\cos\\theta, s=\\sin\\theta$:\n    $x'(\\theta) = 4s - 6(2sc) + 4(3s-4s^3) - (4sc(2c^2-1))$\n    $= 4s - 12sc + 12s(1-c^2) - 4sc(2c^2-1) = s[4-12c+12-12c^2 - 8c^3+4c] = s[-8c^3-12c^2-8c+16]$ This is getting complicated, let's simplify the sum of sines directly.\n    Factor out $\\sin\\theta$:\n    $x'(\\theta) = 4\\sin\\theta - 12\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + 4\\sin\\theta(4\\cos^2\\theta-1) - 4\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta(2\\cos^2\\theta-1)$\n    Setting $x'(\\theta) = 0$ and assuming $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$ (as $\\theta=0$ gives $z=0$, the cusp of the lobe):\n    $4 - 12\\cos\\theta + 4(4\\cos^2\\theta-1) - 4\\cos\\theta(2\\cos^2\\theta-1) = 0$\n    Let $c = \\cos\\theta$:\n    $4 - 12c + 16c^2 - 4 - (8c^3 - 4c) = 0$\n    $-8c^3 + 16c^2 - 8c = 0$\n    $-8c(c^2 - 2c + 1) = 0$\n    $-8c(c-1)^2 = 0$\n    The non-trivial solutions (since $c=1$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$) is $c = \\cos\\theta = 0$. This gives $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Tangent Point's Coordinates:**\n    We evaluate $z(\\theta)$ at $\\theta = \\pi/2$:\n    $e^{-i\\pi/2} = -i$\n    $e^{-i2(\\pi/2)} = e^{-i\\pi} = -1$\n    $e^{-i3(\\pi/2)} = i$\n    $e^{-i4(\\pi/2)} = e^{-i2\\pi} = 1$\n    $z(\\pi/2) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4(-i) + 3(-1) - \\frac{4}{3}(i) + \\frac{1}{4}(1)$\n    $z(\\pi/2) = \\left(\\frac{25}{12} - 3 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + i\\left(4 - \\frac{4}{3}\\right)$\n    $z(\\pi/2) = \\left(\\frac{25 - 36 + 3}{12}\\right) + i\\left(\\frac{12 - 4}{3}\\right)$\n    $z(\\pi/2) = -\\frac{8}{12} + i\\frac{8}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3} + i\\frac{8}{3}$\n    This is the point of tangency in the upper half-plane.\n\n6.  **Determine the Angle $\\alpha$:**\n    The ray from the origin to this point $z_t = -2/3 + i(8/3)$ is tangent to the stability lobe. The argument of this point is $\\phi = \\arg(z_t)$.\n    $\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{\\text{Im}(z_t)}{\\text{Re}(z_t)} = \\frac{8/3}{-2/3} = -4$.\n    Since the point is in the second quadrant ($\\text{Re}<0, \\text{Im}>0$), its argument is $\\phi = \\arctan(-4) + \\pi = \\pi - \\arctan(4)$.\n    The boundary of the A($\\alpha$)-stability wedge is given by the ray with angle $\\pi - \\alpha$. We equate this to $\\phi$:\n    $\\pi - \\alpha = \\phi = \\pi - \\arctan(4)$\n    $-\\alpha = -\\arctan(4)$\n    $\\alpha = \\arctan(4)$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is $\\arctan(4)$.\n\n<<<arctan(4)>>>"
