Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon is a consequence of the molecule's geometry, which creates a double-well potential for the nitrogen atom, and the principles of quantum mechanics that allow a particle to pass through a finite energy barrier. These factors (particle masses and electrostatic forces creating the potential) are unchanged in the exotic molecule. The change in nuclear spin from 1/2 (fermion) to 0 (boson) only alters the symmetry requirements for the total molecular wavefunction due to the Pauli principle. This change affects which rotational-vibrational energy levels are allowed to exist, but it does not eliminate the underlying tunneling mechanism itself.
