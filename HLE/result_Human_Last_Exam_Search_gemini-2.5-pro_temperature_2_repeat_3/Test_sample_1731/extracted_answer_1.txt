In summary, the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of photons demonstrates that the equilibrium state is the one of maximum entropy and is characterized by a mean energy derived from the Planck distribution. The equilibrium value of entropy is the maximized statistical entropy (`S = k_B ln(W)` evaluated for the Bose-Einstein distribution), and the equilibrium mean energy `<E>` is that given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. These large deviation theorems provide a rigorous probabilistic foundation for the well-established results of Bose-Einstein statistical mechanics.
