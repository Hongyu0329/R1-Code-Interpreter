    "Using the framework of large deviation theory (LDT), the equilibrium properties of a system can be derived from fundamental probabilistic principles. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems are central to this approach, establishing that the equilibrium state of a system, such as a Bose gas of photons, is its most probable macroscopic state.\n\n### **Connection between Large Deviations and Thermodynamics**\n\nIn statistical mechanics, large deviation theorems provide a rigorous foundation for the thermodynamic principle that isolated systems evolve to a state of maximum entropy. Thermodynamic potentials like entropy are identified as rate functions within large deviation theory, which quantify the exponential decay in the probability of a system's macroscopic properties deviating from their mean values.\n\nThe equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of the large deviation rate function, as this represents the most probable, or \"least unlikely,\" configuration.\n\n### **Equilibrium Entropy from the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the large deviations of an empirical measure, which, in a physical context, is the macroscopic distribution of particles across available states (the macrostate). The theorem demonstrates that the probability of observing a particular macrostate is exponentially related to the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between that macrostate's distribution and the underlying single-particle distribution.\n\nFor a Bose gas of photons, the key insights are:\n*   The rate function in Sanov's theorem is the relative entropy.\n*   Minimizing this rate function to find the most probable macrostate is equivalent to the principle of maximizing the thermodynamic entropy.\n*   This procedure, known as Boltzmann's method, involves finding the distribution of particles (`N_j`) across energy levels (`Îµ_j`) that maximizes the number of microscopic arrangements (`W`). The entropy is given by Boltzmann's formula, `S = k_B ln(W)`.\n\nFor bosons, this maximization under the constraint of a fixed total energy leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number of each state. The equilibrium entropy is the value of `S` calculated with this distribution.\n\n### **Equilibrium Mean Energy from the Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem addresses the large deviations of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables. The total energy of a gas can be viewed as such a sum. The theorem establishes that the probability of the mean energy deviating from its expected value is governed by a rate function derived from the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function.\n\nApplication of this theorem to the energy of a physical system demonstrates that:\n*   The system's equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of the Cramer-Chernoff rate function.\n*   This minimization procedure validates the use of the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics, where the probability of a system being in a state with energy `E` at a temperature `T` is proportional to `exp(-E/k_B T)`.\n*   A recent study confirms that applying large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of photons successfully reproduces the foundational results of Bose and Planck.\n\nTherefore, the **equilibrium mean energy `<E>`** is the expected value of energy calculated using the Bose-Einstein statistics for the occupation of energy levels. For photons in a cavity (black-body radiation), this results in the Planck law for the spectral energy density. The total mean energy `<E>` integrated over all frequencies is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the energy density is proportional to `T^4`.\n\n<<<In summary, the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of photons demonstrates that the equilibrium state is the one of maximum entropy and is characterized by a mean energy derived from the Planck distribution. The equilibrium value of entropy is the maximized statistical entropy (`S = k_B ln(W)` evaluated for the Bose-Einstein distribution), and the equilibrium mean energy `<E>` is that given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. These large deviation theorems provide a rigorous probabilistic foundation for the well-established results of Bose-Einstein statistical mechanics.>>>"
