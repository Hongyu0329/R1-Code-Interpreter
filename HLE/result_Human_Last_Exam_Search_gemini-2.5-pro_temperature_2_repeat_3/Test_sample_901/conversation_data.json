    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The regioselectivity of this reaction is determined by the stereochemical requirement for the leaving group (Bromine) and the abstracted proton to be in an anti-periplanar or trans-diaxial orientation.\n\nFor the given starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the bromine and methyl groups are trans to each other. In a cyclohexane ring, trans-1,2 substituents can exist in two chair conformations: one with both substituents in equatorial positions (e,e) and another with both in axial positions (a,a). The conformation with both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions is significantly more stable.\n\nHowever, for an E2 elimination to occur, the leaving group must be in an axial position. Therefore, the molecule must adopt the less stable diaxial (a,a) conformation to react.\n\nIn this reactive (a,a) conformation, the bromine atom is axial. The two adjacent carbons (Î²-carbons) are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. There is no axial hydrogen on C2 that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination cannot form a double bond between C1 and C2 (which would yield 1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product).\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\nConsequently, the tert-butoxide base can only abstract the axial proton from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. This results in the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene as the sole elimination product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
