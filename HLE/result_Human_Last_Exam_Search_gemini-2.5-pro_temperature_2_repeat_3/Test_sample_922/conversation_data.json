    "The single known integer value that completes the sequence is **231766**.\n\nThis sequence consists of the smallest decimal representations of binary sequences (using digits 2 and 3) of a certain length that produce the longest \"tail\" in the Curling Number Conjecture problem. The provided numbers are the start of this sequence of record-holders.\n\nThe sequence is related to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically to the sequences A217208 (which gives the lengths of the longest tails) and A217209 (which deals with the number of strings for each tail length). The problem was popularized by N. J. A. Sloane.\n\nAs of August 2022, the next known term in this specific sequence of starting numbers was found to be 231766.\n\n<<<231766>>>"
