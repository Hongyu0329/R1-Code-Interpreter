    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly achieved by directly reacting xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas in a nickel container. The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, can be varied to optimize the yield of XeF₄.\n\nThe original and a frequently cited method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) to 400°C at approximately 6 atmospheres of pressure. This high-temperature synthesis is considered an efficient method for producing XeF₄, though it can also yield other xenon fluorides like XeF₂ and XeF₆.\n\nHowever, alternative methods have been developed that operate at lower temperatures. A patented process describes the preparation of xenon fluorides by reacting xenon with dinitrogen difluoride (N₂F₂) at temperatures below 200°C. Specifically for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride, this method is effective in a temperature range of 80°C to 150°C.\n\nAnother approach involves photochemical synthesis, which can also be performed at lower temperatures. Flow methods have also been employed, with reaction temperatures ranging from 300-500°C. It has been noted that for the direct thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine, reaction products are typically observed at temperatures exceeding 120°C.\n\nConsidering the available methods, the process using dinitrogen difluoride allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride at temperatures as low as 80°C. Comparing this to the provided options, 78°C is the closest temperature.\n\n<<<D>>>"
