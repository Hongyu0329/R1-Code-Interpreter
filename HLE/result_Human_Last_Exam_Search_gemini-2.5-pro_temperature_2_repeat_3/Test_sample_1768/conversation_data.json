    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. To find the correct reading frame for the given nucleotide sequence, we must translate it in all three possible forward frames and identify the one that is free of stop codons. The three stop codons are typically TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's analyze the three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n    The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. The presence of a stop codon makes this an unlikely reading frame for a sequence taken from the middle of a gene.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    This reading frame translates into a continuous sequence of amino acids without any stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n    The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon, which makes this frame incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the second reading frame is the correct one.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSNEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLADRLLEKW\n\n<<<2, DIVVSNEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLADRLLEKW>>>"
