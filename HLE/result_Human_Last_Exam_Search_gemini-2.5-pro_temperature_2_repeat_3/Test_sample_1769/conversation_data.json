    "Without the invasions and linguistic influence of the Norse between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved from its original Old English form, which was *sweostor* or *swuster*.\n\nThe current word, \"sister,\" is a hybrid. While it originates from Old English, its modern spelling and pronunciation, specifically the \"i\" in the first syllable, are the result of influence from the Old Norse word *systir*. In areas of England without heavy Scandinavian settlement, the word evolved into *suster* during the Middle English period, directly from the Old English *swuster*.\n\nIf the Norse influence had been absent, the native form *suster* would have continued its development into Modern English. Following typical English vowel evolution, the 'u' sound in *suster* would likely have shifted to a sound similar to the vowel in \"cup\" or \"putt\". Therefore, the word would probably be spelled and pronounced as *suster* (rhyming with \"duster\" or \"bluster\").\n\nThis developmental path is seen in related West Germanic languages that did not undergo the same Norse influence; for example, the Dutch word for sister is *zuster*, and the German word is *Schwester*.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
