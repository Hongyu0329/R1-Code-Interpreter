    "The IUPAC name of the product formed from the reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF after an aqueous work-up is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThis reaction is a type of cross-coupling reaction, often referred to as a Kumada coupling, which involves the reaction of a Grignard reagent with an organic halide. In the case of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds, the reactivity of the halogens with the Grignard reagent generally follows the trend I > Br > Cl.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in the following manner:\n*   **Step 1:** The most reactive carbon-halogen bond is the C-I (carbon-iodine) bond. The phenyl magnesium bromide will first replace the iodine atom on the 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene molecule.\n*   **Step 2:** Due to the use of \"excess\" phenyl magnesium bromide and refluxing conditions (which provide the necessary energy), the two less reactive bromine atoms are also subsequently replaced by phenyl groups. Although reactions with polyhalogenated benzenes can sometimes proceed through aryne intermediates, the stepwise substitution is the expected pathway here.\n*   **Step 3:** The aqueous work-up is a standard procedure used to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and protonate any intermediates, ensuring the final product is the neutral, fully substituted aromatic compound.\n\nThe starting material, 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, has halogen substituents at the 1, 2, and 3 positions of the benzene ring. The reaction results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups at these same positions. Therefore, the final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. This compound has the chemical formula C₂₄H₁₈.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
