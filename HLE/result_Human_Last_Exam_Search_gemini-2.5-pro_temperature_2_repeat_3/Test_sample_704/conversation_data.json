    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is the range between G and A.\n\nWhen the primary colors yellow and blue are mixed, they produce the secondary color green. In his work \"Opticks,\" Sir Isaac Newton developed a color wheel where he analogized the spectrum of light to a musical scale. He divided the circle into seven colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—and associated them with the notes of a diatonic musical scale.\n\nNewton's chosen scale was the Dorian mode starting on the note D. In this arrangement, the colors are mapped to the notes as follows:\n\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   **Blue - A**\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nTherefore, the range from green to blue on Newton's color circle corresponds to the musical interval between the notes G and A.\n\n<<<G to A>>>"
