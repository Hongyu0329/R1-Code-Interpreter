    "Fairy bees, unknownIn 2024, the most commonly used name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native North American range is \"fairy bees.\" They are also sometimes referred to as \"miner bees.\" The genus includes over 600 species, many of which are very small and native to the desert regions of the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe exact year that the common name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not readily available in public records. The formal scientific name, *Perdita*, was established by Frederick Smith in 1853. While the common name \"fairy bees\" is widely used in contemporary literature and online resources, historical documentation regarding its origin is scarce, suggesting it may be a more recent or informally adopted term. For many native bee species, common names are not yet standardized.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, unknown>>>"
