    "The Christian theologian who first developed a specialized, systematic terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature—a framework applicable to both the singular miracle of the virgin birth and the systemic alterations in nature following the Fall—is **Francis Turretin**.\n\nWithin the tradition of Reformed Scholasticism, Francis Turretin (1623–1687) is a pivotal figure who rigorously systematized the doctrine of divine providence. In his influential work, *Institutes of Elenctic Theology*, he articulated and defended the key distinction between **ordinary providence** (*providentia ordinaria*) and **extraordinary providence** (*providentia extraordinaria*).\n\nThis terminology provides a comprehensive framework for understanding God's relationship to the natural world and its laws:\n\n*   ***Providentia Ordinaria*** (Ordinary Providence): This term describes God's typical governance of the world through the consistent and regular operation of secondary causes and the laws of nature which He established. This is how God normally upholds and directs creation.\n*   ***Providentia Extraordinaria*** (Extraordinary Providence): This refers to miracles, where God acts directly, working \"without, above, and against\" the ordinary means and natural laws to accomplish his will.\n\nThis framework is directly applicable to the two events specified in the question:\n\n1.  **The Virgin Birth**: This is a clear instance of *providentia extraordinaria*. Turretin's system would classify the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit as a supernatural act where God worked apart from and above the natural laws of human reproduction to bring about the Incarnation. The virgin birth is seen as a unique, miraculous sign of God's redemptive plan.\n\n2.  **The Fall**: The consequences of the Fall—described in Christian theology as a curse upon the ground, the introduction of pain, physical death, and a fundamental corruption of human nature—represent a divinely ordained, systemic alteration to the created order. In Turretin's theology, the Fall and its universal effects on nature are not random events but occur under the sovereign decree of God. The *Westminster Confession of Faith*, a cornerstone of the tradition Turretin represents, explicitly states that God's providence extends even to \"the first fall.\" This change to the \"ordinary\" workings of nature is thus encompassed within his overarching doctrine of providence.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like Augustine and John Calvin laid the groundwork for these ideas, Francis Turretin is distinguished for his highly precise, systematic, and polemical development of this specific terminology, making his work a primary example of a theological system that can describe both unique miracles and universal changes in natural law.\n\n<<<Francis Turretin>>>"
