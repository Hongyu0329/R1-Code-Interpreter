The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal Ni loadings are reported in the range of 5-12.5 wt%, with some studies pointing to an optimum of around 7% molar Ni for the reverse WGS. For water splitting, optimal atomic ratios of Ni to Ce are found to be around 3:1 and 1:1 for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), while a ratio of 1:2 is reported to be optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).
