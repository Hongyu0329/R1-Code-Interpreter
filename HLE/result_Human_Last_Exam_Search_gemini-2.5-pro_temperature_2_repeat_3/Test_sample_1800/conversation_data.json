    "### Optimizing Ni/Ce Ratio for Catalysis in Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is highly dependent on the specific application, whether for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or for water splitting. Research indicates that different ratios are optimal for each of these processes, and the ideal composition can also be influenced by the catalyst's synthesis method and the presence of dopants.\n\n#### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio varies across different studies.\n\nIn the context of the reverse WGS (rWGS) reaction, an optimal nickel molar proportion of approximately 7% has been identified in La-doped Ceria catalysts. In these studies, a catalyst with the composition Ni<sub>0.07</sub>/(Ce<sub>0.9</sub>La<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>x</sub>)<sub>0.93</sub> demonstrated high CO production and stability. Lower nickel loadings resulted in more pronounced deactivation, while higher loadings did not significantly improve performance.\n\nFor the standard WGS reaction, research on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt% showed that catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni achieved nearly identical, high CO conversion rates at 400°C. Other studies have also shown good WGS activity with Ni loadings around 4-5 wt%. Furthermore, some research has explored different Ceria loadings, indicating that the amount of ceria also plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of Ni-CeO₂/C catalysts. The promotion of nickel catalysts with about 3% (w/w) ceria has also been investigated. The catalytic activity in the WGS reaction is often linked to the oxygen storage capacity of the ceria support.\n\n#### Water Splitting\n\nIn the case of water splitting, which involves the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), the ideal Ni/Ce ratio also appears to vary.\n\nFor the OER, studies on Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce<sub>100−y</sub>O<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts revealed that compositions of Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ, corresponding to Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, respectively, exhibited the highest activities. This enhanced performance is attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies, which are favorable for the reaction. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst also demonstrated excellent long-term stability.\n\nFor the HER, a different optimal ratio was found. In a study using Ni₃N-xCeO₂/NF catalysts, a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2) was identified as optimal for HER performance.\n\nIt is evident that the synergistic interaction between nickel and ceria, particularly the generation of oxygen vacancies, is a key factor in the catalytic performance for both WGS and water splitting reactions.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal Ni loadings are reported in the range of 5-12.5 wt%, with some studies pointing to an optimum of around 7% molar Ni for the reverse WGS. For water splitting, optimal atomic ratios of Ni to Ce are found to be around 3:1 and 1:1 for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), while a ratio of 1:2 is reported to be optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).>>>"
