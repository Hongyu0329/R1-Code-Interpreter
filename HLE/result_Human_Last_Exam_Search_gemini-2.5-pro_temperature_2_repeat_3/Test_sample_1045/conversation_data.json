    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by the number of functions assigned to each atom and the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. Here's how the functions are allocated:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** A carbon atom has a core 1s orbital and valence 2s and 2p orbitals. In the 6-31G basis set, the core orbital is represented by one contracted function. The valence orbitals are split into two functions each. Therefore, each carbon atom uses 9 contracted Gaussian functions (1 for the 1s orbital, 2 for the 2s orbital, and 2 for each of the three 2p orbitals).\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** A hydrogen atom has only a 1s valence orbital. In the 6-31G basis set, this is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nTo calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene:\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the functions for all atoms: 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
