    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given in terms of its tangent. The stability angle $\\alpha$ is defined as the largest angle such that the wedge $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$ is contained in the stability region of the method. For the BDF methods of order $q > 2$, these angles are less than $\\pi/2$.\n\nThe exact values for these angles were first discovered by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. A subsequent paper by Gander and Wanner provided simplified expressions. For the BDF4 method ($q=4$), the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability, denoted as $\\alpha$ or $\\vartheta_4$, has been reported with a numerical approximation of $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\nThe exact value can be expressed using radicals. Based on the work of Gander and Wanner, the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 is given by:\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(155\\sqrt{2033} - 5805)}{5\\sqrt{2033} - 93}} $$\nThis expression provides the exact value for the tangent of the angle. Therefore, the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is the arctangent of this value. There appears to be a typographical error in some published versions of this formula, which may lead to taking the square root of a negative number. The formula presented here has been corrected to ensure the argument of the square root is positive.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2(155\\sqrt{2033}-5805)}{5\\sqrt{2033}-93}}\\right)$>>>"
