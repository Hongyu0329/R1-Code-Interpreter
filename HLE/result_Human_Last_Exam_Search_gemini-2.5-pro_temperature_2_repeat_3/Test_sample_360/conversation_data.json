    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed which results in two diastereomeric isomers. These isomers are a meso form and a racemic mixture (rac).\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, is a doubly chelating bridging ligand. In this reaction, it coordinates to two [Ru(bpy)₂]²⁺ units. The resulting dinuclear complex, [Ru₂(bpy)₄(2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]⁴⁺, exhibits stereoisomerism.\n\nThe two diastereomers are:\n*   A meso (Δ/Λ) form, which has a center of inversion.\n*   A rac (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) form, which contains a two-fold rotation axis and consists of a pair of enantiomers.\n\nThese two diastereomeric forms are separable by techniques such as cation exchange chromatography. While such reactions often yield a 1:1 ratio of diastereomers, in this specific case, a 2:1 ratio was observed.\n\nTherefore, a total of two diastereomers are formed, one of which is a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
