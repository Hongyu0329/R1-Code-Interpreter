Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit a significantly increased and more polyfunctional release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, upon antigen encounter compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is expected to lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity but also a higher risk of cytokine release syndrome.
