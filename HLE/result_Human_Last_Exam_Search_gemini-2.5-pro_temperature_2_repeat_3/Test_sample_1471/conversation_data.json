    "The provided expression contains Cyrillic script \"римская цифра,\" which translates to \"roman numeral.\" This part of the equation is missing a specific value. However, the rest of the equation can be solved by converting the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the Roman numerals in the equation:\n\n*   **CCC:** In Roman numerals, 'C' represents 100. Therefore, CCC is equal to 100 + 100 + 100, which is 300.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII:** This numeral is converted as follows:\n    *   MMM = 3000\n    *   DCCC = 800\n    *   LXXX = 80\n    *   VIII = 8\n    *   Together, MMMDCCCLXXXVIII equals 3888.\n\nAssuming the intended calculation is the subtraction of these two values, the equation would be:\n\n300 - 3888 = -3588\n\nWithout a specified Roman numeral for \"римская цифра,\" a complete solution to the division and subtraction problem is not possible. If we take the subtraction part of the problem, the solution is -3588.\n\n<<<-3588>>>"
