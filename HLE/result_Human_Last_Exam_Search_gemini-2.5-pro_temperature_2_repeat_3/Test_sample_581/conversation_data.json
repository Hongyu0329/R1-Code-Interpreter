    "The best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is a question that requires finding the maximum size of a subset of the vector space \\( \\mathbb{F}_3^8 \\) that contains no three elements in a line (no three elements summing to the zero vector).\n\nTo establish a lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension *n*, denoted as *a(n)*, a common method is to construct a new cap set by taking the Cartesian product of known cap sets. If \\( C_k \\) is a cap set in \\( \\mathbb{F}_3^k \\) and \\( C_m \\) is a cap set in \\( \\mathbb{F}_3^m \\), then their product \\( C_k \\times C_m \\) is a cap set in \\( \\mathbb{F}_3^{k+m} \\) of size \\( |C_k| \\times |C_m| \\).\n\nThe exact sizes of the largest cap sets for smaller dimensions are known:\n*   a(1) = 2\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 9\n*   a(4) = 20\n*   a(5) = 45\n*   a(6) = 112\n\nUsing these known values, we can calculate lower bounds for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 by finding products of sizes for dimensions that sum to 8:\n*   a(8) ≥ a(2) × a(6) = 4 × 112 = 448\n*   a(8) ≥ a(3) × a(5) = 9 × 45 = 405\n*   a(8) ≥ a(4) × a(4) = 20 × 20 = 400\n\nThe best lower bound from these constructions is 448. A thesis from TU Delft mentions that for dimension 8, this direct product construction yields a better lower bound than the more complex \"extended product construction\".\n\nBased on this calculated lower bound of 448, we can eliminate answer choices A (224), B (16), D (80), and E (45). This leaves us with C (512) and F (496).\n\nFurther specialized constructions can yield better lower bounds than simple products of maximum-sized caps. For instance, it's known that a(8) is at least a(2) x a(2) x a(4) which is 4 * 4 * 20 = 320, a(2) x a(3) x a(3) which is 4 * 9 * 9 = 324 and also at least a(4) x a(4) = 20 * 20 = 400. The product a(2) x a(6) gives 4 x 112 = 448 and a(3) x a(5) gives 9 x 45 = 405. The best lower bound is constructed from a product of two known caps of smaller dimension and in this case a(2) * a(2) * a(2) * a(2) is not optimal. It is plausible that there exists a specific construction that results in a cap set of size 496. Without a direct reference for a new record, and seeing that 496 is a viable option above our calculated secure lower bound, it stands as a credible answer.\n\nConsidering the options and the established lower bound of 448, the answer must be higher. Option F, 496, represents a plausible, improved lower bound.\n\n<<<F>>>"
