    "I am unable to determine the number of pas de Balanchine Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015. Despite extensive searches, a viewable video of this specific performance is not available online.\n\nMy research confirmed that Svetlana Gileva did perform this role with the Semperoper Ballett, and a recording was made on November 9, 2015. However, all found links to this video are now inactive. Without visual access to the performance, a count of the specific choreographic step, \"pas de Balanchine,\" is impossible.\n\nInformation about William Forsythe's choreographic style suggests a basis in classical ballet that is then extended and deconstructed. While I located tutorials explaining a \"pas de Balanchine,\" applying this to a performance I cannot watch is not feasible. Therefore, the exact number of times this step was performed in the specified solo remains unknown.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your request.>>>"
