    "The question asks to identify the mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes. Let's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. Gene conversion tends to make sequences more similar, leading to their homogenization, which counteracts divergence. While it can generate new allelic diversity, its primary role is not the stable retention of two distinct, diverging gene copies.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is a common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional. While this does represent divergence (one gene is functional, the other is not), it does not result in the retention of two functional genes. It is essentially a failure to retain both copies in a functional state.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after gene duplication, one copy maintains the original function while the other acquires a completely new, selectively advantageous function. This process directly explains both the **retention** of the second copy (due to its new benefit) and the **divergence** between the two genes.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** According to this model, the two duplicated gene copies divide the ancestral functions between them. Each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out different sub-functions, making both copies necessary to perform the complete set of functions of the original gene. Like neofunctionalization, this mechanism explains both the **retention** (both copies become essential) and the **divergence** of the duplicated genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes a macroevolutionary event where an ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapting to a different ecological niche. This process operates at the species level, not at the level of individual genes within a genome.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are considered the primary mechanisms responsible for the preservation and functional divergence of duplicate genes. They provide a selective advantage to maintaining what would otherwise be a redundant second copy of a gene. Subfunctionalization can occur through the accumulation of neutral degenerative mutations, making it a very plausible and potentially frequent pathway for initial gene retention. Neofunctionalization describes the subsequent evolution of novel functions. Both are crucial models in gene evolution. Given the choices, both C and D are strong candidates as they are the key theoretical models answering the question. In many contexts, these are the accepted fates that lead to retention and divergence.\n\n<<<D. Subfunctionalization>>>"
