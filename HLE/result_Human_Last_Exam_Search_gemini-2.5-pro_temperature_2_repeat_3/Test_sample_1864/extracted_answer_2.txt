For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the specified detection channels, you should prepare a minimum of **13** essential controls. This includes **one unstained control**, **five single-stain compensation controls**, **five Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls**, and **at least two controls specific to the streptavidin beads** (beads alone and beads with all fluorescent reagents in the absence of the target). Additional controls like a viability dye control are also highly recommended.
