    "The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is a seminal result in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory. This expression is derived using the renormalization group and the ε-expansion, where ε = 4 - d is a small parameter representing the deviation from four spatial dimensions.\n\nThe renormalization group describes how the coupling constants of a theory change with the energy scale. The behavior is governed by the beta function, β(u). Fixed points of the renormalization group flow occur when the beta function is zero, β(u*) = 0, indicating that the coupling constant becomes scale-invariant.\n\nIn the ϕ⁴ theory with a single scalar field (N=1), the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling constant *u* in *d* = 4 - ε dimensions is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + Bu²\n\nwhere B is a constant that depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. A widely used convention, particularly in statistical mechanics, yields a specific value for B.\n\nTo find the fixed point, we set the beta function to zero:\n\n-εu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n1.  **u* = 0**: This is the Gaussian fixed point, which corresponds to a non-interacting (free) field theory.\n2.  **u* = ε / B**: This is the non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nIn a common normalization scheme, the constant B is 3/2. This leads to the leading order expression for the fixed-point coupling:\n\n**u* = (2/3)ε**\n\nIt is important to note that different conventions for the definition of the coupling constant exist, which can lead to different numerical prefactors in the expression for the fixed point. For example, in some quantum field theory literature, a different normalization for the coupling constant λ is used, resulting in a different expression. However, the result u* = (2/3)ε is a standard and widely cited expression.\n\nThis non-trivial fixed point is crucial for understanding the universal critical behavior of systems like the Ising model near their critical temperatures. The ε-expansion, pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, allows for the calculation of critical exponents as a series in ε, providing a powerful tool to study phase transitions.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ε>>>"
