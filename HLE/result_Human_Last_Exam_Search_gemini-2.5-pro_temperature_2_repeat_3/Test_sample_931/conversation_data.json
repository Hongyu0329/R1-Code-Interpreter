    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that feed on soft-bodied arthropods. Their diet primarily includes aphids and mites. In pear orchards, for example, they are significant predators of pear psylla.\n\nIn addition to preying on other insects, some adult snakeflies have been observed to consume pollen and nectar. It is not fully understood if pollen is a required part of their life cycle or simply a favored food source. They are not known to feed on fungus or leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the available information:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Correct, some adults have been reported to feed on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Incorrect. While snakeflies eat pollen, they are not found in New Zealand, where the Māhoe tree is native.\n*   **C. Fungus:** Incorrect. There is no evidence they consume fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Incorrect. They do not eat leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Correct as a food *type*. Adult snakeflies prey on aphids. Although the Totara tree is from New Zealand where snakeflies are not established, aphids are a staple of their diet.\n\nConsidering the choices, the most accurate option is F, as it includes two recorded food sources for adult Raphidiopterans.\n\n<<<F>>>"
