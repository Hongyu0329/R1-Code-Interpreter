    "I have conducted multiple searches to identify the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial. Despite a thorough investigation into the advertising campaign, its themes, and celebrity endorsements related to Enron, no evidence has surfaced to confirm the participation of any Nobel laureates in these commercials.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign is well-documented for its edgy and abstract nature, which aimed to portray Enron as an innovative and questioning company. The irony of this slogan became apparent with the subsequent collapse of the company due to massive accounting fraud.\n\nWhile there are discussions about Enron's associations with prominent figures and the general topic of celebrity endorsements in the face of corporate scandals, these do not mention any Nobel Prize winners appearing in their television advertisements. Information about the cast of these commercials or specific celebrity endorsers is not readily available in the public record.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to identify two Nobel laureates who were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" It is possible that this is a misconception.\n\n<<<I am unable to verify that two Nobel laureates were featured in the infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" My research has not produced any evidence to support this claim.>>>"
