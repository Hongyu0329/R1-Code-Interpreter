    "Based on an interpretation of the \"maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\" as the sup-norm ($||f||_\\infty$) of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ for a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the upper bound in relation to the covolume ($V$) for a squarefree natural number $N$ can be described as follows.\n\nIn this context, the covolume $V$ of the hyperbolic surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is approximately proportional to the level $N$. Specifically, the volume is given by $V \\sim N^{1+o(1)}$. Consequently, an upper bound in terms of $N$ can be translated into an upper bound in terms of $V$.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and a fixed Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, research has established several upper bounds for its sup-norm. An important result in this area shows that the sup-norm has an upper bound that decreases as the level (and therefore the covolume) increases.\n\nOne of the bounds mentioned in the literature for a squarefree level $N$ is:\n$||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/22 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, a result attributed to Templier.\n\nFurther improvements have been made, with a subsequent bound stated as:\n$||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nSince $V$ is of the order of $N$, these inequalities imply a relationship of the form:\n$||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$\n\nIt's important to note that research in this area is ongoing, and the exact exponent in the upper bound is subject to improvement. The notation $\\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}$ means that the implied constant in the inequality depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with a fixed eigenvalue and a squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the sup-norm, denoted as $||f||_\\infty$, in relation to the covolume $V$ follows a power law decay. Given that the covolume $V$ is approximately proportional to $N$, the bound can be expressed as $||f||_\\infty \\ll V^{-c}$ for some positive constant $c$. A known result provides an upper bound of $||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$, which translates to an upper bound in terms of the covolume of approximately $V^{-1/12}$.>>>"
