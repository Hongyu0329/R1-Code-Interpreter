For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with a fixed eigenvalue and a squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the sup-norm, denoted as $||f||_\infty$, in relation to the covolume $V$ follows a power law decay. Given that the covolume $V$ is approximately proportional to $N$, the bound can be expressed as $||f||_\infty \ll V^{-c}$ for some positive constant $c$. A known result provides an upper bound of $||f||_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} N^{-1/12+\epsilon}$, which translates to an upper bound in terms of the covolume of approximately $V^{-1/12}$.
