    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a point is typically guaranteed by conditions on the spaces X, Y, and Z, and on the functions F, G, and H, usually in the context of complete metric spaces. The core principle is an extension of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to the product space X × Y × Z.\n\nThe primary conditions are as follows:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a joint contraction mapping condition. A common way to establish this is to define a mapping T on the product space X × Y × Z and show that it is a contraction.\n\nLet the product space be denoted by W = X × Y × Z, and define a metric d on W, for example:\nd((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)\n\nNow, define a mapping T: W → W by:\nT(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))\n\nA fixed point of T is a point (x, y, z) such that T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z), which is precisely the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point. By the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, T has a unique fixed point if (W, d) is a complete metric space (which it is, since X, Y, and Z are complete) and T is a contraction mapping.\n\nT is a contraction mapping if there exists a constant k ∈ [0, 1) such that for all (x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂) ∈ W:\nd(T(x₁, y₁, z₁), T(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ k * d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂))\n\nThis general condition can be broken down into more specific conditions on F, G, and H. For instance, if there exist non-negative constants α₁, α₂, α₃, β₁, β₂, γ₁, γ₂, γ₃ such that for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)\n*   d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)\n*   d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)\n\nThen, T is a contraction if:\nmax {α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁} < 1\n\nIf these conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) in X × Y × Z.\n\n### Alternative Conditions: Partially Ordered Metric Spaces\n\nAlternatively, existence theorems can be formulated in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The conditions would include:\n\n1.  **(X, ≼_X), (Y, ≼_Y), (Z, ≼_Z)** being partially ordered sets, and the metric spaces being complete.\n2.  **Monotonicity Properties**: The functions F, G, and H must have some mixed-monotonicity property with respect to the orders on X, Y, and Z. The specific nature of the monotonicity depends on the theorem (e.g., F is non-decreasing in the first argument and non-increasing in the others).\n3.  **Existence of a starting point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) satisfying a certain relationship with its image under T, for instance, (x₀, y₀, z₀) ≼ T(x₀, y₀, z₀), where ≼ is the product order on X × Y × Z.\n\nIn these cases, a contractive condition similar to the one above is still required, but it only needs to hold for elements that are related by the partial order.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental requirements for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are the completeness of the underlying spaces and a suitable contractive property of the functions F, G, and H, which ensures that iterative application of the mapping T converges to a unique point.\n\n<<<The core conditions for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces)**: The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **(Contraction Condition)**: The functions must collectively satisfy a contraction condition on the product space X × Y × Z. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants satisfying certain inequalities such that a combined operator T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x)) becomes a contraction mapping on the product space endowed with a suitable metric. For instance, if for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)\n    *   d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)\n    *   d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)\n    and the sum of these coefficients in each dimension is less than one (i.e., max{α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁} < 1), then a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.\nAlternative frameworks involve conditions of monotonicity on partially ordered metric spaces.>>>An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a point is typically guaranteed by conditions on the spaces X, Y, and Z, and on the functions F, G, and H, usually in the context of complete metric spaces.
