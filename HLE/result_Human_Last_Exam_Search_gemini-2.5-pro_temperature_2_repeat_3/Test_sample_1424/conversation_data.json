    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as \\(G_0\\), describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \\(\\epsilon_k\\), is most clearly seen in the momentum-frequency representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function \\(G_0(k, \\omega)\\) for a given momentum \\(k\\) and frequency \\(\\omega\\) is given by the expression:\n\n\\(G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}\\)\n\nwhere:\n*   \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency, which is related to the energy of the particle.\n*   \\(\\epsilon_k\\) represents the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states with momentum \\(k\\).\n*   \\(\\mu\\) is the chemical potential, which determines the Fermi level.\n*   \\(i\\eta\\) is an infinitesimally small complex number (\\(\\eta \\to 0^+\\)) that ensures the correct causal behavior of the Green's function. It shifts the poles of the Green's function slightly off the real axis. The term \\(\\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)\\) determines whether the pole is shifted into the upper or lower half of the complex plane, depending on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThis formula demonstrates that the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\(\\epsilon_k\\) directly determine the poles of the bare Green's function. In essence, for each momentum \\(k\\), the function \\(G_0\\) has a singularity at the energy \\(\\omega = \\epsilon_k\\). This reflects the fact that in a non-interacting system, a particle with momentum \\(k\\) can only exist at the specific energy \\(\\epsilon_k\\).\n\nThe Feynman path integral provides a formal way to derive this result. In this formalism, the Green's function is calculated by integrating over all possible paths a particle can take. For a non-interacting system described by a quadratic action, this integral can be performed exactly, and after a Fourier transform from position and time to momentum and frequency, the expression for \\(G_0(k, \\omega)\\) is obtained.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\(G_0\\) depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\(\\epsilon_k\\) as an inverse function in frequency-momentum space. Specifically, for a given momentum \\(k\\) and frequency \\(\\omega\\), the bare Green's function \\(G_0(k, \\omega)\\) is proportional to \\((\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}\\), where the eigenvalues \\(\\epsilon_k\\) determine the poles of the function.>>>"
