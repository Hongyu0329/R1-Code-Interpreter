    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. The reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. In this specific case, the reactants are:\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** Also known by its systematic IUPAC name, 2,2-dimethylpropanal, or as trimethylacetaldehyde. It's an aldehyde with a bulky tertiary-butyl group attached to the carbonyl group. Its chemical formula is C₅H₁₀O.\n*   **The Wittig Reagent:** The provided name is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. The \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" part indicates a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃), and the \"ethylidene\" part signifies the two-carbon chain double-bonded to the phosphorus. The substituent \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" is located on the second carbon of the ethylidene group. This means the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe core of the Wittig reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (=O) of the aldehyde with the carbon group of the ylide (=CR₂).\n\nTherefore, the aldehyde's tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-CH=, combines with the ylide's carbon chain, =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), at the site of the double bonds.\n\nThe final product of the reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The reaction also produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the E or Z isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide. In this case, the ylide is non-stabilized, which typically favors the formation of the (Z)-alkene. However, it's common to get a mixture of both E and Z isomers.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
