    "**\"The Life of Emile Zola,\" the 1937 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film in that category to feature the Luxor Obelisk.**\n\nThe biographical drama, which chronicles the life of the famed French writer and his involvement in the Dreyfus affair, is set in Paris and showcases several of the city's landmarks. Though primarily filmed on studio backlots, a wide-angle shot of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk prominently stands, is included in the film to establish the Parisian setting.\n\nThe film's production involved the recreation of various Parisian locales, including the Pantheon, the Ecole Militaire, and Les Halles, on studio sets. However, footage of the actual Place de la Concorde was incorporated into the movie. The narrative of *The Life of Emile Zola* unfolds in Paris, beginning in 1862, and follows the writer's life and career, which were deeply intertwined with the city's social and political landscape.\n\nWhile a later Best Picture winner, \"An American in Paris\" (1951), also features the Place de la Concorde, it does so in a stylized ballet sequence created on a soundstage, rather than depicting the actual location. This makes *The Life of Emile Zola* the earliest Best Picture recipient to visually present the iconic Egyptian monument to audiences.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
