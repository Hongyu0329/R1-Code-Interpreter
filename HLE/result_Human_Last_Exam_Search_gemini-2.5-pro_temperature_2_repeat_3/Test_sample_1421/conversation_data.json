    "The formula for the fermionic partition function, Z, in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is a cornerstone of quantum field theory at finite temperature. It describes the statistical mechanics of a system of fermions.\n\nThe partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields, which are mathematical objects necessary to represent the fermionic nature of particles within the path integral framework.\n\nThe general formula is:\n<br>\n<center>\n$Z = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)}^{\\psi^*(\\beta) = -\\psi^*(0)} \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n</center>\n<br>\nWhere:\n\n*   **Z**: The fermionic partition function.\n*   **∫ D[ψ*, ψ]**: This represents the Feynman path integral, which is a sum over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ(**x**, τ) and their conjugates ψ\\*(**x**, τ). These fields are functions of spatial coordinates **x** and imaginary time τ.\n*   **Grassmann fields**: The fields ψ and ψ\\* are not ordinary numbers but are elements of a Grassmann algebra, which means they anticommute. This property is essential to correctly implement the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ\\*, ψ]**: This is the Euclidean action of the system, expressed in imaginary time. A common form for the Euclidean action is:\n\n    <br>\n    <center>\n    $S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\ \\psi^*(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + H(\\vec{x}, -i\\vec{\\nabla}) \\right) \\psi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n    </center>\n    <br>\n*   **Imaginary time (τ)**: The formalism employs imaginary time, τ = it, where t is real time. This analytical continuation is what connects quantum field theory to statistical mechanics.\n*   **β**: This is the inverse temperature, defined as β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T), where T is the temperature and k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant (often set to 1 in natural units). The integration in imaginary time runs from 0 to β.\n*   **H**: This is the single-particle Hamiltonian, which contains the kinetic and potential energy terms.\n*   **Anti-periodic boundary conditions**: A crucial feature for fermions is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This means the fermionic field at the beginning of the imaginary time interval is the negative of the field at the end:\n\n    <br>\n    <center>\n    ψ(**x**, 0) = -ψ(**x**, β) and ψ\\*(**x**, 0) = -ψ\\*(**x**, β).\n    </center>\n    <br>\n\n    This mathematical condition correctly reproduces the Fermi-Dirac statistics that govern the behavior of fermions. The use of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the path integral formulation is equivalent to calculating the trace of the density operator, Tr(e<sup>-βH</sup>), for a fermionic system.\n\nFor a non-interacting system, the path integral is Gaussian and can be evaluated exactly. The result is given by the determinant of the operator in the action.\n\n"
