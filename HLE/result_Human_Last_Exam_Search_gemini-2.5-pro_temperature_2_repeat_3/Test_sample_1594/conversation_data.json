    "The two high schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa. When viewed from above, their buildings form the letter **E**.\n\nThe main building of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti has a shape that clearly forms the vertical spine and the middle and lower horizontal arms of the letter \"E\".
