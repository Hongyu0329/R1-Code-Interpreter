    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors, and these are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t),$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t).$$\n\n### 1. Finding Equilibrium Points\n\nEquilibrium points exist where both derivatives are zero.\nSetting $u'(t) = 0$, we have $u^2(u - 1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(u, d) = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the $(u, d)$ phase plane are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n### 2. Stability Analysis\n\nWe analyze the stability of these points using the Jacobian matrix. Let $f(u, d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $g(u, d) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, the point $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, the point $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so this is a non-hyperbolic point, and stability cannot be determined by linearization alone.\n\n### 3. Finding the Separatrix\n\nSeparatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We found a saddle point at $(1, -1)$. We look for an invariant curve passing through this point. The equation for $d'$ is a type of Riccati equation.\n\nLet's test if a simple curve of the form $d = -u^2$ is a solution to the system. This is an invariant manifold if any trajectory starting on the curve stays on the curve. To verify this, we can substitute $d = -u^2$ into the system.\n\nFrom $d = -u^2$, we differentiate with respect to $t$ to get $d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)$.\nSubstituting $u'(t) = u^3 - u^2$:\n$$d'(t) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3.$$\nNow we check this against the original equation for $d'$ by substituting $d=-u^2$:\n$$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d'(t) = 2u^4 - (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$$\n$$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3.$$\nThe expressions match. Thus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. This is the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n*   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. This is the non-hyperbolic point $(0, 0)$.\n\nThe slope of this curve in the $(u, d)$ plane is $dd/du = -2u$. At the saddle point $(1,-1)$, the slope is $-2$.\nThe eigenvector for the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ (corresponding to eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$) is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector indicates a slope of $-2/1 = -2$.\n\nSince the curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the saddle point and is tangent to the unstable eigenvector at that point, it represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point. Unstable manifolds of saddle points are key separatrices in a dynamical system. It separates the phase plane into regions where trajectories have different long-term behaviors.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
