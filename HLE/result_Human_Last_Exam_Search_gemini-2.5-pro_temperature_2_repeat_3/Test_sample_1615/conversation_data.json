    "The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that it is not a complete graph. The number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring is called the chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$.\n\nFirst, let $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. The chromatic number is exactly $n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each vertex.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than $n$.\nSo, $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if a chromatic number of $12344$ is achievable for a non-complete graph with $12345$ vertices. To do this, we can construct such a graph.\n\nConsider the graph $G^*$ formed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge, say between vertices $u$ and $v$.\n*   This graph $G^*$ has $12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph because the edge $(u,v)$ is missing.\n*   Now, let's determine the chromatic number of $G^*$. Consider the subgraph induced by all vertices except $v$. This subgraph is the complete graph $K_{12344}$, as all these $12344$ vertices are still mutually connected.\n*   To color a $K_{12344}$, we need at least $12344$ colors. This implies that the chromatic number of our graph $G^*$ must be at least $12344$, i.e., $\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$.\n\nSince we have already established that for any non-complete graph with $12345$ vertices the chromatic number is at most $12344$, and we have found a specific graph that requires exactly $12344$ colors, we can conclude that the maximum number of colors needed is $12344$.\n\nThis conclusion can also be understood in the context of Brooks' Theorem. Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph $G$, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of complete graphs or odd cycles, the chromatic number is $\\Delta(G)+1$. Our graph $G$ has 12345 vertices, which is odd, but we are looking for the *maximum* number of colors. A simple cycle $C_{12345}$ would have $\\chi(C_{12345}) = 3$, which is not the maximum. For any other non-complete graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. The maximum possible degree for a non-complete graph on $12345$ vertices is $12344$. This would mean the maximum possible chromatic number is at most $12344$. The example graph $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed has a maximum degree of $12344$ and a chromatic number of $12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
