The measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a fixed numerical value but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable \( \eta \), the measure \( d\eta \) is defined by the relations \( \int d\eta \cdot 1 = 0 \) and \( \int d\eta \cdot \eta = 1 \). This, combined with the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables (\( \eta^2=0 \)), directly enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.
