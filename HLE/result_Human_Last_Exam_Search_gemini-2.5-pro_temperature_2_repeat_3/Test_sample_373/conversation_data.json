    "The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights during randomized uniform gossiping is 1 in 21.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Barbell Graph Structure**: A standard barbell graph is formed by taking two identical complete graphs and connecting them with a single edge. For a 10-node graph, this means two 5-node complete graphs (K₅) are joined by one \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck\" edge.\n\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: In the context of edge sampling, this process implies that any single edge in the entire graph has an equal probability of being selected. This method is also referred to as uniform random edge sampling.\n\n*   **Calculating the Total Number of Edges**:\n    *   A complete graph with 'n' nodes has n * (n-1) / 2 edges.\n    *   For one of the 5-node cliques (K₅), the number of edges is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10.\n    *   Since there are two such cliques, they contribute 10 + 10 = 20 edges.\n    *   There is one additional bottleneck edge connecting the two cliques.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is 20 + 1 = 21.\n\n*   **Calculating the Probability**: The probability of sampling a specific edge is the number of desired edges divided by the total number of edges.\n    *   Number of bottleneck edges: 1\n    *   Total number of edges: 21\n    *   The resulting probability is 1/21.\n\nAs a decimal, this probability is approximately 0.0476.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
