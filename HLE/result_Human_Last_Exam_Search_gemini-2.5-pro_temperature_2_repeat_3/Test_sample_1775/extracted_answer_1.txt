The net displacement field (**D**) through the transistor is the superposition of the fields generated by the top and bottom gates. It is a vector quantity. Assuming the direction perpendicular to the gates is the z-axis, the displacement field is given by the expression:

**D** = (C_bg * V_bg - C_tg * V_tg) **ẑ**

where:
*   **C_bg** is the bottom gate capacitance per unit area.
*   **V_bg** is the voltage applied to the bottom gate.
*   **C_tg** is the top gate capacitance per unit area.
*   **V_tg** is the voltage applied to the top gate.
*   **ẑ** is the unit vector pointing from the bottom gate to the top gate.
