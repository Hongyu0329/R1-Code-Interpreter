    "The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n` replicas is determined by the dimension of the bosonic part of the model's target manifold.\n\nFor symmetry class D, the appropriate supersymmetric sigma-model is defined on the Riemannian symmetric superspace given by the coset `SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)`. With two replicas, `n=2`, the target space is `SpO(4, R|4) / U(2|2)`. The non-Grassmann variables correspond to the coordinates of the bosonic submanifold of this space.\n\nThe number of these variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of the coset, which can be calculated by subtracting the bosonic dimension of the subgroup from the bosonic dimension of the main group:\n`dim_B(SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)) = dim_B(SpO(2n, R|2n)) - dim_B(U(n|n))`\n\nThe bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra `spo(2n, R|2n)` is the direct sum of the Lie algebras `sp(2n, R)` and `so(2n)`. The dimensions of these algebras are:\n*   `dim(sp(2n, R)) = n(2n + 1)`\n*   `dim(so(2n)) = n(2n - 1)`\nTherefore, the bosonic dimension of `SpO(2n, R|2n)` is `n(2n + 1) + n(2n - 1) = 2n^2 + n + 2n^2 - n = 4n^2`.\n\nThe bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra `u(n|n)` is the direct sum of two `u(n)` Lie algebras. The dimension of `u(n)` is `n^2`.\nTherefore, the bosonic dimension of `U(n|n)` is `n^2 + n^2 = 2n^2`.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the difference between these two bosonic dimensions:\n`Number of bosonic variables = 4n^2 - 2n^2 = 2n^2`\n\nFor the specific case of two replicas, we set `n = 2`:\n`Number of bosonic variables = 2 * (2^2) = 2 * 4 = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
