    "The user's query is highly specific and uses notation that can be ambiguous without further context. Based on the search results, here is a breakdown of how the rule activation level is determined in an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system (IT3 FLS).\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure. A fuzzy rule has antecedents (the \"IF\" part) and a consequent (the \"THEN\" part). The \"rule activation level,\" also known as the \"firing strength,\" is calculated from the antecedent part. For a rule like `IF x1 is A1 AND x2 is A2 THEN...`, we need to find the membership of the inputs (`x1'` and `x2'`) in their respective fuzzy sets (`A1` and `A2`) and then combine these membership values using a t-norm operator, which represents the logical \"AND\".\n\nIn an IT3 FLS, the membership value is not a single number but a type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS). This T2 FS is itself defined by a \"footprint of uncertainty\" (FOU) and secondary membership functions. For an *interval* type-3 fuzzy set, this is often simplified and can be represented by its vertical slices. The firing level for a rule is the result of applying a t-norm operation to the T2 FSs of the antecedents.\n\nThe query provides two crisp numbers: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n*   `Phi_k(x′)` likely represents the firing strength of the antecedents for the k-th rule, evaluated at input x'. The notation `⨅ μ(x)` (the meet/t-norm of all antecedent memberships) is used to denote this value.\n*   The notation `μG_k_j(y_j)` is very unusual for an antecedent calculation, as `y` typically denotes an output variable. However, one paper uses similar notation where `μG` refers to the membership of the consequent. Another possibility is that this is simply confusing notation from a specific textbook or source and it refers to a second antecedent's membership value.\n\nGiven the request to combine these using a t-norm to find the rule activation level, the most logical interpretation is that the problem has been simplified for a textbook-style question. It is likely that `0.7` and `0.9` are presented as the final membership evaluations for two antecedent parts of a single rule, and the question asks to combine them. The complex type-3 nature is simplified to these two representative numbers.\n\nThe rule activation level is the t-norm of these values. A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\". Common t-norms include:\n1.  **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n2.  **Product t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n\nWithout specification, the \"minimum\" t-norm is the most frequently used.\n\n**Calculation using Minimum t-norm:**\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n**Calculation using Product t-norm:**\nActivation Level = `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the t-norm is not specified in the prompt, and the `min` function is the most common for this operation, `0.7` is the most probable answer.\n\nFinal conclusion based on this chain of reasoning will be the result of the `min` operation.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
