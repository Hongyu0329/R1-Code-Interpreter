    "The minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory depends on the nature of the interaction, specifically the number of fields that meet at a single vertex. The relationship between the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V) in a connected Feynman diagram is given by Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nL = I - V + 1\n\nFurthermore, for a scalar field theory with a self-interaction of the form $\\phi^n$, each vertex involves n fields. This means n lines meet at each vertex. If a diagram has V vertices and E external lines (representing incoming and outgoing particles), the total number of line ends is nV. These ends are either connected to form internal lines (propagators) or are left as external lines. Since each internal line connects two vertices, the following relationship holds:\n\nnV = 2I + E\n\nBy combining these two equations, we can determine the number of vertices required for a given number of loops and external lines. We are interested in the simplest possible diagrams, which are often vacuum diagrams with no external lines (E=0).\n\n### Case 1: $\\phi^4$ Theory\n\nIn a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex connects four lines (n=4). For a two-loop vacuum diagram (L=2, E=0), we have:\n\n1.  2I = 4V\n2.  L = I - V + 1\n\nSubstituting I = 2V into the loop equation:\n\n2 = 2V - V + 1\n2 = V + 1\nV = 1\n\nThus, in a $\\phi^4$ theory, it is possible to construct a two-loop diagram with just one vertex. This diagram is known as the \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram, where two of the four lines emerging from the vertex loop back to connect to the same vertex, forming two loops.\n\n### Case 2: $\\phi^3$ Theory\n\nIn a $\\phi^3$ theory, each vertex connects three lines (n=3). For a two-loop vacuum diagram (L=2, E=0):\n\n1.  2I = 3V\n2.  L = I - V + 1\n\nSubstituting I = 3V/2 into the loop equation:\n\n2 = (3V/2) - V + 1\n2 = V/2 + 1\n1 = V/2\nV = 2\n\nTherefore, a $\\phi^3$ theory requires a minimum of two vertices to form a two-loop diagram. A well-known example is the \"sunset\" diagram, which consists of two vertices connected by three internal lines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the possibilities, the absolute minimum number of vertices required to form a two-loop Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory is one, which is achievable in a $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n<<<1>>>"
