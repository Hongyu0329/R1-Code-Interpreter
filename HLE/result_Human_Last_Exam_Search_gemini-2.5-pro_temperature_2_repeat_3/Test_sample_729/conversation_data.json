    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, a power subgroup is a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all its elements for some integer k. The structure of Q128 is given by the presentation <x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>. The order of the element x is 64, and elements of the form xⁱy have an order of 4.\n\nThe power subgroups Gᵏ can be determined by considering two cases for the integer k.\n\n### Case 1: k is an odd integer\n\nFor any odd integer k, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements, Gᵏ, is the group G itself. This is because the k-th power of the generator x, which is xᵏ, will still generate the entire cyclic subgroup <x> since k is coprime to the order of x (64). Furthermore, the k-th power of an element of the form xⁱy will result in an element that, in combination with <x>, generates the entire group Q128. Thus, for any odd k, we get one power subgroup, which is Q128 itself.\n\n### Case 2: k is an even integer\n\nFor any even integer k, the subgroup Gᵏ is generated by the set of all elements {gᵏ | g ∈ Q128}.\nThe k-th power of an element xⁱ is (xⁱ)ᵏ = xⁱᵏ. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup <xᵏ>.\nThe k-th power of an element of the form xⁱy is (xⁱy)ᵏ. Since k is even, this can be written as ((xⁱy)²)ᵏᐟ² = (x³²)ᵏᐟ² = x¹⁶ᵏ.\nTherefore, for an even k, the power subgroup Gᵏ is generated by <xᵏ> and x¹⁶ᵏ. This is the cyclic subgroup <x<sup>gcd(k, 16k)</sup>> which simplifies to <xᵏ>.\n\nThe distinct subgroups of the form <xᵏ> are determined by the greatest common divisor of k and 64, i.e., <x<sup>gcd(k, 64)</sup>>. Since k is always even in this case, the possible values for gcd(k, 64) are the even divisors of 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Each of these even divisors gives a distinct cyclic subgroup:\n*   <x²>\n*   <x⁴>\n*   <x⁸>\n*   <x¹⁶>\n*   <x³²>\n*   <x⁶⁴> = {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThis gives a total of 6 distinct power subgroups for even values of k.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group Q128 is {Q128, <x²>, <x⁴>, <x⁸>, <x¹⁶>, <x³²>, {1}}.\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have 1 (from the odd powers) + 6 (from the even powers) = 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
