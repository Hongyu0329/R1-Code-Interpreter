    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the central copper atom. The two common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, each with a distinct molecular geometry and symmetry.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex has a copper ion in the +1 oxidation state. In this complex, the copper ion is coordinated by two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands, resulting in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Analysis of this structure reveals that the molecule possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄). Therefore, the point group for **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) is S₄**.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\nWhen copper is in the +2 oxidation state, as in bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II), the geometry around the copper ion is a distorted octahedron. This is often observed in crystal structures where anions like perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate occupy the axial positions. Crystallographic data for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate) and perchlorate salts show that the complex resides on a crystallographic inversion center. The presence of an inversion center as the principal symmetry element (besides identity) means the point group for **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) is Cᵢ**.\n\n<<<S₄ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) and Cᵢ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)>>>"
