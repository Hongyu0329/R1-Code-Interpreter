    "Phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors across its various pure allotropes: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that may appear yellow due to the presence of impurities or as it ages and degrades into red phosphorus, accelerated by light and heat. Therefore, both white and yellow are associated with this allotrope.\n\nRed phosphorus is more stable than white phosphorus and is dark red in color, sometimes with an iron-grey luster. It is formed by heating white phosphorus in the absence of air.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form that can be produced by heating red phosphorus to a high temperature. It is sometimes classified as a subset of red phosphorus but is also referred to as a distinct red/purple form.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite, and it is a good conductor of electricity. It is the least reactive of the allotropes. There are two forms of black phosphorus, α-black and β-black phosphorus.\n\nA more recently discovered allotrope is blue phosphorus. First predicted in 2014 and created in a lab in 2016, it exists as a two-dimensional material.\n\nWhile other allotropes and forms like gaseous diphosphorus exist, the distinctly colored solid allotropes that can be observed are white (which can also appear yellow), red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
