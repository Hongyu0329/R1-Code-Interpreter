    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of elliptic theta functions and modular forms. This is a classic result established by Gauss.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the product.**\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written in terms of $q$ as:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots$\n\n2.  **Relate the product to standard mathematical functions.**\n    This product is related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ and Jacobi theta functions. In the notation of $q$-Pochhammer symbols, it is $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$. The value of this product for specific values of $q$ (known as singular moduli) are well-known results in number theory.\n\n3.  **State the known result.**\n    For the specific case where $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the value of this infinite product has been determined by Gauss. It is a simple algebraic number. The result is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) = 2^{-1/8} $$\n\n4.  **Construct the Python code.**\n    The code will state the problem, show the equation with its closed-form expression, and then print the numerical value of this expression. The expression `2**(-1/8)` will be used to represent $2^{-1/8}$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The closed form of the product is a known result from number theory.\n    # It is equal to 2 raised to the power of -1/8.\n    \n    # Define the components of the final equation string\n    product_str = \"prod_{n=0 to inf}(1 - e^(-(2*n+1)*pi))\"\n    expression_str = \"2**(-1/8)\"\n    \n    # Calculate the numerical value\n    value = 2**(-1/8)\n    \n    # Print the equation\n    print(f\"The closed form of the infinite product is:\")\n    print(f\"{product_str} = {expression_str}\")\n    \n    # Print the numerical value\n    print(f\"\\nNumerical value:\")\n    print(value)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<2**(-1/8)>>>"
