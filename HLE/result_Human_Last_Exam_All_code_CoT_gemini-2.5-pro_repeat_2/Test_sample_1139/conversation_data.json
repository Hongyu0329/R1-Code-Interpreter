    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** The non-Grassman (i.e., bosonic) variables of a supersymmetric sigma-model parametrize the bosonic part of the model's target supermanifold. The number of variables is therefore the dimension of this bosonic manifold.\n2.  **Identify the Manifold for Class D:** For the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the bosonic part of the target space is the product of two symmetric spaces: a non-compact one and a compact one. The specific manifold is:\n    `M_B = [O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))] x [Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) x Sp(2n))]`\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these two spaces.\n    *   The dimension of the non-compact part, `O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`, is given by the formula `n^2`.\n    *   The dimension of the compact part, `Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) x Sp(2n))`, is given by the formula `4n^2`.\n    *   The total dimension is the sum: `n^2 + 4n^2 = 5n^2`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We are given `n = 2` replicas. The Python code will substitute this value into the formula, calculate the dimension of each part, and sum them to find the total number of variables. It will print out each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_class_d_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the bosonic sector of the\n    supersymmetric sigma-model for class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    n = 2\n\n    # The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables corresponds to the dimension\n    # of the bosonic part of the target supermanifold for the sigma-model.\n    # For symmetry class D, this manifold is a product of two symmetric spaces:\n    # M_B = [O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))] x [Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) x Sp(2n))]\n    # where 'n' is the number of replicas.\n\n    # We calculate the dimension of each part.\n\n    # Part 1: Non-compact sector O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))\n    # The dimension of this space is n^2.\n    dim_non_compact = n**2\n\n    # Part 2: Compact sector Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) x Sp(2n))\n    # The dimension of this space is 4*n^2.\n    dim_compact = 4 * n**2\n\n    # The total number of variables is the sum of the dimensions.\n    total_dim = dim_non_compact + dim_compact\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(\"The supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas\")\n    print(\"has a bosonic sector parametrized by a manifold with a dimension calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n} replicas:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of non-compact part (O({2*n})/(O({n})xO({n}))): n^2 = {n}^2 = {dim_non_compact}\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of compact part (Sp({4*n})/(Sp({2*n})xSp({2*n}))): 4*n^2 = 4*{n}^2 = {dim_compact}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is the sum of these dimensions.\")\n    print(f\"Total variables = {dim_non_compact} + {dim_compact} = {total_dim}\")\n\nsolve_class_d_variables()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
