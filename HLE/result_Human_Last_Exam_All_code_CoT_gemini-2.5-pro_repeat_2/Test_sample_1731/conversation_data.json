    "This problem requires us to derive the equilibrium expressions for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (the Bose case for light quanta). The theoretical justification for the methods used in statistical mechanics, like the principle of maximum entropy, comes from large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: We'll start from the premise that the equilibrium state of the system is the one that maximizes its entropy, a concept underpinned by large deviation theorems like Sanov's theorem. For a gas of photons (bosons), the number of particles is not conserved, so we maximize entropy subject only to the constraint of a fixed total energy `U`.\n2.  **Bose-Einstein Statistics**: This maximization procedure leads to the well-known Bose-Einstein distribution, which describes the average number of photons occupying a given energy state at a certain temperature `T`.\n3.  **Mean Energy Calculation**: To find the mean energy density `u = U/V`, we will integrate the energy of the photons over all possible energy states. This involves using the Bose-Einstein distribution and the density of states `g(E)` for photons in a three-dimensional volume. The result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density, which shows `u` is proportional to `T^4`.\n4.  **Entropy Calculation**: With the mean energy `U` determined, we can find the entropy `S` using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, `S = (U + PV)/T`. Since the pressure `P` of a photon gas is related to its energy density by `P = u/3`, this simplifies to `S = (4/3) * U / T`. From this, we can find the entropy density `s = S/V`, which will be proportional to `T^3`.\n5.  **Python Implementation**: The Python script will calculate the specific numerical coefficients for the final equations of `u(T)` and `s(T)` using high-precision values of fundamental physical constants. It will then print the final equations, showing both their symbolic form (which includes all the integer numbers from the derivation) and their final calculated form.\n\n```python\nimport math\n# Using scipy.constants for higher precision of physical constants\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Explanation ---\n# This script finds the equilibrium values for mean energy density (u) and entropy density (s)\n# for a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta).\n# The foundation for this calculation is the principle of maximum entropy, which is justified\n# by large deviation theorems (like Sanov's theorem) in statistical mechanics. The procedure is:\n# 1. Maximize the entropy for a Bose gas with no particle number conservation (chemical potential = 0)\n#    subject to a fixed total energy. This yields the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n# 2. Integrate the energy over all states using the Bose-Einstein distribution and the density of states\n#    for photons to find the total energy U. This results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density u = U/V.\n# 3.
