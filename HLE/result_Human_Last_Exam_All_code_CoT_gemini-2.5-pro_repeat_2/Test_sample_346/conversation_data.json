    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is a Church numeral represented by a very complex SKI combinator expression.\n\n2.  **SKI Combinators and Church Numerals:**\n    *   I need to use the reduction rules for SKI combinators:\n        *   `I x → x`\n        *   `K x y → x`\n        *   `S x y z → x z (y z)`\n    *   A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times: `n f x → f(f(...f(x)...))`.\n\n3.  **Strategy: Programmatic Reduction:**\n    *   The expression is far too complex to reduce reliably by hand. A single mistake in applying the rules would lead to a completely wrong result.\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform the SKI reduction automatically. This is the most robust and error-free method.\n\n4.  **Python Implementation Plan:**\n    *   **Data Structures:** I'll define classes to represent the combinators (`S`, `K`, `I`), variables (for `f` and `x`), and function application (`App(function, argument)`).\n    *   **Expression Tree:** I will manually construct the expression tree from the problem statement using these classes. This is safer than writing a full parser for this one-off task.\n    *   **Reduction Engine:** I'll implement a `reduce` function that repeatedly applies the SKI reduction rules to an expression tree until it can no longer be simplified (i.e., it's in \"normal form\"). I will use applicative-order reduction (arguments are reduced before the function is applied) as it's straightforward to implement.\n    *   **Finding `n`:**\n        1.  The expression given is the Church numeral `n` itself. To find its value, I need to see how it behaves when applied to `f` and `x`.\n        2.  I will create symbolic variables for `f` and `x`.\n        3.  I will apply the reduced expression `n` to `f` and `x`, creating the new expression `n(f)(x)`.\n        4.  I will reduce this new expression completely. The result should be a nested structure like `f(f(...(f(x))...))`.\n        5.  I will write a helper function to traverse this final structure and count the number of times `f` is applied. This count is `n`.\n    *   **Final Calculation:** Once `n` is determined, I will calculate `log_2(n)` using Python's `math` library and print the required numbers.\n\nThis programmatic approach will mechanize the complex reduction process, ensuring an accurate result.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for processing deep expression trees.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# 1.
