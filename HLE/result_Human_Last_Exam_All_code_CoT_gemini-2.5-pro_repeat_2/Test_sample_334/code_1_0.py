    """
    Analyzes the provided options against the cybersecurity requirements for biometric authentication.

    The core problem is that biometrics are 'unique but not secret'. We need a solution that addresses:
    1.  Prevention of spoofing/replay attacks.
    2.  An unwilling/coerced user will NOT authenticate.
    3.  Security remains even if biometric data is stolen.
    4.  Applicability to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    Let's evaluate the winning option: Strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

    - Requirement 1 (Spoofing/Replay): If an attacker spoofs the biometric (e.g., with a 3D-printed fingerprint), they still need the additional factors, like a secret PIN and a physical hardware token. The spoof attempt fails. This requirement is MET.

    - Requirement 2 (Coercion): If a user is kidnapped and forced to use their fingerprint, they can refuse to provide the secret PIN. This gives the unwilling user a way to consciously block the authentication. This requirement is MET.

    - Requirement 3 (Data Exposure): If an attacker steals the database of biometric templates, the data is useless on its own. The attacker would still need the user's PIN and their physical token to gain access. This requirement is MET.

    - Requirement 4 (Modality-Agnostic): This approach works with any biometric modality (face, voice, fingerprint, etc.) because the biometric serves as just one of the factors. This requirement is MET.

    Conclusion: Strong Multi-Factor Authentication is the only solution presented that comprehensively addresses all four requirements by complementing the 'what you are' factor of biometrics with 'what you know' (PIN) and 'what you have' (token) factors.
