    "Based on our current understanding of its material properties, the answer is no. Here is the detailed explanation:\n\nSpontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC, is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n\n1.  **Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:** Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, exist in several different atomic arrangements (polymorphs). The most commonly studied and synthesized forms, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are planar and possess a center of inversion in their crystal lattice.\n\n2.  **Second-Order Nonlinearity (χ⁽²⁾):** In materials with inversion symmetry, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾, is zero. Applying an electric field `E` to such a material produces the same physical state as applying an inverted field `-E`. However, the second-order polarization depends on the square of the field (`E²`), which does not change sign when the field is inverted. This contradiction can only be resolved if the second-order response is zero.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero. As SPDC is an effect that depends directly on χ⁽²⁾, these nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit it.\n\nIt is worth noting that this symmetry can be broken by external factors such as applying significant strain, introducing defects, or placing the nanosheet on a substrate. In such cases, a weak second-order nonlinear response might be induced, but it is not an intrinsic property of the ideal, free-standing material.\n\n<<<No>>>"
