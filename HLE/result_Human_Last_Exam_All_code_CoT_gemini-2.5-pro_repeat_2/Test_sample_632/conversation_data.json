This square had a unique architectural feature until 1950 when it was removed by the city administration.

    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific and unique architectural feature present in the Piazza della Rotonda until the mid-20th century.\n2.  I will confirm the year of its removal, which is stated as 1950 in the prompt.\n3.  Based on historical records, the feature in question was a ring of tram tracks that circled the central fountain.\n4.  I will then write a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will use the `print()` function to display the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about the\n    Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"a circular tramway track\"\n    year_removed = 1950\n    \n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in the year {year_removed} was {feature}.\")\n    print(\"This tram ring circled the central fountain and was dismantled to improve traffic and the general appearance of the square for the 1950 Holy Year.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<a circular tramway track>>>"
