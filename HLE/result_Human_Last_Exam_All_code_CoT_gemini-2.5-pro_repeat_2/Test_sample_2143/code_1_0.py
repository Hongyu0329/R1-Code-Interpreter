# The historical figure in question is the founder of psychoanalysis.
# His final major work, "Moses and Monotheism", delves into the origins of the Ten Commandments.
# In this work, he analyzes the psychological implications of the commandments,
# including the one against coveting material possessions and the one prohibiting representation.
# By creating a psychoanalytic theory (a new representation) of Moses and the commandments,
# he can be interpreted as "naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation".
