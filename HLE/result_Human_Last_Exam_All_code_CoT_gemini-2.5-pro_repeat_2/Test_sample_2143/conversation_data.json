    "The user is asking to identify a historical figure, \"HE\", based on an interpretation of his work by \"Veronika Campan\".\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Analyze the clues:**\n    *   \"at the end of HIS work\": This points to a specific, likely famous, written work.\n    *   \"addressed the issue of another's material possessions\": This is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment, \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house... nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\"\n    *   \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\": This refers to the Second Commandment, \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\"\n    *   The reference to \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\" suggests that the figure \"HE\" is a subject of modern academic or psychoanalytic study. Veronika Campan is a scholar known for her work on psychoanalysis, particularly relating to Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the clues:** The figure in question wrote a famous work analyzing the Ten Commandments. This work itself creates a new interpretation or \"representation\" of the lawgiver (Moses) and the laws, thereby \"ignoring\" the very prohibition against representation that is part of those laws. This intellectual move is characteristic of Sigmund Freud, who wrote the book *Moses and Monotheism* at the end of his life and career. In this book, he applies psychoanalysis to the origins of monotheism and the figure of Moses, thus creating a new \"representation\" of him.\n\n3.  **Formulate the answer:** The person described is Sigmund Freud.\n\n4.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script that prints his full name as requested.\n\n```python\n# The historical figure in question is the founder of psychoanalysis.\n# His final major work, \"Moses and Monotheism\", delves into the origins of the Ten Commandments.\n# In this work, he analyzes the psychological implications of the commandments,\n# including the one against coveting material possessions and the one prohibiting representation.\n# By creating a psychoanalytic theory (a new representation) of Moses and the commandments,\n# he can be interpreted as \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\".\nhis_full_name = \"Sigmund Freud\"\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
