    # Step 1: Analyze the function l2(v).
    # The numerator of l2(v) contains the product: ∏_{i=1 to n} ∏_{j≥i to n} sinh(|v_i - v_j|/2).
    # This product includes terms where i = j.
    # For any i, the term for j=i is sinh(|v_i - v_i|/2) = sinh(0) = 0.
    # Because one of the terms in the product is zero, the entire product is zero.
    # The denominator is a product of Gamma functions with positive arguments, so it is non-zero.
    # Therefore, l2(v) is identically 0 for any vector v.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the PDF f(v).
    # f(v) is defined as a product involving l2(...).
    # Since l2(...) is always 0, f(v) is always 0.
    # A function that is 0 everywhere cannot be a probability density function.
    # This means the sampling procedure is ill-defined.
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate the consequences for p_k and d_k.
    # Since there is no valid probability distribution, there is no actual randomness.
    # The "probability density function" p_k(z) can be considered 0 everywhere.
    p_k_at_1 = 0
    
    # The differential entropy (d_k) measures uncertainty. For a non-random process, entropy is 0.
    d_k = 0
    
    # The constant term in the expression for l(k)
    constant_term = 1
    
    # Step 4: Calculate l(k).
    # l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1
    result = p_k_at_1 + 2 * d_k - constant_term
