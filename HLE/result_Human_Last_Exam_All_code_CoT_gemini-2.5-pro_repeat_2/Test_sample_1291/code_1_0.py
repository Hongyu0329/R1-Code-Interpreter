    The problem asks to identify the types of points on the Berkovich projective line that are isomorphic to a specific quotient space.

    1.  **Understanding the Points on the Berkovich Line over C_p:**
        The Berkovich projective line over the p-adic complex numbers, C_p, has its points classified into types. Due to C_p being algebraically closed with a dense value group, the classification simplifies:
        -   **Type 1:** Classical points, corresponding to elements of P^1(C_p) = C_p U {infinity}. Geometrically, these are disks of radius 0.
        -   **Type 2:** Points corresponding to closed disks D(a, r) = {x in C_p : |x-a|_p <= r}, for any center a in C_p and any real radius r > 0.
        -   **Types 3 and 4:** Over C_p, these types are subsumed into Type 2. Type 3's distinction based on the value group vanishes, and Type 4 (the Gauss point) is just a specific Type 2 point like D(0,1). There are also limit points due to non-spherical completeness, but they are not parameterized by single objects like disks.

    2.  **Parameterizing the Points:**
        The problem gives us the space C_p^x * C_p, with points (z_0, z) where z_0 is non-zero. We need to see what kind of Berkovich points these can represent.
        A point of Type 2 is defined by a center 'a' and a radius 'r'. Our space of pairs (z_0, z) has two degrees of freedom, which suggests a mapping.
        A natural mapping from our space to the set of Type 2 points is:
        -   Map (z_0, z) to the disk D(a, r) where:
            -   Center a = z / z_0
            -   Radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p
        This mapping is a bijection. For any disk D(a, r), we can find a corresponding (z_0, z). For example, choose any z_0 with |z_0|_p = 1/r, and set z = a * z_0.

    3.  **Conclusion on Point Types:**
        -   The space C_p^x * C_p naturally parameterizes the set of all Type 2 points.
        -   It cannot produce Type 1 points, as this would require a radius of 0, meaning |z_0|_p would have to be infinite, which is not possible for z_0 in C_p.
        -   The problem introduces an equivalence relation on the space of parameters (z_0, z). This means some of these Type 2 disks are grouped together.
        -   However, the process of identifying some Type 2 points with others still results in a set of points of Type 2. The fundamental nature of the points being parameterized does not change.
        -   Therefore, the subset of the Berkovich line mentioned in the problem must consist of points of Type 2.
