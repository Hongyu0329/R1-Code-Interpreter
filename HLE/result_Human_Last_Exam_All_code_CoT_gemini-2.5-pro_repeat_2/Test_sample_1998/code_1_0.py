    This script determines the smallest natural number N with the property that,

    the map defined by Q is surjective.

    # Step 1: Identify the field K and its properties.
    # The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    # whose residue field is a local field of characteristic 2.
    # This is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.

    # Step 2: Determine the u-invariant of K.
    # The u-invariant, u(K), is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic
    # quadratic form over K. For 2-dimensional local fields of characteristic 2,
    # a theorem by Parimala and Suresh (2010) shows that the u-invariant is 8.
    u_K = 8

    print(f"The u-invariant of the field K is u(K) = {u_K}.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the condition for N > u(K).
    # If N is greater than u(K), any quadratic form in N variables over K
    # must be isotropic (i.e., not anisotropic).
    # Therefore, the set of anisotropic N-dimensional quadratic forms is empty.
    # The condition is "for every anisotropic quadratic form...", which is
    # vacuously true for an empty set.
    # This implies that the smallest N cannot be larger than u(K) + 1.
    N_upper_bound = u_K + 1

    print(f"For any N > {u_K}, the condition is vacuously true.")
    print(f"This means the answer is at most {N_upper_bound}.")

    # Step 4: Analyze the case N = u(K).
    # We check if every anisotropic form of dimension N = 8 is surjective (universal).
    # For fields like K, any anisotropic form of dimension u(K) is known to be
    # similar to a Pfister form. In this case, it's a 3-fold Pfister form.
    # A fundamental theorem in quadratic form theory states that an anisotropic
    # Pfister form is never universal. Its value set is a proper subgroup of K*.
    # Therefore, there exists an 8-dimensional anisotropic form which is not surjective.
    
    print(f"\nFor N = {u_K}, there exists an anisotropic quadratic form (a Pfister form) that is not surjective.")
    print(f"This means N = {u_K} is not the answer.")

    # Step 5: Conclude the result.
    # Since the property does not hold for N=8, but holds for N=9,
    # the smallest such natural number is 9.
    # The final equation for N is:
    N = u_K + 1

    print("\nThe smallest natural number N is given by the equation: N = u(K) + 1")
    print(f"Substituting the value of u(K), we get: N = {u_K} + 1")
    print(f"The smallest such natural number N is {N}.")
