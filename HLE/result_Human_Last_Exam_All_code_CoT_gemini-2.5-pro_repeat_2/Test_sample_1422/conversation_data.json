    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** The problem involves topological properties of Feynman diagrams. Two key formulas relate the number of loops (L), vertices (V), internal lines (I), external lines (E), and the number of lines per vertex (n).\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n\n2.  **Set Up the Problem:** We are given that the diagram has two loops, so `L = 2`.\n\n3.  **Solve for V:** Combine the two formulas to derive an expression for the number of vertices (V) in terms of the interaction type (n) and the number of external lines (E).\n    *   From the first formula: `I = L + V - 1`. With `L=2`, this becomes `I = V + 1`.\n    *   Substitute this into the second formula: `n * V = 2 * (V + 1) + E`.\n    *   Rearrange to solve for V: `V = (E + 2) / (n - 2)`.\n\n4.  **Minimize V:** To find the minimum possible number of vertices, we need to analyze the derived formula `V = (E + 2) / (n - 2)`.\n    *   `V` must be a positive integer.\n    *   The number of external lines `E` must be a non-negative integer (`E >= 0`). To minimize `V`, we should minimize the numerator, which means choosing the smallest possible `E`. The minimum is `E=0` (for vacuum diagrams).\n    *   The number of lines per vertex `n` depends on the interaction term (e.g., `φ^n`). For an interacting theory, we must have `n > 2`, so `n >= 3`. To minimize `V`, we should maximize the denominator `(n - 2)`.\n\n5.  **Test Cases:** We will test the most common interaction types to find the minimum `V`.\n    *   **Case 1: `φ^3` theory (n=3):** Calculate `V` using `n=3` and `E=0`.\n    *   **Case 2: `φ^4` theory (n=4):** Calculate `V` using `n=4` and `E=0`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Compare the results from the test cases. The smallest integer `V` found will be the answer. The code will print this entire derivation process.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the minimum number of vertices required for a two-loop\n# Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory.\n#\n\n# Step 1: State the fundamental formulas for Feynman diagram topology.\nprint(\"To solve this, we use two fundamental topological relations for a connected Feynman diagram:\")\nprint(\"1.
