# This script calculates the final output based on the provided quantum gate rules.

# According to the logic, after the first pass through gates A and B,
# the state becomes a classical 1. This state is then fed into Gate C.
# The output of Gate C on an input of 1 is also 1.
# This process repeats for all three "ABC" cycles. Therefore, the input
# to the final Gate C is a classical 1.

# To apply the formula of Gate C, we represent the classical bit '1'
# as the quantum state |1⟩.
# The state |1⟩ can be written as 0|0⟩ + 1|1⟩.
# From this, we identify the amplitudes for the Gate C formula.

# Amplitude of the |0⟩ state component
alpha = 0.0

# Amplitude of the |1⟩ state component
beta = 1.0

# The formula for Gate C is: |amplitude of |0⟩|² × 0 + |amplitude of |1⟩|² × 1
final_output = (abs(alpha)**2 * 0) + (abs(beta)**2 * 1)
