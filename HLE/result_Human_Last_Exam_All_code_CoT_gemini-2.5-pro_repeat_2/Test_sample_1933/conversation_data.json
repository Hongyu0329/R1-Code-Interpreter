    "This problem asks for the VC dimension of a specific fragment of first-order logic. I will first explain the reasoning step-by-step and then provide a Python script that demonstrates the crucial part of the proof.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Logic and Concepts:**\n    The schema $S$ has 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n    The logic fragment is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A concept is a set of domain elements defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$.\n    Any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment can be shown to be logically equivalent to a formula of the form:\n    $$ \\psi(x) \\land \\chi $$\n    where $\\psi(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$ (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$), and $\\chi$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables, e.g., $\\exists y. P_2(y)$).\n\n2.  **Characterize the Concept Class:**\n    In any given model (which defines the interpretation of the predicates over a universe $U$), the sentence $\\chi$ is either true or false.\n    *   If $\\chi$ is true, the concept defined by $\\phi(x)$ is the set of elements satisfying $\\psi(x)$.\n    *   If $\\chi$ is false, the concept is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\n    The formula $\\psi(x)$ is a conjunction of some of the predicates $P_1, ..., P_4$. For any subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we can form the formula $\\psi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. The concept defined by this formula is the intersection of the extensions of the corresponding predicates, i.e., $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n    Therefore, for any model, the class of all definable concepts is a subset of the collection of sets formed by all possible intersections of the four predicate extensions $\\{P_1^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_2^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_3^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_4^{\\mathcal{M}}\\}$, plus the empty set.\n\n3.  **Find the Upper Bound for the VC Dimension:**\n    There are 4 predicates, so we can form $2^4 = 16$ distinct conjunctions (including the empty conjunction, which corresponds to the formula $\\top$ and defines the entire universe). This means that in any model, we can define at most 16 distinct concepts.\n    A fundamental result in VC theory (a consequence of Sauer's Lemma) states that if a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ can shatter a set of size $d$, then the size of the class must be at least $2^d$.\n    In our case, $|\\mathcal{C}| \\le 16$. So, we must have $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$.\n    This establishes an upper bound: the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n4.  **Find the Lower Bound for the VC Dimension:**\n    To show the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to demonstrate that there exists a model and a set of 4 points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, that can be shattered.\n    To shatter $X$, we must be able to generate every one of its $2^4 = 16$ subsets using the formulas from our logic.\n    We can achieve this by defining the predicate extensions in a specific way. Let the universe be $X$ itself. For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, define the extension of predicate $P_i$ as $P_i^{\\mathcal{M}} = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\n    Now, for any desired subset $Y \\subseteq X$, let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. The formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$ defines the concept $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = Y$.\n    Since we can construct a formula for every subset of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\nThe following Python code provides a computational demonstration of the lower bound proof by implementing the shattering of 4 points.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef demonstrate_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that the VC dimension of the given logic fragment is 4.\n\n    The logic is explained in the text above.
