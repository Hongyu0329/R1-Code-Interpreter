    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use the Whitehead formula, which relates the Hopf charge to the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points in the target space (the 2-sphere, S²).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the Hopf charge `H` as the linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)` of two curves, `C₁` and `C₂`, which are the preimages of two chosen points on S².\n2.  Choose two convenient points on S². A good choice is the South Pole, `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the equator, `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`.\n3.  Calculate the preimage `C₁ = n⁻¹(p₁)`. This is the set of points `(x, y, z)` where the vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` equals `p₁`.\n4.  Calculate the preimage `C₂ = n⁻¹(p₂)`.\n5.  Determine the linking number of the two resulting curves, `C₁` and `C₂`. This can be found by counting the number of times one curve pierces a surface bounded by the other curve.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Define curves as preimages**\n\nWe will find the preimages of `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)` (South Pole) and `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the preimage of the South Pole (C₁)**\n\nThe vector `n` equals `p₁` when `nz = -1`.\n*   `nz = cos(G) = -1`\n*   This implies `G = π`.\n*   From the definition `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, we have `π = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, which simplifies to `1 = exp(-10 * r2)`.\n*   This requires `-10 * r2 = 0`, so `r2 = 0`.\n*   The definition of `r2` is `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)² + z*z)`.\n*   `r2 = 0` means `(x*x + y*y - 0.5)² = 0` and `z*z = 0`.\n*   This gives us `z = 0` and `x*x + y*y = 0.5`.\n\nSo, the preimage `C₁` is a circle in the `z=0` plane with radius `sqrt(0.5)`.\n`C₁: x² + y² = 0.5, z = 0`\n\n**Step 4: Find the preimage of the point (1, 0, 0) on the equator (C₂)**\n\nThe vector `n` equals `p₂` when `nx = 1`, `ny = 0`, and `nz = 0`.\n*   `nz = cos(G) = 0` implies `G = π/2`.\n*   Using the definition of `G`, we get `π/2 = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, which means `exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5`.\n*   Taking the natural logarithm: `-10 * r2 = ln(0.5) = -ln(2)`.\n*   So, `r2 = ln(2) / 10`. Let's call this constant `R_h`.\n*   Squaring this gives `r2² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n*   From the definition of `r2`, we have the equation `(x*x + y*y - 0.5)² + z*z = (ln(2)/10)²`. This equation defines a torus.\n\nNow we use the other conditions:\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f) = 0`. Since `G = π/2`, `sin(G) = 1`, so this simplifies to `sin(f) = 0`. This means `f=kπ`, so `y=0`.\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f) = 1`. With `sin(G)=1`, this gives `cos(f)=1`. This means `f=2kπ`, which corresponds to `y=0` and `x > 0`.\n\nSo, the preimage `C₂` is the curve defined by the torus equation, restricted to the half-plane `y=0, x>0`.\n`C₂: (x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)², y = 0, x > 0`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)`**\n\nTo find the linking number, we can count how many times the curve `C₂` pierces the disk `D₁` bounded by the circle `C₁`.\n*   The curve `C₁` is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   The disk `D₁` it bounds is `x² + y² ≤ 0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   The curve `C₂` lies in the `y=0` plane. We need to find where it intersects the `z=0` plane, which is the plane containing the disk `D₁`.\n*   On `C₂`, set `z=0`: `(x² - 0.5)² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n*   Taking the square root: `x² - 0.5 = ± ln(2)/10`.\n*   This gives two possible values for `x²`:\n    *   `x₁² = 0.5 - ln(2)/10`\n    *   `x₂² = 0.5 + ln(2)/10`\n\nNow, let's check if these intersection points lie inside or outside the disk `D₁`. The condition for a point `(x,0,0)` to be inside `D₁` is `x² ≤ 0.5`.\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, so `ln(2)/10 ≈ 0.0693`.\n*   `x₁² ≈ 0.5 - 0.0693 = 0.4307`. Since `0.4307 < 0.5`, this point is **inside** the disk `D₁`.\n*   `x₂² ≈ 0.5 + 0.0693 = 0.5693`. Since `0.5693 > 0.5`, this point is **outside** the disk `D₁`.\n\nThe curve `C₂` pierces the plane of the disk `D₁` at two points. One piercing point is inside the disk and one is outside. Therefore, the curve `C₂` passes through the surface `D₁` exactly once.\n\nThe linking number is 1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two points.\n# Let's choose the South Pole (0,0,-1) and an equatorial point (1,0,0).\n\n# Preimage of South Pole: nz = cos(G) = -1 => G = pi\n# G = pi * exp(-10*r2) => exp(-10*r2) = 1 => r2 = 0\n# r2^2 = (x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z = 0\n# This means z=0 and x*x+y*y-0.5 = 0.\n# So, C1 is the circle: x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 in the z=0 plane.\nradius_C1_sq = 0.5\nprint(f\"The first curve, C1 (preimage of the South Pole), is a circle in the z=0 plane with equation x^2 + y^2 = {radius_C1_sq}.\")\n\n# Preimage of (1,0,0): nz = cos(G) = 0 => G = pi/2\n# G = pi * exp(-10*r2) => exp(-10*r2) = 0.5 => r2 = -ln(0.5)/10 = ln(2)/10\n# Also nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1.
