    "To solve this problem, we need to compare two strings lexicographically while ignoring the case of the letters. A straightforward way to do this is to convert both strings to the same case (e.g., lowercase) and then perform a standard lexicographical comparison.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Read the two strings provided as input.\n2.  Convert both of these strings to their lowercase equivalents. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive as required (e.g., 'A' becomes 'a' and is treated the same as 'a').\n3.  Compare the two new lowercase strings.\n4.  If the first lowercase string is lexicographically smaller than the second, print \"-1\".\n5.  If the first lowercase string is lexicographically larger than the second, print \"1\".\n6.  If the strings are identical, print \"0\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them case-insensitively, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input and remove any trailing whitespace.\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Read the second string from standard input and remove any trailing whitespace.\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n    \n    # Compare the lowercase strings and print the result.\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
