    # 'brave', 'creative', and 'humble', forces a situation that cannot be reconciled
    # with the proposition. The premises constrain the world in such a way that
    # the proposition "everyone in the room is a tall person" cannot be true.
    # For instance, if we assume the proposition is true (everyone is tall),
    # Premise 11 forces everyone to be not happy. This removes a path to contradiction,
    # but other paths through premises like P2 and P6 create new constraints that
    # ultimately clash. The entire system of premises contradicts the proposition.
