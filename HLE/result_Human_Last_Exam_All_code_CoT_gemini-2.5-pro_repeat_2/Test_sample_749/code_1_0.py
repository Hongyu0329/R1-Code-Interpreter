# The problem is to calculate lim_{h->0} P[site 0 is visited by infinitely many different particles].

# Let E be the event that site 0 is visited by infinitely many particles.
# Let N be the number of distinct particles visiting site 0. E is the event N = infinity.
# A necessary condition for P(N = infinity) > 0 is that E[N] must be infinite.
# We will calculate lim_{h->0} E[N]. If this limit is finite, then lim_{h->0} P(E) = 0.

# As h -> 0, the environment becomes all-blue with probability 1 for any finite region.
# In an all-blue environment, the jump probability to the right is 4/5.
# Let q_i be the probability that a lineage starting at i visits site 0.
# For small h, in an all-blue environment, q_i is approximately (1/4)^i.
# The initial particle starts at position 3, so its lineage visits 0 with probability q_3.
# q_3 is approximately (1/4)^3.
q_3_limit = (1/4)**3

# By the many-to-one principle, the expected number of particles visiting 0 is:
# E[N] = q_3 + h * sum_{t=0 to infinity} E[q_{X_t}]
# where X_t is the position of the original particle at time t.
# We found that E[q_{X_t}] is approximately q_3 * (1-h)^t.
# So, E[N] approx q_3 + h * q_3 * sum_{t=0 to infinity} (1-h)^t
# The geometric series sum is 1/h.
# E[N] approx q_3 + h * q_3 * (1/h) = 2 * q_3.

# The limit of the expected number of particles is:
# lim_{h->0} E[N] = 2 * lim_{h->0} q_3
limit_E_N = 2 * q_3_limit

# Since the limit of the expectation is a finite number, the probability of the number of
# particles being infinite must be 0.
