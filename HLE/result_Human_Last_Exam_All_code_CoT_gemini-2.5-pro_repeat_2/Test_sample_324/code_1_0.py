    # In speculative decoding, the acceptance probability for a drafted token
    # is determined by the probabilities assigned by the target and draft models.
    # Let's denote these probabilities as P_target and P_draft.

    # The formula for acceptance probability of a single token is:
    # Acceptance_Probability = min(1, P_target / P_draft)

    # The problem describes a sanity check where the same model is used for both
    # the draft and target roles.
    # This implies that for any token, the probability assigned by the draft model
    # is identical to the probability assigned by the target model.
    # So, P_target = P_draft.

    # Let's represent this relationship. Since they are equal, their ratio is 1.
    # (Assuming the probability of a drafted token is non-zero, which it must be).
    ratio = 1

    # Now, we plug this ratio into the acceptance probability formula.
    acceptance_rate = min(1, ratio)

    # The final equation for the acceptance rate is thus determined.
    # We print the components of this logical deduction.
