    # on the plane with a specific property. The property is that for every
    # direction, there exists a line in that direction such that the 1D measure
    # (length) of its intersection with C is at least 1/2.

    # Based on principles of convex geometry, the set with the minimal area that
    # satisfies this condition is a Reuleaux triangle of constant width w = 1/2.

    # The area of a Reuleaux triangle of width w is given by the formula:
    # Area = (pi - sqrt(3)) * w^2 / 2.
    
    # For this problem, w = 1/2.

    # We will now calculate this value.
