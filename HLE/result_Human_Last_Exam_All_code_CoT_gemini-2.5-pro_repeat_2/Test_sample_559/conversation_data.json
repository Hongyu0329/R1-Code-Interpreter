    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System and Find Equilibria**: The first step is to understand the given system of differential equations. We find the equilibrium points (where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$) to understand the long-term behavior of the system.\n2.  **Classify the Equilibria**: We use the Jacobian matrix to linearize the system around each equilibrium point and classify their stability. This analysis will identify if there are any saddle points, which are crucial for finding separatrices.\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix**: A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors. In many systems, the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point act as separatrices.\n4.  **Find the Equation of the Separatrix**: We look for an invariant curve passing through the saddle point. An invariant curve is a line or curve that is itself a trajectory of the system. We can find this by either solving the differential equation for the phase portrait, $\\frac{dd}{du}$, or by guessing a simple functional form and verifying it.\n5.  **Verification**: We will test a hypothesized simple polynomial relationship, $d = f(u)$, by substituting it into the original system of differential equations to see if it holds true for all time.\n6.  **Confirmation as Separatrix**: Once an invariant curve is found, we confirm it's a separatrix by showing it passes through a saddle point. An invariant curve passing through a saddle must be one of its manifolds (stable or unstable), which are by definition separatrices.\n7.  **Final Output**: The final step is to create a Python script that prints the derived equation of the separatrix, explicitly showing the numerical values involved as requested.\n\nFollowing these steps, I have found the equilibrium points to be $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$. The point $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point. By testing simple polynomial forms, I found that the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system. This curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ and also through the origin $(0, 0)$. An invariant curve that contains a saddle point is a separatrix. Therefore, the separatrix for this system is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n```python\n# The separatrix of the system is a curve described by an equation relating d and u.\n# Through analysis of the system's phase portrait, the separatrix is identified as an\n# invariant manifold passing through a saddle point.\n# This curve was found to be d = -u^2.\n\n# We define the coefficient and the power for this equation.\ncoefficient = -1\npower = 2\n\n# Now, we print the final equation. The numbers that define the equation,\n# the coefficient and the power, are explicitly part of the output string.\nprint(f\"The equation for the separatrix is d = ({coefficient}) * u**({power})\")\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
