    "My plan to determine the oligomeric state of the protein is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** A coiled-coil sequence is defined by a seven-amino-acid repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The core of the structure is formed by residues at the `a` and `d` positions, which are typically hydrophobic. I will analyze the given sequence by testing all seven possible starting positions (phasings) for this repeat.\n2.  **Score Each Phasing:** For each of the seven possible phasings, I will identify the amino acids that fall into the `a` and `d` positions. I will score each phasing based on how many of these core positions are occupied by hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, W). The phasing with the highest score is the most likely correct one.\n3.  **Analyze the Best Phasing:** Once the best phasing is identified, I will examine the specific pattern of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions.\n4.  **Apply Packing Principles:** The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is determined by how efficiently the side chains of the `a` and `d` residues can pack together (\"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n    *   **Dimer/Trimer:** Typically requires large hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions. A polar residue in the core is generally destabilizing, especially in a trimer where three such residues would be forced together.\n    *   **Tetramer:** Can accommodate different patterns, including having polar residues at a core position. A tetrameric arrangement can often minimize the energetic penalty of a buried polar group better than a dimer or trimer.\n5.  **Determine the Oligomeric State:** Based on the specific `a` and `d` pattern, I will deduce the most likely oligomeric state that provides the most stable packing arrangement. I will provide Python code to automate this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to determine its likely oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    hydrophobic = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W'}\n    heptad_map = \"abcdefg\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the sequence to find the correct heptad repeat phasing.\")\n    print(\"Sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    best_phasing_info = {\n        \"start_pos_name\": None,\n        \"score\": -1,\n        \"a_residues\": [],\n        \"d_residues\": [],\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through all 7 possible phasings\n    # i=0 means sequence[0] is 'a', i=1 means it's 'b', etc.\n    for i in range(7):\n        current_a = []\n        current_d = []\n        score = 0\n        start_pos_name = heptad_map[i]\n        \n        # In our mapping, 'a' corresponds to index 0, and 'd' to index 3\n        # A residue at sequence index `k` will have a heptad position of (k + offset) % 7\n        # If sequence[0] is at heptad pos `i`, then the position of sequence[k] is (k - i) % 7.\n        # Let's use a simpler mapping: position of seq[k] is (k + phase_offset) % 7\n        # If G (k=0) is 'a', offset=0.
