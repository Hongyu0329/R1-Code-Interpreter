    "To decode the word, we need to interpret the visual pattern of 't' and 'b' characters. This type of puzzle, often called a \"t-b puzzle\", works by using 't' to represent a drawn segment (\"there\") and 'b' to represent a blank segment. The overall structure describes letters on a grid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to decode the word:\n1.  **Reconstruct the Grid**: The `verbatim` block in the input preserves the exact spacing. We can map this layout to a 2D grid. The structure consists of three main horizontal lines and two vertical columns of characters.\n2.  **Interpret 't' and 'b'**: 't' means a segment is \"on\" or drawn, while 'b' means it is \"off\" or blank.\n3.  **Render the Image**: We will write a Python script to create this grid and then print it out, replacing 't' with a visible character like '#' and 'b' with a space.\n4.  **Identify the Letters**: By observing the rendered image, we can recognize the letters that make up the encoded word.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these steps and print the final decoded image.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the t-b puzzle by reconstructing the grid and rendering the letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The puzzle input is laid out in a specific grid structure.\n    # We represent this structure from the verbatim block.\n    # The grid has 13 rows.
