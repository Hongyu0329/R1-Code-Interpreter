# Step 1: Interpret S = SNYWR
# We assume S is the sum of the alphabetical positions of the letters (A=1, Z=26).
# S=19, N=14, Y=25, W=23, R=18
# S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99
S = 99

# Step 2: Define the given values for the triangle
# BC = a = S
# angle B = 30 degrees, so sin(B) = 0.5
# AC = b (the side we are analyzing)
# AB = c (the side with two possible values)

# Step 3: Apply the condition for the ambiguous case (SSA) for two triangles.
# For two possible values of side AB, the length of side AC must satisfy:
# BC * sin(B) < AC < BC
# S * 0.5 < AC < S

# Step 4: Calculate the bounds for AC
lower_bound = S * 0.5
upper_bound = S

# Step 5: Count the number of integers within these bounds.
# The smallest integer value for AC is the first integer greater than the lower bound.
min_AC = math.floor(lower_bound) + 1

# The largest integer value for AC is the last integer less than the upper bound.
max_AC = upper_bound - 1

# The number of integer values is max_AC - min_AC + 1.
count = max_AC - min_AC + 1

# Step 6: Print the results clearly
