    # If they were the same tree (say, A), the child's position would be on
    # line(A, E) and line(A, F). Since A, E, and F are not collinear,
    # the only intersection point is A itself. A child cannot be at the same
    # position as a tree. Therefore, the blocking trees must be different.

    # a unique position for a child. The problem asks for the maximum possible
    # number, which assumes the trees can be placed such that all these
    # potential positions are valid and don't cause other visibility issues.
    # The total number is the number of permutations of choosing 2 trees from 4.
