    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. This is equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of these quadratic forms under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R$. There are $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ such forms.\n\nTwo forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible matrix $T \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T(v))$ for all vectors $v = (x, y)^T$.\n\nA direct, analytical classification is quite complicated because $R$ is not a field and has zero divisors (e.g., $2 \\times 4 = 0$). A computational approach is more straightforward.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  **Represent Forms and Transformations**: A quadratic form is represented by a tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`. An invertible linear transformation is a 2x2 matrix $T$ with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is a unit (i.e., one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$).\n\n2.  **Generate All Forms and Transformations**: The script will first generate all 512 possible forms and the full group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Define the Group Action**: The transformation of a form $Q(x,y)$ by a matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ results in a new form $Q'(x', y') = a'x'^2 + b'x'y' + c'y'^2$. The new coefficients are derived from substituting $x = px' + qy'$ and $y = rx' + sy'$ into $Q(x,y)$. The formulas are:\n    *   $a' = ap^2 + bpr + cr^2 \\pmod 8$\n    *   $b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs \\pmod 8$\n    *   $c' = aq^2 + bqs + cs^2 \\pmod 8$\n\n4.  **Count the Orbits**: To find the number of equivalence classes, we count the number of orbits. The script iterates through all forms in lexicographical order. For each form, if it hasn't been seen before (i.e., isn't part of an already-found orbit), it's considered a canonical representative of a new class. We then compute its entire orbit and mark all forms in that orbit as \"processed\". This ensures we count each class exactly once.\n\nThe final count of these canonical representatives is the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Generate the group GL(2, Z/N Z)\n    matrices = []\n    units = {i for i in range(N) if math.gcd(i, N) == 1}\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        matrices.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Step 2: Generate all possible quadratic forms (a, b, c)\n    all_forms = set()\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    # Step 3: Count the orbits by finding canonical representatives\n    processed_forms = set()\n    num_classes = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all forms in a fixed (lexicographical) order.\n    sorted_all_forms = sorted(list(all_forms))\n\n    for q_candidate in sorted_all_forms:\n        # If this form is already in an orbit we've found, skip it.\n        if q_candidate in processed_forms:\n            continue\n        \n        # Otherwise, this is a new canonical representative (the first one\n        # we've encountered in its orbit because of the sorted iteration).\n        num_classes += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the orbit of this representative...\n        a, b, c = q_candidate\n        orbit = set()\n        for T in matrices:\n            p, q = T[0][0], T[0][1]\n            r, s = T[1][0], T[1][1]\n            \n            a_new = (a * p**2 + b * p * r + c * r**2) % N\n            b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % N\n            c_new = (a * q**2 + b * q * s + c * s**2) % N\n            \n            orbit.add((a_new, b_new, c_new))\n        \n        # ...and mark all its members as processed.\n        processed_forms.update(orbit)\n            \n    print(num_classes)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<58>>>"
