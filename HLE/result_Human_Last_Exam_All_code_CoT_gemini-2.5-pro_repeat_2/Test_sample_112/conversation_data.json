    "This is a literary question rather than a computational one. The poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre is preserved in a single manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, which dates from the first half of the fifteenth century. This manuscript is an anthology containing several other important Middle English works. My plan is to provide a Python script that will print the name of the specific book of manners found in this same manuscript.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_of_manners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the user's literary question.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_in_question = \"Sir Launfal\"\n    manuscript_name = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    book_of_manners = \"How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter\"\n\n    print(f\"The poem '{poem_in_question}' is preserved in the manuscript {manuscript_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it is a book of manners, or courtesy book, titled '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_book_of_manners()\n```\n<<<How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter>>>"
