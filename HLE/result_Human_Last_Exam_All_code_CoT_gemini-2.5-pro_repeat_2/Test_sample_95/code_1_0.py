    fact_2 = "This was widely mistranslated as 'canals,' implying artificial structures."
    fact_3 = "Many astronomers in places with poor atmospheric conditions (like smoky cities) could not see them, leading to the theory that they were an optical illusion or a product of the observer's imagination."
