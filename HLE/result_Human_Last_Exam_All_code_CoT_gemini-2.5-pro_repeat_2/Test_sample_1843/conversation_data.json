    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** Find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n    We need this lcm to be $6$.\n4.  **Count Component Characters:** For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to count the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides $6$. Let's call this count $c_{p^a}$.\n5.  **Combine the Counts:** We will form tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ of these allowed primitive characters. The total number of such tuples is the product $c_{p_1^{a_1}} \\times c_{p_2^{a_2}} \\times \\cdots \\times c_{p_r^{a_r}}$.\n6.  **Verify the LCM:** We must ensure that for any such tuple, the lcm of the orders is exactly $6$. We can do this by showing the lcm is always a multiple of $2$ and $3$, and since all orders divide $6$, the lcm must be exactly $6$.\n\nThis process will give us the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order $6$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary {p: a}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef get_primitive_orders(p, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of possible orders for primitive characters modulo p^a.\n    \"\"\"\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: return [] # No primitive characters mod 2\n        if a == 2: return [2] # Only one primitive char mod 4, order 2\n        # For p=2, a>=3, the group is C_2 x C_{2^{a-2}}.\n        # Primitive characters are those not induced from mod 2^{a-1}.\n        # This is more complex, but not needed for N=36036.\n        # N has a factor of 2^2, not higher powers of 2.\n        return []\n\n    # For odd primes p\n    if a == 1:\n        # For mod p, primitive chars are all non-principal chars.\n        # Orders are divisors of phi(p)=p-1, greater than 1.\n        order_group = p -
