    Solves the hypersphere point placement problem based on a known theorem.

    The problem asks for the largest number of points that must appear in some
    closed hyper-hemisphere, for an optimal arrangement of 15 points on an
    8-dimensional hypersphere. This is equivalent to finding the value A(n, d)
