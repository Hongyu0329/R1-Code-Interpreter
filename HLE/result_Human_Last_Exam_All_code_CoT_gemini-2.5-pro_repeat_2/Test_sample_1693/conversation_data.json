    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Timeframe:** The period in question is from the beginning of World War II in September 1939 until the French armistice on June 22, 1940.\n2.  **Establish Search Criteria:** I will search for French ships (naval or merchant) that were sunk by German U-boats (either by torpedo, gunfire, or mines laid by U-boats).\n3.  **Determine the \"Largest\" Metric:** The size of a ship is typically measured by its tonnage. For merchant vessels and liners, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is a standard measure.\n4.  **Research and Compare:** I will search historical naval records and databases for French ships sunk during this period, filter them by the cause of sinking (U-boat action), and then compare their tonnage to find the largest one.\n5.  **Present the Findings:** I will write a Python script to clearly display the name of the ship, its tonnage, and the date of its sinking.\n\nBased on this plan, the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat or a U-boat-laid mine before the armistice was the passenger liner *Champlain*.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat\n# before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n\n# Ship details\nship_name = \"Champlain\"\nship_type = \"Passenger Liner\"\n# Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is a common measure for civilian ships.\ndisplacement_grt = 28124\nsinking_date = \"June 17, 1940\"\ncause = \"Struck a mine laid by the German submarine U-65\"\n\n# Print the information clearly.\nprint(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {ship_type}, '{ship_name}'.\")\nprint(f\"It was sunk on {sinking_date} after hitting a mine laid by U-65.\")\nprint(\"The ship's size by Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) was:\")\n# The final part of the request is to output the number from the final \"equation\" or result.\nprint(displacement_grt)\n```\n<<<Champlain>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
