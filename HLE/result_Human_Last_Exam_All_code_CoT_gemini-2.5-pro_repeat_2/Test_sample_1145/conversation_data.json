    "The problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' within the interval from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a, given that the particle is in the n = 2 quantum state.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`.\n2.  **Find the Probability Density:** The probability density is given by the square of the wavefunction, `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a)`.\n3.  **Set up the Probability Integral:** The probability of finding the particle between `x1` and `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `Probability = ∫[from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a) dx`\n4.  **Solve the Integral:** The analytical solution to this integral is:\n    `[x/a - (1/(2*n*π)) * sin(2*n*π*x/a)]`\n5.  **Evaluate at the Limits:** We will evaluate this expression at the limits `x2 = 0.505a` and `x1 = 0.495a` for `n = 2` and find the difference to get the final probability.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_particle_in_box_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a specific interval\n    of a 1D box for a given quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
