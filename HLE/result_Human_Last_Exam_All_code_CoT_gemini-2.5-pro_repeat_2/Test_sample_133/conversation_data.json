    "An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the minimum number of turns. In Connect 4, this often involves creating a \"forced win\" scenario, where the opponent is faced with multiple threats and cannot block them all.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the board for immediate wins:** First, I will check if player 'O' can win in a single move by completing a line of four.\n2.  **Analyze for forced wins:** If no immediate win exists, I will search for moves that create a \"double threat.\" This occurs when a player creates two different lines of three that can be completed on the next turn. Since the opponent can only block one of these threats, a win on the subsequent turn is guaranteed. This is the fastest way to win if an immediate win is not possible.\n3.  **Validate the moves:** For each potential move that creates a double threat, I'll ensure it doesn't inadvertently allow the opponent ('X') to win on their very next turn.\n4.  **Format the output:** The identified optimal moves will be presented in the requested `a1, b2, ...` format.\n\nBased on my analysis, there are no single-move wins for 'O'. However, there are moves that set up a guaranteed win in 3 turns (O's current move, X's block, O's final winning move). The following code will identify these moves.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connect_four():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given Connect 4 board state to find the optimal\n    moves for player 'O' to win as fast as possible.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The board is represented as a list of lists.\n    # Row 0 is the top row as shown in the problem's image.\n    board = [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],  # Row 1\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],  # Row 2\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],  # Row 3\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],  # Row 4\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],  # Row 5\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']   # Row 6\n    ]\n    \n    player = 'O'\n    opponent = 'X'\n    rows, cols = 6, 7\n\n    def check_win(b, p):\n        # Check horizontal\n        for c in range(cols - 3):\n            for r in range(rows):\n                if b[r][c] == p and b[r][c+1] == p and b[r][c+2] == p and b[r][c+3] == p:\n                    return True\n        # Check vertical\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for r in range(rows - 3):\n                if b[r][c] == p and b[r+1][c] == p and b[r+2][c] == p and b[r+3][c] == p:\n                    return True\n        # Check positively sloped diagonals\n        for c in range(cols - 3):\n            for r in range(rows - 3):\n                if b[r][c] == p and b[r+1][c+1] == p and b[r+2][c+2] == p and b[r+3][c+3] == p:\n                    return True\n        # Check negatively sloped diagonals\n        for c in range(cols - 3):\n            for r in range(3, rows):\n                if b[r][c] == p and b[r-1][c+1] == p and b[r-2][c+2] == p and b[r-3][c+3] == p:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def get_next_open_row(b, c):\n        for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            if b[r][c] == '.':\n                return r\n        return None\n\n    def get_valid_cols(b):\n        return [c for c in range(cols) if b[0][c] == '.']\n\n    # Tier 1: Check for win in 1 move\n    winning_moves_1_ply = []\n    for col in get_valid_cols(board):\n        row = get_next_open_row(board, col)\n        temp_board = [r[:] for r in board]\n        temp_board[row][col] = player\n        if check_win(temp_board, player):\n            move_str = f\"{chr(ord('a') + col)}{row + 1}\"\n            winning_moves_1_ply.append(move_str)\n    \n    if winning_moves_1_ply:\n        print(\", \".join(sorted(winning_moves_1_ply)))\n        return\n\n    # Tier 2: Check for win in 3 moves (forced win)\n    winning_moves_3_ply = []\n    for col in get_valid_cols(board):\n        row = get_next_open_row(board, col)\n        \n        board_after_o1 = [r[:] for r in board]\n        board_after_o1[row][col] = player\n\n        # Skip this move if it allows the opponent to win immediately\n        can_opponent_win = False\n        for opp_col in get_valid_cols(board_after_o1):\n             opp_row = get_next_open_row(board_after_o1, opp_col)\n             board_after_x = [r[:] for r in board_after_o1]\n             board_after_x[opp_row][opp_col] = opponent\n             if check_win(board_after_x, opponent):\n                 can_opponent_win = True\n                 break\n        if can_opponent_win:\n            continue\n            \n        # Count winning threats created by this move.
