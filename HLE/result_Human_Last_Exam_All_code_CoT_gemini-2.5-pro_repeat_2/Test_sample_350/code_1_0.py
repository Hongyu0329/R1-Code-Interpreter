# The user wants to identify the primary philosophical influences on Wolfhart Pannenberg's concept of cosmic history and contingency.
# This requires knowledge of 20th-century theology and German Idealism.

# Step 1: Analyze the core components of Pannenberg's argument as described in the text.
# The key concepts are "theology of history," "cosmic history," and a "contingent concept of time."

# Step 2: Identify the major philosopher associated with a grand "philosophy of history."
# Georg Hegel is the most prominent figure whose work revolves around the idea of history as the rational self-manifestation of Spirit.
# Pannenberg's entire project of "revelation as history" is a direct and critical engagement with Hegel's system.

# Step 3: Identify the major philosopher who provides a metaphysical basis for "contingency," especially in relation to God and creation,
# in a way that would complement or correct Hegel.
# Friedrich Schelling, particularly his later philosophy, delved into the concepts of freedom, nature, and contingency in God.
# He provided a framework for a dynamic God and a non-deterministic creation, which Pannenberg used to build his model of an open future
# and a contingent history, distinguishing his view from a more deterministic reading of Hegel.

# Step 4: Combine these findings and select the correct option.
# The two primary philosophical pillars for Pannenberg's argument are Georg Hegel (for the structure of history as revelation)
# and Friedrich Schelling (for the metaphysical basis of contingency).

print("1. For his grand 'theology of history,' Pannenberg critically engages with and reinterprets the framework established by Georg Hegel.")
print("2. For his central concept of 'contingency' against a deterministic view of history, he draws heavily upon the later philosophy of Friedrich Schelling.")
