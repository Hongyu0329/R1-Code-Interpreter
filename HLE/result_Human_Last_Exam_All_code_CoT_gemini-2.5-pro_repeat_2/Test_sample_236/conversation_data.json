    "To determine the number of elements in the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Knots:** We list all knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). For the chiral trefoil knot, we must consider both its right-handed and left-handed versions.\n2.  **Identify Homology Spheres:** An integral surgery on a knot K with coefficient 'n' results in a 3-manifold whose first homology group is Z/|n|Z. For this to be an integral homology sphere (a manifold with the same homology as the 3-sphere S³), we require the first homology group to be trivial. This happens only when the surgery coefficient 'n' is +1 or -1.\n3.  **Analyze Each Knot's Surgeries:** We will examine the ±1 surgeries on each identified knot and determine the resulting element in the homology cobordism group.\n4.  **Count Unique Elements:** We will collect all the elements generated from these surgeries and count the number of distinct ones. This involves using known results from low-dimensional topology to identify when different surgeries produce the same element.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by enumerating the cases and using established topological facts to identify and count the unique homology cobordism elements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from surgeries\n    on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be\")\n    print(\"represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # We use a set to store the unique elements found.\n    # We use symbolic names for the elements for clarity:\n    # 'Id': The identity element (represented by S^3)\n    # 'P': The element for the Poincare sphere Sigma(2,3,5)\n    # 'P_inv': The inverse of P\n    # 'S': The element for the manifold Sigma(2,3,7)\n    # 'S_inv': The inverse of S\n    unique_elements = set()\n    knot_contributions = {}\n\n    # Case 1: The Unknot (0_1)\n    # It is achiral. ±1 surgery on the unknot yields S^3.\n    print(\"1.
