    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A*sin(at + Î´)` and `y(t) = B*sin(bt)`. Our curve fits the specific form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, with `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Check Conditions:** For the standard formula to apply, the frequencies `a` and `b` must be integers, and their ratio `a/b` should be rational. Here, `a=9` and `b=5` are integers. For the formula for the number of self-intersections, we need `a` and `b` to be coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is `GCD(9, 5) = 1`, so they are coprime.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** There is a well-established formula for the number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve of the form `(cos(at), sin(bt))` where `a` and `b` are coprime integers. The number of self-intersection points, `N`, is given by:\n    `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We substitute our values `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula:\n    `N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    `N = 8 * 4 / 2`\n    `N = 32 / 2`\n    `N = 16`\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the steps of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)).\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # Check if a and b are coprime\n    if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:\n        print(f\"The numbers a={a} and b={b} are not coprime.\")\n        print(\"The standard formula may not apply directly.\")\n        return\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve\n    # of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)) with a and b coprime is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n    a_minus_1 = a - 1\n    b_minus_1 = b - 1\n    numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n    num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n    print(\"The curve is a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)).\")\n    print(f\"Here, a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the number of self-intersection points is (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of intersections = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"                         = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\n    print(f\"                         = {numerator} / 2\")\n    print(f\"                         = {num_intersections}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
