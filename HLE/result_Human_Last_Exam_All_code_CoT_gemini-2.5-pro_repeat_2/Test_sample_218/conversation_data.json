    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, for example, a partition of 4 is `[3, 1]`. For $n=25$, we need to consider all possible partitions of 25.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the **Hook-Length Formula**. For a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, the dimension $d_\\lambda$ is given by:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Algorithm:** My approach will be to:\n    a.  Generate all integer partitions of 25.\n    b.  For each partition, calculate the dimension of its corresponding irreducible representation using the hook-length formula.\n    c.  Count how many of these dimensions are strictly less than 500,000.\n    d.  Print the final count.\n\nThis process involves handling large numbers like $25!$, but Python's built-in support for arbitrary-precision integers makes this straightforward.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n using a recursive helper function.\n    A partition is represented as a list of non-increasing integers.\n    Example for n=4: [[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]\n    \"\"\"\n    def partition_helper(target, max_val, current_partition):\n        if target == 0:\n            all_partitions.append(current_partition)\n            return\n        \n        for i in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            partition_helper(target - i, i, current_partition + [i])\n\n    all_partitions = []\n    partition_helper(n, n, [])\n    return all_partitions\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation corresponding to a partition\n    using the hook-length formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # n! is the numerator in the hook-length formula.\n    # math.factorial can handle this size.\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n\n    # Calculate the product of hook lengths for all cells in the Young diagram.\n    hook_product = 1\n    for i in range(len(partition)):  # Iterate over rows (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(partition[i]):  # Iterate over columns (0-indexed)\n            # Calculate hook length for cell (i, j)\n            # Number of cells to the right in the same row\n            num_right = partition[i] - (j + 1)\n            \n            # Number of cells below in the same column\n            num_down = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    num_down += 1\n            \n            # Hook length is num_right + num_down + 1 (for the cell itself)\n            hook_length = num_right + num_down + 1\n            hook_product *= hook_length\n            \n    # The division is guaranteed to be exact.
