    "This is a geographical riddle. My plan is to solve it by breaking down the clues and using them to identify the correct location.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n1.  **\"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\"**: This points to a highly remote and isolated place. Candidates include Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, and the Pitcairn Islands.\n2.  **\"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\"**: This indicates the island is of volcanic origin and has a specific landform where a collapsed volcano has formed a bay.\n3.  **\"shares the town's name\"**: The name of the town and the name of the bay must be the same.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   Let's evaluate **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**. It is extremely remote, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands, which satisfies the distance criterion of being greater than `500` km.\n*   The island is entirely volcanic.\n*   The main town is **Hanga Roa**. In the local Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga\" means \"Bay\" and \"Roa\" means \"Long\". The town's name literally means \"Long Bay\". This perfectly fits the criterion that the town and bay share a name.\n*   Hanga Roa is situated on the coast in a bay (Hanga Roa Bay), which is flanked by the island's large, extinct volcanoes (Terevaka and Rano Kau). While not situated *inside* a single, perfectly formed caldera bay like Santorini, the bay's existence is a direct result of the island's overall volcanic structure.\n\nThis combination of extreme remoteness and the town's name literally meaning \"bay\" makes Hanga Roa the correct answer. The following Python code will print this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle by defining the criteria\n    and printing the logical steps to reach the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Riddle Criteria ---\n    # The prompt mentions a number that is part of the criteria.\n    # Let's define it as a variable.\n    min_distance_from_inhabited_land_km = 500\n\n    # --- Logical Deduction ---\n    print(\"Finding the island town based on the following criteria:\")\n    print(f\"1.

The town and the bay share the same name.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Analysis of the clues\n    analysis_step_1 = \"The distance criterion points to a very remote location, like Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\"\n    analysis_step_2 = \"Easter Island is volcanic, and its main town is Hanga Roa.\"\n    analysis_step_3 = \"In the Rapa Nui language, 'Hanga' means 'Bay' and 'Roa' means 'Long'.\"\n    analysis_step_4 = \"Therefore, the town's name, 'Hanga Roa', literally means 'Long Bay', satisfying the shared name criterion.\"\n\n    # The final answer\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    island_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n\n    print(\"Deduction:\")\n    print(f\"- {analysis_step_1}\")\n    print(f\"- {analysis_step_2}\")\n    print(f\"- {analysis_step_3}\")\n    print(f\"- {analysis_step_4}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The answer is the town of {town_name} on {island_name}.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
