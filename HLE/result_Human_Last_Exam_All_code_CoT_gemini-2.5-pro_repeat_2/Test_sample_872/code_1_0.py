    Calculates the maximum probability of winning Tic Tac Toe against a random opponent.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  The optimal first move for the player (X) is the center square.
    2.  The computer (O) then has 8 squares left. By symmetry, its move can be
        classified as either a corner (4/8 probability) or an edge (4/8 probability).
    3.  The win probability for both of these computer responses is calculated. Due to
        the board's symmetry, these probabilities turn out to be identical.
    4.  The total win probability is the weighted average of these cases.
