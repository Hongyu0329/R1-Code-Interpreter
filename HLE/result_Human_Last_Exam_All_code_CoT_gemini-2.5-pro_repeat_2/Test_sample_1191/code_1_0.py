    # The mutation rate itself is a trait that is subject to evolutionary pressures.
    # We need to evaluate the trade-offs associated with different mutation rates.

    # Cost of a high mutation rate:
    # Most new mutations are deleterious. A high rate increases the 'genetic load' of a population,
    # which reduces average fitness. Selection acts against this.
    cost_of_high_rate = "Increased deleterious mutation load, reducing fitness."

    # Cost of a very low mutation rate:
    # Genetic variation is the raw material for adaptation. A very low rate limits the ability
    # of a population to adapt to changing environments.
    cost_of_low_rate = "Limited adaptive potential."

    # The balancing force:
    # Natural selection mediates the trade-off between these two costs. It favors an "optimal"
    # mutation rate that is not too high and not too low, thereby maximizing long-term fitness.
    # This process is best described as natural selection for fitness optimality.
