    "Of course. Here is the plan to calculate the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the diagram:** The diagram has two identical vertices and four identical internal lines (propagators) connecting these two vertices. This is a \"setting-sun\" or \"watermelon\" vacuum diagram in a theory like $\\phi^4$.\n2.  **Calculate vertex symmetry:** The two vertices are of the same type and are interchangeable. The number of permutations for these vertices is $2!$.\n3.  **Calculate line symmetry:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are identical propagators. They are also interchangeable. The number of permutations for these lines is $4!$.\n4.  **Calculate the total symmetry factor:** The total symmetry factor, S, is the product of the vertex and line permutation factors.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to calculate $2! \\times 4!$ and print the full equation with the intermediate and final results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with 2 vertices\n    and 4 field contractions (internal lines) between them.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_lines = 4\n\n    # Calculate the number of permutations for identical vertices\n    vertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # Calculate the number of permutations for identical lines connecting the vertices\n    line_permutations = math.factorial(num_lines)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these factors\n    symmetry_factor = vertex_permutations * line_permutations\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(\"The symmetry factor S is calculated by multiplying the number of permutations of identical vertices by the number of permutations of identical internal lines.\")\n    print(f\"Number of vertices = {num_vertices}\")\n    print(f\"Number of internal lines = {num_lines}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"S = (permutations of vertices) * (permutations of lines)\")\n    print(f\"S = {num_vertices}! * {num_lines}!\")\n    print(f\"S = {vertex_permutations} * {line_permutations}\")\n    print(f\"S = {symmetry_factor}\")\n\ncalculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions in perturbative Green's function analysis?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
