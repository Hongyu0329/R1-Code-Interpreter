    "To determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Outer-Hull:** The \"outer-hull\" of a polyhedron refers to its convex hull. The great icosahedron is a non-convex star polyhedron. Its 12 vertices are located at the exact same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Surface for Triangulation:** The task is to triangulate the surface of this convex hull (the regular icosahedron). A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of 20 identical, equilateral triangles.\n\n3.  **Determine the Minimal Number of Triangles:** Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly divided into triangles, this existing structure represents the most minimal triangulation. No fewer triangles can be used to form its closed surface.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this conclusion and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the\n# outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n# Step 1: The outer-hull (or convex hull) of the great icosahedron is a\n# regular icosahedron, as they share the same 12 vertices.\n\n# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its surface is\n# composed of triangular faces. We need to find the number of these faces.\n# By definition, a regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\nnumber_of_faces_on_an_icosahedron = 20\n\n# Step 3: \"Triangulating\" the surface means dividing it into triangles.\n# Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already made of 20 triangles,\n# this is the minimal triangulation possible.\nminimal_triangles = number_of_faces_on_an_icosahedron\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer. The \"equation\" is simply that the result\n# equals the number of faces.\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles required is equal to the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"Result = {minimal_triangles}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
