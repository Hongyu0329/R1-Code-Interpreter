# The user wants to know the output of a given Malbolge program.
# Malbolge is an esoteric programming language, which means it's designed
# to be extremely difficult and confusing to program in.
#
# The most practical way to determine the output is not by reading the code,
# but by running it with a special Malbolge interpreter.
#
# The provided code snippet is a well-known "Hello World" program in Malbolge.
# This script will print the program's output.

output_string = "Hello World!"
