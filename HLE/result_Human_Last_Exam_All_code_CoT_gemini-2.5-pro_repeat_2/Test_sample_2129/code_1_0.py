    # Step 1: Determine parameters a and lambda.
    # a is the number of extrema of y_2(x) for n = 10000 and x > 0.
    # lambda is the number of extrema for n = -2000 and x > 0.
    # Extrema are found where y_2'(x) = 0. We analyze y_2'(x) using its Taylor series,
    # derived from the initial conditions and the DE for y_2(x).
    #
    # The DE is x^2 * y_2^(4)(x) + 2x * y_2'''(x) - y_2(x) - (10/n)*x^2 = 0
    # ICs: y_2(0) = 0, y_2'(0) = 1, y_2''(0) = -1 - 20/n, y_2'''(0) = 1/2.

    # The Taylor series for y_2(x) is y_2(x) = x + (-1/2 - 10/n)x^2 + (1/12)x^3 - (1/144)x^4 + ...
    # The derivative is y_2'(x) = 1 - (1 + 20/n)x + (1/4)x^2 - (1/36)x^3 + ...
    #
    # To find the number of positive roots of y_2'(x), we analyze its derivative, y_2''(x):
    # y_2''(x) = -(1 + 20/n) + (1/2)x - (1/12)x^2 + ...
    #
    # For large positive n (e.g., n=10000) and large negative n (e.g., n=-2000), the term
    # -(1 + 20/n) is negative and close to -1. The subsequent terms do not change the sign
    # of y_2''(x) from being negative for all x > 0.
    # Since y_2''(x) < 0, y_2'(x) is a monotonically decreasing function.
    # As y_2'(0) = 1 and y_2'(x) tends to -infinity, it must cross the x-axis exactly once for x > 0.
    # Therefore, there is exactly one extremum in both cases.
