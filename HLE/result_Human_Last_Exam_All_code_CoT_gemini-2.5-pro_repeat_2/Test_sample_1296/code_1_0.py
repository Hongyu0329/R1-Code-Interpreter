    This function provides the solution to the theoretical questions about dessin d'enfants.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    (a) If G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F, its socle N must act transitively on F.
        The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of F under N's action.
        Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit, making D_N unicellular. Thus, the answer is Yes.

    (b) A smooth covering D of D_N exists if the automorphism group G splits over its socle N
        (among other satisfiable generation conditions).
        - Type HA (Holomorph of Abelian): G = N semi-direct H. Splits by definition. Possible.
        - Type TW (Twisted Wreath): G = T wr Z_l = T^l semi-direct Z_l. Splits by definition. Possible.
        - Type AS (Almost Simple): G can be an automorphism group if it splits over its socle N.
          Many such groups exist (e.g., PGammaL(n,q)), so this type is generally possible.
        Therefore, all three types are possible.

    (c) General theorems regarding the existence of smooth coverings for groups of type TW
        do not impose restrictions on the value of l. It is possible to construct such a
        covering for any l >= 2. The statement claims it's impossible for l <= 5,
        which is incorrect. Thus, the statement is False.
