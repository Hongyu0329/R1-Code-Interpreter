    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Duality:** The core of the solution lies in the principle of duality, which connects the observability of a system `(A, C)` to the controllability of its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`. We can find the observer canonical form for `(A, C)` by first finding the controller canonical form for its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\n2.  **Define the Dual System:** We will define the dual system matrices `F = A^T` and `G = C^T`.\n\n3.  **Find the Controller Canonical Form for the Dual System:**\n    a.  The dual system `(F, G)` is a multi-input system because `C` has two rows, making `G` have two columns. We will select the first column of `G`, let's call it `g1`, to construct the transformation.\n    b.  We will compute the controllability matrix for `(F, g1)`: `W_c = [g1, F*g1, F^2*g1]`.\n    c.  We will find the characteristic polynomial of `F`, which is the same as for `A`, to get the coefficients `a1, a2, a3`.\n    d.  Using these coefficients, we will construct a special matrix `W_c_bar`.\n    e.  The transformation matrix that converts the state `z` to the controller canonical state `z_c` is `P_c`, which is the inverse of `(W_c * W_c_bar)`.\n\n4.  **Transform the Original System:**\n    a.  The transformation matrix `P_o` that converts the original system to observer canonical form is related to `P_c` by `P_o = (P_c^{-1})^T`.\n    b.  The new state is `x_o = P_o * x`, which means the original state is `x = P_o^{-1} * x_o`.\n    c.  The new output equation is `y = C * x = C * (P_o^{-1} * x_o)`.\n    d.  Therefore, the new output matrix is `C_o = C * P_o^{-1}`. From step 4a, `P_o^{-1} = P_c^T`.\n    e.  So, the final calculation is `C_o = C * P_c^T`.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** We will use Python with the NumPy library to perform the matrix calculations and print the final result for the new `C` matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_observer_canonical_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the original system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [1, 1, 0],\n        [2, 1, 1],\n        [0, 2, 0]\n    ])\n    C = np.array([\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Original A matrix:\\n\", A)\n    print(\"\\nOriginal C matrix:\\n\", C)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the dual system\n    F = A.T\n    G = C.T\n\n    print(\"\\nDual system matrix F = A^T:\\n\", F)\n    print(\"\\nDual system matrix G = C^T:\\n\", G)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the transformation to controller canonical form for the dual system\n    # We use the first column of G to build the controllability matrix\n    g1 = G[:, 0:1] # Keep it as a column vector\n\n    # Controllability matrix for (F, g1)\n    Wc = np.hstack([g1, F @ g1, F @ F @ g1])\n    print(\"\\nControllability matrix for the dual system (Wc):\\n\", Wc)\n\n    # Check if the system is controllable\n    if np.linalg.matrix_rank(Wc) < A.shape[0]:\n        print(\"\\nDual system is not controllable with the first column of C^T.
