    # The question concerns the shift in the French royal title and the biographer of the king in question.

    # 1. Identify the key historical facts.
    # The monarch who began the shift from "King of the Franks" to "King of France" was Philip II Augustus.
    # This change, reflecting a move to territorial law, began around the year 1190.
    # The contemporary biographer who gave Philip the epithet "Augustus" was Rigord.
    # The reign of Philip II ended with his death in 1223.

    print("Step 1: Analyzing the historical facts.")
    print("The monarch in question is Philip II Augustus.")
    print("The shift in royal title to 'King of France' began around the year 1190.")
    print("The contemporary biographer and source of the 'Augustus' epithet was Rigord.")

    # 2. Evaluate the given choices based on these facts.

        'A': (1190, 'Suetonius'),
        'B': (1250, 'Joinville'),
        'C': (1223, 'Rigord'),
        'D': (1789, 'Voltaire'),
        'E': (1190, 'Baldwin')

    print("Choice A is incorrect: Suetonius was a Roman historian.")
    print("Choice B is incorrect: Joinville was the biographer of Louis IX.")
    print("Choice D is incorrect: Voltaire and the year 1789 relate to a much later era.")
    print("Choice E is incorrect: John W. Baldwin was a modern historian, not the contemporary source of the epithet.")
    print("Choice C is the best fit: Rigord is the correct biographer. The year 1223 is the end of Philip II's reign, the period that 'contained' the morphing of the monarchy's stylization.")
