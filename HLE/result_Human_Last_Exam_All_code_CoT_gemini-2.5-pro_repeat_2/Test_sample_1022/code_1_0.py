def solve_cohomology_dimension():
    """
    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.

    This calculation relies on established theorems in group cohomology:
    1. The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T is isomorphic to its
       ordinary cohomology (a result by N. Monod).
    2. The dimensions of the cohomology groups of T are known:
       dim H^k(T) are 1, 2, 1 for k=0, 1, 2, and 0 for k >= 3.
    3. The Künneth formula applies, allowing the computation for the direct
       product T x T.
