    Solves for the smallest number m such that the set A is m-diophantine.

    The set A is the set of tuples (x_1, ..., x_n) where each x_i is the cube of a rational number.
    This means for (x_1, ..., x_n) to be in A, there must exist rational numbers q_1, ..., q_n
    such that:
    x_1 = q_1**3
    x_2 = q_2**3
    ...
    x_n = q_n**3

    This system of n equations can be rewritten as:
    x_1 - q_1**3 = 0
    x_2 - q_2**3 = 0
    ...
    x_n - q_n**3 = 0

    A set A is m-diophantine if there's a single polynomial F with m auxiliary variables y_i
    such that (x_1, ..., x_n) is in A if and only if there exist y_1, ..., y_m with F(x, y) = 0.

    We can combine the n equations into one by summing their squares, because for rational numbers,
    a sum of squares is zero if and only if each term is zero.
    Let F = (x_1 - q_1**3)**2 + (x_2 - q_2**3)**2 + ... + (x_n - q_n**3)**2 = 0.

    The auxiliary variables are the 'q_i's. We need n of them, one for each x_i.
    Let's identify y_i with q_i.
    So, F(x_1, ..., x_n, y_1, ..., y_n) = (x_1 - y_1**3)**2 + ... + (x_n - y_n**3)**2 = 0.

    The number of auxiliary variables y_i is n. So, m can be n. This shows m <= n.

    The smallest m must be at least n, because the condition for each x_i to be a cube is independent
    of the others. Each requires its own "witness" q_i (or y_i). It's not possible to use fewer
    than n variables to certify n independent conditions.
    Therefore, the smallest number m is n.
