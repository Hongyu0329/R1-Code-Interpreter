    # The problem asks for the dimension of H_31(G, R).
    # We can determine this by finding the homological dimension of G over R, denoted hd_R(G).
    # By definition, H_n(G, R) is zero for all n > hd_R(G).

    # Step 1: Analyze the group G and find a suitable group extension.
    # The group G is generated by g and h. We can define a homomorphism phi
    # that maps an element f in G to its translation amounts at -infinity and +infinity.
    # phi(f) = (translation at -inf, translation at +inf).
    # For g: g(x) = x+1 (for x<0) and g(x) = x (for x>2). So, phi(g) = (1, 0).
    # For h: h(x) = x (for x<0) and h(x) = x+2 (for x>2). So, phi(h) = (0, 2).
    # The image of phi, let's call it Q, is the subgroup of ZxZ generated by (1,0) and (0,2).
    # This group Q is isomorphic to Z^2.
    # The kernel of phi, let's call it K, consists of elements in G with compact support.
    # These elements are a subgroup of Thompson's group F.
    # This gives a short exact sequence: 1 -> K -> G -> Q -> 1.

    # Step 2: Use the Bieri-Eckmann inequality for homological dimensions.
    # The inequality states that hd_R(G) <= hd_R(K) + hd_R(Q).

    # The homological dimension of the kernel K is bounded by that of Thompson's group F.
    # It is a known result that hd_R(F) = 2.
    hd_K_bound = 2

    # The homological dimension of the quotient Q (isomorphic to Z^2) is also a standard result.
    # It is the dimension of its classifying space, the 2-torus.
    hd_Q = 2

    # Step 3: Calculate the bound for the homological dimension of G.
    hd_G_bound = hd_K_bound + hd_Q

    # Step 4: Compare the desired degree with the homological dimension bound.
    degree = 31

    if degree > hd_G_bound:
        dimension = 0
    else:
        # For n <= hd_R(G), the dimension is not necessarily zero.
        # However, for the given degree, the result is definitive.
        dimension = "Cannot be determined with this method"

    # Output the reasoning and the final result.
