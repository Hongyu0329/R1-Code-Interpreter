    """
    Analyzes and provides answers to three theoretical questions regarding the
    Pohozaev identity for a mixed SchrÃ¶dinger system.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Analyze Question (a) ---
    # Question: True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily
    # a critical point of the energy functional J.
    #
    # Reasoning: The Pohozaev identity P(u, v) = 0 is a necessary condition
    # for (u, v) to be a solution (a critical point of J). It is derived from the
    # governing equations, which are the Euler-Lagrange equations J'(u, v) = 0.
    # However, the Pohozaev identity is not a sufficient condition. It is possible
    # to construct functions that satisfy P(u, v) = 0 but are not solutions
    # to the system (i.e., for which J'(u, v) != 0).
    #
    # Conclusion for (a): False.
    answer_a = "False"

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Question (b) ---
    # Question: Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists
    # a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is in P? (Meaning P(u_t, v_t) = 0).
    #
    # Reasoning: This asks if any function can be projected onto the Pohozaev
    # manifold via a scaling t. Let's assume a typical scaling, e.g., in amplitude,
    # (u_t, v_t) = (tu, tv). The functional P is defined as
    # P(u, v) = s * K(u, v) - N(u, v), where K is the quadratic kinetic term and
    # N represents the nonlinear terms. If N is homogeneous of degree p, then
    # P(tu, tv) = s * t^2 * K(u, v) - t^p * N(u, v).
    # Setting P(tu, tv) = 0 for t > 0 yields t^(p-2) = (s * K(u, v)) / N(u, v).
    # For a unique positive solution t to exist, the right-hand side must be
    # a positive real number. While K(u,v) > 0 for any non-zero function, the
    # sign of N(u,v) depends on the specific nonlinearities and the function (u,v).
    # It is not guaranteed to be positive for *any* (u,v). If N(u,v) <= 0,
    # no such positive t exists.
    #
    # Conclusion for (b): No.
    answer_b = "No"

    # --- Step 3: Analyze Question (c) ---
    # Question: Must the minimiser of J on {P(u,v)=0} satisfy the condition
    # phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
    #
    # Reasoning: Let M be the Pohozaev manifold where P(u, v) = 0.
    # Let phi(t) = J((u,v)_t), where (u,v)_t is the scaling transformation that
    # generates the Pohozaev identity. By definition, P(u,v)=0 is equivalent
    # to phi'(1)=0 for a function on the manifold M.
    # The procedure for finding a minimizer of J on M often involves, for each
    # function f, maximizing J(f_t) with respect to t, and then minimizing this
    # value over all f. A minimizer (u,v) found this way must therefore maximize J
    # along its specific scaling curve. A necessary condition for this maximum at t=1
    # is phi''(1) <= 0, and for a non-degenerate case, phi''(1) < 0.
    #
    # Conclusion for (c): Yes.
    answer_c = "Yes"

    # --- Step 4: Print the final answers ---
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}")
    print(f"(b) {answer_b}")
    print(f"(c) {answer_c}")

# Execute the function to provide the solution.
