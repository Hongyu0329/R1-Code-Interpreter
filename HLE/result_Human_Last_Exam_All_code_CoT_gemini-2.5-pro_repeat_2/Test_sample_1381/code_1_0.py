def solve_equilibria_count(N):
    """
    Calculates and explains the number of possible equilibria for N species
    in the given generalized Lotka-Volterra system.

    The logic is based on the following derivation:
    1.  An equilibrium is a state where all population changes are zero (dX_i/dt = 0).
        This leads to two cases for each species: extinction (X_i = 0) or coexistence,
        where a specific algebraic condition must be met.

    2.  The trivial equilibrium, where all species are extinct (X_i = 0 for all i),
        is always a possible solution. This accounts for 1 equilibrium.

    3.  For coexistence equilibria, a mathematical analysis shows that the set of
        surviving species must consist of those with the highest values of the
        parameter A_i.

    4.  Since parameters can be varied, we can assume all A_i values are distinct.
        This gives N possible sets of coexisting species: the top 1, the top 2, ...,
        up to all N species. This provides N possible coexistence equilibria.

    5.  The total number of possible equilibria is the sum of the trivial case and
        the N coexistence cases.
