    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with a 6-31G** basis set, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N):** We will sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule ($\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{Si}$, $\\mathrm{F}$).\n2.  **Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions (K):** We will find the number of basis functions contributed by each atom according to the 6-31G** basis set and sum them up. This number corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals.\n3.  **Apply the Weyl-Paldus Formula:** For a system with an even number of electrons, the ground state is typically a singlet state (total spin S=0). The number of CSFs for a full CI calculation of a singlet state is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = (K+1) \\left( \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\right)^2 $$\n    where `K` is the number of spatial orbitals, `N` is the number of electrons, and $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will use a Python script to perform the calculation, as the resulting number is extremely large. The script will first determine N and K, then apply the formula to find the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_csfs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI\n    calculation of CH2SiHF with a 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\n    electrons = {\n        'C': 6,\n        'H': 1,\n        'Si': 14,\n        'F': 9\n    }\n    # Molecule is CH2SiHF, so 1*C, 3*H, 1*Si, 1*F\n    num_atoms = {'C': 1, 'H': 3, 'Si': 1, 'F': 1}\n    N = sum(electrons[atom] * num for atom, num in num_atoms.items())\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the total number of electrons (N)\")\n    print(f\"Electrons per atom: C={electrons['C']}, H={electrons['H']}, Si={electrons['Si']}, F={electrons['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Molecule CH2SiHF has 1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F atom(s).\")\n    print(f\"Total electrons N = 1*{electrons['C']} + 3*{electrons['H']} + 1*{electrons['Si']} + 1*{electrons['F']} = {N}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K) for 6-31G**\n    # 6-31G** basis functions per atom:\n    # H: 2 (6-31G) + 3 (p-funcs from second *) = 5\n    # C: 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d-funcs from first *) = 15\n    # F: 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d-funcs from first *) = 15\n    # Si: 13 (6-31G) + 6 (d-funcs from first *) = 19\n    basis_functions = {\n        'C': 15,\n        'H': 5,\n        'Si': 19,\n        'F': 15\n    }\n    K = sum(basis_functions[atom] * num for atom, num in num_atoms.items())\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the total number of basis functions (K)\")\n    print(f\"Basis functions (orbitals) per atom for 6-31G**: C={basis_functions['C']}, H={basis_functions['H']}, Si={basis_functions['Si']}, F={basis_functions['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Total basis functions K = 1*{basis_functions['C']} + 3*{basis_functions['H']} + 1*{basis_functions['Si']} + 1*{basis_functions['F']} = {K}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the Weyl-Paldus formula for a singlet state (S=0)\n    # Number of CSFs = (K+1) * [C(K+1, N/2)]^2\n    # The ground state of this molecule is a singlet, so S=0.\n    S = 0\n    if N % 2 != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The molecule has an odd number of electrons.
