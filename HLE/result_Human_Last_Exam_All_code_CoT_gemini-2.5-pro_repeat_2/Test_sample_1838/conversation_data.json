    "My plan is to solve this problem by first generating all the pixels that form the line between the two given points using Bresenham's line algorithm. This algorithm is efficient because it only uses integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting. For the given line from (1,1) to (11,5), the change in x (dx=10) is greater than the change in y (dy=4), so the algorithm will iterate along the x-axis, incrementing x by 1 at each step and deciding whether to increment y based on a decision parameter.\n\nAfter generating the complete list of pixels, I will determine the total number of pixels on the line. Since the number of pixels is odd, there will be a single, unique central pixel. I will calculate its position in the list (which is the middle index) and then retrieve its coordinates. Finally, I will print these coordinates as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    This implementation is specific to the case where x1 < x2 and the slope is between 0 and 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the change in x and y\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Initialize the decision parameter.\n    # This is the initial error term.\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Initialize starting coordinates\n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # Store all pixels on the line in a list\n    pixels = []\n\n    # Iterate from the start to the end of the line\n    while x <= x2:\n        # Add the current pixel to our list\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n\n        # Bresenham's algorithm logic\n        if p < 0:\n            # The next point is (x+1, y)\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # The next point is (x+1, y+1)\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n            y = y + 1\n        \n        # Always increment x for this slope\n        x = x + 1\n\n    # Find the central pixel\n    # The number of pixels is len(pixels).
