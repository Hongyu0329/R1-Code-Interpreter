def solve():
    """
    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square
    inscribed in a circle, given the center and a point on the circumference.

    The steps are:
    1. L: Draw a line through the center (O) and the given point (A) to find the opposite point (C), forming the first diameter.
    2. C: Draw a circle centered at A, with radius AC.
    3. C: Draw a circle centered at C, with radius CA. These two circles intersect at new points (P, Q).
    4. L: Draw a line through P and Q. This is the perpendicular bisector of AC and forms the second diameter, intersecting the original circle at B and D.
    5. L: Draw the side from A to B.
    6. L: Draw the side from B to C.
    7. L: Draw the side from C to D.
    8. L: Draw the side from D to A.
