    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The group is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which can be denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n2.  **Understand the Structure**: The generalized quaternion group $Q_{4n}$ has order $4n$. For $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. These groups are \"2-groups,\" meaning their order is a power of 2. We can write the order 128 as $2^7$. The standard notation for these groups is $Q_{2^{m+1}}$. By comparing $2^7$ with $2^{m+1}$, we find that $m+1 = 7$, which gives $m=6$.\n3.  **Identify Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup is a set of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct sets we can form this way.\n4.  **Apply the Formula**: For a generalized quaternion group $G = Q_{2^{m+1}}$ (where $m \\ge 2$), the set of distinct power subgroups is known to be $\\{G\\} \\cup \\{ \\langle x^{2^i} \\rangle \\mid i=1, 2, \\dots, m \\}$, where $\\langle x \\rangle$ is the unique maximal cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n5.  **Count the Subgroups**:\n    *   The subgroup $G$ itself is one power subgroup (obtained for $k=1$ or any odd $k$).\n    *   The subgroups $\\langle x^{2^i} \\rangle$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$ form another set of $m$ distinct subgroups (these are $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle x^{2^m} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$).\n    *   The total number of power subgroups is $1 + m$.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Substitute the value of $m=6$ into the formula $1+m$ to get the final count. The script will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized\n    quaternion group of size 128 and explains the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size {group_size}, denoted Q_{group_size}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Express the group size in the standard form Q_{2^(m+1)}\n    # The size must be a power of 2.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: The size of a generalized quaternion group must be a power of 2. {group_size} is not.\")\n        return\n\n    # N = 2^(m+1) => log2(N) = m+1\n    exponent = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    print(f\"The order of the group is {group_size}.
