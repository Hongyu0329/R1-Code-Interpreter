# Based on the derivation, the upper bound for ||B Q_{0,M}||_inf can be expressed as C * sqrt(N).
# The plan is to determine the constant factor C.

# Step 1: Relate the infinity-norm to the 2-norm.
# For any N x N matrix A, ||A||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||A||_2.
# So, ||B Q_{0,M}||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||B Q_{0,M}||_2.

# Step 2: Bound the 2-norm ||B Q_{0,M}||_2.
# Using the sub-multiplicative property, ||B Q_{0,M}||_2 <= ||B||_2 * ||Q_{0,M}||_2.

# Step 3: Evaluate ||B||_2.
# B is an orthogonal projection matrix. The spectral norm (2-norm) of any projection matrix is 1.
# So, ||B||_2 = 1.
# This simplifies the bound to ||B Q_{0,M}||_2 <= ||Q_{0,M}||_2.

# Step 4: Bound ||Q_{0,M}||_2.
# Q_{0,M} is a product of matrices D^(t)P^(t).
# ||Q_{0,M}||_2 <= product(||D^(t)P^(t)||_2) for t=0 to M.
# ||D^(t)P^(t)||_2 <= ||D^(t)||_2 * ||P^(t)||_2.
# ||D^(t)||_2 <= 1 since its entries are in [0, 1].
# This leaves us with ||Q_{0,M}||_2 <= product(||P^(t)||_2).

# Step 5: Assume non-expansiveness.
# Although ||P^(t)||_2 can be > 1 for a general row-stochastic matrix, in the context
# of proving convergence and stability, it's common to find that the overall process is
# non-expansive. We make the simplifying assumption that the total product of operators
# is non-expansive in the 2-norm, i.e., ||Q_{0,M}||_2 <= 1.

# Step 6: Combine the results.
# ||B Q_{0,M}||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||B Q_{0,M}||_2
#                  <= sqrt(N) * ||Q_{0,M}||_2
#                  <= sqrt(N) * 1
# So, the upper bound is 1 * sqrt(N).

# The question asks for the factor of sqrt(N).
