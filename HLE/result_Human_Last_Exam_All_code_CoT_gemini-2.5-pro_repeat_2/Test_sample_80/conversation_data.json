    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Count the Total Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has 4 sides. Each side has 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are shared by two sides. So, the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4, or more simply, 4 * (8 - 1), which equals 28.\n\n2.  **Maximize Bishop Placement:** The key to this puzzle is understanding how bishops attack and that they are restricted to squares of a single color.\n    *   The 28 edge squares are divided equally into 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n    *   Bishops on white squares can't attack bishops on black squares, so we can solve the problem for each color independently and add the results.\n    *   **For the 14 white edge squares:** We can place a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops. A simple way to visualize this is by placing bishops on all the white squares in the first column (`a2`, `a4`, `a6`, `a8`) and the last column (`h2`, `h4`, `h6`). This gives 4 + 3 = 7 bishops. These 7 bishops will cover (attack) the remaining 7 white edge squares.\n    *   **For the 14 black edge squares:** By symmetry, the same logic applies. We can place a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares (e.g., at `a1`, `a3`, `a5`, `a7` and `h3`, `h5`, `h7`).\n    *   Therefore, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge is 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Empty Squares:** To find the number of edge squares lacking bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on an 8x8 chessboard\n    after placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An N x N board has 4 sides with N-1 unique squares each.\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # For an even-sized N x N board, we can place N-1 bishops on the white\n    # edge squares and N-1 on the black edge squares.\n    # For N=8, this is 7 on white and 7 on black.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = 2 * (board_size - 1)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares that will lack bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    print(\"--- Chess Bishop Puzzle ---\")\n    print(f\"Total number of edge squares on a {board_size}x{board_size} board: {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"Maximum non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge: {max_bishops_on_edge}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the number of squares lacking bishops, we calculate:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} (total edge squares) - {max_bishops_on_edge} (placed bishops) = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {empty_edge_squares} edge squares would lack bishops.\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
