    "The value computed as the time between consecutive heartbeats for measuring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is known as the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI). When using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this is specifically called the R-R interval. Since the tracking is done with PPG, Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) is the more general and appropriate term.\n\nI will provide a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef print_hrv_term():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function defines and prints the term for the value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The value between heartbeats is the time interval.\n  term = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n  \n  # Print the explanation.\n  print(f\"The value computed as the time between heartbeats to measure HRV is called the: {term}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nprint_hrv_term()\n```\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
