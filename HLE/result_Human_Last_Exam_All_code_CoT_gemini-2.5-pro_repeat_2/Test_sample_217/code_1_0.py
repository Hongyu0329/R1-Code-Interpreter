# My analysis identified that triplets 3, 5, and 8 are the ones
# where all items—the biological mode, the two species, and their traits—are directly related.
# This script will print the numbers of these correct triplets as a final "equation".

# Define the numbers of the correct triplets in ascending order.
num1 = 3
num2 = 5
num3 = 8

# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation".
# I will format the output to resemble a simple statement or equation.
