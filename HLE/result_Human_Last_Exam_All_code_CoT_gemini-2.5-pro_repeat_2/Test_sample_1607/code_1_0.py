def solve_quantum_symmetry_statements():
    """
    Analyzes statements about quantum symmetries and identifies the true ones.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - A: False. The generator's spectrum can be continuous (e.g., momentum).
    - B: False. This statement has two parts, B1 and B2. B2 is false because the scaling
      generated by τ = xp + px scales x by e^(2θ), not e^θ. Since one part is false,
      the entire statement B is considered false.
    - C: False. The condition [τ, H] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [S, H] = 0.
    - D: True. If [τ, H] = 0, H(τ|ψ>) = τ(H|ψ>) = E(τ|ψ>). Degeneracy.
    - E: True. This is the definition of the rotation operator around the z-axis.
    - F: True. This is a direct consequence of the Ehrenfest theorem for conserved quantities.
    - G: False. Commutativity of S(θ) for different θ is always true for a single generator.
      It does not imply the generator must be Hermitian.
    - H: False. An unbounded operator (e.g., the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian) can have
      a discrete spectrum.
    - I: True. According to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, e^A * e^B != e^(A+B) if
      [A, B] is not zero, which is the case here.
    - J: True. If [S, H] = 0, H(S|ψ>) = S(H|ψ>) = E(S|ψ>). Degeneracy.

    The true statements are D, E, F, I, J.
