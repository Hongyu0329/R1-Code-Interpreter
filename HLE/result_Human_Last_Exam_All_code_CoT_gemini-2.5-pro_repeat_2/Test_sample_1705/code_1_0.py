    """
    This function calculates the requested value based on a mathematical analysis
    of the problem.

    The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S of points x_0
    for which the orbit under f(x) = (2x + sin(2*pi*x))/3 has exactly 7 distinct values.

    1.  A sequence with a finite number of values must be pre-periodic.
        This means for an x_0 in S, its sequence eventually enters a cycle.
        The total number of distinct points is the sum of the pre-period length (k)
        and the cycle length (c), so k + c = 7.

    2.  This implies that every point in S is a pre-periodic point for the function f.

    3.  The function f(x) is analytic. For analytic functions on a compact interval,
        the set of periodic points is countable.

    4.  The set of pre-images of any point is finite. Consequently, the set of all
        pre-periodic points is also countable.

    5.  Since S is a subset of a countable set, S itself is countable.

    6.  The Lebesgue measure of any countable set of real numbers is 0.

    7.  Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.
