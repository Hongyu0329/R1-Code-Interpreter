    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n1.  The user wants to find the value of the infinite product $$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\n2.  This product is related to a known mathematical identity involving the Gamma function. The general identity for a product starting from n=1 is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^k}{n^k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}\\Gamma(1 - x e^{2\\pi i j / k})} $$\n3.  For this specific problem, we have $k=3$. The cubic roots of unity are $1$, $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$. So the product from $n=1$ is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n4.  The user's product starts from $n=3$. We can express it by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n5.  Substituting the identity from step 3, we get the final expression:\n    $$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n6.  I will use the `sympy` library in Python to construct this symbolic expression and print it. This will ensure all the numbers and symbols in the final equation are correctly represented as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the expression:\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the symbolic expression for the given infinite product\n    using the Gamma function identity and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 'z'.\n    z = sympy.Symbol('z')\n\n    # The problem is to evaluate the infinite product starting from n=3.\n    # We use the known identity for the product from n=1.\n    # The numbers in the equation are 1, 3, 2, 8, and the constants in Gamma and roots of unity.\n\n    # Define the complex cubic roots of unity, w = exp(2*pi*I/3) and w^2 = exp(4*pi*I/3).\n    # These contain the numbers 2, 3, 4, pi, and I.\n    omega = sympy.exp(2 * sympy.pi * sympy.I / 3)\n    omega_sq = sympy.exp(4 * sympy.pi * sympy.I / 3)\n\n    # The product of Gamma functions in the denominator of the identity. The number 1 is in the argument.\n    gamma_product = sympy.gamma(1 - z) * sympy.gamma(1 - z * omega) * sympy.gamma(1 - z * omega_sq)\n\n    # The full infinite product starting from n=1.\n    infinite_product_from_1 = 1 / gamma_product\n\n    # The required product starts from n=3, so we divide by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    # Term for n=1 contains the numbers 1 and 3: (1 - z**3 / 1**3).\n    term_for_n_1 = (1 - z**3)\n    # Term for n=2 contains the numbers 2 and 3, which result in 8: (1 - z**3 / 2**3).\n    term_for_n_2 = (1 - z**3 / 8)\n\n    # The final expression is the product from n=1 divided by the first two terms.\n    final_expression = infinite_product_from_1 / (term_for_n_1 * term_for_n_2)\n\n    # Print the final symbolic expression. The string representation will contain all the numbers.\n    print(final_expression)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1/((1 - z**3)*(1 - z**3/8)*gamma(1 - z)*gamma(1 - z*exp(2*I*pi/3))*gamma(1 - z*exp(4*I*pi/3)))>>>"
