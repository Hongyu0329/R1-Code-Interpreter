# This script calculates the number of 2-bridge knots with crossing number up to 13
# that have two disjoint, non-parallel, minimal genus Seifert surfaces.

# Step 1: Analyze the core mathematical property.
# The question requires counting knots that admit a pair of Seifert surfaces with three specific properties:
# 1. Minimal Genus: The surfaces have the smallest possible genus for the given knot.
# 2. Disjoint: The interiors of the two surfaces do not intersect.
# 3. Non-parallel: The two surfaces are not isotopic in the knot complement.

# Step 2: Apply a key theorem from knot theory.
# A theorem by T. Kobayashi ("Uniqueness of minimal genus Seifert surfaces for links", 1989)
# states that for any knot K in S^3, if two of its minimal genus Seifert surfaces are disjoint,
# then they MUST be parallel (isotopic).

# Step 3: Identify the logical contradiction.
# The user's query asks for surfaces that are both "disjoint" and "non-parallel".
# However, Kobayashi's theorem establishes that for a knot's minimal genus Seifert surfaces,
# the property of being "disjoint" implies the property of being "parallel".
# Therefore, the required conditions are mutually exclusive. It is impossible for such surfaces to exist.

# Step 4: Conclude the count.
# Since no knot can satisfy these contradictory conditions, the set of such knots is empty.
# The other constraints (knot type, crossing number) are irrelevant.
# The number of such knots is 0.

# The final calculation is based on this logical deduction, not a search.
number_of_knots = 0

# Step 5: Output the result as an equation as requested.
# The final equation is simply the assignment of the calculated count.
print("The final equation for the number of such knots is:")
print(f"count = {number_of_knots}")
