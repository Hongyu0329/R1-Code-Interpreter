def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    - Apis (1): Larvae are in a hive. Unlikely.
    - Melipotini (2): Caterpillars are on foliage. Likely.
    - Eupholini (3): Larvae are internal borers. Unlikely.
    - Acritini (4): Larvae are in decaying matter. Unlikely.
    - Oxyptilini (5): Caterpillars can be borers or external. Possible, but less likely than others.
    - Dictyophorini (6): Nymphs are on foliage. Likely.
    - Acanthocerini (7): Larvae are in soil/wood. Unlikely.

    The most definitively unlikely tribes are those whose immatures are never
    found on the exterior of foliage.
