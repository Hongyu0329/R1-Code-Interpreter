# --- Main execution demonstrating the problem ---

# Let's consider a concrete example instance of the problem.

# Let G be the complete graph on 4 vertices, K_4.
# Let H be a triangle, K_3.

# Parameter: The size of H

# Output: The number of subgraphs of G isomorphic to H.
# This corresponds to counting the number of 3-cliques in a 4-clique.
# The expected answer is C(4, 3) = 4.
