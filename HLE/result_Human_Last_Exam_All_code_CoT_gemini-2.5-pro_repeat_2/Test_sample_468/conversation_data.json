    "Based on my research, the genus *Perdita* consists of very small bees, often with iridescent coloring, native to North and Central America. They are commonly referred to as \"fairy bees\". This name was in popular use for some time, for example, in the 2016 book \"The Bees in Your Backyard\". However, the name was formally proposed and standardized for the entire genus in a 2018 publication by the Entomological Society of America as part of the \"Common Names of North American Bees\" initiative. Therefore, 2018 is the year the name was officially \"coined\" or adopted for scientific and public use.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer:\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and the year it was coined\n    for the bee genus \"Perdita\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The common name for the genus \"Perdita\" is \"fairy bees\".\n    common_name = \"fairy bees\"\n    \n    # This common name was formally proposed and adopted in a publication\n    # by the Entomological Society of America in 2018.\n    year = 2018\n    \n    # The prompt requests that each number in the final output is also printed.\n    # In this case, the number is the year.\n    print(f\"The number in the final answer is: {year}\")\n\n    # Print the final answer in the required format: \"<name>, <year>\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {common_name}, {year}\")\n\nget_perdita_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<fairy bees, 2018>>>"
