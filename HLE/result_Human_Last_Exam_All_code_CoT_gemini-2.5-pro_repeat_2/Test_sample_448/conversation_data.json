    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases:** I will list the naturally occurring noble gases: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data:** I will use the standard atmospheric abundances for these gases, as the atmosphere is their primary reservoir on Earth, and comparing these values is sufficient to determine the rarest. The abundance values are generally stable and would not have significantly changed by 2002.\n3.  **Implement a Python Script:**\n    *   I'll store the names of the noble gases and their abundances (in parts per million, ppm) in a Python dictionary.\n    *   The script will then iterate through the dictionary to find the gas with the lowest abundance value.\n    *   Finally, it will calculate the percentage from the ppm value (since 1 ppm = 0.0001%) and print the result, showing the numbers used in the conversion. Radon's extreme rarity is due to its radioactivity and short half-life, making its concentration far lower than any other noble gas.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    atmospheric abundance and calculates its percentage.\n    The abundances are given for 2002, but these values are stable over time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Abundance of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n    # Data is a well-established scientific consensus.\n    # Radon's abundance is extremely low (approx. 1 part in 10^21) due to its radioactivity.\n    # 1 part in 10^21 is 1e-15 ppm.\n    noble_gas_abundances_ppm = {\n        'Helium': 5.24,\n        'Neon': 18.18,\n        'Argon': 9340,\n        'Krypton': 1.14,\n        'Xenon': 0.087,\n        'Radon': 1e-15\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances_ppm, key=noble_gas_abundances_ppm.get)\n    rarest_gas_ppm = noble_gas_abundances_ppm[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert the abundance from ppm to a percentage\n    # Conversion factor: 1 ppm = 0.0001 %\n    conversion_factor = 10000\n    rarest_gas_percentage = rarest_gas_ppm / conversion_factor\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The equation to find its percentage from its abundance in parts per million (ppm) is:\")\n    # Using scientific notation for better readability of the small numbers\n    print(f\"{rarest_gas_ppm:.1e} ppm / {conversion_factor} = {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e} %\")\n    print(f\"As a percentage of all terrestrial matter (approximated by atmospheric abundance), this is {rarest_gas_percentage:.21f}%.\")\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
