    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the spaces**: Let the domain be $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the codomain be $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  **Calculate the connectivity of the domain A**: The connectivity of a space is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected for $n \\ge 2$.\n    *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4$ is $4-2 = 2$.\n    *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^6$ is $6-2 = 4$.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product of a $k_1$-connected space and a $k_2$-connected space is $(k_1 + k_2 + 1)$.\n    *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1.\n    *   Therefore, the connectivity of $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $7+1=8$.\n3.  **Calculate the connectivity of the codomain B**:\n    *   The smash product $S^n \\wedge S^m$ is $(n+m-1)$-connected.\n    *   Connectivity of $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is $4+6-1 = 9$.\n    *   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ decreases connectivity by 1.\n    *   Therefore, the connectivity of $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $9-1=8$.\n4.  **Analyze the connectivity of the map f**: A map $f: A \\to B$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection (epimorphism) for $i=k$.\n    *   Since both $A$ and $B$ are 8-connected, their homotopy groups $\\pi_i(A)$ and $\\pi_i(B)$ are trivial for $i \\le 8$. The map between trivial groups is an isomorphism.\n    *   Thus, $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$. This means the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n    *   To determine if the map is 9-connected, we must check if $\\pi_9(f): \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a surjection.\n5.  **Compute the 9th homotopy groups**:\n    *   For the domain $A$: By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem applies, giving $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The homology of loop spaces of spheres is known: $H_*(\\Omega S^n; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the polynomial algebra $\\mathbb{Z}[x_{n-1}]$. So $H_*(\\Omega S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}[x_3]$ and $H_*(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}[y_5]$. By the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is generated by $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For the codomain $B$: $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is 9-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem applies, giving $\\pi_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong H_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n6.  **Determine the nature of the map on $\\pi_9$**: The map $\\pi_9(f)$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$, which must be multiplication by some integer $k$. For the map to be surjective, $k$ must be $\\pm 1$.\n7.  **Identify the map and find k**: The map $f$ is the adjoint of the canonical map $c: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, which is a fundamental map in the theory of iterated loop spaces. This map takes the smash product of loops to a loop on a loop space. The generators of the respective homotopy groups correspond to identity maps on the spheres. The construction ensures that the generator of $\\pi_9(A)$ (which corresponds to $\\text{id}_{S^4} \\wedge \\text{id}_{S^6}$ on the level of loops) is mapped to the generator of $\\pi_9(B)$. Thus, the map on $\\pi_9$ is an isomorphism, meaning $k=\\pm 1$.\n8.  **Conclusion**: Since $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism, it is a surjection. Therefore, the map $f$ is 9-connected.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes the numerical calculations.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    m = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the domain A = Sigma(Omega S^n wedge Omega S^m)\n    conn_Omega_Sn = n - 2\n    conn_Omega_Sm = m - 2\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n} is n-2 = {conn_Omega_Sn}\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{m} is m-2 = {conn_Omega_Sm}\")\n\n    # Connectivity of a smash product X wedge Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1\n    conn_smash_loops = conn_Omega_Sn + conn_Omega_Sm + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of (Omega S^{n} wedge Omega S^{m}) is {conn_Omega_Sn} + {conn_Omega_Sm} + 1 = {conn_smash_loops}\")\n\n    # Connectivity of Sigma(X) is conn(X) + 1\n    conn_A = conn_smash_loops + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the domain A = Sigma(Omega S^{n} wedge Omega S^{m}) is {conn_smash_loops} + 1 = {conn_A}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Connectivity of the codomain B = Omega(S^n wedge S^m)\n    # Connectivity of S^n wedge S^m is n + m - 1\n    conn_smash_spheres = n + m - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of (S^{n} wedge S^{m}) is {n} + {m} - 1 = {conn_smash_spheres}\")\n\n    # Connectivity of Omega(X) is conn(X) - 1\n    conn_B = conn_smash_spheres - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the codomain B = Omega(S^{n} wedge S^{m}) is {conn_smash_spheres} - 1 = {conn_B}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the map connectivity\n    # The map is k-connected if pi_i(f) is an isomorphism for i < k and an epimorphism for i = k.\n    # Since conn(A) = conn(B) = 8, pi_i(A) = pi_i(B) = 0 for i <= 8.\n    # The map is an isomorphism for i <= 8, so the map is at least 8-connected.\n    # We check the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group, pi_9.\n    first_nontrivial_pi = conn_A + 1\n    print(f\"The first non-trivial homotopy group to check is pi_{first_nontrivial_pi}.\")\n\n    # pi_9(A) = Z and pi_9(B) = Z.
