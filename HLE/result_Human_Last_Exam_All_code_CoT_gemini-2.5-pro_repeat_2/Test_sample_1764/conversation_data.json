    "An isometric embedding is a function that preserves distances between spaces. We are looking for the smallest possible number of such functions that can exist between a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Let $N(X, B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings from a space $X$ to a space $B$. We want to find the minimum value of $N(X, B)$ across all possible choices of $X$ and $B$ that fit the problem's description.\n2.  An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for any two points $x_1, x_2$ in $X$, the distance $d(x_1, x_2)$ is equal to the norm of the difference of their images in $B$, i.e., $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B$.\n3.  We will test a simple case to see if it's possible for the number of embeddings to be zero.\n4.  Consider the simplest non-trivial finite ultrametric space: a two-point space $X = \\{a, b\\}$ with the metric $d(a, b) = 1$.\n5.  Consider the simplest Banach space: the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$, which contains only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\| = 0$.\n6.  For an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ to exist, we must satisfy the distance-preserving property. For the points $a$ and $b$, this means $\\|f(a) - f(b)\\|_B = d(a, b)$.\n7.  Let's substitute the values from our chosen spaces into this equation and check for consistency.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings from a\n    finite ultrametric space X to a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the spaces for our test case.\n    # Let X be a finite ultrametric space with two points, a and b.\n    # The distance between them is d(a, b) = 1.\n    distance_in_X = 1\n\n    # Let B be the trivial Banach space {0}.\n    # The only vector in B is the zero vector.
