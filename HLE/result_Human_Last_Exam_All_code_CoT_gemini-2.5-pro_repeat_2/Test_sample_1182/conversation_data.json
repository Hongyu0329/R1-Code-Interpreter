    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve at the prime $p=2$. The number of double points is the number of nodes in this stable reduction.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Write down the curve equation.**\n    The curve is given by $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n\n2.  **Find a better model.**\n    The reduction of this equation modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$, which is $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This is a non-reduced scheme (a \"double line\"), so the model is not stable. We need to find a new model of the curve over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ that has a stable special fiber over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A model is a curve isomorphic to the original one over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n3.  **Perform a change of variables.**\n    Let's try a change of variables $(x, y) \\to (X, Y)$. A suitable transformation is a scaling of the coordinates, for example, $x = uX, y = vY$ for some $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2^*$. Let's try $x = X/2$ and $y=Y/2$. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n    Substituting these into the original equation:\n    $(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n    $Y^2/4 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    $Y^2/4 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    Multiplying by 4, we get a new model for the curve:\n    $C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\n    This model is defined over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, as all coefficients are integers.\n\n4.  **Analyze the reduction of the new model.**\n    We take the equation for $C'$ and reduce it modulo 2.\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2 \\pmod 2$\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1) \\pmod 2$\n    Let's call this reduced curve $\\bar{C'}$. A curve is stable if it is reduced and its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\n5.  **Check if the reduced curve is stable.**\n    a.  **Reduced:** The polynomial $P(X,Y) = Y^2 - X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)$ has no repeated factors (since $X^3+X^2+1$ is separable), so the curve $\\bar{C'}$ is reduced.\n    b.  **Singularities:** We find the singular points by solving $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial X} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial Y} = 0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n        $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial Y} = 2Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This is true for all $Y$.\n        However, in the ring of formal derivatives, this is $2Y=0 \\implies Y=0$.\n        $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial X} = -(2X(X^3+X^2+1) + X^2(3X^2+2X)) \\equiv -(X^2(X^2)) \\equiv -X^4 \\equiv X^4 \\pmod 2$.\n        $X^4 = 0$ implies $X=0$.\n        So, the only singular point is $(X,Y)=(0,0)$.\n    c.  **Type of singularity:** To classify the singularity at $(0,0)$, we examine the lowest-degree terms of the equation $Y^2 - X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)=0$.\n        $Y^2 - X^5 - X^4 - X^2 = 0$.\n        The lowest-degree homogeneous part is $Y^2 - X^2$.\n        Since $Y^2-X^2 = (Y-X)(Y+X)$ is a product of two distinct linear factors, the singularity is an ordinary double point (a node).\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ is a reduced curve with only one singularity, which is a node. Therefore, $\\bar{C'}$ is a stable curve, and it represents the stable reduction of the original curve. The number of double points is the number of nodes, which is 1.\n\n```python\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the steps to find the number of double points\n    in the stable reduction of the curve y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5.\n    The actual calculations are mathematical and are explained in the comments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The original curve is C: y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x.\n    # We find a new model C' over the 2-adic integers by the transformation\n    # x = X/2, y = Y/2.
