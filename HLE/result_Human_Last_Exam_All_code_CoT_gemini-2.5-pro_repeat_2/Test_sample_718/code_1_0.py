    The problem asks for the value of 'n' such that any 'tame' functor f from an upper semilattice J to the category of K-vector spaces is 'n-resolvable'.

Here is the step-by-step derivation:

1.  **Understanding the Terms:**
    *   An **upper semilattice (J)** is a partially ordered set where any two elements have a least upper bound (a join).
    *   A functor f is **n-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length at most n. This is equivalent to saying its projective dimension, pd(f), is less than or equal to n.
    *   The problem is asking for an upper bound on the projective dimension of any tame functor defined on an upper semilattice.

2.  **From Functors to Algebras:** The category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K) (for a finite poset J) is equivalent to the category of modules over the **incidence algebra** K[J]. The projective dimension of a functor f corresponds to the projective dimension of its associated K[J]-module. The question can thus be rephrased in terms of this algebra.

3.  **A Key Theorem on Incidence Algebras:** A fundamental result in representation theory states that the incidence algebra K[J] is **hereditary** if and only if the poset J does not contain a subposet isomorphic to the **"crown"**. The crown poset is the set {a, b, c, d} with the four relations a < c, b < c, a < d, and b < d, and no other relations between them.

4.  **Hereditary Algebras and Global Dimension:** An algebra is defined as hereditary if its global dimension is at most 1. This means that *every* module over that algebra has a projective dimension of at most 1.

5.  **Connecting the Dots: Upper Semilattices Cannot Contain Crowns:**
    *   Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an upper semilattice J *does* contain a crown {a, b, c, d}.
    *   By the definition of an upper semilattice, the join of elements 'a' and 'b', let's call it k = a v b, must exist within J.
    *   By the definition of a join, k is the *least* upper bound of a and b.
    *   In the crown structure, both c and d are upper bounds of a and b.
    *   Because k is the *least* upper bound, k must be less than or equal to any other upper bound. Therefore, k <= c and k <= d.
    *   The existence of such an element k, which sits "between" {a,b} and {c,d}, contradicts the minimal structure of a crown poset.
    *   Therefore, an upper semilattice J cannot contain a crown.

6.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Since J is an upper semilattice, it does not contain a crown.
    *   This implies its incidence algebra K[J] is hereditary.
    *   This means the global dimension of the module category (and thus the functor category) is at most 1.
    *   Therefore, *any* functor f: J -> Vect_K has a projective dimension of at most 1.
    *   This makes any functor 1-resolvable. The condition that the functor is "tame" is therefore redundant information.

The final equation is n = 1.
