    "This is a question from homological algebra, specifically the representation theory of posets. I will provide a Python script that explains the logical steps to arrive at the answer and then prints the final numerical result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will clarify the mathematical terms involved: \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\".\n2.  The core of the problem lies in determining the global homological dimension of the category of functors on an upper semilattice, `Fun(J, Vect_K)`. An object being `n`-resolvable means its projective dimension is at most `n`.\n3.  I will connect the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` to the category of modules over the incidence algebra `K[J]`. The homological properties of these two categories are the same.\n4.  I will use a key theorem that relates the global dimension of `K[J]` to the structure of the poset `J`. Specifically, `K[J]` has a global dimension of at most 1 (making it a \"hereditary\" algebra) if and only if `J` does not contain a \"crown\" subposet.\n5.  I will then show that the definition of an \"upper semilattice\" logically prevents it from containing a \"crown\" subposet.\n6.  This implies that the incidence algebra `K[J]` is hereditary and has a global dimension of at most 1.\n7.  Therefore, any functor `f: J -> Vect_K` must have a projective dimension of at most 1. This means any such functor is 1-resolvable. The condition of the functor being \"tame\" is a consequence of this structure, but not required for the proof.\n8.  The Python code will encapsulate this reasoning and print the final value for `n`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homological_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to determine the value of n for which\n    a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The problem asks for the value of 'n' such that any 'tame' functor f from an upper semilattice J to the category of K-vector spaces is 'n-resolvable'.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terms:**\n    *   An **upper semilattice (J)** is a partially ordered set where any two elements have a least upper bound (a join).\n    *   A functor f is **n-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length at most n. This is equivalent to saying its projective dimension, pd(f), is less than or equal to n.\n    *   The problem is asking for an upper bound on the projective dimension of any tame functor defined on an upper semilattice.\n\n2.  **From Functors to Algebras:** The category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K) (for a finite poset J) is equivalent to the category of modules over the **incidence algebra** K[J]. The projective dimension of a functor f corresponds to the projective dimension of its associated K[J]-module. The question can thus be rephrased in terms of this algebra.\n\n3.  **A Key Theorem on Incidence Algebras:** A fundamental result in representation theory states that the incidence algebra K[J] is **hereditary** if and only if the poset J does not contain a subposet isomorphic to the **\"crown\"**. The crown poset is the set {a, b, c, d} with the four relations a < c, b < c, a < d, and b < d, and no other relations between them.\n\n4.  **Hereditary Algebras and Global Dimension:** An algebra is defined as hereditary if its global dimension is at most 1. This means that *every* module over that algebra has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\n5.  **Connecting the Dots: Upper Semilattices Cannot Contain Crowns:**\n    *   Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an upper semilattice J *does* contain a crown {a, b, c, d}.\n    *   By the definition of an upper semilattice, the join of elements 'a' and 'b', let's call it k = a v b, must exist within J.\n    *   By the definition of a join, k is the *least* upper bound of a and b.\n    *   In the crown structure, both c and d are upper bounds of a and b.\n    *   Because k is the *least* upper bound, k must be less than or equal to any other upper bound. Therefore, k <= c and k <= d.\n    *   The existence of such an element k, which sits \"between\" {a,b} and {c,d}, contradicts the minimal structure of a crown poset.\n    *   Therefore, an upper semilattice J cannot contain a crown.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since J is an upper semilattice, it does not contain a crown.\n    *   This implies its incidence algebra K[J] is hereditary.\n    *   This means the global dimension of the module category (and thus the functor category) is at most 1.\n    *   Therefore, *any* functor f: J -> Vect_K has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n    *   This makes any functor 1-resolvable. The condition that the functor is \"tame\" is therefore redundant information.\n\nThe final equation is n = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\n    n = 1\n    print(\"The numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    print(n)\n\nsolve_homological_question()\n<<<1>>>\n```"
