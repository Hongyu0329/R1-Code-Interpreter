    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem of coloring a figure-eight knot is a classic example in knot theory. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Define Knot Coloring:** Knot coloring is a method of labeling the arcs of a knot diagram. We assign an integer \"color\" to each arc from the set `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` for some integer `n`.\n2.  **State the Coloring Rule:** At every crossing, three arcs meet. If the over-crossing arc has color `c`, and the two under-crossing arcs have colors `a` and `b`, they must satisfy the equation `2*c = a + b` (all calculations are done modulo `n`).\n3.  **Identify Non-Trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"non-trivial\" if at least two different colors are used. The smallest `n > 1` for which such a non-trivial coloring exists gives the size of the smallest algebraic structure (`Z_n`) that can color the knot.\n4.  **Model the Figure-Eight Knot:** The figure-eight knot has 4 arcs and 4 crossings. We can set up a system of four linear equations based on the coloring rule, one for each crossing.\n5.  **Find the Smallest `n`:** I will write a Python script to find the smallest integer `n` (starting from 2) that allows a non-trivial solution to this system of equations. The script will iterate through `n` and for each `n`, it will check all possible color assignments for the 4 arcs until it finds a valid, non-trivial coloring. The first `n` that works is the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest number of colors (n > 1) to non-trivially color the figure-eight knot.\n\n    The figure-eight knot has 4 arcs. Let their colors be x1, x2, x3, x4.\n    The coloring equations at the four crossings are:\n    1. 2*x2 = x1 + x4\n    2. 2*x3 = x1 + x2\n    3. 2*x4 = x2 + x3\n    4. 2*x1 = x3 + x4\n    All equations are modulo n, the number of colors.\n\n    This function searches for the smallest n > 1 that has a non-trivial solution\n    (where not all colors are the same).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Start checking from n=2, as n=1 is always trivial.\n    for n in range(2, 10):\n        # Generate all possible color assignments for the 4 arcs using n colors.\n        colors = range(n)\n        for coloring in itertools.product(colors, repeat=4):\n            x1, x2, x3, x4 = coloring\n\n            # We need a non-trivial coloring (at least two different colors).\n            if len(set(coloring)) > 1:\n                # Check if the coloring satisfies all four crossing equations modulo n.\n                # In Python, '%' is the remainder operator, which works for our modular arithmetic needs.\n                eq1_ok = (2 * x2) % n == (x1 + x4) % n\n                eq2_ok = (2 * x3) % n == (x1 + x2) % n\n                eq3_ok = (2 * x4) % n == (x2 + x3) % n\n                eq4_ok = (2 * x1) % n == (x3 + x4) % n\n\n                if eq1_ok and eq2_ok and eq3_ok and eq4_ok:\n                    # We found the smallest n that works.\n                    print(f\"The smallest number of colors is {n}.\")\n                    print(\"This means the smallest algebraic structure has \" + str(n) + \" elements.\")\n                    print(f\"\\nAn example of a valid non-trivial coloring is (x1,x2,x3,x4) = {coloring}.\")\n                    print(f\"Let's verify this coloring with the rule '2 * over_arc = under_arc_1 + under_arc_2' (mod {n}):\\n\")\n                    \n                    # Outputting each number in the final equations\n                    print(f\"Equation 1 (2*x2 = x1+x4): 2*{x2} = {x1} + {x4}  =>  {2*x2} = {x1+x4}.
