    print("Analysis: Gradient descent is a descent method. For a suitable constant step size (e.g., gamma < 2/L where L is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient), the function value is guaranteed to decrease at each step unless the gradient is zero. The standard analysis shows that the sum of the squared gradient norms is finite, which implies that the gradient norm ||grad(f(x_k))|| must converge to 0. Therefore, any limit point x* must be a stationary point (grad(f(x*)) = 0).")

    print("Analysis: If the sequence of iterates x_k converges to a point x*, the distance between consecutive iterates, ||x_{k+1} - x_k||, must go to 0. From the update rule, this implies that the update vector itself must effectively go to zero. Under standard assumptions (e.g., gamma is bounded away from zero, C is convex), this forces the projected gradient term, Proj_{T_{x_k}C}(-grad(f(x_k))), to converge to 0. By continuity, the limit point x* must satisfy the stationarity condition: ||Proj_{T_{x*}C}(-grad(f(x*)))|| = 0.")

    print("Analysis: Due to the momentum term, this is not a descent method, which makes its analysis more complex. A common but flawed argument involves taking the limit of the update equation. If x_k -> x*, then (x_k - x_{k-1}) -> 0 and (x_{k+1} - x_k) -> 0. This leads to the equation:")
