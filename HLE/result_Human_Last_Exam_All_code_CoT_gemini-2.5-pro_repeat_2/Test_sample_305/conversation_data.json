    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the input:** We have a set S with 3 distinct elements. Let's label them {0, 1, 2}. A binary operation is a function from S x S to S.\n\n2.  **Represent the operation:** A binary operation can be represented by a 3x3 Cayley table (or multiplication table). The entry at row `i` and column `j` represents the result of `i * j`.\n\n3.  **Apply the commutative property:** An operation `*` is commutative if `i * j = j * i` for all `i, j` in S. This means the Cayley table must be symmetric about its main diagonal. Because of this symmetry, we only need to define the values on the main diagonal and the upper triangle. The number of such entries for a set of size `n` is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. For n=3, this is `3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n\n4.  **Count commutative operations:** For each of these 6 unique entries, the result can be any of the 3 elements in S. Therefore, the total number of distinct commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 3^6 = 729.\n\n5.  **Apply the associative property:** An operation `*` is associative if `(i * j) * k = i * (j * k)` for all `i, j, k` in S.\n\n6.  **Brute-force check:** We can write a script to check all 729 commutative operations. The script will:\n    a. Iterate through every possible commutative Cayley table.\n    b. For each table, check if the associative property holds for all 3^3 = 27 possible combinations of (i, j, k).\n    c. Count how many tables satisfy the property.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of a given size n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n\n    # A commutative operation on a set of n elements is determined by the\n    # values on the main diagonal and upper triangle of its Cayley table.\n    # The number of such entries is n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    num_upper_triangle_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # We create a list of index pairs for these upper-triangle entries.\n    upper_triangle_indices = []\n    for i in elements:\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            upper_triangle_indices.append((i, j))\n\n    associative_commutative_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through all possible ways to fill the upper triangle of the\n    # Cayley table.
