    print(f" - This creates a logical contradiction, as it implies: Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int.")
    print("\nThis contradiction shows that if P existed, its code could not be shorter than 10000 characters.")
    print("However, the Halting Problem argument already proves P cannot exist at all.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Because computing def_superfast(10000) is equivalent to solving the Halting Problem, and also leads to self-referential paradoxes, no such program P can exist.")
