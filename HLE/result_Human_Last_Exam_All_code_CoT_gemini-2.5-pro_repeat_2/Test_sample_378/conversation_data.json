    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different prominent Nigerian leader, the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\nTherefore, I will write a Python script to clarify this. The script will:\n1.  State the correct name for Goodluck Jonathan.\n2.  Explain that he has never publicly identified as \"Azikiwe\".\n3.  Conclude that no year can be given for an event that did not happen.\n4.  To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation\" with a \"number\", I will state that the year for this event is 0, as it never occurred.\n\n```python\ndef check_identification_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's query about when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\n    publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    historical_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    print(f\"The public figure's full name is {correct_name}.\")\n    print(\"There are no public records indicating that he has ever identified himself as 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is associated with {historical_figure}, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(\"\\nBecause this event never occurred, a year cannot be provided.\")\n\n    # To satisfy the prompt's format, we present the result as an equation.\n    # The year is 0, signifying that the event did not happen.\n    year = 0\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: Year = {year}\")\n\ncheck_identification_year()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
