    "The riddle describes the Russian explorer and statesman Nikolai Rezanov. The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which is based on Rezanov's story. Rezanov died and was buried in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was lost after the cathedral where he was interred was destroyed by the Soviets. His remains were rediscovered during construction work in the late 1980s.\n\nThe following Python code will print his last name.\n\n```python\n# The man described is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807).\n# He was a Russian nobleman whose efforts to colonize Alaska and California\n# became the subject of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n# The libretto for this opera was written by Andrei Voznesensky.\n# Rezanov's grave was lost and then rediscovered in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1980s.\n\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
