    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic control theory problem known as pole placement or eigenvalue assignment.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are equal to the desired values, which are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n2.  **Formulate the Characteristic Polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues correspond to a specific characteristic polynomial. For eigenvalues `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`. For the given poles, this is `(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n3.  **Use a Specialized Library:** I will use the `python-control` library, which provides a function `control.place()` designed specifically for pole placement problems. This function is robust and handles the underlying linear algebra.\n4.  **Adapt for the Problem's Formulation:** The `control.place(A, B, p)` function calculates a gain matrix `K` for a system where the control law is `u = -Kx`, leading to a closed-loop system of `A - BK`. In your problem, the control law is `u = Fx`, resulting in `A + BF`. Therefore, the gain matrix we are looking for is `F = -K`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will define the matrices `A` and `B`, specify the desired poles `p`, calculate `K` using `control.place()`, find `F = -K`, and then print all the matrices involved in the final equation `A_cl = A + B * F`.\n6.  **Verification:** Finally, the code will calculate the eigenvalues of the resulting `A_cl` to confirm that they match the desired poles.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem. You will need to have the `numpy`, `scipy`, and `control` libraries installed (`pip install numpy scipy control`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system so that\n    the closed-loop system A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices A and B\n    A = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n    B = np.array([[1., 2.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n\n    # Define the desired eigenvalues (poles) for the closed-loop system\n    desired_poles = np.array([-1. + 1.j, -1. - 1.j])\n\n    # The control.place function solves for K in the equation A - BK.\n    # Our problem is formulated as A + BF.\n    # Therefore, we can find K and then F = -K.\n    try:\n        K = ct.place(A, B, desired_poles)\n        F = -K\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during pole placement: {e}\")\n        print(\"This may happen if the system is not controllable.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the resulting closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B * F\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"Given system matrix A:\")\n    print(A)\n\n    print(\"\\nGiven input matrix B:\")\n    print(B)\n\n    print(\"\\nDesired eigenvalues:\")\n    print(desired_poles)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculated state feedback gain matrix F:\")\n    print(F)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is A_cl = A + B * F, where A_cl is the closed-loop matrix.\")\n    print(\"\\nResulting closed-loop matrix A_cl:\")\n    print(A_cl)\n\n    # Verification step: Calculate the eigenvalues of the new system A + BF\n    eigenvalues_of_A_cl = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    print(\"\\nVerification: Eigenvalues of the closed-loop system A_cl:\")\n    # Sort for consistent comparison\n    eigenvalues_of_A_cl.sort(key=np.imag)\n    print(eigenvalues_of_A_cl)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_pole_placement()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system so that\n    the closed-loop system A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices A and B\n    A = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n    B = np.array([[1., 2.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n\n    # Define the desired eigenvalues (poles) for the closed-loop system\n    desired_poles = np.array([-1. + 1.j, -1. - 1.j])\n\n    # The control.place function solves for K in the equation A - BK.\n    # Our problem is formulated as A + BF.\n    # Therefore, we can find K and then F = -K.\n    try:\n        K = ct.place(A, B, desired_poles)\n        F = -K\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during pole placement: {e}\")\n        print(\"This may happen if the system is not controllable.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the resulting closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B * F\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"Given system matrix A:\")\n    print(A)\n\n    print(\"\\nGiven input matrix B:\")\n    print(B)\n\n    print(\"\\nDesired eigenvalues:\")\n    print(desired_poles)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculated state feedback gain matrix F:\")\n    print(F)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is A_cl = A + B * F, where A_cl is the closed-loop matrix.\")\n    print(\"\\nResulting closed-loop matrix A_cl:\")\n    print(A_cl)\n\n    # Verification step: Calculate the eigenvalues of the new system A + BF\n    eigenvalues_of_A_cl = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    print(\"\\nVerification: Eigenvalues of the closed-loop system A_cl:\")\n    # Sort for consistent comparison\n    eigenvalues_of_A_cl.sort(key=np.imag)\n    print(eigenvalues_of_A_cl)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_pole_placement()\n```"
