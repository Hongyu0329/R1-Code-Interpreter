# In this universe, a proposition P is a Quantum Temporal Fixed Point (QTFP)
# if the result of the temporal quantum conjunction (P ⊙ P) is the same
# for forward and backward time-flows.

# The condition is:
# Forward Flow Result = Backward Flow Result
# sqrt((P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P)) = sqrt((P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P))

# This simplifies to comparing the expressions inside the square root:
# (P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P) = (P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P)

# We will analyze these two expressions using Boolean algebra,
# representing True with the number 1 and False with the number 0.

# Analyze the Left-Hand Side (Forward Flow expression):
# (P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P) simplifies to (P ∨ ¬P).
# By the Law of the Excluded Middle, (P ∨ ¬P) is always True.
forward_flow_value = 1

# Analyze the Right-Hand Side (Backward Flow expression):
# (P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P) simplifies to (False ∨ False).
# By the Law of Non-Contradiction, this is always False.
backward_flow_value = 0

# For P to be a QTFP, the two values must be equal.
# This leads to a final equation derived from the problem's definitions.
