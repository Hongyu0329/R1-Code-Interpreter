    This function calculates the requested value based on the derived formula.
    
    The derivation proceeds as follows:
    1. The function l(a) is the derivative of a log-probability density, l(a) = d/da [ln(p(U(a)))].
    2. For the specified matrix log-normal distribution, the log-pdf ln(p(Y)) consists of three main parts:
       - A quadratic term involving Sigma inverse, which becomes negligible for large n.
       - A term from the Jacobian of the matrix exponential map.
       - A term from the determinant of Y related to the measure on the space of SPD matrices.
    3. For n = 10^9, we can use large-n asymptotics to simplify the derivatives of these terms.
    4. The derivative l(a) is approximated by: l(a) approx (n-3)/a - 2(n-1)/(a*ln(n*a^2)).
    5. The final value is the floor of the sum of l(a_i) over the first 10 prime numbers.
