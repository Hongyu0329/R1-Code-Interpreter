    "My plan is to first identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" and then to find information within the plot summary about their marriage. I will then create a Python script to store the name of the character they marry and print it as the output.\n\n1.  **Identify the main character:** The protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n2.  **Find the spouse's name:** In the novel, Adam Zamoyski's primary guide and companion in the far-future world is a powerful, non-human entity. Their relationship evolves, and he ultimately marries this entity.\n3.  **Store and print the name:** The name of this character is Angelina. I will write a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the name of the character that the protagonist of\n# Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\n# The protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski.\n# He marries a posthuman entity.\nwife_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(f\"The character that the main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries is named: {wife_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
