    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scientific Problem:** The user is asking for an optimal material composition (Ni/Ce ratio) for catalytic reactions. This is not a value that can be derived from a simple calculation but is instead determined through extensive experimental research found in scientific literature.\n2.  **Consult Scientific Knowledge:** I will access my knowledge base of materials science and catalysis research to find the consensus on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions. The key is the synergy between Ni (the active metal) and Ceria (the support), which provides oxygen vacancies. The optimal ratio maximizes this synergy by ensuring high dispersion of Ni atoms, preventing them from clumping together (sintering), and creating the maximum number of active Ni-O-Ce interface sites.\n3.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Research indicates that for both reactions, a relatively low Ni loading is preferable. A commonly cited optimal atomic ratio is where there is approximately 1 Ni atom for every 9 Ce atoms. This translates to an atomic ratio of 1/9 or ~0.11.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will create a Python script that uses `print()` statements to explain this reasoning and present the final answer. The code will explicitly define the numbers in the ratio and print the final \"equation\" to satisfy the user's request.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and presents the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio\n    for catalytic applications based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Determining the Ideal Ni/Ce Atomic Ratio for Catalysis\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a fixed theoretical value but is determined experimentally.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to maximize the synergistic effect between Ni and the Ceria support, which is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\")\n    print(\"\\nKey Factors:\")\n    print(\"1. High Ni Dispersion: Prevents the formation of large Ni clusters, maximizing active surface area.\")\n    print(\"2. Strong Metal-Support Interaction: Creates highly active Ni-O-Ce interface sites.\")\n    print(\"3. Ceria Redox Properties: The CeO2 support provides oxygen vacancies that participate in the catalytic cycle.\\n\")\n\n    # Based on experimental data from scientific literature, a common optimal ratio is found.\n    # We will represent this ratio as an \"equation\".\n    ni_parts = 1\n    ce_parts = 9\n    \n    # Calculate the decimal value of the ratio\n    decimal_ratio = ni_parts / ce_parts\n    \n    print(\"Based on experimental findings, an excellent balance of activity and stability is often achieved with the following atomic ratio:\")\n    print(f\"Ideal Ratio -> Ni : Ce = {ni_parts} : {ce_parts}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Ni / Ce = {ni_parts} / {ce_parts} â‰ˆ {decimal_ratio:.2f}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_ideal_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<0.11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
