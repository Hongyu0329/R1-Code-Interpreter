        "1. The provided subterm relation is pathological. In dependent type theory, functions defined by structural recursion must terminate. This is guaranteed by requiring recursive calls to be on structurally smaller arguments. The given rules, such as 'a case analysis C is a subterm of X whenever all branches of C are subterms of X', violate this principle. It allows a function f(X) to make a recursive call on an expression like `case X of ...`, which is not structurally smaller and thus can lead to non-terminating loops.",
        
        "2. The ability to define non-terminating functions is equivalent to having a general recursion operator, often called a fixed-point combinator (like the Y combinator). This breaks the logical consistency of the type theory, as non-terminating programs cannot be considered valid proofs.",
        
        "3. The combination of general recursion and an impredicative universe of propositions (a standard feature of systems like the Calculus of Constructions, where one can quantify over all propositions to form a new proposition) is known to be inconsistent. This is famously demonstrated by Girard's Paradox.",
        
        "4. Girard's paradox is a paradox of size and self-reference, similar to Russell's paradox. It constructs a paradoxical type by exploiting the ability to quantify over an entire universe of types. The general recursion provided by the faulty subterm rules allows one to construct a term of this paradoxical type, which in turn allows the construction of a term of the empty type (a proof of False), making the system inconsistent.",
        
        "5. The question asks which axiom is inconsistent with this setup. The paradox of Girard is fundamentally about the structure of the hierarchy of universes. The axiom on the list that directly deals with this structure is Propositional Resizing. This axiom states that any proposition (a type in the lowest universe, Prop) has an equivalent counterpart in any higher universe (Type_i). It makes a very strong claim about the 'smallness' of the impredicative universe Prop. This claim about universe structure is precisely what is undermined by the paradox, which shows that the universe hierarchy cannot be collapsed in this way without contradiction when general recursion is present."
