    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Identify the mathematical object in question. The \"space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $Gr(3, 5)$.\n2.  The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  Recall the structure of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians. It is a well-established result in algebraic topology that the integral cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$ are free abelian groups for all $i$. This means they have no torsion.\n4.  The entire cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of these individual cohomology groups. A direct sum of torsion-free groups is itself torsion-free.\n5.  Therefore, the torsion subgroup of $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group, $\\{0\\}$.\n6.  The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For any torsion group, including the trivial group, this rank is 0.\n7.  To make this more concrete, I will write a Python script that not only states this reasoning but also explicitly calculates the Betti numbers (the ranks of the free cohomology groups) for $Gr(3, 5)$ using Schubert calculus combinatorics. This demonstrates the structure of the cohomology ring.\n8.  Finally, the script will print the final answer based on this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_cohomology_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral\n    cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
