    "To solve the equation `IV / XXX - XXXI`, I will first convert each Roman numeral into its modern number equivalent.\n\n1.  **IV**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (I=1) comes before a larger value (V=5), we subtract the smaller from the larger. So, IV = 5 - 1 = 4.\n2.  **XXX**: This is X (10) repeated three times. So, XXX = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n3.  **XXXI**: This is XXX (30) followed by I (1). So, XXXI = 30 + 1 = 31.\n\nNow, I will substitute these modern numbers back into the equation:\n4 / 30 - 31\n\nFollowing the order of operations (division before subtraction):\n1.  4 / 30 ≈ 0.1333...\n2.  0.1333... - 31 = -30.8666...\n\nThe following Python code will perform these conversions and calculations to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check for subtractive notation (e.g., IV, IX)\n        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i+1]]:\n            result += roman_map[s[i+1]] - roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 2\n        else:\n            result += roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n\n# Roman numerals from the equation\nroman1 = 'IV'\nroman2 = 'XXX'\nroman3 = 'XXXI'\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers\nnum1 = roman_to_int(roman1)\nnum2 = roman_to_int(roman2)\nnum3 = roman_to_int(roman3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nsolution = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers and the result\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {solution}\")\n\n# Also print the final answer in the requested format\n# print(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n<<<-30.86666666666667>>>"
