    "Here is my step-by-step derivation of the phonetic transcription, presented as a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the English source phrase \"shock absorber\".\n2.  Break it down into its constituent parts: \"shock\" and \"absorber\".\n3.  Apply the phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish to each part to determine how it would be adapted. This includes consonant substitutions (like 'sh' to 'ch'), vowel mapping, and characteristic features like the lateralization of the final /r/ to /l/.\n4.  Combine the adapted parts, considering how they would link together in natural speech.\n5.  Present the final International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this step-by-step process.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_to_puerto_rican_spanish():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step phonetic transcription of the English\n    phrase \"shock absorber\" into Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    english_phrase = \"shock absorber\"\n    \n    print(f\"Deriving the phonetic transcription for the English phrase: '{english_phrase}'\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the first word, \"shock\"\n    print(\"--- Part 1: Processing 'shock' ---\")\n    print(\"1. The English 'sh' sound /ʃ/ does not exist in most Spanish dialects.\")\n    print(\"   It is typically adapted to the 'ch' sound, which is /tʃ/ in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\")\n    print(\"   sh -> ch -> [tʃ]\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The English vowel in 'shock', /ɑ/ (like in 'cot'), is mapped to the closest Spanish vowel, which is /o/.\")\n    print(\"   o -> o -> [o]\")\n    print(\"\\n3. The final 'ck' sound /k/ exists in Spanish and is retained.\")\n    print(\"   ck -> k -> [k]\")\n    print(\"\\nResulting adaptation for 'shock': [tʃok]\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the second word, \"absorber\"\n    print(\"--- Part 2: Processing 'absorber' ---\")\n    print(\"1. The English consonant cluster /bs/ is uncommon in Spanish and is often simplified to /s/.\")\n    print(\"   (e.g., the Latin 'substantia' became 'sustancia' in Spanish).\")\n    print(\"   abs -> as -> [as]\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The English syllable '-sorb-' /sɔɹb/ is adapted as follows:\")\n    print(\"   - The vowel-r combination /ɔɹ/ becomes /oɾ/.\")\n    print(\"   - The intervocalic /b/ sound is softened to a fricative, written as [β].\")\n    print(\"   sorb -> sorb -> [soɾβ]\")\n    print(\"\\n3. A defining characteristic of Puerto Rican Spanish is the lateralization of a word-final /r/ to an /l/ sound.\")\n    print(\"   Therefore, the English ending '-er' /ɚ/ becomes /el/.\")\n    print(\"   er -> el -> [el]\")\n    print(\"\\n4.
