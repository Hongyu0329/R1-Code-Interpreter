    print("1. The English 'sh' sound /ʃ/ does not exist in most Spanish dialects.")
    print("   It is typically adapted to the 'ch' sound, which is /tʃ/ in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).")
    print("   sh -> ch -> [tʃ]")
    print("\n2. The English vowel in 'shock', /ɑ/ (like in 'cot'), is mapped to the closest Spanish vowel, which is /o/.")
    print("   o -> o -> [o]")
    print("\n3. The final 'ck' sound /k/ exists in Spanish and is retained.")
    print("   ck -> k -> [k]")

    print("   (e.g., the Latin 'substantia' became 'sustancia' in Spanish).")
    print("   abs -> as -> [as]")
    print("\n2. The English syllable '-sorb-' /sɔɹb/ is adapted as follows:")
    print("   - The vowel-r combination /ɔɹ/ becomes /oɾ/.")
    print("   - The intervocalic /b/ sound is softened to a fricative, written as [β].")
    print("   sorb -> sorb -> [soɾβ]")
    print("\n3. A defining characteristic of Puerto Rican Spanish is the lateralization of a word-final /r/ to an /l/ sound.")
    print("   Therefore, the English ending '-er' /ɚ/ becomes /el/.")
    print("   er -> el -> [el]")
    print("\n4. The stress from the English word (ab-SOR-ber) is maintained on the same syllable.")

    print("When the two adapted words, [tʃok] and [a.soɾ.ˈβel], are spoken together, they link up.")
    print("The final consonant [k] of 'choc' joins with the initial vowel [a] of 'asorbel' to form a new syllable [ka].")
