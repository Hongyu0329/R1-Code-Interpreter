    "Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles for a 100BB deep, rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game, the opening range from the button is extremely wide due to the positional advantage and the absence of rake.\n\nHere is my thinking process to determine the worst suited jack to open:\n1.  **Identify the Position:** The button is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range.\n2.  **Consider the Game Conditions:** A \"rake-free\" environment further incentivizes opening a wider range of hands, as the pot is not reduced by the house. This means even marginal hands become slightly more profitable.\n3.  **List Suited Jack Combinations:** We need to evaluate all suited hands containing a Jack, from strongest to weakest based on their kicker: JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges:** Standard GTO charts show that strong and medium-strength suited Jacks (like JTs through J7s) are always profitable opens from the button. The question comes down to the weakest ones: J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n5.  **Determine the Bottom of the Range:** In a typical GTO range for these conditions, even the weakest suited Jacks are included. The hand with the lowest kicker, J2s, has the worst playability in terms of making straights compared to J3s or J4s. However, its flush potential combined with the massive positional advantage makes it a profitable, albeit marginal, open-raise. It represents the \"worst\" or lowest expected value (EV) suited Jack that is still considered a standard part of the opening range.\n\nThe following Python code will print the abbreviated hand name for you.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the worst suited jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on GTO principles.\n\n    The \"worst\" hand is defined as the one with the lowest expected value (EV)\n    that is still considered a profitable open-raise. In this scenario, the\n    opening range is very wide.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The suited jacks are ranked by their kicker: JTs, J9s, ..., J2s.\n    # The hand with the lowest kicker that is still part of a standard\n    # GTO opening range from the button is J2s.\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n    print(f\"The worst suited Jack to open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
