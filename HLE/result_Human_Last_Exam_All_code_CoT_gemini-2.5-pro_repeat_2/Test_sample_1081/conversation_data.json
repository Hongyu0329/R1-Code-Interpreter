    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of the group**: A reductive group is determined by its root system and the action of the Galois group Gal($\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q$) on the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field is split.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for the number of tori**: For a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, a known result from the theory of algebraic groups states that the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the square of the prime-to-$p$ part of the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points, $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_{p'}^2$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n3.  **Determine the order of the group**: For a split group of Lie type, the order of the group of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is given by a general formula. For a group of type $E_8$, the order is:\n    $|G(E_8, q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$\n    The exponents $d_i$ in the terms $(q^{d_i}-1)$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. These degrees are $2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30$. The term $q^{120}$ corresponds to the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final number**: The prime-to-$p$ part of $|G(E_8, q)|$, denoted $|G(E_8, q)|_{p'}$, is obtained by removing the factor of $q^{120}$ (since $q$ is a power of $p$). So,\n    $|G(E_8, q)|_{p'} = (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$.\n    The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the square of this value.\n\nThe following Python code will generate and display the final formula for the number of tori, clearly indicating the degrees of the fundamental invariants involved.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the formula for the number of\n    F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for the Weyl group of type E_8.\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # We construct the formula for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori.\n    # The formula is the square of the product of (q^{d_i} - 1) for each degree d_i.\n\n    # Let's build the product term string\n    product_terms = []\n    for d in degrees:\n        product_terms.append(f\"(q^{d} - 1)\")\n\n    product_string = \" * \".join(product_terms)\n\n    # The final equation for the number of tori, let's call it N\n    final_equation = f\"N = ({product_string})^2\"\n\n    print(\"The exact number (N) of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8 over F_q is given by the equation:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers appearing in the exponents of the equation are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group W(E_8):\")\n    # Now, print each number as requested\n    for d in degrees:\n        print(d)\n\nsolve_tori_number()\n```\n<<<((q^2 - 1) * (q^8 - 1) * (q^12 - 1) * (q^14 - 1) * (q^18 - 1) * (q^20 - 1) * (q^24 - 1) * (q^30 - 1))^2>>>"
