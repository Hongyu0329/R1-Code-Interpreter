    "Here is a step-by-step explanation of why critical-level views violate the Non-Elitism condition.\n\n**1. Understanding Critical-Level Views**\n\nIn population ethics, a critical-level view states that adding a new person to the world is a positive contribution if and only if that person's welfare level is above a certain positive value called the \"critical level\" (let's call it `c`, where `c > 0`).\n\n*   If a new person has a welfare level `w > c`, adding them is good.\n*   If a new person has a welfare level `w < c`, adding them is bad (even if `w` is positive).\n*   If a new person has a welfare level `w = c`, adding them is neutral.\n\n**2. Understanding the Non-Elitism Condition**\n\nThe Non-Elitism condition is designed to prevent any quality of life from being \"lexically superior\" to another. It formally states:\n\nFor any two welfare levels `u` and `v` where `u > v > 0`, there exists some number of people `N` such that a population of `N` individuals all at welfare level `v` is better than a population of one individual at welfare level `u`.\n\nEssentially, this means that quantity can always, eventually, make up for quality. No matter how good level `u` is, a sufficient number of lives at the slightly lower level `v` will eventually be considered better.\n\n**3. Demonstrating the Violation**\n\nWe can show how a critical-level view violates the Non-Elitism condition with a simple example.\n\n1.  Let's assume a critical-level view where the critical level `c = 10`.\n2.  Now, let's choose two welfare levels as required by the Non-Elitism condition. Let `u = 20` and `v = 5`. Note that `u > v > 0` (20 > 5 > 0).\n3.  According to the critical-level view, the value of adding one person at level `u=20` is `u - c = 20 - 10 = 10`. This is a positive value, so this is a good state of affairs.\n4.  According to the same view, the value of adding one person at level `v=5` is `v - c = 5 - 10 = -5`. This is a negative value.\n5.  Non-Elitism requires that there is some number `N` of people at level `v=5` that would be better than the one person at `u=20`. However, according to our critical-level view, adding *any* number of people at level 5 just makes the total value worse. The total value for `N` people at level 5 would be `N * (5 - 10) = -5N`.\n6.  Since the value of the single person at `u=20` is `+10`, and the value of `N` people at `v=5` is `-5N` (always negative for any N > 0), it is impossible for the population of `N` people at level 5 to ever be better.\n\nThus, the critical-level view violates the Non-Elitism condition because the existence of the critical level creates a class of positive lives (those between 0 and `c`) that are always considered bad additions, meaning no quantity of them can ever outweigh a good addition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
