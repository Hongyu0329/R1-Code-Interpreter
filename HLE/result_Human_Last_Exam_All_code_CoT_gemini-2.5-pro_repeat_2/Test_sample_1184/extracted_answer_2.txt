[1] Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 Subunit (AID-BID Binding)

The following residues in the beta-1 subunit's Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain are critical for high-affinity binding to the alpha-1 subunit:

  - Residue: Y194
    Forms part of the hydrophobic binding groove for the AID helix.

  - Residue: I214
    Contributes to the hydrophobic floor of the binding pocket.

  - Residue: M216
    A key hydrophobic contact point for the AID helix.

  - Residue: W239
    A critical, highly conserved residue that forms extensive hydrophobic
    interactions with the AID.

  - Residue: K243
    Forms a crucial salt bridge with a conserved Glutamate (E) residue on the
    alpha-1 AID.

  - Residue: V262
    Contributes to the hydrophobic surface of the binding groove.

  - Residue: V301
    Part of the hydrophobic pocket that stabilizes the AID helix.

  - Residue: I303
    Another key hydrophobic contact point within the binding groove.


[2] Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of alpha-1 Subunit

Gating modulation is controlled by larger, more flexible regions rather than single residues. The key regions are:

  - Region: N-Terminus (Residues 1-47)
    This variable region is a primary determinant of gating modulation. Its
    presence significantly influences the kinetics and voltage-dependence of both
    activation and inactivation. Deletion of this region alters channel
    function dramatically.

  - Region: SH3-GK Linker (Approx. Residues 108-175)
    This flexible linker connects the SH3 and GK domains. Its length and amino
    acid composition are known to fine-tune the speed of voltage-dependent
    inactivation of the channel.
