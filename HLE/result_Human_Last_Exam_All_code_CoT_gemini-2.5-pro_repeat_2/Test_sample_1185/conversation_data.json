    "This is a problem from algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the moduli space of stable curves. The different \"types\" of stable reduction correspond to the different combinatorial structures of singular stable curves of a given genus. A stable curve of genus `g=2` is a connected curve with only nodal singularities, whose automorphism group is finite.\n\nIts structure can be described by a \"dual graph\" `Γ`, where:\n*   Vertices `v_i` correspond to the irreducible components `C_i` of the curve. Each vertex is weighted by the geometric genus `g_i` of its component.\n*   Edges correspond to nodes where two components intersect.\n*   Self-loops correspond to nodes on a single component.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the curve is given by the formula: `g = Σ g_i + h¹(Γ)`, where `h¹(Γ)` is the first Betti number of the graph (the number of independent cycles). For genus 2, we need `Σ g_i + h¹(Γ) = 2`.\n\nThe stability condition for `g=2` is equivalent to requiring that for every component `C_i` that is a rational curve (`g_i = 0`), the number of nodes on it must be at least 3. In the dual graph, this means for any vertex `v_i` with weight `g_i=0`, its degree must be at least 3 (where a self-loop contributes 2 to the degree).\n\nThe following Python code systematically enumerates all possible graph structures that satisfy these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_stable_reduction_types_genus_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2\n    by systematically analyzing the possible structures of their dual graphs.\n    \"\"\"\n    stable_types = []\n\n    # A stable curve of genus 2 must satisfy:\n    # 1.
