    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question, followed by the code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first identify the specific 1905 paper by Albert Einstein that deals with Brownian motion. The paper's title is \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"\n2.  I will then research the citations and intellectual foundations of this paper. The work is heavily based on the principles of statistical mechanics.\n3.  The primary figure whose work on statistical mechanics and gas theory influenced Einstein was Ludwig Boltzmann. His ideas were famously compiled and published in his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"\n4.  I will write a Python script that prints this information to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the scientist whose lectures\n    were a foundational source for Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    lecture_work = \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"\n    paper_year = 1905\n    paper_topic = \"Brownian motion\"\n\n    print(f\"In his {paper_year} paper on {paper_topic}, Albert Einstein's work was fundamentally based on the principles developed by {scientist}.\")\n    print(f\"While not a direct citation in the modern sense, the paper relies heavily on the ideas from {scientist}'s influential work, famously presented in his '{lecture_work}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nfind_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
