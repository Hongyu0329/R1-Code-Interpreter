    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric-key cryptography.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary quantum algorithm that threatens symmetric-key ciphers is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain Grover's Algorithm's Impact:** Unlike Shor's algorithm, which completely breaks common asymmetric cryptography (like RSA and ECC), Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Brute-forcing a symmetric key is an unstructured search problem.\n3.  **Quantify the Impact:** A classical computer needs, on average, `2^(n-1)` attempts to brute-force a key of `n` bits. Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately `sqrt(2^n)` or `2^(n/2)` operations. This effectively halves the security strength of the key in bits.\n4.  **Determine the Target Security Level:** The generally accepted minimum security level for classical computers is 128 bits. This means an attacker would need to perform on the order of `2^128` operations, which is considered infeasible. To maintain this level of security against a quantum computer, the post-quantum security strength must also be at least 128 bits.\n5.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** We need to find a key length, let's call it `k`, such that when its strength is halved by a quantum computer, it is still at least 128 bits.\n    *   Equation: `k / 2 >= 128`\n    *   Solving for `k`: `k >= 256`\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to provide a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length to resist quantum attacks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target security level we want to maintain, even against a quantum computer.\n    # 128-bit security is the current industry standard for classical resistance.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the target classical security level.\")\n    print(f\"Target security level = {target_security_level} bits\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Understand the quantum threat.\")\n    print(\"Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for brute-force attacks.\")\n    print(\"This means it effectively halves the bit strength of a symmetric key (k).\")\n    print(\"The post-quantum security strength is k / 2.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Set up the equation to find the required key length (k).\")\n    print(\"We need the post-quantum security strength to be equal to our target security level.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: k / 2 = {target_security_level}\\n\")\n\n    # To find the required key length 'k', we solve the equation.\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * 2\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Solve for k.\")\n    print(f\"k = {target_security_level} * 2\")\n    print(f\"k = {required_key_length}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"To achieve a {target_security_level}-bit security level against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least {required_key_length} bits long.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
