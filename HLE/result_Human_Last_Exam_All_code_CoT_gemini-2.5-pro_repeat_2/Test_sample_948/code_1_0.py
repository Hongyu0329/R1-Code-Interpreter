# This script identifies the properties of a 1D Fermi-Hubbard system
# with on-site two-body losses in the long-time limit.

# Based on the analysis, the system approaches a metastable state with
# specific characteristics. The script will print the numbers corresponding
# to these correct properties.

# The correct properties are:
# 1: Zero tunneling (interpreted as zero net particle current in a stationary state).
# 3: Zero losses (the final state has no double occupancies).
# 4: Spin entanglement (the ground state of the effective Hamiltonian is entangled).
# 5: Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations (this is the favored magnetic
#    ordering in the repulsive Hubbard model's ground state).
