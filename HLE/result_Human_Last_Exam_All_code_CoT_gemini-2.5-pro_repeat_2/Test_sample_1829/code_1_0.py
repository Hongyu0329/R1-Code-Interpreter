    print("The condition 'yesterday was after tomorrow' is a logical impossibility. An 'if-then' statement with a false premise is always logically TRUE.")
    print("Therefore, S1 is always a TRUE statement.")

    print("The second part, 'He is 18 and I am 19,' means Fred is older than his friend.")
    print("This contradicts the first part, 'My best friend is older than me.' A statement that contradicts itself is always FALSE.")
    print("Therefore, S5 is always a FALSE statement.")

    print("\nStep 2: Apply the condition that 'Only one statement is true'.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Since S1 is always TRUE and S5 is always FALSE, S1 must be the single true statement.")

    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The truth of statement S1 does not depend on the word 'Wednesday'. It's a vacuously true statement.")
    print("In logic puzzles, such arbitrary details are intentional clues. Fred uses this logically true statement to truthfully convey a piece of information.")
