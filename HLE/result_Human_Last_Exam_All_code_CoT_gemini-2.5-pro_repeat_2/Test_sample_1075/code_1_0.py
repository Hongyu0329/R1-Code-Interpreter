    Analysis of the situation between Lewis and Marcel:
    1.  The contract is for the sale of a good (a painting), so the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) applies.
    2.  Lewis expressly told Marcel the specific purpose of the painting (a large centrepiece) and relied on Marcel's skill. The painting delivered was not fit for this purpose. This is a breach of the implied condition of 'fitness for purpose' under the SGA.
    3.  The painting also did not match the specific description agreed upon ('Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay'). This is a breach of the implied condition of 'correspondence with description'.
    4.  A breach of a condition allows the buyer to repudiate the contract and demand a full refund.
    5.  Therefore, a lawyer would advise Lewis that his understanding is correct and he is entitled to the return of his money.
