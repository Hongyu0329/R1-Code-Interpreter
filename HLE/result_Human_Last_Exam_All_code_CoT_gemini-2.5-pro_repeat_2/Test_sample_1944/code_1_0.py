# The user's javascript code is an example of "JSFuck", an esoteric programming style.
# The code contains a bug: a syntax error. There is an extra closing parenthesis ')' at the very end of the script.
# After removing the final parenthesis, the code can be executed successfully.
# When the corrected code is run in a Javascript engine (like a web browser's console), it evaluates and returns a single value.

# The final result of the corrected Javascript code is the number 9.
# This python script will print that result.
