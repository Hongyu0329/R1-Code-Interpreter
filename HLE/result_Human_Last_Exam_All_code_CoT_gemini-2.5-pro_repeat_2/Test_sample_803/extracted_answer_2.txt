The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the generalized dihedral groups, formed by the semidirect product $Q \rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$ and the action of the generator of $C_2$ on $Q$ is inversion ($g \mapsto g^{-1}$ for all $g \in Q$).
