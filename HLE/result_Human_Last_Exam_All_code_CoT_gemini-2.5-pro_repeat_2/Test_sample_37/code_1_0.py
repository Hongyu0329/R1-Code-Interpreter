    # Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem Components
    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the definitions")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print(" - Hypercomputer (H): A theoretical machine more powerful than a Turing machine, capable of infinite computations.")
    print(" - Set S: The set of real numbers that are computable by a standard Turing machine.")
    print(" - Number Ω: Defined by the self-referential statement: 'Ω cannot be computed by this hypercomputer (H)'.")
    print(" - The Task: The hypercomputer H must determine if Ω is a member of the set S.")
    print(" - The Outcome: The hypercomputer halts without giving an answer.")

    # Step 2: Analyzing the Self-Referential Paradox of Ω
    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the logical paradox")
    print("-------------------------------------")
    print("We examine the definition of Ω by considering two cases:")
    print("\n  Case 1: Assume the hypercomputer H *can* compute Ω.")
    print("  - If H computes Ω, it has successfully performed the computation.")
    print("  - However, the very definition of Ω is that it *cannot* be computed by H.")
    print("  - This creates a direct contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false.")
    
    print("\n  Case 2: Conclude the hypercomputer H *cannot* compute Ω.")
    print("  - This statement is consistent with the definition of Ω.")
    print("  - Therefore, the statement 'H cannot compute Ω' must be true.")

    # Step 3: Determining the Nature of Ω and its relation to Set S
    print("\nStep 3: Determining if Ω is in the set S")
    print("-----------------------------------------")
    print("  1. From our analysis, we have logically concluded that Ω is not computable by the hypercomputer H.")
    print("  2. The set S contains only numbers that are computable by a standard Turing machine.")
    print("  3. A hypercomputer is, by definition, more powerful than a standard Turing machine. Any number a Turing machine can compute, a hypercomputer can also compute.")
    print("  4. It follows that if the hypercomputer H cannot compute Ω, then a less powerful standard Turing machine also cannot compute Ω.")
    print("  5. Therefore, Ω is not a member of the set S (Ω ∉ S).")

    # Step 4: Explaining the Hypercomputer's Failure
    print("\nStep 4: Explaining why the hypercomputer cannot solve the problem")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Even though we, as external observers, can deduce that Ω ∉ S, the hypercomputer itself cannot.")
    print("This is a classic example of a limitation described by Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.")
    print(" - For the hypercomputer H to prove 'Ω ∉ S', it would first have to prove the statement about its own limitation: 'I, hypercomputer H, cannot compute Ω'.")
    print(" - A powerful, consistent formal system (like our hypercomputer) cannot prove all true statements about itself, especially statements concerning its own limitations or completeness.")
    print(" - The hypercomputer is trapped in a self-referential loop. It cannot formally prove its own inability to compute Ω, so it cannot take the next logical step to conclude that Ω is not in S. This forces it to halt without a definitive answer.")

    # Step 5: Evaluating the Answer Choices
    print("\nStep 5: Evaluating the final options")
    print("------------------------------------")
    print(" A. Ω is a non-computable number outside the recursively enumerable set S due to its self-referential nature, and the hypercomputer cannot resolve this paradox. --> This aligns perfectly with our step-by-step analysis.")
    print(" B. Ω is a computable number... --> False. This leads to a contradiction.")
    print(" C. The set S is not well-defined... --> False. The set of Turing-computable numbers is well-defined.")
    print(" D. ...indicates the existence of a new hierarchy of computation. --> While this is a consequence, it is not the direct explanation for this specific machine's failure. The paradox itself is the cause.")
    print(" E. ...Ω is both inside and outside the set S... --> False. This describes a logical impossibility. The issue is undecidability for the machine, not a state of being two contradictory things at once.")

    print("\nFinal Conclusion: The most accurate explanation is A.")
