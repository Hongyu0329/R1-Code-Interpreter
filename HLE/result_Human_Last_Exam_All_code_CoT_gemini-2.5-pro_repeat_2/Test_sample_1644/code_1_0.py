    Solves the ZF set theory problem about the Axiom of Choice for finite sets.

    The problem is to find the largest positive integer n such that AC(2) implies AC(n),
    where AC(k) is the statement "every family of k-element sets has a choice function".
    We work in ZF set theory without the Axiom of Choice.

    # Step 1: Analyze the possible values of n.
    # It is a known result that if n has an odd prime factor p, AC(2) does not imply AC(p).
