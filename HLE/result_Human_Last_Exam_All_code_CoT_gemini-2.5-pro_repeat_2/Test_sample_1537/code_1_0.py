    This function solves the mathematical problem.
    Based on the provided topological properties of the group G, we can deduce that G must be locally connected.
    A key theorem in topology states that in a locally connected space, the connected components of any open subset are themselves open.
    Therefore, for any open subset of G, all of its components are open.
    This means the number of non-open components is always 0.
    The largest possible number of non-open components is therefore 0.
