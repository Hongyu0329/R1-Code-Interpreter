    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we must confirm the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are divisors of 14 ($\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$). None of these are roots of the polynomial. We also can show that it doesn't factor into two quadratic polynomials. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible. The Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant**: The Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. We will calculate this value and check if it's a perfect square.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: To distinguish between the possible Galois groups ($S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$, $V_4$, $\\mathbb{Z}_4$), we analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial. For $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. The Galois group is $S_4$ if the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it's reducible (i.e., has a rational root), the group is smaller ($D_4$, $V_4$, or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$).\n\n4.  **Determine the Group and its Order**:\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square and $R(y)$ is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square and $R(y)$ is irreducible, the group is $A_4$ (order 12).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square and $R(y)$ is reducible, the group is $D_4$ (order 8).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square and $R(y)$ is reducible, the group is $V_4$ (order 4).\n\nThe following Python script will perform the calculations for steps 2 and 3 to identify the correct group and its order.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_integer_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = {1, n}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    \n    # Add negative divisors\n    positive_divs = list(divs)\n    all_divs = positive_divs + [-d for d in positive_divs]\n    return all_divs\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial x^4 + {p}x + {q}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the discriminant\n    # Formula for x^4 + px + q is Delta = 256*q^3 - 27*p^4\n    discriminant = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the discriminant.\")\n    print(f\"The discriminant Delta = 256 * ({q})^3 - 27 * ({p})^4\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * {q**3} - 27 * {p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * (q**3)} - {27 * (p**4)}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {discriminant}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Check if the discriminant is a perfect square\n    sqrt_discriminant = int(math.sqrt(discriminant))\n    is_square = (sqrt_discriminant * sqrt_discriminant == discriminant)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Check if the discriminant is a perfect square.\")\n    if is_square:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is a perfect square ({sqrt_discriminant}^2).\")\n        print(\"The Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is not a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.
