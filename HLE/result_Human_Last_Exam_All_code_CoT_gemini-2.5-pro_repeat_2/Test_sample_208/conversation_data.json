    "This problem is a classic mathematical puzzle known as \"circle packing in a circle\". We are asked to find the radius of a larger circle that can perfectly contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of one.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the problem**: The task is to find the radius for the circle packing problem with n=14 and r=1.\n2.  **Find the formula**: For 14 circles, the optimal packing arrangement has been mathematically determined. The radius `R` of the large circle is given by the formula `R = r * (3 + sec(pi/9))`, where `r` is the radius of the small circles.\n3.  **Set up the calculation**: Since the radius `r` of the small circles is given as 1, the formula simplifies to `R = 3 + sec(pi/9)`. The term `sec(pi/9)` is the same as `1 / cos(pi/9)`.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will:\n    a. Use the `math` library to get the value of pi and the cosine function.\n    b. Calculate the value of `R` using the formula.\n    c. As requested, print each number used in the final equation.\n    d. Format the final result to 4 significant digits and print it to the console.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.\n# The formula for this specific packing problem (n=14) is R = 3 + sec(pi/9).\n\nprint(\"To find the radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one, we use a known mathematical formula.\")\nprint(\"For 14 circles, the radius 'R' of the enclosing circle is given by R = 3 + sec(pi/9).\")\nprint(\"This is equivalent to R = 3 + (1 / cos(pi/9)).\")\n\n# Define the numbers in the final equation\nval_3 = 3\nval_1 = 1\nangle_rad = math.pi / 9\ncos_val = math.cos(angle_rad)\n\n# The final radius R\nR = val_3 + (val_1 / cos_val)\n\nprint(\"\\nHere are the individual numbers in the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"The number three: {val_3}\")\nprint(f\"The number one: {val_1}\")\n# We use the calculated value for cos(pi/9) as a number in the equation.\nprint(f\"The value of cos(pi/9): {cos_val:.8f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nPerforming the calculation step-by-step:\")\nprint(f\"R = {val_3} + (1 / {cos_val:.8f})\")\nprint(f\"R = {val_3} + {1/cos_val:.8f}\")\nprint(f\"R = {R:.8f}\")\n\n# The '.4g' format specifier rounds the number to 4 significant digits.\nprint(f\"\\nThe radius of this circle up to 4 significant digits is {R:.4g}\")\n```\n<<<4.064>>>"
