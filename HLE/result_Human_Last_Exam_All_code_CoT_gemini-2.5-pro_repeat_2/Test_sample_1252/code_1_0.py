    # Part (a): Minimum number of vertices for non-empty M_trop(g,A).
    # For M_trop(g,A) to be non-empty, there must exist a stable graph,
    # which requires 2g - 2 + |A| > 0. When this condition holds, a graph
    # with a single vertex, g loops, and |A| legs can be constructed.
    # The valence of this vertex is 2g + |A|, which is >= 3 under the stability condition.
    # Since a graph must have at least one vertex to satisfy the valence requirement, the minimum is 1.
    answer_a = "1"

    # Part (b): Is M_trop(0,A) always a simplicial fan?
    # Yes. For g=0, M_trop(0,A) is the space of phylogenetic trees, which is a fan.
    # It is simplicial because every cone, corresponding to a tree, is generated by
    # linearly independent vectors representing the tree's edges (or splits).
    answer_b = "yes"

    # Part (c): For g>0, is M_trop(g,A) a tropical variety? If not, is it a polyhedral complex?
    # For g>=2, M_trop(g,A) is known not to be a tropical variety because it fails to satisfy
    # necessary structural conditions (e.g., its links are not necessarily spherical).
    # However, by its construction as a colimit of cones (polyhedra) glued along faces,
    # it is a polyhedral complex.
    answer_c = "no, yes"

    # Combine the answers into the final requested format.
