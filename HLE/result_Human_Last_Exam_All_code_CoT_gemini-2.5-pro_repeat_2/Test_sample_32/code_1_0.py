# The task is to compute the integral of the product of lambda classes
# lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1 on the moduli space of stable curves
# of genus 3, M_3_bar.
# The dimension of this space is 3*g-3 = 3*3-3 = 6.
# The degrees of the lambda classes are deg(lambda_i) = i.
# The degree of the product lambda_3*lambda_2*lambda_1 is 3+2+1=6.
# Since the degree of the class matches the dimension of the space,
# the integral is a rational number.

# A known relation in the tautological ring of M_3_bar implies that this
# integral is equal to another Hodge integral whose value is tabulated in
# the literature (e.g., by Faber and Pandharipande).
# The identity is:
# integral(lambda_1 * lambda_2 * lambda_3) = integral(kappa_4 * lambda_1^2)

# The value of the integral on the right hand side is known to be 1/2880.
# Faber, C., Pandharipande, R. "Hodge integrals and Gromov-Witten theory." (2000).
# Table 1 gives <kappa_4 lambda_1^2> = 1/2880.

numerator = 1
denominator = 2880

# We need to provide the result in the form "a/b"
# and output the numbers in the final equation.
