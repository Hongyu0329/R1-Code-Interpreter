    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult the known classification of such groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the problem:** The task is to determine the maximum possible size for a torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ of an elliptic curve $E$ over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, given that the group is non-cyclic.\n2.  **Use established theorems:** The classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in number theory, established by mathematicians like Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. A non-cyclic torsion subgroup must be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m > 1$.\n3.  **List the possibilities for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** According to the classification, the possible non-cyclic torsion structures for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n4.  **Calculate and compare orders:** I will write a Python script to generate these group structures, calculate their orders (which is the product of the component orders), and find the maximum among them.\n5.  **Output the result:** The script will print the list of possible non-cyclic groups, their corresponding orders, and finally the calculation for the largest order.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)) based on known classification theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over\n    # quadratic fields, the possible non-cyclic structures over Q(sqrt(-3)) are:\n    # 1.
