    "My plan to solve this chess puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Chess Position**: I will examine the provided FEN string `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1` to understand the strategic situation for both White and Black. White's primary advantage is the powerful passed pawn on d6, while Black's active queen on c5 is the main defensive piece.\n2.  **Determine the Optimal Move**: The most decisive move is `Qxc5+`. This move forces a trade of queens. The resulting king and pawn endgame is winning for White because the White king can activate and support the d6 pawn, creating unstoppable threats.\n3.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script to present this solution.\n    *   The script will first state the position and the reasoning behind the best move.\n    *   It will then print the best move, `Qxc5+`, as the final answer.\n    *   The prompt includes a specific instruction: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". I will interpret the \"final equation\" as the move notation itself. My code will parse the move string (`Qxc5+`) and print any digits it contains to fulfill this requirement.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess position and provides the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    # FEN string for the position.\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    \n    # The best move for White, determined by strategic analysis.\n    best_move = \"Qxc5+\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"The optimal move for White is Qxc5+. This forces a queen trade, \"\n        \"transitioning the game into a pawn endgame. In this endgame, White's \"\n        \"passed pawn on d6, combined with the ability for the White king to activate, \"\n        \"creates a decisive and winning advantage for White.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Position FEN: {fen}\")\n    print(f\"White to move.
