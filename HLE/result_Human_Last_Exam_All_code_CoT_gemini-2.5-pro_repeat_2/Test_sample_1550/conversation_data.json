    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two polynomial equations with two variables, x and y.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Eliminate a Variable**: I will first form a linear combination of the two equations to eliminate one of the quadratic terms, specifically the `y^2` term. This will result in a new equation that is only linear in `y`.\n2.  **Express y in terms of x**: From the new equation, I will solve for `y` to get an expression for `y` as a function of `x`.\n3.  **Substitution**: I will substitute this expression for `y` back into one of the original quadric equations. This will yield a single equation containing only the variable `x`.\n4.  **Solve for x**: The resulting equation will be a rational function of `x`. The solutions for `x` are the roots of the numerator of this function, which turns out to be a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. I will explicitly show this final polynomial.\n5.  **Count Real Roots**: I will then find all the roots of this quartic polynomial. The number of real roots for `x` will correspond to the number of real intersection points, as each real `x` will give a corresponding real `y`. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library for accurate symbolic manipulation and `numpy` for reliable numerical root finding.\n\nHere is the Python script that implements this plan and finds the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quadric_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of real intersection points between two quadrics\n    by eliminating one variable to obtain a single-variable polynomial and then\n    finding the number of real roots of that polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables\n    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations from the problem statement\n    eq1 = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    eq2 = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    print(\"The two quadric equations are:\")\n    print(\"Eq1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\")\n    print(\"Eq2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\\n\")\n\n    # Plan Step 1 & 2: Eliminate y^2 to get an equation linear in y.\n    # The coefficients for y^2 are 72 and 324.
