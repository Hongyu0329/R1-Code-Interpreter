    # A point is "special" if the direction spaces of all planes passing through it
    # collectively span the entire space R^10.
    # To span a d-dimensional space with k-dimensional subspaces, we need
    # at least m = ceil(d/k) subspaces, assuming they are in general position.

    # --- Step 2: Bounding the number of special points ---
    # A special point must lie at the intersection of at least `min_planes` planes.
    # The problem implies that the number of special points is finite, which means
    # the intersection of any group of `min_planes` (or more) planes is at most a single point.
    #
    # The total number of special points is therefore bounded by the total number of
    # possible intersection points of `min_planes` planes.
    
    # The number of ways to choose `min_planes` out of N is given by the binomial
    # coefficient C(N, min_planes), which for large N is O(N^min_planes).
    
    # --- Step 3: Conclusion ---
    # The number of special points is O(N^min_planes).
    # The problem states this is O(N^c).
    # Therefore, c <= min_planes.
    # Constructions in combinatorial geometry show that this bound is tight, meaning
    # configurations exist with Omega(N^min_planes) special points.
    # Thus, the largest possible value for c is min_planes.
