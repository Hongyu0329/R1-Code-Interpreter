    # The number to be represented is N = 10^100.
    # Python's int type can handle arbitrarily large integers.
    N = 10**100

    # The representation is N = Σ [tet(2, ai) * pow(2, bi)], which simplifies to
    # N = Σ 2^(2^(ai-1) + bi). This is a sum of powers of two.
    # This means we are looking at the binary representation of N.
    # The number of terms in the sequence is the number of '1's in N's binary form.
    count_of_sequences = bin(N).count('1')

    # The largest term in the sequence corresponds to the largest exponent,
    # which is the position of the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of N.
    # This value, j_max, can be found using N.bit_length() - 1.
    j_max = N.bit_length() - 1

    # Now, we must find a1 and b1 such that:
    # j_max = 2^(a1-1) + b1
    # with the constraint that b1 < 2^(a1-1).
    # This is done by finding the MSB of j_max itself.
    # Let k be the position of the MSB of j_max. k = floor(log2(j_max)).
    k = j_max.bit_length() - 1

    # From the decomposition, a1-1 = k, so a1 = k + 1.
    a1 = k + 1

    # The remainder is b1.
    # (1 << k) is an efficient way to calculate 2**k.
    b1 = j_max - (1 << k)

    # The final output requires the count of sequences, a1, and b1, separated by spaces.
    # The instruction "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
    # is interpreted as printing the final computed values for the solution.
