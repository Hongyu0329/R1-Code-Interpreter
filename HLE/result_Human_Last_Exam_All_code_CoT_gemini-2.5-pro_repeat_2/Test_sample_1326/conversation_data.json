    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of a piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Break Down the Integral**: The function $p(x)$ is defined differently on the interval $[0, 3]$ and $[3, 5]$. Since our integration range is $[0, 4]$, we must split the integral at the point where the function's definition changes, which is at $x=3$. This gives us two separate integrals to solve:\n    $\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n2.  **Define the Integrals for Each Part**:\n    *   For the interval $[0, 3]$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$. So, the first integral is $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx$.\n    *   For the interval $[3, 4]$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$. So, the second integral is $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$.\n3.  **Solve the Integrals using Python**: We will write a Python script that uses the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for high-precision numerical integration. This is an effective method, especially for the more complex second part of the function.\n4.  **Sum the Results**: The final answer is the sum of the results from the two integrals. The script will compute these values and print the final equation showing how they are summed up.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef p1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Function definition for the interval 0 <= x <= 3.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef p2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Function definition for the interval 3 <= x <= 5.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Note: np.exp, np.sin, and np.cos are used for vectorized operations,\n  # which is good practice with numerical libraries.\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part (from 0 to 3)\n# The result from quad is a tuple (value, estimated_error)\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part (from 3 to 4)\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# Calculate the total integral by summing the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# --- Output ---\n\nprint(\"The integral from 0 to 4 is calculated by splitting it into two parts:\")\nprint(f\"1. The integral of (2*x^3)/8 from x=0 to x=3.\")\nprint(f\"2. The integral of (e^x * (1 + sin(x))) / (1 + cos(x)) from x=3 to x=4.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The value of the first integral is:\")\nprint(f\"Part 1 = {integral1:.4f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe value of the second integral is:\")\nprint(f\"Part 2 = {integral2:.4f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation combining these parts is:\")\n# We print each number that contributes to the final sum\nprint(f\"{integral1:.4f} + ({integral2:.4f}) = {total_integral:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4750>>>"
