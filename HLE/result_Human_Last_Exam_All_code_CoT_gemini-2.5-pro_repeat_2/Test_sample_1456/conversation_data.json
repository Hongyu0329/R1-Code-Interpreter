    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question from the field of point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. The solution does not involve a numerical computation but rather a logical deduction based on established theorems. I will provide a Python script that explains the steps and reasoning to arrive at the answer, satisfying the request to use code and present the final result as an \"equation.\"\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible number of composants for a product of two nondegenerate continua, `X x Y`.\n2.  **Recall Key Theorem:** I will use a fundamental theorem from continuum theory. The theorem states: If `Y` is a decomposable continuum, then the number of composants of the product space `X x Y` is equal to the number of composants of `X`.\n3.  **Strategy for Maximization:** To maximize the number of composants in the product `X x Y`, we should:\n    *   Choose `Y` to be a simple decomposable continuum (like the interval `[0, 1]`). A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n    *   Choose `X` to be a continuum with the largest possible number of composants.\n4.  **Find the Maximum for a Single Continuum:** The largest number of composants a single continuum can have is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (the \"size\" of the set of real numbers). Indecomposable continua like the pseudo-arc or the Knaster continuum have `c` composants.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By applying the theorem from step 2 to the continua chosen in step 3, the maximum number of composants in the product will be the maximum number of composants possible for `X`, which is `c`.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will print this logic step-by-step, defining variables to represent the quantities involved and printing a final \"equation\" that leads to the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the largest possible number\n    of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the relevant theorem from continuum theory.\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the key theorem.\")\n    print(\"Let X and Y be two continua.
