    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the independent continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters in these transformations.\n\nThis is a classical result from the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations. The maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of point symmetries is composed of several types of transformations. While the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional (due to the pressure term), the standard question refers to this finite-dimensional part.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the number of spatial dimensions, `n=3`.\n2.  List the fundamental symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n3.  For each type of symmetry, determine its dimension (i.e., the number of parameters it depends on).\n    *   Time translations: Shifting time by a constant.\n    *   Space translations: Shifting spatial coordinates by a constant vector.\n    *   Space rotations: Rotating the spatial coordinates and the velocity field.\n    *   Galilean boosts: Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Scaling transformations: Rescaling time, space, velocity, and pressure simultaneously.\n    *   Pressure shifts: Shifting the pressure by a constant value.\n4.  Sum these dimensions to get the total dimension of the symmetry group.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a given number of spatial dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is specified for 3 spatial dimensions.\n    n = 3\n\n    # 1.
