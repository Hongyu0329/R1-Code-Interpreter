    Determines which of the given sets are necessarily "closepact".

    The property "closepact in itself" for a subset of the real or complex
    numbers is equivalent to the mathematical property of being "compact".
    
    According to the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of the real or complex
    numbers is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.

    This script analyzes each choice based on the "closed and bounded" criteria.
