    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Equation**: We need to find the number of ordered tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\n2.  **Simplify the Search**: A brute-force search is computationally expensive. To make it feasible, we'll first find unique sets of five non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation. We can enforce an order, such as $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$, to find each unique set only once.\n3.  **Optimize the Search**: The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$. We can use this limit and other mathematical constraints to significantly reduce the search space in our loops.\n4.  **Count Permutations**: For each unique set of numbers found, some numbers might be repeated (e.g., $\\{a, a, b, c, d\\}$). The number of distinct ordered solutions (tuples) for each set is calculated using the formula for permutations with repetition: $\\frac{5!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$, where $n_i$ is the frequency of each distinct number in the set.\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all the unique sets found.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will:\n    *   Loop through the possible values for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ under the ordering constraint.\n    *   Calculate the required value for $x_5^2$ and check if it's a perfect square.\n    *   For each valid set found, calculate the number of permutations.\n    *   Sum these counts and print the detailed calculation process, including the final equation summing up all permutation counts.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The main plan is to find unique sets of integers {x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅}\n    # that solve the equation, and then for each set, calculate the number of\n    # distinct permutations, which gives the number of ordered solutions.\n    # Finally, we sum up the counts from all unique sets.\n\n    target = 2024\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))  # Max possible value for any xᵢ is floor(sqrt(2024)) = 44\n    \n    solution_sets = []\n\n    # To find unique sets efficiently, we search for solutions with the constraint:\n    # x₁ ≥ x₂ ≥ x₃ ≥ x₄ ≥ x₅ ≥ 0\n    # The loop ranges are optimized based on this constraint.\n    x1_min = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(target / 5.0))) # x₁ must be at least 21\n    for x1 in range(x1_min, limit + 1):\n        rem1 = target - x1*x1\n        \n        x2_min = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(rem1 / 4.0))) if rem1 > 0 else 0\n        x2_max = min(x1, int(math.sqrt(rem1)))\n        for x2 in range(x2_min, x2_max + 1):\n            rem2 = rem1 - x2*x2\n            \n            x3_min = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(rem2 / 3.0))) if rem2 > 0 else 0\n            x3_max = min(x2, int(math.sqrt(rem2)))\n            for x3 in range(x3_min, x3_max + 1):\n                rem3 = rem2 - x3*x3\n                \n                x4_min = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(rem3 / 2.0))) if rem3 > 0 else 0\n                x4_max = min(x3, int(math.sqrt(rem3)))\n                for x4 in range(x4_min, x4_max + 1):\n                    rem4 = rem3 - x4*x4\n                    \n                    # Now we check if the remainder is a perfect square for x₅²\n                    if rem4 >= 0:\n                        x5 = int(math.sqrt(rem4))\n                        if x5*x5 == rem4 and x5 <= x4:\n                            solution_sets.append((x1, x2, x3, x4, x5))\n\n    def count_permutations(t):\n        # Calculates 5! / (n₁! * n₂! * ...), where nᵢ is the frequency of each distinct element\n        counts = Counter(t)\n        denominator = 1\n        for count in counts.values():\n            denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n        return math.factorial(5) // denominator\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"Finding the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation:\")\n    print(\"x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024\\n\")\n    print(\"First, we find all unique sets of integers (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅) where x₁ ≥ x₂ ≥ x₃ ≥ x₄ ≥ x₅.\")\n    print(\"Then, for each set, we calculate the number of distinct ordered solutions (permutations).\\n\")\n    print(f\"Found {len(solution_sets)} unique sets.
