    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size, which is primarily determined by the integer `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core of the Algorithm:** The main computational work happens inside the `while q > 0` loop. The overall complexity will be determined by how many times this loop executes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Loop's Behavior:** The loop continues as long as the quotient `q` is positive. Let's examine how `q` changes in each step.\n    *   Initially, before the loop, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In the first iteration of the loop, `x` becomes the old `q` (i.e., `⌊n/c⌋`), and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. This is equivalent to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be `⌊n / c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\n3.  **Find the Number of Iterations:** The loop stops when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when the expression `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n    *   Termination condition: `n / c^(k+1) < 1`\n    *   Multiplying by `c^(k+1)` gives: `n < c^(k+1)`\n    *   To solve for `k`, we can take the logarithm to the base `c` of both sides: `log_c(n) < k + 1`\n    *   Rearranging for `k`, we get: `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n    *   Since `k` must be an integer (as it's the iteration count), the number of times the loop runs is `k = floor(log_c(n))`. This shows that the number of iterations is directly proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Iteration:** The operations inside the loop are: one increment (`i := i + 1`), one assignment (`x := q`), one division (`⌊x/c⌋`), one multiplication (`qc`), and one subtraction (`x - qc`). These are all fundamental arithmetic operations that take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration.\n    *   Time Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Time Complexity = `O(log_c(n)) × O(1)`\n    *   Time Complexity = `O(log_c(n))`\n\n    In complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because it only differs by a constant factor from any other base (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`). Therefore, the complexity is written as `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements the algorithm and empirically demonstrates this logarithmic relationship by counting the iterations and comparing the count to the value of `log_c(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_imag_complexity(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements the IMAG algorithm, counts the number of loop iterations,\n    and compares it to the theoretical value of log_c(n) to demonstrate the\n    O(log n) time complexity. It then prints the values involved in this comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate inputs as per the algorithm's constraints\n    if not (isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(c, int) and n >= 0 and c >= 2):\n        print(\"Error: Input must be integers n and c, where n >= 0 and c >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Start of IMAG Algorithm Implementation ---\n    # 1.
