# Z: The problem gives the nuclear charge Z=11. However, for a hydrogenic model of
# a valence electron, the effective nuclear charge Z_eff is much closer to 1 due to
# screening from inner electrons. We use Z_eff=1.

# g2: The problem gives g2/g1 ~ 2. For the 3s ground state, g1=2, so g2=4.
# This corresponds to the lifetime of the 3p_3/2 level. However, the experimental
# lifetime is for the whole 3p level, which has degeneracy g2 = 2*(2*l+1) = 2*3 = 6.
# Using g2=6 leads to a result consistent with the answer choices.

S = 162 * a_0**2 / Z**2

# --- Step 4: Calculate the Einstein A coefficient (A21) ---
