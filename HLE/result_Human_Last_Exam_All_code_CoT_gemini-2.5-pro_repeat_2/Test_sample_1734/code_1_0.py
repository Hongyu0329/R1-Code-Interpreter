/*
 * This program calculates the gravitational time dilation factor 'f'
 * for the Pioneer probe near the pulsar Pandora, designed for the memory-
 * efficient, decimal-based Wuxing architecture.
 *
 * The Wuxing architecture has no floating-point types or standard math
 * libraries (like sqrt). All calculations must use the special 'frac' type.
 *
 * Formula: f = sqrt(1 - (2*G*M)/(r*c^2))
 *
 * Pre-calculation & Simplification for `frac`:
 * - The term we need is x = (2GM)/(rc^2).
 * - r = 20km (radius) + 60km (distance) = 80,000 m.
 * - Rs = 2GM/c^2 for a 2-solar-mass pulsar is ~5913 m.
 * - x = Rs/r = 5913/80000 approx 0.0739.
 * - To avoid overflow in the `frac` type (which uses small char types),
 *   we approximate x with a simple fraction: 3/40 (which is 0.075).
 * - Thus, we need to calculate f = sqrt(1 - 3/40) = sqrt(37/40).
 * - The value 37/40 can be stored in a `frac` as {n=37, d=40, e=0}.
 * - We use the Babylonian method for sqrt, which only requires basic arithmetic.
 *
 * Memory Efficiency Analysis:
 * - A `frac` type uses 3 `char` types. On Wuxing, a char is 2 Decimal Digits (D).
 * - So, sizeof(frac) = 2D + 2D + 2D = 6D.
 * - To calculate sqrt(y), the Babylonian method g_new = (g + y/g)/2 needs:
 *   1. `y`: the number (37/40e0).
 *   2. `g`: the iterative guess, which becomes the final answer.
 *   3. `two`: the constant 2 (2/1e0).
 * - This requires a minimum of 3 `frac` variables, for a total memory footprint of
 *   z = 3 * 6D = 18D. This is the most memory-efficient implementation.
