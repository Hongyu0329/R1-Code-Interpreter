# This script determines the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# based on its given properties.

# Let X be a compact topological space.
# Property (1): X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, ω₁).
# This means X is a compactification of R.

# Property (2): Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique
# continuous function on X.
# This is the universal property that defines the Stone-Čech compactification, βR.

# The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like the long ray R)
# is unique up to homeomorphism. This means that any space satisfying the
# given properties must be homeomorphic to βR.

# Therefore, all such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class.
# The number of distinct classes is 1.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# The final equation is:
# Number of homeomorphism classes = 1

print("The final equation is:")
print(f"Number of homeomorphism classes = {number_of_homeomorphism_classes}")
