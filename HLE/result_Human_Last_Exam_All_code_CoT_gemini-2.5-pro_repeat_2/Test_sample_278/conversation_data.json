    "My plan is to solve this problem by first determining the bounding box of the figure described by the parametric curve.\n\n1.  **Find the range of x-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π)`. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1 over this interval. Thus, `x_min = -1` and `x_max = 1`.\n2.  **Find the range of y-coordinates:** The y-coordinate has two definitions:\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = 1 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, the y-values are in `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. So, the y-values are in `[-5, 0)`.\n    *   Combining these two ranges, the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`. Thus, `y_min = -5` and `y_max = 1`.\n3.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n4.  **Determine the side of the smallest enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that can contain this bounding box must be equal to the larger of its dimensions.\n    *   `side_length = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is `side_length * side_length`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum x and y values.\n\n# For x = cos(t), the range over [0, 2*pi) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1.0\nx_max = 1.0\n\n# For y, we have two parts.\n# Part 1: y = 1 * sin(t) for t in [0, pi]. Range is [0, 1].\n# Part 2: y = 5 * sin(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi). Range is [-5, 0).\n# The overall range for y is the union of these two ranges.\ny_min = -5.0\ny_max = 1.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 3: The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(f\"The figure spans from x={x_min} to x={x_max}, so its width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The figure spans from y={y_min} to y={y_max}, so its height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side of the smallest enclosing square must be the larger of the width and height, which is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\nprint(f\"The area of this square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n```\n<<<36.0>>>"
