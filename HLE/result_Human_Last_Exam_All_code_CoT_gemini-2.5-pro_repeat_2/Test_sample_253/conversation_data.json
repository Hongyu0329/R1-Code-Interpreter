    "Here is the plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The rule number 110 corresponds to the binary sequence `01101110`. This sequence maps the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns to the next state of the central cell as follows:\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton**: The simulation starts from a single cell in state `1`, surrounded by cells in state `0`. We'll create a list or array to represent this initial state. The width of the array must be large enough to accommodate the pattern's growth over 20 generations. A width of `2 * 20 + 1 = 41` is the minimum required. We'll use a slightly larger width for safety.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: We will loop 20 times to simulate the 20 generations. In each step, we'll create a new array for the next generation. We'll iterate through each cell of the current generation, determine its 3-cell neighborhood, and use the Rule 110 mapping to calculate its state in the next generation.\n4.  **Output the Final Pattern**: After 20 iterations, the simulation is complete. The resulting array will contain the final binary pattern. We will convert this array into a string of '0's and '1's, trim any excess leading or trailing zeros, and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' cell and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of generations to simulate\n    generations = 20\n\n    # Rule 110 mapping: key is the 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right),\n    # value is the next state of the center cell. 110_decimal = 01101110_binary.\n    rule110 = {\n        (1, 1, 1): 0,\n        (1, 1, 0): 1,\n        (1, 0, 1): 1,\n        (1, 0, 0): 0,\n        (0, 1, 1): 1,\n        (0, 1, 0): 1,\n        (0, 0, 1): 1,\n        (0, 0, 0): 0\n    }\n\n    # Set up the initial state.
