    "My plan is to provide a Python script that solves the problem, as this is the primary format requested. The problem also contains a specific task to find the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program for this task. I will perform that analysis here and provide the final value as the answer.\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nTo achieve the highest memory efficiency in a C program, we should avoid creating extra arrays or data structures to store the numbers or their counts. The most memory-efficient C program would read the input into a character buffer and then iterate through the buffer multiple times—once for each possible digit (1, 2, 3, 4)—printing the results directly. This avoids storing counts or creating a separate array for sorting.\n\nHere is the logic for such a C program:\n1.  Read the input string into a `char s[1001]`.\n2.  Use a flag, for instance, `int first_term = 1;`, to correctly handle the printing of `+` symbols.\n3.  **Pass 1:** Iterate through the string `s` (at indices 0, 2, 4, ...). If `s[i]` is '1', print it (with a preceding `+` if `first_term` is false) and update the flag.\n4.  **Pass 2:** Do the same for the digit '2'.\n5.  **Pass 3:** Do the same for the digit '3'.\n6.  **Pass 4:** Do the same for the digit '4'.\n\nThe variables used and their memory consumption (assuming a standard 32/64-bit system where `int` is 4 bytes) would be:\n*   `char s[1001]`: The buffer to hold the input string (max 1000 chars + null terminator). Memory: `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = **1001 bytes**.\n*   `int first_term`: A flag variable to manage printing the `+` separator. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4` = **4 bytes**.\n*   `int i`: A loop counter variable. This variable's memory space on the stack can be reused for each of the four passes. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4` = **4 bytes**.\n\nThe total memory used for variables is the sum of these amounts.\n\nTotal Memory (m) = 1001 + 4 + 4 = 1009 bytes.\n\nThis approach is more memory-efficient than using counting sort (which requires an extra integer array for counts) or in-place sorting (which requires storing the string length and an extra temp variable for swapping).\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input sum as a string\n    s = input()\n\n    # The summands are the characters at even indices, or more easily,\n    # we can split the string by the '+' character.\n    summands = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of summands in non-decreasing order.\n    # Since they are strings '1', '2', '3', '4', lexical sort is sufficient.\n    summands.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted summands back into a single string, separated by '+'.\n    # This forms the new equation that Xenia can calculate.\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(summands)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1009>>>"
