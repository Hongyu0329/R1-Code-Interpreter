# The final answer is a rational number n, where the focal length f is proportional to t^n.
# We will determine the value of n based on the physics of the system.

# Step 1: Find the relationship between focal length (f) and angular velocity squared (omega^2).
# The equation for the surface of a rotating liquid is z = (omega^2 * r^2) / (2*g).
# The equation for a parabolic mirror is z = r^2 / (4*f).
# Equating the two gives f = g / (2 * omega^2).
# This means f is proportional to (omega^2)^a.
a = -1
print(f"The focal length f is proportional to (ω^2)^a, where a = {a}")

# Step 2: Find the relationship between angular velocity squared (omega^2) and time (t).
# Constant power P means dK/dt is constant, where K is kinetic energy.
# K = (1/2) * I * omega^2.
# P = d/dt[(1/2) * I * omega^2] = (I/2) * d(omega^2)/dt.
# Integrating P*dt = (I/2)*d(omega^2) gives P*t = (I/2)*omega^2.
# This means omega^2 is proportional to t^b.
b = 1
print(f"The angular velocity squared, ω^2, is proportional to t^b, where b = {b}")

# Step 3: Combine the relationships to find the final exponent n.
# We have f ∝ (ω^2)^a and ω^2 ∝ t^b.
# Substituting the second into the first gives f ∝ (t^b)^a = t^(a*b).
# Therefore, n = a * b.
n = a * b
print("\nCombining these relationships, we get f ∝ t^n.")
print(f"The final equation is f ∝ t^({a}*{b}).")
print(f"So, the value of n is {n}.")
