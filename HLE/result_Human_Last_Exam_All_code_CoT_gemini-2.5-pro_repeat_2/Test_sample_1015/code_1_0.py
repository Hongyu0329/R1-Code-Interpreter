    print("\n1. Vaganova Method:")
    print("   - The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on core stability and precise alignment.")
    print("   - In a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep the hips perfectly square and directly over the supporting legs.")
    print("   - The bend comes from the upper and middle back, maintaining a stable and controlled pelvis. The goal is a pure curve of the spine.")

    print("\n2. Balanchine Method:")
    print("   - The Balanchine style is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, neoclassical lines.")
    print("   - In a Balanchine cambré derrière, a key stylistic feature is to press the hip forward as the upper body bends back.")
    print("   - This action, sometimes called 'breaking at the hip,' creates a more extreme, angular line and is a defining characteristic of the style.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("   - While head and arm placements also differ stylistically, the most fundamental and defining mechanical difference is the treatment of the hips.")
    print("   - Vaganova demands hip stability, while Balanchine incorporates a distinct forward hip placement.")
    print("   - Therefore, the placement of the hip is the correct answer.")
