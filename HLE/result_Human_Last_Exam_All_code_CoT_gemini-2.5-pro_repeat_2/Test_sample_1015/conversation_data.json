    "My plan is to analyze the technical specifics of a *cambré derrière* (a bend of the upper body backwards) in both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods. I will compare the core principles of each method as they apply to this movement, focusing on body alignment, particularly of the spine and pelvis. By identifying the most significant and defining technical difference, I can select the correct option from the choices provided.\n\nThe Python script below will articulate this analysis. It will define the key characteristics of the movement in each style and then determine which of the multiple-choice options best captures the primary distinction. Finally, it will print the reasoning and the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    and prints the explanation and the correct answer choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Cambré Derrière in Vaganova vs. Balanchine Methods:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1. Vaganova Method:\")\n    print(\"   - The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on core stability and precise alignment.\")\n    print(\"   - In a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep the hips perfectly square and directly over the supporting legs.\")\n    print(\"   - The bend comes from the upper and middle back, maintaining a stable and controlled pelvis.

Balanchine Method:\")\n    print(\"   - The Balanchine style is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, neoclassical lines.\")\n    print(\"   - In a Balanchine cambré derrière, a key stylistic feature is to press the hip forward as the upper body bends back.\")\n    print(\"   - This action, sometimes called 'breaking at the hip,' creates a more extreme, angular line and is a defining characteristic of the style.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"   - While head and arm placements also differ stylistically, the most fundamental and defining mechanical difference is the treatment of the hips.\")\n    print(\"   - Vaganova demands hip stability, while Balanchine incorporates a distinct forward hip placement.\")\n    print(\"   - Therefore, the placement of the hip is the correct answer.\")\n\n    correct_choice = 'B'\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice}. {options[correct_choice]}\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nsolve_ballet_question()\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
