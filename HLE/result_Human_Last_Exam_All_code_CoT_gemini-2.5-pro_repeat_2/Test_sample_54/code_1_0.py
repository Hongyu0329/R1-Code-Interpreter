    print("   - Saturated Activations: Functions like sigmoid, tanh, or hard-sigmoid 'saturate' (flatten out). Their behavior can be modeled by comparing a weighted sum to a threshold. For example, `sigmoid(x) > 0.5` is equivalent to `x > 0`.")

    print("   - A saturated activation or a hard-attention comparison on this weighted sum is equivalent to the function of a Threshold Gate. A threshold gate outputs 1 if the weighted sum of its boolean inputs exceeds a certain threshold, and 0 otherwise. Operations on finite-precision floats can be simulated by such gates.")

    print("   - Circuit Size: For an input of length 'n', a transformer's computational graph involves a number of operations (and parameters) that is polynomial in 'n'. This means the simulating circuit will have a polynomial number of gates, denoted as `poly(n)`.")

    print("   - The class of problems solvable by circuits of constant depth (`O(1)`), polynomial size (`poly(n)`), and composed of unbounded fan-in AND, OR, and Threshold gates is defined as TC⁰ (Threshold Circuits, class zero).")
