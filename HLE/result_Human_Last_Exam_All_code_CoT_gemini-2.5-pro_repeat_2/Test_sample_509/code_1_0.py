    This script analyzes the condition for the existence of a homotopy section

    The key result is that for a compact manifold M, the fibration pi_{k,l} admits a
    homotopy section if and only if the Euler characteristic chi(M) is zero.
    For non-compact manifolds, a homotopy section always exists.

    The question's options must be checked against this condition.
