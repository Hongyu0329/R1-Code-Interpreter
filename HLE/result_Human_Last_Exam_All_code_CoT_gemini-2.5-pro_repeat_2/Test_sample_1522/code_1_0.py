    print("The condition is: There exists a constant a <= 1 such that for all distinct x, y, |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y|.")

    print("So, the condition on f is equivalent to stating that f is a contraction mapping on R, with a contraction constant L < 1.")

    print("A fixed point of f is a number x such that f(x) = x.")

    print("The set of real numbers R with the standard distance |x - y| is a complete metric space.")

Since g(x) is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that g(x) must be 0 for some x, which means f(x) = x.)")
