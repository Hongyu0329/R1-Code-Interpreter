# The solution is derived from analyzing the physics of a violin.
# (1) 'sul ponticello' changes the harmonic content, corresponding to parameter 'ν' in group (ii).
# (2) A bridge mute adds mass, changing higher body resonances, corresponding to group (iv): (μ, a_2, f_2).
# (3) Helium in the air changes the speed of sound, altering air resonances like f_1 in group (iii).
# (4) Changing the string from A to E alters the fundamental frequency 'F', corresponding to group (i).
# For (2), adding the mute's mass lowers the resonant frequency f_2, so the direction is 'down'.

# The final answer is a formatted string of these findings.
variation_1_group = "ii"
variation_2_group = "iv"
variation_3_group = "iii"
variation_4_group = "i"
direction_for_2 = "down"

# The problem requires the final answer in a specific comma-separated format.
# We construct the string and print it.
final_answer = f"{variation_1_group},{variation_2_group},{variation_3_group},{variation_4_group},{direction_for_2}"

print(final_answer)
