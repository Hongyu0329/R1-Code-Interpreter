    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of
    regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.
    
    A continuum is a compact connected metric space.
    A continuum is decomposable if it is the union of two proper subcontinua.
    A subcontinuum is regular if it is the closure of its interior.
    
    Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
    A theorem in topology states that any decomposable continuum X can be written as
    the union of two distinct proper regular subcontinua, A and B.
    This implies that the number of such subcontinua must be at least 2.
    
    Step 2: Establish an upper bound.
    We need to find an example of a decomposable continuum that has exactly two
    regular proper subcontinua. An example is the union of two pseudo-arcs
    (indecomposable continua where every proper subcontinuum has an empty interior)
    joined at a single point. Let this space be X = P1 U P2.
    The only two regular proper subcontinua of this space are P1 and P2 themselves.
    
    Conclusion:
    From Step 1, the minimum number is >= 2.
    From Step 2, the minimum number is <= 2.
    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
