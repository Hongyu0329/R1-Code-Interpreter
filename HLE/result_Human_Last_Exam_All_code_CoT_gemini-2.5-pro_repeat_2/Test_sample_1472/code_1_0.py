    # Step 1: Define the molecule's components
    print("1. Molecular Structure:")
    print("   - Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print("   - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)")
    print("   - Complex: [Cu(CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)2]. Two bidentate ligands coordinate to the copper via their sulfur atoms.")
    print("   - Coordination Number: 4 (four S-Cu bonds).")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")

    # Step 2: Determine the coordination geometry
    print("2. Coordination Geometry:")
    print("   - A 4-coordinate complex can be either tetrahedral or square planar.")
    print("   - The two bulky, puckered chelate rings favor a configuration that minimizes steric repulsion.")
    print("   - Therefore, a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the CuS4 core is the most stable and likely arrangement.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")

    # Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of an idealized core
    print("3. Symmetry of the Idealized Core [Cu(S-CH2-CH2-S)2]:")
    print("   - If we temporarily ignore the methyl groups, the complex is analogous to [Cu(ethylenediamine)2].")
    print("   - A tetrahedral complex of the type [M(A-A)2] (where A-A is a symmetric bidentate ligand) has D2 symmetry.")
    print("   - The D2 point group consists of the identity operation (E) and three mutually perpendicular C2 rotation axes.")
    print("     - One C2 axis passes through the Cu atom and interchanges the two ligands.")
    print("     - The other two C2 axes also pass through the Cu atom, bisecting the S-Cu-S angle within each ligand.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")

    # Step 4: Consider the effect of the methyl groups
    print("4. Effect of the Methyl (-CH3) Groups:")
    print("   - The actual ligand is CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3.")
    print("   - We must check which symmetry elements of D2 are retained.")
    print("   - The C2 axis that interchanges the two identical ligands is preserved. A 180-degree rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.")
    print("   - However, the two C2 axes that bisect the S-Cu-S angles are lost. A rotation around these axes would move a methyl group to a position where there is no methyl group, as the ligand is not symmetric about the S-Cu-S bisector.")
    print("   - There are no mirror planes (Ïƒ) or an inversion center (i) in this chiral molecule.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")

    # Step 5: Final Determination
    print("5. Conclusion:")
    print("   - The only symmetry element remaining, besides the identity (E), is a single C2 axis.")
    point_group = "C2"
    print(f"   - A molecule with only the symmetry elements E and C2 belongs to the {point_group} point group.")
