def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    Solves the set theory problem about cardinalities of MAD families.

    The problem asks for the difference between the maximal and minimal possible
    cardinality of X, where X is the set of cardinalities of uncountable
    maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families of subsets of ω.
    This is given under the assumption that the continuum hypothesis (CH) fails
    and 2^ω₁ = ω₃.

    Background from Set Theory:
    1. A MAD family is a maximal collection of infinite subsets of natural numbers
       (ω) where any two sets have a finite intersection.
    2. The set of possible cardinalities of uncountable MAD families is the set of
       all regular cardinals in the interval [𝔞, 2^ω].
       - 𝔞 is the smallest possible cardinality of an infinite MAD family.
       - 2^ω is the cardinality of the continuum (the power set of ω).
    3. ZFC axioms imply:
       - ω₁ ≤ 𝔞 ≤ 2^ω.
       - 𝔞 must be a regular cardinal.
    4. Problem constraints:
       - CH fails: 2^ω > ω₁.
       - 2^ω₁ = ω₃. From cardinal arithmetic, ω < ω₁ implies 2^ω ≤ 2^ω₁.
         Therefore, 2^ω ≤ ω₃.
    5. Combining constraints, the possible values for 2^ω are ω₂ and ω₃.

    # Step 1: Find the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    # To maximize |X|, we need the widest possible interval [𝔞, 2^ω] of regular cardinals.
    # This is achieved by choosing the smallest possible 𝔞 and the largest possible 2^ω.
    # - Smallest possible 𝔞: ω₁ (since 𝔞 ≥ ω₁).
    # - Largest possible 2^ω: ω₃ (since 2^ω ≤ ω₃).
    # It is consistent with ZFC + (2^ω₁ = ω₃) to have a model where 𝔞 = ω₁ and 2^ω = ω₃.
    #
    # In this case, X = {κ is a regular cardinal | ω₁ ≤ κ ≤ ω₃}.
    # The cardinals in this interval are ω₁, ω₂, and ω₃.

    # We must also satisfy 2^ω > ω₁. The smallest possible value for 2^ω is ω₂.
    # It is consistent with ZFC + (2^ω₁ = ω₃) to have a model where 𝔞 = 2^ω = ω₂.
    # Note that ω₂ is a regular cardinal, so it is a valid value for 𝔞.

    # In this case, X = {κ is a regular cardinal | ω₂ ≤ κ ≤ ω₂}.
