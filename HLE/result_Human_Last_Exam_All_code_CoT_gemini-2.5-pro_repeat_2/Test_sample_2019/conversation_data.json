    "To solve this problem, I will use a computational approach. The task is to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 chessboard that wraps around (a toroidal board).\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Toroidal Attack Rules:** On a normal chessboard, queens attack along ranks, files, and diagonals. On a toroidal board, these attacks \"wrap around\". For a board of size `N x N`, two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if:\n    *   They are in the same row: `r1 == r2`\n    *   They are in the same column: `c1 == c2`\n    *   They are on the same \"wrap-around\" diagonal. This can be expressed using modular arithmetic:\n        *   `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n        *   `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n2.  **Use a Backtracking Algorithm:** The board size (5x5) and number of queens (4) are small enough to be solved with a brute-force search. I will use a backtracking algorithm, which is a classic method for solving such constraint-satisfaction problems.\n\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   I will write a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time on the board.\n    *   The board's 25 squares will be indexed from 0 to 24 for simplicity.\n    *   To avoid counting the same arrangement of queens multiple times, I will enforce an order. When placing the next queen, the search will only consider squares with an index greater than the previously placed queen's index.\n    *   For each potential square, a helper function will check if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (i.e., not attacked by any queens already on the board) according to the toroidal rules.\n    *   If a placement is safe, the function will place the queen and call itself to place the next queen. After the recursive call returns, it will \"un-place\" the queen (backtrack) to explore other possibilities.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. When this happens, we have found one valid arrangement and we increment a counter.\n\nThis method will systematically explore all valid combinations of queen placements and provide the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n\n    def is_safe(queen_pos, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a queen at queen_pos is safe from the queens in placed_queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        r2, c2 = queen_pos\n        for r1, c1 in placed_queens:\n            # Check for row or column attack\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                return False\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks\n            if (r1 - c1) % board_size == (r2 - c2) % board_size:\n                return False\n            if (r1 + c1) % board_size == (r2 + c2) % board_size:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_placements(queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid queen placements using backtracking.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if all queens have been placed, we found one valid solution.\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Iterate over possible squares, starting from start_index to avoid duplicates.\n        for i in range(start_index, board_size * board_size):\n            # Optimization: if remaining squares are not enough for remaining queens, stop.\n            if (board_size * board_size - i) < queens_to_place:\n                break\n                \n            r, c = i // board_size, i % board_size\n\n            if is_safe((r, c), placed_queens):\n                # Place the queen\n                placed_queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recurse to place the next queen\n                count += count_placements(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, placed_queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other options\n                placed_queens.pop()\n        \n        return count\n\n    total_ways = count_placements(num_queens, 0, [])\n    \n    # The final output explains the result, including the numbers from the problem statement.\n    print(f\"On a {board_size}x{board_size} toroidal chessboard, there are {total_ways} ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_n_queens_toroidal()\n```\n<<<200>>>"
