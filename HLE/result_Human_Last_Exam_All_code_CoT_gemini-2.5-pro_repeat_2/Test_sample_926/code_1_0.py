def calculate_superlubric_friction(velocity, temperature, k_factor):
    """
    Calculates an illustrative frictional force in a superlubric system.

    This function uses a simplified model based on the principle that frictional
    force in some superlubric systems increases with both sliding velocity and
    temperature due to dynamic, thermal effects.

    Args:
        velocity (float): The sliding velocity in meters per second (m/s).
        temperature (float): The system temperature in Kelvin (K).
        k_factor (float): A proportionality constant representing material
                          and contact properties, in N*s/(m*K).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated frictional force in Newtons (N).
