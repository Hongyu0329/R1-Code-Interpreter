    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to evaluate is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This form is a standard result from calculus. The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)| + C`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** For a definite integral from `a` to `b`, `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx` evaluates to `[ln|f(x)|]` from `a` to `b`, which is `ln|f(b)| - ln|f(a)|`.\n3.  **Identify `f(x)`, `a`, and `b`:** In this problem, `f(x) = F₃(x)`, the lower limit `a = 0`, and the upper limit `b = 1`. So, the value of the integral, which we'll call `V`, is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. (We can drop the absolute value since `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^sin(x))` is always positive).\n4.  **Calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`:**\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n5.  **Calculate `V`:** Substitute the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the expression for `V`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n7.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` library for high precision. The script will print out the values at each step of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and calculates the final requested value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the function F3(x) based on the problem description.\n    # F₀(x) = x\n    # F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n    # F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    def F3(x):\n        return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n    # Step 2: The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to\n    # ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    \n    # Calculate F₃(1)\n    f3_at_1 = F3(1)\n    \n    # Calculate F₃(0)\n    f3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral, V.\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final result as the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n    final_result = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_result)\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The equation for the integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    print(\"The integral V is calculated as: ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\n    print(f\"Value of F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"Value of F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\n    print(f\"Final value to report is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\n    print(f\"10000 * V = {final_result}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
