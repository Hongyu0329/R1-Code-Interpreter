    # The problem defines a set of instances Q, where each instance C=(S,d) in Q
    # has the minimum possible size |S|=N and exhibits the "local-max" property for some k.
    # The local-max property is: max(score(C,k-1), score(C,k+1)) < score(C,k).
    # Given the possible scores of 1 or 2, this implies:
    # score(C, k-1) = 1
    # score(C, k+1) = 1
    # score(C, k)   = 2
    
    # Step 1: Determine the minimum size N and corresponding k.
    # A score of 1 for a k'-clustering means that there exists a valid clustering
    # with a radius of 1. A valid clustering is a Voronoi partition of S into k'
    # clusters, where each cluster has a size of at least L.
    
    # For score(k-1) = 1, S can be partitioned into k-1 clusters, V_1, ..., V_{k-1}.
    # The total size |S| = |V_1| + ... + |V_{k-1}|.
    # With the constraint |V_i| >= L, we must have |S| >= (k-1) * L.
    
    # For score(k+1) = 1, S can be partitioned into k+1 clusters, W_1, ..., W_{k+1}.
    # The total size |S| = |W_1| + ... + |W_{k+1}|.
    # With the constraint |W_j| >= L, we must have |S| >= (k+1) * L.
    
    # To find the minimum N, we must find k that allows for the smallest |S|.
    # The value k must be at least 2, since k-1 must be at least 1.
    # Let's test the smallest possible value, k=2.
    # If k=2:
    #  - From the 1-clustering: |S| >= (2-1)*L = 1 * 24 = 24.
    #  - From the 3-clustering: |S| >= (2+1)*L = 3 * 24 = 72.
    # Both conditions must hold, so |S| must be at least 72.
    
    # Let's check if |S|=72 is possible.
    # If |S|=72, we need to be able to partition it into 1 cluster of size >= 24 (which is {S} itself, size 72),
    # and into 3 clusters of size >= 24. A partition into {24, 24, 24} works.
