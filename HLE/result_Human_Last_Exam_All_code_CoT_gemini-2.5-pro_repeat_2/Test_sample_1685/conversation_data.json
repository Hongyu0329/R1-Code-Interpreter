    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the ODE for large x:** The original ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. When $x$ is large, the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ diminishes, assuming $y''$ does not grow excessively fast. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is an oscillating term. To find the smooth, average behavior of the solution for large $x$, we can neglect these two terms. This simplifies the ODE to $y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$.\n\n2.  **Assume a solution form:** For large $x$, a common trial solution form is a power law, $y(x) = C x^p$.\n\n3.  **Determine the dominant balance:** We substitute the power-law form into the simplified ODE to determine which terms are dominant.\n    *   $y'''(x) \\sim x^{p-3}$\n    *   $y^4(x) \\sim x^{4p}$\n    *   $y'^4(x) \\sim x^{4p-4}$\n\n    For large $x$, the dominant term on the right-hand side is $y^4$ (as $4p > 4p-4$). To have a balance, the power of the left-hand side must match the power of the dominant term on the right-hand side.\n    $p-3 = 4p \\implies 3p = -3 \\implies p = -1$.\n    With $p=-1$, the powers of the terms are: $x^{-4}$ for $y'''$, $x^{-4}$ for $y^4$, and $x^{-8}$ for $y'^4$. The term $y'^4$ is indeed negligible compared to the other two for large $x$, so our balance is consistent.\n\n4.  **Solve for the constant C:** Now we use the determined form $y(x) = C/x$ in the balanced equation $y''' \\approx y^4$.\n    *   $y'(x) = -C/x^2$\n    *   $y''(x) = 2C/x^3$\n    *   $y'''(x) = -6C/x^4$\n    Substituting into the balance equation:\n    $-6C/x^4 = (C/x)^4 = C^4/x^4$\n    $-6C = C^4$\n    Since we seek a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0$), we can divide by $C$:\n    $C^3 = -6$\n    $C = \\sqrt[3]{-6} \\approx -1.81712$\n\n5.  **Construct the final expression:** Rounding the constant $C$ to two decimal places gives $-1.82$. The resulting approximate analytical expression is $y(x) = -1.82/x$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the constant and prints the final expression for the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. The ODE is approximated for large x as y''' ≈ y^4 + y'^4.\n# 2. A power-law solution y(x) = C * x^p is assumed.\n# 3. Dominant balance analysis yields p = -1 and the approximation y''' ≈ y^4.\n# 4. Substituting y(x) = C/x into y''' = y^4 gives C^3 = -6.\n# 5. We calculate C and round it to two decimal places to form the final expression.\n\n# Calculate the value of the constant C\n# C^3 = -6 => C = (-6)^(1/3)\nC = -math.pow(6, 1/3)\n\n# Round the constant to two decimal places\nC_rounded = round(C, 2)\n\n# The numerator in the final expression y(x) = numerator / x\nnumerator = C_rounded\n\n# Print the final analytical expression\nprint(\"An analytical expression that approximates the solution for large x is:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {numerator} / x\")\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 / x>>>"
