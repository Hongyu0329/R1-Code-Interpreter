    # Part a: Determine the bi-degree of the terminal polynomial.
    # An sl(2) string in DH_n exhibits symmetry. If a string starter (lowest weight vector)
    # has bi-degree (a, b), the terminal polynomial (highest weight vector) will have
    # bi-degree (b, a).
    # Given starter bi-degree is (4, 3).

    # Part b: Provide the condition for a polynomial to be a valid string starter.
    # We interpret the indices r_1, ..., r_b as the exponents of the y-variables in
    # the construction of the polynomial. For the polynomial to be a string starter (FP=0),
    # a common condition is that the set of exponents {r_1, ..., r_b} must be a
    # permutation of {0, 1, ..., b-1}. A necessary condition derived from this is that
    # the sum of the exponents equals the sum of the numbers from 0 to b-1.
    # The sum is b*(b-1)/2, which is C(b, 2).
    # The equation representing this condition is:
    index_start = 1
    binom_k = 2
    # The notation C(n, k) is defined as binomial coefficient in the problem description.

    # Part c: Determine if a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) can be constructed
    # using only E_{r, 0} operators.
    # The operator E_{r, 0} increases the x-degree by r but has no effect on the y-degree.
    # If the construction process for DH_n starts from a polynomial with y-degree 0
    # (a common case, e.g., starting with Delta_n(X)), applying operators that do not
    # change the y-degree cannot result in a polynomial with a non-zero y-degree.
