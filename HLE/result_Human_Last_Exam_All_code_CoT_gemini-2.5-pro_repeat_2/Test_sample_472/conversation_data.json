    "This task requires scanning a line of Latin poetry from Plautus. Plautine scansion is complex and allows for many substitutions compared to classical poetry (like that of Virgil or Ovid). The line given is a \"trochaic septenarius catalecticus,\" a common meter in Roman comedy.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is a trochaic septenarius catalecticus. The basic pattern for this meter is seven trochees (`L S`) followed by a final incomplete foot, often represented as:\n    `L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L X`\n    (where `L` is a long syllable, `S` is a short syllable, and `X` is an anceps, a syllable that can be either long or short).\n\n2.  **Syllabify and Scan:** I will break the line into syllables and determine their length (long or short) based on standard rules.\n    *   A syllable is long by nature (diphthong or long vowel) or by position (vowel followed by two or more consonants).\n    *   A syllable is short if it has a short vowel followed by only one consonant.\n    *   An important feature of this line is **hiatus**, where elision (the dropping of a final vowel before another vowel) does *not* occur between `bene` and `esse`. This is necessary to achieve the 15 syllables required for this meter.\n\n3.  **Apply Metrical Substitutions:** Plautus frequently substitutes other feet for the standard trochee (`L S`). I will use the following valid substitutions to make the line fit the meter:\n    *   **Tribrach (`S S S`)** for a Trochee\n    *   **Iamb (`S L`)** for a Trochee\n    *   **Pyrrhic (`S S`)** for the final incomplete foot (`L X`)\n\n4.  **Group into Feet:** I will group the resulting sequence of long and short syllables into the seven metrical feet of the trochaic septenarius.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the final scansion, with each foot separated by a space as requested.\n\n### Scansion Execution:\n\n*   **Line:** `et ti bi be ne es se so li quom si bi sit ma le`\n*   **Syllable Lengths:** `L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S`\n*   **Grouping into Feet with Substitutions:**\n    1.  `et ti` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n    2.  `bi be ne` -> `S S S` (Tribrach, substituting a Trochee)\n    3.  `es se` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n    4.  `so li` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n    5.  `quom si` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n    6.  `bi sit` -> `S L` (Iamb, substituting a Trochee)\n    7.  `ma le` -> `S S` (Pyrrhic, substituting the final `L X`)\n\nThis scansion is consistent with the rules of early Latin comic meter.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the metrical scansion of the provided Latin line.\n# The line is a trochaic septenarius catalecticus from Plautus.\n# L = Long syllable, S = Short syllable.\n# Feet are separated by double spaces.\n\nfinal_scansion = \"L S  S S S  L S  L S  L S  S L  S S\"\n\n# Print each character of the scansion, which represents a syllable's length.\nprint(final_scansion)\n```\n<<<L S  S S S  L S  L S  L S  S L  S S>>>"
