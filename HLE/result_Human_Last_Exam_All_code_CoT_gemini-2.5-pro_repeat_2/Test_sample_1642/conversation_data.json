    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem**: The goal is to find the maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard. The rules are that queens of the same color cannot attack each other, and no two queens can occupy the same square.\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: For `m` queens of a single color to be non-attacking, they must all be in different rows. Since a 16x16 board has only 16 rows, the number of queens of one color, `m`, cannot be greater than 16. This gives us an upper bound: `m <= 16`.\n3.  **Determine if the Upper Bound is Achievable**: To determine if `m = 16` is possible, we need to see if we can place 16 non-attacking white queens and 16 non-attacking black queens on the board simultaneously without sharing any squares. This is equivalent to finding two disjoint solutions to the 16-queens problem.\n4.  **Apply a Known Mathematical Result**: Fortunately, this is a studied problem. A mathematical theorem states that it's possible to find two disjoint N-queens solutions on an N×N board for all N ≥ 4.\n5.  **Solve for N=16**: Our board size is N=16. Since 16 is greater than 4, the theorem applies. This confirms that two disjoint 16-queens solutions exist. We can use one solution for the white queens and the other for the black queens.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since we can achieve `m = 16` and we know `m` cannot be greater than 16, the maximum value for `m` is 16.\n7.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that follows this logical deduction to arrive at the answer and prints the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_peaceable_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black\n    queens can coexist on an N x N chessboard without same-color attacks.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
