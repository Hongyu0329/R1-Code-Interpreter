# Part 1: Determine the number of lines with compiler errors.
# - Line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a valid type in XVM's C. The largest type is `long` (12D).
# - Line 4: The format specifier `%d` is for the `digit` type, not `unsigned long`. It should be `%n`.
# - Line 9: The format specifier `%d` is for the `digit` type, not for the result which is a large number. It should be `%n`.
# Total lines with errors = 3.
x = 3

# Part 2: Calculate the minimum memory usage in an optimized version.
# To handle inputs n, m <= 4*10^9, `unsigned long` (12D) is needed.
# To handle input a < 10^6, `unsigned int` (6D, max 999,999) is sufficient.
# Total memory = 12 (for n) + 12 (for m) + 6 (for a) = 30D.
y = 30

# Part 3: Determine if branching is required.
# The use of `if (n % a != 0)` is a branch. This can be replaced by the
# mathematical formula for ceiling division: `(numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator`.
# Thus, branching is not necessary.
z = 'Y'

# Part 4: Calculate the output for the given n, m, and a.
# The equation is ceil(n/a) * ceil(m/a)
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# na and ma are the numbers of flagstones for each dimension.
na = math.ceil(n / a)
ma = math.ceil(m / a)

# The result is the product of na and ma.
t = int(na * ma)

# The final answer is constructed in the format x:y:z:t.
# The numbers in the final equation (na, ma, and the result t) have been calculated above.
