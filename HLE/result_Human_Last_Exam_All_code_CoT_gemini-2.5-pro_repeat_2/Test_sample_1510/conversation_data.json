    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Point Groups of Order 2:** First, I'll identify the crystallographic point groups in two dimensions that have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of its symmetry operations. A point group of order 2 contains the identity operation and one other symmetry operation (either a 2-fold rotation or a reflection). These point groups are **C2** (2-fold rotation) and **Cm** (reflection).\n2.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to Point Groups:** I will create a data structure containing all 17 wallpaper groups, mapping each to its corresponding point group and the order of that point group.\n3.  **Filter and Count:** The script will then iterate through this data, filtering for wallpaper groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n4.  **Display Results:** Finally, the script will print the names of the identified wallpaper groups, show how the total count is derived by summing the counts for each type of point group (C2 and Cm), and display the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds and counts the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its point group and the order of that point group.\n    wallpaper_groups_info = {\n        # Group Name: (Point Group Symbol, Point Group Order)\n        \"p1\":   (\"C1\", 1),\n        \"p2\":   (\"C2\", 2), # Has a point group of order 2\n        \"pm\":   (\"Cm\", 2), # Has a point group of order 2\n        \"pg\":   (\"Cm\", 2), # Has a point group of order 2\n        \"cm\":   (\"Cm\", 2), # Has a point group of order 2\n        \"p2mm\": (\"D2\", 4),\n        \"p2mg\": (\"D2\", 4),\n        \"p2gg\": (\"D2\", 4),\n        \"c2mm\": (\"D2\", 4),\n        \"p4\":   (\"C4\", 4),\n        \"p4mm\": (\"D4\", 8),\n        \"p4gm\": (\"D4\", 8),\n        \"p3\":   (\"C3\", 3),\n        \"p3m1\": (\"D3\", 6),\n        \"p31m\": (\"D3\", 6),\n        \"p6\":   (\"C6\", 6),\n        \"p6mm\": (\"D6\", 12),\n    }\n\n    # Find the groups with point group of order 2\n    groups_with_c2 = []\n    groups_with_cm = []\n\n    for group_name, (point_group, order) in wallpaper_groups_info.items():\n        if order == 2:\n            if point_group == \"C2\":\n                groups_with_c2.append(group_name)\n            elif point_group == \"Cm\":\n                groups_with_cm.append(group_name)\n\n    count_c2 = len(groups_with_c2)\n    count_cm = len(groups_with_cm)\n    total_count = count_c2 + count_cm\n\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are C2 (2-fold rotation) and Cm (reflection).\")\n    print(\"\\nWallpaper groups with point group C2:\")\n    for group in groups_with_c2:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Count: {count_c2}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nWallpaper groups with point group Cm:\")\n    for group in groups_with_cm:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Count: {count_cm}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we sum the counts:\")\n    print(f\"{count_c2} (for C2) + {count_cm} (for Cm) = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_question()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
