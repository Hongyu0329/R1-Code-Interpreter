After one step, the cycle is broken into a set of disjoint paths. With high probability (1-1/n), the longest of these paths has a length of O(log n). The algorithm then needs to run on these paths. The runtime for a path of length k is O(log k). Therefore, the total runtime is dominated by the time on the longest path, which is O(log(O(log n))) = O(log log n). This is known to be a tight bound.

A simple path is a tree with degree at most 2. It is a known result that this algorithm's runtime on a path of length n is Θ(log n). Since a path is a tree, the complexity for arbitrary trees is at least Ω(log n). Thus, the complexity is Θ(log n), which corresponds to category 9."""

This guarantees that the number of vertices decreases exponentially in expectation, leading to an O(log n) runtime with high probability. This bound is known to be tight, as there are bounded-degree graphs (like expanders or random regular graphs) for which the algorithm requires Ω(log n) steps. Therefore, the complexity is Θ(log n), corresponding to category 9."""
