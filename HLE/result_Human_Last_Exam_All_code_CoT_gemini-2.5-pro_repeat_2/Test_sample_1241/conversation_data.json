    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the stationary probabilities of the system. At steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we denote as $P_i$. This implies that their time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero.\n\nThe given system of differential equations thus transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (This is the normalization condition, as the sum of probabilities must be 1).\n\nWe can solve this system by expressing $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$ and then using the normalization condition to find the value of $P_1$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the Python code:\n1.  Define the given rate constants $\\lambda_{ij}$.\n2.  From equation (1), express $P_0$ as a function of $P_1$: $P_0 = (\\lambda_{10} / \\lambda_{01}) P_1$.\n3.  From equation (3), express $P_2$ as a function of $P_1$: $P_2 = (\\lambda_{12} / (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})) P_1$.\n4.  From equation (4), express $P_3$ as a function of $P_2$: $P_3 = (\\lambda_{23} / \\lambda_{31}) P_2$. Then substitute the expression for $P_2$ to get $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n5.  Substitute the expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ into the normalization equation (5).\n6.  Solve the normalization equation for $P_1$.\n7.  Calculate the numerical value of $P_0$ using the value of $P_1$.\n8.  Finally, compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$ and print the result along with the values of $P_0$ and $P_1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_markov_chain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the stationary probabilities of the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system\n    and calculates the sum P0 + P1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state (t -> infinity), P_i'(t) = 0.\n    # The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear equations.\n    # We will express P0, P2, and P3 in terms of P1.\n\n    # From -l_01*P0 + l_10*P1 = 0\n    # P0 = (l_10 / l_01) * P1\n    coeff_P0_wrt_P1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n    # From l_12*P1 - (l_21 + l_23)*P2 = 0\n    # P2 = (l_12 / (l_21 + l_23)) * P1\n    coeff_P2_wrt_P1 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n    # From l_23*P2 - l_31*P3 = 0\n    # P3 = (l_23 / l_31) * P2\n    # Substitute P2 in terms of P1\n    # P3 = (l_23 / l_31) * coeff_P2_wrt_P1 * P1\n    coeff_P3_wrt_P1 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_P2_wrt_P1\n\n    # The normalization condition is P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1.\n    # Substitute the expressions in terms of P1:\n    # (coeff_P0_wrt_P1 * P1) + P1 + (coeff_P2_wrt_P1 * P1) + (coeff_P3_wrt_P1 * P1) = 1\n    # P1 * (coeff_P0_wrt_P1 + 1 + coeff_P2_wrt_P1 + coeff_P3_wrt_P1) = 1\n    \n    total_coeff_P1 = coeff_P0_wrt_P1 + 1 + coeff_P2_wrt_P1 + coeff_P3_wrt_P1\n    \n    # Solve for P1\n    P1 = 1 / total_coeff_P1\n    \n    # Calculate P0\n    P0 = coeff_P0_wrt_P1 * P1\n\n    # The desired result is the sum of P0 and P1\n    result = P0 + P1\n\n    # Print the final equation with the calculated values\n    print(f\"The stationary probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) = {P0}\")\n    print(f\"P1(inf) = {P1}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {P0} + {P1} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_markov_chain()\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339464>>>"
