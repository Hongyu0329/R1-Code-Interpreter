    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, we need to compare the distances from Waskaganish to the borders of its neighboring regions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the location of Waskaganish, Quebec:** It is located on the southeast coast of James Bay. We will use its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n2.  **Identify the nearest points in neighboring provinces/territories:**\n    *   **Ontario:** The Ontario-Quebec border is a land border that meets the James Bay coast just west of Waskaganish. We will use the coordinates of a point on the coast just on the Ontario side of the border.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut to Waskaganish is the collection of islands within James Bay. We will find the coordinates of the southernmost island belonging to Nunavut, which is South Twin Island.\n3.  **Calculate the distances:** We will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.\n4.  **Compare the distances:** The province or territory with the shortest calculated distance will be the closest.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the distance between two points on Earth using the Haversine formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 6371  # Radius of Earth in kilometers\n    \n    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n    \n    # Difference in coordinates\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    \n    # Haversine formula\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    \n    distance = R * c\n    return distance\n\n# Coordinates for the locations\n# 1. Waskaganish Gathering Place, Quebec\nwaskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.1944, -78.7606\n\n# 2. Closest point in Ontario (on the James Bay coast, just across the provincial border)\nontario_border_lat, ontario_border_lon = 51.20, -79.52\n\n# 3.
