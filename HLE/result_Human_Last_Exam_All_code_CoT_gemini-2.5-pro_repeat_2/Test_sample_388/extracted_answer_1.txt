Hello Allison. I see you're picking up your Fluoxetine. I wanted to let you know that taking Excedrin with Fluoxetine can increase your risk for stomach bleeding. This is because the aspirin in Excedrin and the Fluoxetine both affect your body's ability to form clots. For future headaches, a safer choice would be a product with just acetaminophen, like Tylenol. If your headaches persist, you should let your doctor know.
