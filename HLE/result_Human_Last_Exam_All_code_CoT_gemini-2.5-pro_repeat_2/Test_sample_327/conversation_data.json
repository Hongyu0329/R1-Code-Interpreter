    "To find the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find its canonical representation as a sum of powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$. This is equivalent to finding the sequence of red (positive) and blue (negative) pieces in a stack that sum to the given value.\n\nWe can determine this sequence using a greedy algorithm:\n1.  Start with the target value $V = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  The first piece has a value of $\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $V > 0$, the first piece is red, and its value is $+\\frac{1}{2}$. The remaining value to represent is $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n3.  The second piece has a value of $\\pm\\frac{1}{4}$. Since the remaining value $\\frac{5}{16}$ is positive, the second piece is red, and its value is $+\\frac{1}{4}$. The new remainder is $\\frac{5}{16} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n4.  The third piece has a value of $\\pm\\frac{1}{8}$. Since the remaining value $\\frac{1}{16}$ is positive, the third piece is red, and its value is $+\\frac{1}{8}$. The new remainder is $\\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{2}{16} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\n5.  The fourth piece has a value of $\\pm\\frac{1}{16}$. Since the remaining value $-\\frac{1}{16}$ is negative, the fourth piece is blue, and its value is $-\\frac{1}{16}$. The new remainder is $-\\frac{1}{16} - (-\\frac{1}{16}) = 0$.\n\nThe process terminates as the remainder is now zero. The sequence of pieces is Red, Red, Red, Blue. This corresponds to the sum $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe total number of pieces in this canonical representation is 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm to find the representation and count the pieces.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_hackenbush():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a fraction in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    target_value = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n    remaining_value = target_value\n    \n    terms = []\n    piece_val_denom = 2\n\n    # Loop until the value is fully represented\n    while remaining_value != 0:\n        current_piece = Fraction(1, piece_val_denom)\n        \n        # If remaining value is positive, the next piece is Red\n        if remaining_value > 0:\n            terms.append(current_piece)\n            remaining_value -= current_piece\n        # If remaining value is negative, the next piece is Blue\n        else:\n            terms.append(-current_piece)\n            remaining_value += current_piece\n        \n        # The next piece's value is halved\n        piece_val_denom *= 2\n    \n    # Build the equation string\n    equation_str = f\"{target_value} = \"\n    for i, term in enumerate(terms):\n        if i > 0:\n            if term > 0:\n                equation_str += \"+ \"\n            else:\n                equation_str += \"- \"\n        \n        if term < 0:\n            equation_str += f\"1/{abs(term.denominator)} \"\n        else:\n            equation_str += f\"1/{term.denominator} \"\n\n    # Remove trailing space and print the equation\n    print(equation_str.strip())\n    \n    # Print the total number of pieces\n    num_pieces = len(terms)\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of pieces needed is: {num_pieces}\")\n\nsolve_hackenbush()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
