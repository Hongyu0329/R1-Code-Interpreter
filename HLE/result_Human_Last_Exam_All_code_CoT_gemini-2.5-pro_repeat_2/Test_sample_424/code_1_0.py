# The problem asks for the number of special points on a planar figure.
# Based on the analysis, these points are the endpoints of the line segments
# that are not connected to other parts of the figure. These are often called
# "dangling" or "leaf" nodes in a graph representation.

# Let's list the endpoints of the segments and determine which ones are dangling.

# Segment L1: {0} x [1/2, 3/2]. Endpoints: (0, 1/2), (0, 3/2).
# This segment connects to the unit circle at (0,1).
# Both endpoints (0, 1/2) and (0, 3/2) are dangling.

# Segment L2: [1/2, 3/2] x {0}. Endpoints: (1/2, 0), (3/2, 0).
# This segment connects to the unit circle at (1,0).
# The point (3/2, 0) connects to the quarter circle C_{3/2}.
# The endpoint (1/2, 0) is dangling.
L2_dangling_points = [(0.5, 0)]

# Segment L3: [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}. Endpoints: (-3/2, 0), (-1/2, 0).
# This segment connects to the unit circle at (-1,0).
# Both endpoints (-3/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0) are dangling.
L3_dangling_points = [(-1.5, 0), (-0.5, 0)]

# Segment L4: {0} x [-3/2, -1/2]. Endpoints: (0, -3/2), (0, -1/2).
# This segment connects to the unit circle at (0,-1).
# The point (0, -3/2) connects to the quarter circle C_{3/2}.
# The endpoint (0, -1/2) is dangling.
L4_dangling_points = [(0, -0.5)]

# Segment L5: [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}. Endpoints: (-1/2, 1), (1/2, 1).
# This segment connects to the unit circle at (0,1).
# Both endpoints (-1/2, 1) and (1/2, 1) are dangling.
