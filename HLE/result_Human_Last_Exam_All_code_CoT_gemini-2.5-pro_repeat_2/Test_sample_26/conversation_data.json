    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use tools from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Properties of X:** $X$ is a smooth complex surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d=5$. The complex dimension of $X$ is $n-1 = 3-1=2$. The real dimension is 4.\n\n2.  **Relate Homotopy to a Simpler Space:** We can relate the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of its pullback $\\tilde{X}$ to the universal cover of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The universal cover of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the 7-sphere $S^7$, and the covering map $p: S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the Hopf fibration.\n    Let $\\tilde{X} = p^{-1}(X)$. The restriction of $p$ to $\\tilde{X}$ gives a principal $S^1$-fibration $S^1 \\to \\tilde{X} \\to X$. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration implies that $\\pi_k(\\tilde{X}) \\cong \\pi_k(X)$ for $k \\ge 3$, since $\\pi_k(S^1)=0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Thus, we need to find the rank of $\\pi_3(\\tilde{X})$.\n\n3.  **Use Hurewicz Theorem:** The space $\\tilde{X}$ is the intersection of the cone over $X$ in $\\mathbb{C}^4$ with the sphere $S^7$. For a hypersurface defined by a polynomial with an isolated singularity at the origin (which a smooth projective hypersurface corresponds to), a theorem by Milnor states that this space (the link of the singularity) is highly connected. Specifically, for a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, the link is $(n-2)$-connected. Here, $n=4$, so $\\tilde{X}$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected. This means $\\pi_1(\\tilde{X})=0$ and $\\pi_2(\\tilde{X})=0$.\n    For a 2-connected space, the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_3(\\tilde{X}) \\cong H_3(\\tilde{X})$. So, our problem reduces to calculating the rank of the third homology group of $\\tilde{X}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Homology using Spectral Sequence:** We can compute $H_3(\\tilde{X})$ using the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $S^1 \\to \\tilde{X} \\to X$. A key result from this analysis is that $H_3(\\tilde{X})$ is isomorphic to the primitive part of the second homology group of $X$, i.e., $H_3(\\tilde{X}) \\cong H_2(X)_{\\text{prim}}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Betti Numbers of X:** The rank of $H_2(X)_{\\text{prim}}$ is $b_2(X) - 1$. We can find the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$, using the formula for the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.\n    *   $\\chi(X) = \\frac{(1-d)^{n+1}-1}{d} + n+1$\n    *   By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the Betti numbers of $X$ are the same as those of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ except for the middle one ($b_2$). So, $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is also given by $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    *   We can solve for $b_2$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ will be $b_2(X) - 1$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for the smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3\nd = 5  # degree of the hypersurface\nn = 3  # dimension of the ambient projective space CP^n\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristic of X\n# The formula for the Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n is:\n# chi(X) = ((1-d)^(n+1) - 1) / d + (n+1)\neuler_characteristic = ((1 - d)**(n + 1) - 1) // d + (n + 1)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the Betti numbers of X\n# For a smooth hypersurface X of dimension m=n-1 in CP^n, the Lefschetz hyperplane\n# theorem implies that b_i(X) = b_i(CP^m) for i != m.\n# Here m = 2. The Betti numbers for CP^2 are b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1.\nb0 = 1\nb1 = 0\nb3 = 0\nb4 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Use the Euler characteristic to find the second Betti number b_2\n# chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4\n# b2 = chi(X) - (b0 - b1 - b3 + b4)\nb2 = euler_characteristic - (b0 - b1 + b3 + b4)\n\n# Step 4: Relate pi_3(X) to the homology of X\n# The problem of finding rank(pi_3(X)) can be reduced to a homology calculation.\n# A key result is that rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(H_2(X)_prim), the rank of the\n# primitive part of the second homology group of X.\n# The rank of the primitive homology is b_2(X) - 1.\nrank_pi3 = b2 - 1\n\n# Output the final calculation step-by-step\nprint(f\"The degree of the hypersurface X is d = {d}.\")\nprint(f\"The dimension of the ambient space CP^n is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The Euler characteristic of X is calculated as chi(X) = ((1-{d})^({n}+1) - 1) / {d} + ({n}+1) = {euler_characteristic}.\")\nprint(f\"The known Betti numbers of X are b0={b0}, b1={b1}, b3={b3}, b4={b4}.\")\nprint(f\"From the Euler characteristic formula, chi(X) = {b0} - {b1} + b2 - {b3} + {b4}, we solve for b2.\")\nprint(f\"So, {euler_characteristic} = {b0 - b1 + b3 + b4} + b2, which gives b2 = {b2}.\")\nprint(\"The rank of the third homotopy group, pi_3(X), is the rank of the primitive second homology group of X.\")\nprint(f\"This is given by rank(pi_3(X)) = b2(X) - 1 = {b2} - 1 = {rank_pi3}.\")\n\n```\n<<<52>>>"
