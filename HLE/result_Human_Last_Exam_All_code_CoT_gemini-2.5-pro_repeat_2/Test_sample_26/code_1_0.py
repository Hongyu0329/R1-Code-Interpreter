# Parameters for the smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3
d = 5  # degree of the hypersurface
n = 3  # dimension of the ambient projective space CP^n

# Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristic of X
# The formula for the Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n is:
# chi(X) = ((1-d)^(n+1) - 1) / d + (n+1)
euler_characteristic = ((1 - d)**(n + 1) - 1) // d + (n + 1)

# Step 2: Determine the Betti numbers of X
# For a smooth hypersurface X of dimension m=n-1 in CP^n, the Lefschetz hyperplane
# theorem implies that b_i(X) = b_i(CP^m) for i != m.
# Here m = 2. The Betti numbers for CP^2 are b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1.
b0 = 1
b1 = 0
b3 = 0
b4 = 1

# Step 3: Use the Euler characteristic to find the second Betti number b_2
# chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4
# b2 = chi(X) - (b0 - b1 - b3 + b4)
b2 = euler_characteristic - (b0 - b1 + b3 + b4)

# Step 4: Relate pi_3(X) to the homology of X
# The problem of finding rank(pi_3(X)) can be reduced to a homology calculation.
# A key result is that rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(H_2(X)_prim), the rank of the
# primitive part of the second homology group of X.
# The rank of the primitive homology is b_2(X) - 1.
rank_pi3 = b2 - 1

# Output the final calculation step-by-step
