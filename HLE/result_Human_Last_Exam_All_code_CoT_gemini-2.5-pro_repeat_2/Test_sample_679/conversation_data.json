    "Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula $C_7H_{14}$ corresponds to the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$. I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine if the compound contains a double bond or a ring.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal. The chemical shift (e.g., 145 ppm) indicates the electronic environment of the carbon (alkene vs. alkane), and the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) tells how many hydrogen atoms are directly attached to that carbon (s=0H, t=2H, d=1H, q=3H).\n3.  **Reconcile Data**: I will compare the number of carbons and hydrogens from the NMR data with the molecular formula. The formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 signals, which implies that two carbons are chemically equivalent and share the same signal. I'll also check the hydrogen count to confirm this.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: Based on the identified carbon fragments (e.g., a `>C=CHâ‚‚` group, a `CH` group, etc.), I will piece them together like a puzzle to form a single, valid chemical structure that fits all the data.\n5.  **Determine IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is determined, I will name it according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that prints out this entire logical deduction step-by-step, including the assignment of each NMR signal to a specific carbon in the final structure, and then prints the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon from its molecular formula\n    and 13C NMR data by following a step-by-step chemical analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        \"145\": \"s (quaternary C)\",\n        \"112\": \"t (CH2)\",\n        \"48\": \"t (CH2)\",\n        \"27\": \"d (CH)\",\n        \"22\": \"q (CH3)\",\n        \"21\": \"q (CH3)\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    # Degree of Unsaturation for CxHy = x - y/2 + 1\n    # For C7H14, DoU = 7 - 14/2 + 1 = 1\n    print(\"The Degree of Unsaturation is 1.
