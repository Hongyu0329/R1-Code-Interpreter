    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point, where the supply and demand curves intersect. Then, we will calculate the consumer and producer surplus at this equilibrium. The total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions**: Represent the given equations in code.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The equilibrium point (Q_e, P_e) is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D) and the price is the same for both. We'll find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e` by numerically solving the equation `Demand(Q) = Supply(Q)`. Once `Q_e` is found, we can calculate the equilibrium price `P_e` by substituting `Q_e` into either function.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)**: This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, from Q=0 to Q=Q_e. It's calculated as:\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)`\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)**: This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line. Note that the supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integration for producer surplus starts from this minimum quantity. It's calculated as:\n    `PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: This is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n    `Total Welfare = CS + PS`\n\nWe will use the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand(Q):\n    \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\ndef supply(Q):\n    \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0.\n    # We handle the domain for the numerical integrator.\n    return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    \"\"\"Equation to find equilibrium, where Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0.\"\"\"\n    # We need to handle the domain of the supply function for the solver.\n    # If Q is outside the domain, return a large value to push the solver away.\n    if Q**3 - 2 <= 0:\n        return 1e10\n    return demand(Q) - supply(Q)\n\n# The supply function is defined for Q > 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.\n# We'll use an initial guess greater than this, e.g., 4.0.\ninitial_guess_Q = 4.0\nQ_e = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_Q)[0]\nP_e = demand(Q_e)\n\nprint(\"--- Market Equilibrium ---\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium quantity (Q_e) is: {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium price (P_e) is: {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)\n# CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)\nintegral_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_e)\nconsumer_surplus = integral_demand - (P_e * Q_e)\n\nprint(\"--- Consumer Surplus (CS) Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Integral of Demand from 0 to {Q_e:.4f} = {integral_demand:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Market Revenue (P_e * Q_e) = {P_e * Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Consumer Surplus = {integral_demand:.4f} - {P_e * Q_e:.4f} = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)\n# The supply curve is only defined for Q > 2^(1/3).
