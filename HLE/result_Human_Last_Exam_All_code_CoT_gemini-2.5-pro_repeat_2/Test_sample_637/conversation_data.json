    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error `e(k)` converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Observer Dynamics**: The observer estimates the state `x(k)` with `x_hat(k)`. The dynamics of the estimation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` are given by `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\n2.  **Deadbeat Condition**: For the error to become zero in a finite number of steps (deadbeat response), the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent. This means all of its eigenvalues must be zero. Our goal is to place all four eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` at the origin of the complex plane.\n3.  **Duality Principle**: The problem of finding the observer gain `L` to place the poles (eigenvalues) of `(A - LC)` at desired locations is dual to the problem of finding a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the dual system defined by `(A^T, C^T)`. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A^T - C^T L^T)`.\n4.  **Pole Placement for the Dual System**: We will design a state-feedback controller `K` for the dual system `x_d(k+1) = A^T x_d(k) + C^T u_d(k)` that places the closed-loop poles of `(A^T - C^T K)` at `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The observer gain `L` is then simply the transpose of this controller gain, i.e., `L = K^T`.\n5.  **Implementation**: We will use Python with the `numpy` and `scipy` libraries. The `scipy.signal.place_poles` function is ideal for solving the pole placement problem for the dual system. The function will compute the required gain `K`, from which we'll get `L`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\ndef solve_deadbeat_observer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for a given discrete-time system.\n\n    The observer gain L is calculated such that all eigenvalues of (A - LC) are zero,\n    ensuring the observation error converges to zero in a finite number of steps.\n    This is achieved by solving the dual pole placement problem for the system (A^T, C^T).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # The dimension of the state space (n)\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all eigenvalues of (A - LC) should be at the origin.\n    # These are the desired poles for the observer error dynamics.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # We solve the dual problem: find a controller gain K for the system (A^T, C^T)\n    # such that the poles of (A^T - C^T K) are at the desired locations.\n    # The scipy.signal.place_poles function can compute this gain K.\n    # The observer gain L is then the transpose of K.\n    \n    # The dual system matrices are A.T and C.T\n    A_dual = A.T\n    B_dual = C.T # This is the \"B\" matrix for the dual control problem\n\n    # Use place_poles to find the state-feedback gain K for the dual system\n    # The function returns a full result object, from which we extract the gain matrix.\n    placement_result = signal.place_poles(A_dual, B_dual, desired_poles)\n    K = placement_result.gain_matrix\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of K\n    L = K.T\n\n    # Print the resulting observer gain matrix L\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\n    # Optional: Verify the eigenvalues of (A - LC) are at the origin\n    # A_cl = A - L @ C\n    # eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: Eigenvalues of (A - LC):\")\n    # print(eigenvalues)\n\n\nsolve_deadbeat_observer()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\ndef solve_deadbeat_observer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for a given discrete-time system.\n\n    The observer gain L is calculated such that all eigenvalues of (A - LC) are zero,\n    ensuring the observation error converges to zero in a finite number of steps.\n    This is achieved by solving the dual pole placement problem for the system (A^T, C^T).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # The dimension of the state space (n)\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all eigenvalues of (A - LC) should be at the origin.\n    # These are the desired poles for the observer error dynamics.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # We solve the dual problem: find a controller gain K for the system (A^T, C^T)\n    # such that the poles of (A^T - C^T K) are at the desired locations.\n    # The scipy.signal.place_poles function can compute this gain K.\n    # The observer gain L is then the transpose of K.\n    \n    # The dual system matrices are A.T and C.T\n    A_dual = A.T\n    B_dual = C.T # This is the \"B\" matrix for the dual control problem\n\n    # Use place_poles to find the state-feedback gain K for the dual system\n    # The function returns a full result object, from which we extract the gain matrix.\n    placement_result = signal.place_poles(A_dual, B_dual, desired_poles)\n    K = placement_result.gain_matrix\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of K\n    L = K.T\n\n    # Print the resulting observer gain matrix L\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\nsolve_deadbeat_observer()\n```\n>>>"
