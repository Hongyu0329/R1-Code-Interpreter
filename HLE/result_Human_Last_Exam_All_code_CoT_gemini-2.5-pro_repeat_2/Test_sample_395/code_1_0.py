# Define the parameters from the problem statement
n = 2024  # Number of sets
k = 45    # Size of each set

# The problem asks for the smallest possible value of the union of these sets.
# As explained in the reasoning, a possible construction that satisfies the
# conditions is the "central point" model.
# In this model, there is one element common to all sets.
# Each set A_i is composed of this central element and k-1 other elements
# that are unique to A_i.

# Let's calculate the size of the union for this construction.
# The total number of elements is the single central element plus the sum of
# the unique elements from all n sets.
# Number of unique elements in each set (besides the central one) is k - 1.
num_unique_elements_per_set = k - 1

# Total number of unique elements across all n sets
total_unique_elements = n * num_unique_elements_per_set

# The size of the union is the central element (1) + total unique elements.
min_union_size = 1 + total_unique_elements

# Print the final equation with the numbers
print(f"The equation for the smallest possible value is: 1 + {n} * ({k} - 1)")
print(f"The calculation is: 1 + {n} * {num_unique_elements_per_set}")
print(f"Step by step: 1 + {total_unique_elements}")
