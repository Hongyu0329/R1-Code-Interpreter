    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the stability region of the scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the stability function**: The stability of a linear multistep method is analyzed by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a characteristic equation whose roots must be within the unit disk for stability. The boundary of the stability region is given by a function $z(\\theta)$ where $z=h\\lambda$. For the BDF4 method, the stability boundary in the complex plane is given by the function:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n\n2.  **Find the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability**: A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha\\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the point on the stability boundary $z(\\theta)$ that is tangent to a ray from the origin. This corresponds to the point where the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is maximum (since the stability region is in the left half-plane). We need to find $\\phi_{max} = \\max_{\\theta} \\arg(z(\\theta))$ for $z(\\theta)$ in the left half-plane. Then, the stability angle is $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{max}$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the extremal angle**: The condition for the extremum of $\\arg(z(\\theta))$ is $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\arg(z(\\theta)) = 0$. This leads to a complicated trigonometric equation. A known result from the literature (Cryer, 1972) suggests that the solution occurs at a value of $\\theta$ that is a root of a specific polynomial. While sources vary, a plausible path to an exact answer relates the solution to $\\cos(\\theta)=1/3$, which can be derived from the condition $\\tan^2(\\theta/2) = 1/2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the exact value**: We will assume $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/3$ and compute the corresponding value of $z(\\theta) = x+iy$. The tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ will then be given by $\\tan(\\alpha) = -y/x$. We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations and obtain the exact expression for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact value for the A(alpha)-stability angle of the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let c = cos(theta).
