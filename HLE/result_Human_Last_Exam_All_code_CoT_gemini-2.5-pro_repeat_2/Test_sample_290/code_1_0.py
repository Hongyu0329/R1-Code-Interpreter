    # Step 1: Define the given parameters of the problem.

    # The points of S lie on a circle. A straight line can intersect a circle at most twice.

    # Step 3: Explain the reasoning.
    # The problem states we can get from any point in T to any other point in T
    # using at most 2 of the 9 lines. This implies that any two lines that contain
    # points from T must intersect. In a 2D plane, a set of lines that are
    # pairwise intersecting must be concurrent (all pass through a single point).
    # To maximize n (the number of points on the circle), we should use all 9 lines.
    # These 9 concurrent lines can intersect the circle at a maximum of two points each.
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the maximum value of n.
    max_n = num_lines * max_points_per_line

    # Step 5: Output the components of the final equation and the result.
    # This construction is valid. For example, if the 9 lines are all diameters
    # of the circle, they all pass through the center O. They intersect the circle
    # at 18 distinct points. The connectivity condition is satisfied for all 19 points in T.
