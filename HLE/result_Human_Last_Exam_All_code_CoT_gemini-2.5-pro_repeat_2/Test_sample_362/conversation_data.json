    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** I will first identify the two reactants involved in the Wittig reaction: the carbonyl compound (pivalaldehyde) and the phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:** The Wittig reaction involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n3.  **Construct the Product:** I will combine the tert-butyl carbaldehyde fragment `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` with the alkylidene fragment from the ylide, which is `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`.\n4.  **Determine Stereochemistry:** I will classify the ylide as \"non-stabilized\" because the carbon atom of the ylide is not attached to any electron-withdrawing groups. Non-stabilized ylides predominantly form the Z-alkene (cis isomer) under standard conditions.\n5.  **Generate the Final Answer:** I will write a Python script that defines the reactants, constructs the product, determines the stereochemistry, and prints the full reaction equation along with the IUPAC name of the major product. The script will also explicitly list the numerical locants in the product's name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the product of a Wittig reaction and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
