    "Here is a thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a, b, c)`:**\n    The recurrence relation `f(a, b, c) = f(a-1, b, c) + f(a, b-2, c) + f(a, b, c-3)` with the base case `f(0, 0, 0) = 1` suggests that `f(a, b, c)` counts the number of ways to reach the point `(a, b, c)` starting from `(0, 0, 0)` using steps of `(+1, 0, 0)`, `(0, +2, 0)`, and `(0, 0, +3)`.\n    This is a classic combinatorial problem. If we take `n_1` steps of the first kind, `n_2` of the second, and `n_3` of the third, we must have:\n    `n_1 = a`\n    `2 * n_2 = b`\n    `3 * n_3 = c`\n    This implies that `f(a, b, c)` is non-zero only if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3. In that case, `n_1 = a`, `n_2 = b/2`, and `n_3 = c/3`. The total number of ways is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    `f(a, b, c) = (n_1 + n_2 + n_3)! / (n_1! * n_2! * n_3!) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the parameters `α_p, β_p, γ_p`:**\n    We are given `a = α_p`, `b = β_p`, `c = γ_p`. Let's check the conditions for `f` to be non-zero.\n    `β_p = Σ(8p^{3i} + ...)` is a sum of even terms, so `β_p` is even.\n    `γ_p = Σ(3p^{3i} + ...)` is a sum of multiples of 3, so `γ_p` is a multiple of 3.\n    The conditions are met.\n    A key observation is the relationship between `γ_p` and `α_p`:\n    `γ_p = Σ(3p^{3i} + 9p^{3i+1} + 12p^{3i+2}) = 3 * Σ(p^{3i} + 3p^{3i+1} + 4p^{3i+2}) = 3 * α_p`.\n    So, `c = 3a`, which means `c/3 = a`.\n\n3.  **Simplify `f(a, b, c)`:**\n    Substituting `c/3 = a` into the formula for `f`:\n    Let `A = a = α_p` and `B = b/2 = β_p/2`.\n    `f(α_p, β_p, γ_p) = (A + B + A)! / (A! * B! * A!) = (2A + B)! / (A!^2 * B!)`.\n    This is the multinomial coefficient `C(2A + B; A, A, B)`.\n\n4.  **Compute the value modulo `p` using Lucas's Theorem:**\n    Lucas's Theorem can be extended to multinomial coefficients. To use it, we need the base-`p` expansions of `A`, `B`, and `2A+B`.\n    The definition of `α_p` and `β_p` are essentially base-`p` expansions. Let `A_j` be the `j`-th digit of `A` in base `p`.\n    From `A = α_p = Σ(1*p^{3i} + 3*p^{3i+1} + 4*p^{3i+2})`, the digits `A_j` follow a cycle: `A_{3i}=1, A_{3i+1}=3, A_{3i+2}=4`.\n    From `B = β_p/2 = Σ(4*p^{3i} + 2*p^{3i+1} + 2*p^{3i+2})`, the digits `B_j` follow a cycle: `B_{3i}=4, B_{3i+1}=2, B_{3i+2}=2`.\n    Since `p = 2^{127}-1` is very large, these coefficients are valid digits. There are no carries when computing `2A` or `2A+B`.\n    The digits of `2A+B` are `(2A_j+B_j)`.\n    `f(a,b,c) \\pmod p \\equiv \\prod_{j=0}^{\\text{max_deg}} C((2A+B)_j; A_j, A_j, B_j) \\pmod p`.\n    The term for each `j` is `((2A_j+B_j)!) / (A_j! A_j! B_j!)`. Let's compute this for one cycle `(j=3i, 3i+1, 3i+2)`:\n    -   `j=3i`: `C(2*1+4; 1, 1, 4) = C(6; 1, 1, 4) = 6!/(1!1!4!) = 30`.\n    -   `j=3i+1`: `C(2*3+2; 3, 3, 2) = C(8; 3, 3, 2) = 8!/(3!3!2!) = 560`.\n    -   `j=3i+2`: `C(2*4+2; 4, 4, 2) = C(10; 4, 4, 2) = 10!/(4!4!2!) = 3150`.\n    The product of these values is `X = 30 * 560 * 3150 = 52,920,000`.\n\n5.  **Determine the number of cycles:**\n    The sum is over `i` from `0` to `S_p = (3p-1)/2`. The number of `i` values is `S_p+1 = (3p+1)/2`. This is the number of times the cycle product `X` is repeated.\n    So, `f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^{S_p+1} \\equiv X^{(3p+1)/2} \\pmod p`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the exponentiation:**\n    We use Fermat's Little Theorem (`x^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p`).\n    The exponent is `E = (3p+1)/2 = (3(p-1)+4)/2 = 3(p-1)/2 + 2`.\n    `X^E = X^{3(p-1)/2 + 2} = X^2 * (X^{(p-1)/2})^3 \\pmod p`.\n    The term `X^{(p-1)/2}` is congruent to the Legendre symbol `(X/p)`.\n    `X = 52,920,000 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2`.\n    `(X/p) = (2^6/p)(3^3/p)(5^4/p)(7^2/p)`. Since squares are quadratic residues, this simplifies to `(3/p)`.\n    Using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity for `p=2^{127}-1` and `q=3`:\n    `(3/p) = (p/3) * (-1)^{((p-1)/2)((3-1)/2)}`.\n    -   `(p-1)/2 = 2^{126}-1` is odd. `(3-1)/2=1` is odd. So the exponent on `-1` is odd.\n    -   `p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 = -1-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. So `(p/3) = (1/3) = 1`.\n    -   Therefore, `(3/p) = 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n    Substituting back: `X^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p`.\n    `f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^2 * (-1)^3 = -X^2 \\pmod p`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The result is `p - (X^2 \\pmod p)`. Since `X^2` is much smaller than `p`, this is simply `p - X^2`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final value.\n\n```python\n# The Mersenne prime p = 2^127 - 1\np = (2**127) - 1\n\n# As derived in the explanation, the problem simplifies to calculating a value X,\n# which is a product of multinomial coefficients from the repeating digits in the\n# base-p expansion of the arguments to the function f.\n# The repeating cycle of digits gives the factors:\n# C(6; 1, 1, 4) = 30\n# C(8; 3, 3, 2) = 560\n# C(10; 4, 4, 2) = 3150\n# X is the product of these factors.\nX = 30 * 560 * 3150\n\n# The final result modulo p is congruent to -X^2 mod p.\nX_squared = X**2\n\n# The value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p is (p - X^2)\n# because X^2 is smaller than p.\nresult = p - X_squared\n\n# Per the instructions, we output each number in the final equation.\n# The final equation is: result = p - X^2\nprint(f\"The value of p is: {p}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value of X is: {X}\")\nprint(f\"The value of X^2 is: {X_squared}\")\nprint(f\"The final result f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p is p - X^2 = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<170141183460469231731687303713083579327>>>"
