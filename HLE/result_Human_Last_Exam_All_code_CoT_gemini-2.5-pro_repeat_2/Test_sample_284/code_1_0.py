# This script calculates the largest possible value of p based on a known theorem in harmonic analysis.

# The dimension of the space, R^n, is 3.
n = 3

# The critical exponent for the moment curve in R^n is given by the formula:
# p = n * (n + 1) / 2
# For p values up to this critical exponent, the property holds.
# We need to calculate this value for n=3.

p_critical = n * (n + 1) / 2

# We will now print the steps of the calculation as requested.
