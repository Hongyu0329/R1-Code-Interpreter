    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs analyzed with graph theory algorithms.
    B. Correct. The state explosion problem leads to exponential growth in the worst case.
    C. Incorrect. The attack graph generation/reachability problem is generally considered PSPACE-complete, not NP-hard. While PSPACE-complete problems are at least as hard as NP-hard ones, they are in a different, and likely larger, complexity class. This statement is technically inaccurate.
    D. Correct. Systems are dynamic, requiring incremental updates for attack graphs.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs are used for formal verification of security properties via methods like model checking.

    The only incorrect statement is C.
