# Plan:
# 1. Define the depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree.
# 2. The structure of an HSS matrix is a full binary tree. We calculate the total number of nodes in this tree.
# 3. The number of nodes at a given level 'd' in a full binary tree is 2^d.
# 4. We sum the number of nodes from the root (level 0) to the given depth.
# 5. This sum gives the total number of submatrices in a single HSS matrix structure.
# 6. For a matrix multiplication C = A * B, the algorithm accesses the corresponding submatrix from both A and B for each node.
# 7. Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is twice the number of nodes in a single tree.

# The depth of the tree (D). A tree with depth 4 has levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
depth = 4

# Calculate the number of nodes in one HSS tree.
# The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at each level (2^level).
levels = list(range(depth + 1))
nodes_per_level = [2**level for level in levels]
total_nodes_one_tree = sum(nodes_per_level)

# For a matrix multiplication A * B, we access the submatrices for both A and B.
num_matrices = 2
total_accessed_submatrices = num_matrices * total_nodes_one_tree

# Print the explanation and the calculation.
