# This problem is a theoretical question in modal logic.
# A direct computation is not feasible, but we can represent the logical conclusion programmatically.
# The analysis is as follows:
#
# 1. Define the formulas:
#    - Barcan Formula (BF): □∃x φ(x) → ∃x □φ(x)
#    - Converse Barcan Formula (CBF): ∃x □φ(x) → □∃x φ(x)
#
# 2. Define the condition: Decreasing domains.
#    - If world v is accessible from w, Domain(v) is a subset of Domain(w).
#
# 3. Analyze CBF:
#    - Assume the premise is true: There is an individual 'c' in the current world that
#      exists and has property φ in ALL accessible worlds.
#    - This directly implies the conclusion: In ALL accessible worlds, there exists
#      SOME individual (namely 'c') with property φ.
#    - Conclusion: CBF holds.
#
# 4. Analyze BF:
#    - We can construct a counterexample.
#    - World w: Domain = {a, b}
#    - Accessible world v1: Domain = {a}. φ(a) is true here.
#    - Accessible world v2: Domain = {b}. φ(b) is true here.
#    - Check Premise (□∃x φ(x)):
#        - In v1, ∃x φ(x) is true (witness 'a').
#        - In v2, ∃x φ(x) is true (witness 'b').
#        - Premise is TRUE.
#    - Check Conclusion (∃x □φ(x)):
#        - Is there an object in {a, b} that has φ in both v1 and v2?
#        - Object 'a' doesn't exist in v2.
#        - Object 'b' doesn't exist in v1.
#        - Conclusion is FALSE.
#    - Conclusion: BF does not hold.
#
# 5. Final Result:
#    - The Converse Barcan formula holds.
#    - The Barcan formula does not hold.
#    - This corresponds to choice C.
