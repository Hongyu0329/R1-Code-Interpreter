# The dimension 'd' is a parameter of the problem, required to be an integer d >= 3.
# We will use the smallest possible value, d=3, as a concrete example for this script.
d = 3

# The problem asks for the maximal number of measures, k, such that a controlled
# random walk is always transient (i.e., not guaranteed to return to the origin).
#
# The solution to this problem comes from a known result in the mathematical theory
# of controlled random walks. It establishes a "phase transition" based on the
# relationship between the number of measures (k) and the dimension (d).
#
# The result states that:
# 1. If k <= d - 2, the walk is always transient for any choice of measures.
# 2. If k >= d - 1, it is possible to choose a set of measures that makes the walk recurrent.
#
# Therefore, the maximal k for which the walk is *always* transient is d - 2.

# The final equation for the maximal k is:
# k = d - 2

# We calculate the result for our sample dimension d.
k = d - 2

# As requested, we print the final equation and its components for our example.
print(f"The dimension is d = {d}.")
print(f"The equation for the maximal k is: k = d - 2")
print(f"Plugging in the value of d, we get: k = {d} - 2")
print(f"So, for d={d}, the maximal value of k is: {k}")
