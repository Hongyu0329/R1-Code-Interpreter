The question is whether a smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data u_0
exists for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in {dimension} dimensions (on a torus T^{dimension})
such that the solution u blows up in finite time.

The answer is NO.

Here is the detailed explanation:

1.  **Global Regularity in 2D:** For the {dimension}-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
    it is a well-established mathematical theorem that for any smooth initial data,
    a unique, smooth solution exists for all time (t >= 0). This property is known as
    "global regularity". This means that singularities, or "blow-ups," cannot
    develop in finite time from smooth initial conditions.

2.  **Key Mathematical Reason:** The proof of global regularity in {dimension}D relies on the
    vorticity equation. In {dimension}D, a key quantity called "enstrophy" (the integral of the
    squared vorticity) can be shown to have a bound that holds for all time. This
    bound is sufficient to control all higher derivatives of the solution, preventing
    any gradient from becoming infinite in finite time.

3.  **Contrast with the 3D Case:** The same question for the 3D Navier-Stokes equation
    is a famous unsolved problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems posed by
    the Clay Mathematics Institute. In 3D, the "vortex stretching" term in the
    equations could potentially lead to an infinite amplification of vorticity. It is
    not known whether this mechanism can actually cause a blow-up from smooth initial
    data, or if some other mechanism prevents it.

Conclusion: Since your question is specifically about the equation on the
{dimension}-dimensional torus (T^{dimension}), we are in the well-understood case where solutions are
guaranteed to exist and remain smooth for all time. Therefore, no such initial data u_0
that leads to a finite-time blow-up exists.
