For a p-electron, the orbital quantum number l = 1 and the spin quantum number s = 0.5.

The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: [0.5, 1.5]

--- Calculating Eigenvalues ---

For the case j = 0.5:
The eigenvalue of J^2 is ħ² * j * (j + 1) = ħ² * 0.5 * (0.5 + 1) = 0.75 ħ²
The possible m_j values are [-0.5, 0.5].
The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z are:
  For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue is -0.5 ħ
  For m_j =  0.5, the eigenvalue is  0.5 ħ

For the case j = 1.5:
The eigenvalue of J^2 is ħ² * j * (j + 1) = ħ² * 1.5 * (1.5 + 1) = 3.75 ħ²
The possible m_j values are [-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5].
The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z are:
  For m_j = -1.5, the eigenvalue is -1.5 ħ
  For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue is -0.5 ħ
  For m_j =  0.5, the eigenvalue is  0.5 ħ
  For m_j =  1.5, the eigenvalue is  1.5 ħ
