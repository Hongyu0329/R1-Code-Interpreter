The key problem in populations with limited recombination is the irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations, a process known as "Muller's ratchet." This leads to a decline in fitness, or "genetic deterioration."

A compensatory mechanism must counteract this process. Let's analyze the options:

A. Tandem repeats: Not a primary mechanism for functional compensation.
B. Chromosomal inversions: These actually suppress recombination, exacerbating the problem.
C. Transposable elements: Often considered genomic parasites; their accumulation can be a symptom of, not a solution to, ineffective selection.
E. Polyploidy: Provides gene redundancy on a whole-genome scale, which can buffer against mutations. It is a plausible mechanism.

D. Multigene families: These are sets of similar genes created by duplication. This feature provides direct functional redundancy for specific genes. If a harmful mutation inactivates one copy of a gene, the other copies within the family can still produce a functional product. This directly buffers the organism against the effects of Muller's ratchet and is considered a major compensatory mechanism for the lack of recombination. It is a more general and continuously acting process than polyploidy.

Therefore, multigene families are the best answer.
