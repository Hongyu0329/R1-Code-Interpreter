    # The patient's question is about how magnesium can help lower blood pressure.
    # We need to evaluate the provided biological mechanisms.

    # Mechanism A: Vasodilation
    # Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium is required for the
    # contraction of smooth muscles in blood vessel walls. By inhibiting calcium influx,
    # magnesium causes these muscles to relax.
    # Relaxed blood vessels widen, a process called vasodilation.
    # Widened vessels reduce the resistance to blood flow, thus lowering blood pressure.
    # This is a primary and well-documented mechanism.

    # Mechanism B: Protecting from calcium deposition
    # This is a long-term effect related to preventing atherosclerosis, not the primary
    # mechanism for the immediate blood pressure-lowering effect.

    # Mechanism C: Increasing brain matter
    # This is not a direct mechanism for blood pressure regulation.

    # Mechanism D: Stimulating inflammation
    # Inflammation generally worsens or contributes to high blood pressure.

    # Mechanism E: Raising calcium levels
    # Magnesium is a calcium antagonist; it doesn't raise calcium levels.

    explanation = """
Magnesium helps lower blood pressure primarily through its role as a natural calcium channel blocker. Here's how it works:

1.  Calcium ions are essential for the contraction of smooth muscle cells found in the walls of blood vessels.
2.  Magnesium competes with calcium and blocks its entry into these smooth muscle cells.
3.  This inhibition of calcium leads to the relaxation and widening of the blood vessels, a process known as vasodilation.
4.  Vasodilation decreases the resistance against which the heart has to pump blood, resulting in lower blood pressure.

Therefore, the correct mechanism is direct vasodilation.
