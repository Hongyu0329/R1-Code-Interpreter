### Reaction Analysis and Product Identification

**Reaction 1: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene to Product A**

*   **Explanation:** The starting material, (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane, is a secondary alkyl halide. It reacts with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, bulky base, which favors an E2 elimination reaction. Due to the steric hindrance of the base, the reaction follows Hofmann's rule, forming the less substituted alkene.
*   **Product A:** 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The chirality of the starting material is lost.

**Reaction 2: Product A to Product B**

*   **Explanation:** Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane (BH3) followed by oxidation (H2O2, NaOH). This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction that results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of water across the double bond. The hydroxyl group adds to the terminal carbon.
*   **Product B:** 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.

**Reaction 3: Product B to Product C**

*   **Explanation:** Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol), a primary alcohol, is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3). This reagent converts the alcohol into an alkyl bromide.
*   **Product C:** 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.

### Final Product C: Identity and Chirality

*   **IUPAC Name:** The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.
*   **Chirality:** The molecule is **achiral**. It does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four unique groups). The initial stereocenter was destroyed in the first elimination reaction, and the subsequent steps did not generate a chiral product.
