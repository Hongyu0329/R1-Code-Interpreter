    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: We'll start by expressing the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ in the form $H(s) = D_0(s)^{-1} N_0(s)$, where $D_0(s)$ and $N_0(s)$ are polynomial matrices. This is a \"left factorization\". A straightforward way to do this is to choose $D_0(s)$ as a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry is the least common multiple of the denominators in the corresponding row of $H(s)$.\n\n2.  **Coprimeness Check**: We will then check if this factorization is \"left coprime\". Two polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. If the rank drops for some $s$, the factorization is not coprime, and we need to simplify it.\n\n3.  **Factorization Reduction**: If the factorization is not coprime, we will find a greatest common left divisor (GCLD), $G(s)$, of $D_0(s)$ and $N_0(s)$. We can then remove this common factor to obtain the coprime matrices $D(s) = G(s)^{-1}D_0(s)$ and $N(s) = G(s)^{-1}N_0(s)$. The new factorization $H(s) = D(s)^{-1}N(s)$ will be coprime.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The Python code below will implement this procedure using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics. It will calculate the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ and print out each of their elements as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    for the given transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbol s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Step 1: Find an initial (not necessarily coprime) left factorization.\n    # We choose D_0(s) as a diagonal matrix of row denominators.\n    d1 = s + 1\n    d2 = s**2 - 1\n    D_0 = sympy.Matrix([[d1, 0], [0, d2]])\n\n    # Calculate N_0(s) = D_0(s) * H(s)\n    N_0 = sympy.simplify(D_0 * H)\n\n    # Step 2: The initial factorization [D_0(s), N_0(s)] is not coprime.\n    # A common factor exists related to (s+1).
