    "This is a music theory question. The key is to identify the chord progression described.\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. We'll label it 'i' if the key is minor, or 'I' if the key is major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. In a minor key, this is the minor dominant, labeled 'v'. In a major key, this would be a \"borrowed\" chord, also labeled 'v'.\n*   **The Progression:** The user is asking for a song that starts with a i -> v (in a minor key) or I -> v (in a major key) progression.\n\nLet's analyze some Beatles songs:\n\n1.  **\"Michelle\"**: The verse starts in F minor. The opening line (\"Michelle, ma belle...\") starts on the tonic minor (Fm) and ends on the minor fifth (Cm), but it's not a direct jump, as there are other chords in between.\n2.  **\"And I Love Her\"**: After a brief guitar intro, the song's verse begins. The key of the verse is C# minor.\n    *   The first line, \"I give her all my love,\" is sung over a **C# minor** chord (the tonic minor, 'i').\n    *   The second line, \"that's all I do,\" is sung over a **G# minor** chord (the minor fifth, 'v').\n    *   This i -> v progression repeats for the next two lines.\n\nThis direct jump from the tonic minor (C#m) to the minor fifth (G#m) at the very start of the vocal melody makes \"And I Love Her\" the correct answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.\n    The progression is from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - The song \"And I Love Her\" has a verse section in the key of C# minor.\n    - The tonic chord (i) is C# minor.\n    - The fifth degree of the C# minor scale is G#. A minor chord built on this is G# minor (v).\n    - The song's verse starts by alternating directly between C# minor and G# minor.\n    - This perfectly matches the description \"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\".\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"And I Love Her\"\n    tonic_chord = \"C# minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"G# minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that fits this description is: {song_title}\")\n    print(f\"The opening of the verse features a chord jump from the tonic ({tonic_chord}) to the minor fifth ({minor_fifth_chord}).\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<And I Love Her>>>"
