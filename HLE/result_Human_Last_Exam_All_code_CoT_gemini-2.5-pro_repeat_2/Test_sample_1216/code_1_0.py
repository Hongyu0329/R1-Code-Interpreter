# Step 1: Deduce the values for L, D, S, F based on the problem's riddle-like structure.
# From constraint 2 (sqrt(S) = L/4) and the hint that S is near 180, we find S=196.
S = 196
# From S=196, we find L. sqrt(196) = L/4 -> 14 = L/4 -> L=56.
L = 56
# From constraint 1 (F = sqrt(D) + 3L) and the hint that D is near 150, we find D=144.
D = 144
# From D=144 and L=56, we calculate F. F = sqrt(144) + 3*56 -> F = 12 + 168 -> F=180.
F = 180

# The four numbers for the product are:
# a) Lost records (Octavius ones)
lost_records = L
# b) Documents with dual naming
dual_named_docs = D
# c) Single-variant documents
single_variant_docs = S
# d) Full imperial title documents
full_title_docs = F

# Step 2: Calculate the product of these four numbers.
product = lost_records * dual_named_docs * single_variant_docs * full_title_docs

# Step 3: Determine the divisor, which is the number of distinct naming patterns.
# The patterns are: Octavius, Imperator Caesar Divi Filius, Augustus+Caesar,
# Octavianus/Augustus, Imperator Caesar Augustus, and Caesar only.
distinct_patterns = 6

# Step 4: Perform the final division as per the problem.
answer = product / distinct_patterns

# Step 5: Get the floor of the answer divided by 1000.
final_answer = math.floor(answer / 1000)

# The problem requires printing each number in the final equation.
