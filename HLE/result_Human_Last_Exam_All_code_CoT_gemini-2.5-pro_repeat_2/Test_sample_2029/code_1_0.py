    Calculates the number of different score sequences (a_1,...,a_8, b_1,...,b_6) that can occur.

    This problem is equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions to the equation:
    a_1 + ... + a_8 + b_1 + ... + b_6 = 48
    subject to the constraints:
    0 <= a_i <= 6 for i=1,...,8
    0 <= b_j <= 8 for j=1,...,6

    This can be solved using generating functions. The number of sequences is the
    coefficient of x^48 in the expansion of the polynomial P(x) = A(x) * B(x), where:
    A(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^6)^8 for Team A
    B(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^8)^6 for Team B
