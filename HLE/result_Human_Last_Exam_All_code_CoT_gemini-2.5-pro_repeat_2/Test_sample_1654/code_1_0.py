# This script calculates the number of times Anton Chekov used Otchumyelov's coat
# as a key symbol to show his changing state of mind in the short story "The Chameleon".
# The count is based on a literary analysis of his actions (putting the coat on, taking it off, etc.).

# Event 1: Hearing the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels a "chill" of fear and asks for his coat to be put on.
puts_on_coat_fear_of_general = 1

# Event 2: Learning it's not the General's dog, he feels "hot" with renewed arrogance and orders the coat to be taken off.
takes_off_coat_relief = 1

# Event 3: Hearing the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, he feels another "chill" and asks for the coat to be put on again.
puts_on_coat_fear_of_brother = 1

# Event 4: At the conclusion of the episode, he wraps the coat tightly around himself and leaves, reasserting his fragile authority.
wraps_coat_to_leave = 1

# We sum these distinct symbolic actions to get the total count.
total_symbolic_descriptions = (puts_on_coat_fear_of_general +
                               takes_off_coat_relief +

                               wraps_coat_to_leave)

# Print the final equation and the total, showing each component of the sum.
