    # --- Part 1: Proving the number of dispersion points is at most 1 ---
    print("\nPart 1: Show that the number of dispersion points cannot be two or more.")
    print("We use a proof by contradiction.")
    print("Assume a compact connected metric space X has at least two dispersion points, let's call them x1 and x2.")
    print("Since X is connected and has at least two points, it must contain other points. Let y be another point in X, distinct from x1 and x2.")
    
    print("\n- Since x1 is a dispersion point, X \\ {x1} is totally disconnected.")
    print("  This means we can find two disjoint open sets, U and V, that separate the points x2 and y within X \\ {x1}.")
    print("  So, X \\ {x1} = U U V, where x2 is in U and y is in V.")
    print("  Because points are closed in a metric space, X \\ {x1} is open, which makes U and V open sets in X itself.")

    print("\n- Similarly, since x2 is a dispersion point, X \\ {x2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("  We can find two disjoint open sets, A and B, that separate x1 and y within X \\ {x2}.")
    print("  So, X \\ {x2} = A U B, where x1 is in A and y is in B. A and B are also open in X.")

    print("\n- Now, we construct two new sets in X: S1 = U U A and S2 = V \cap B.")
    print("  - S1 is open because it's a union of open sets.")
    print("  - S2 is open because it's an intersection of open sets.")
    print("  - S1 and S2 are disjoint: S1 \cap S2 = (U U A) \cap V \cap B = (U \cap V \cap B) U (A \cap V \cap B) = {} U {} = {}.")
    print("  - S1 and S2 are non-empty: x1 is in A, so x1 is in S1. The point y is in V and B, so y is in S2.")
    print("  - The union S1 U S2 covers all of X. Any point z in X is either in A or B. If in A, it's in S1. If in B, it's either in U (so in S1) or V (so in S2).")

    print("\n- We have found two non-empty, disjoint, open sets (S1, S2) whose union is X.")
    print("  This contradicts the fact that X is a connected space.")
    print("  Therefore, our initial assumption is false. A connected space can have at most one dispersion point.")

    # --- Part 2: Showing that a cardinality of 1 is possible ---
