    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor**: The conductor is $d = 53599$. First, we find its prime factorization.\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters for Square-Free Conductor**: Since the conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $d$ if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\cdots \\chi_{p_r}$, where each $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n3.  **Use the Order Condition**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. We are given that the order must be 6. This implies that the order of each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be primitive, its order must also be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n4.  **Count Using Inclusion-Exclusion**: We will count the number of combinations of component characters that satisfy the order condition. We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_{p_1}, \\dots, \\chi_{p_r})$ where the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. The formula is:\n    *   Number(order=6) = Number(order divides 6) - Number(order divides 3) - Number(order divides 2) + Number(order divides 1).\n5.  **Calculate Each Term**: For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, we will count the number of non-principal characters whose order divides a given number $m$. This is the sum of $\\phi(k)$ for all $k$ that are divisors of $m$, divisors of $\\phi(p)$, and greater than 1. Then we multiply these counts for all prime factors of $d$ to get the total number of characters for the conductor $d$.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Combine the terms from the inclusion-exclusion principle to get the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan and shows the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # A faster way to compute phi(n) without re-factorizing\n    result = n\n    temp_n = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            result -= result // p\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n\n    print(f\"To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {order_k}, we follow these steps:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factorize conductor d\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    prime_factors = sorted(list(d_factors.keys()))\n    factor_str = \" * \".join(map(str, prime_factors))\n    print(f\"\\n1.
