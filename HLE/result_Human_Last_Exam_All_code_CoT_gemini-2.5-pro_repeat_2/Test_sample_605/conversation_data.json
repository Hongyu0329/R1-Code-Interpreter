    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a weighted homogeneous polynomial is defined as `c = d - Σw_i`, where `d` is the weighted degree of the polynomial and `w_i` are the weights of the variables. A key property of a Calabi-Yau manifold defined this way is that this invariant is zero.\n2.  **Determine the Weighted Degree (d):** The polynomial is weighted homogeneous if every term has the same weighted degree. I will calculate the degree for each monomial in the given equation to find the common degree `d`. The variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)` correspond to the weights `(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights (Σw_i):** I will sum the provided weights.\n4.  **Compute the Invariant:** Finally, I will subtract the sum of the weights from the weighted degree `d` to find the invariant. The python code will perform and display these calculations.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights for the variables (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # The polynomial is 0 = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3\n    # We represent each monomial by its exponents for (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)\n    monomials = [\n        (8, 0, 1, 0, 0),  # z_1^8 * z_3\n        (4, 3, 1, 0, 0),  # z_1^4 * z_2^3 * z_3\n        (1, 7, 0, 0, 0),  # z_1 * z_2^7\n        (1, 1, 1, 1, 1),  # z_1 * z_2 * z_3 * z_4 * z_5\n        (0, 1, 4, 0, 0),  # z_2 * z_3^4\n        (0, 0, 0, 3, 1),  # z_4^3 * z_5\n        (0, 0, 0, 0, 3),  # z_5^3\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the weighted degree for each monomial.\")\n    degrees = []\n    for i, mono in enumerate(monomials):\n        degree = sum(exp * w for exp, w in zip(mono, weights))\n        degrees.append(degree)\n        print(f\"  - Degree of term {i+1}: {degree}\")\n\n    # The polynomial should be weighted homogeneous, meaning all terms have the same degree.\n    # We notice that one term has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225.\n    # This is likely a typo in the problem's polynomial.
