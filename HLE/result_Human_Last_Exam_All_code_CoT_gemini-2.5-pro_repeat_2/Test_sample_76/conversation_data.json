    "Here is a plan to solve this problem:\n1.  The problem asks for the number of integer values of $x$ for which the expression $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square. Let this perfect square be $y^2$.\n2.  The equation is $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. This is an equation for integer points on an elliptic curve.\n3.  Finding all integer solutions to such equations can be very difficult and requires advanced number theory. However, for a given cubic polynomial, the number of integer solutions is known to be finite.\n4.  We can analyze the behavior of the polynomial for large absolute values of $x$.\n    -   For large positive $x$, $P(x) \\approx x^3$, which grows quickly.\n    -   For large negative $x$, let $x = -z$ for $z > 0$. Then $P(-z) = -z^3 - 16z^2 + 72z + 1056$. For large $z$, this value becomes negative, so it cannot be a perfect square. We can find a bound for $z$ beyond which $P(-z)$ is always negative. A simple check shows $P(-9) = -321 < 0$, so for any $x \\le -9$, $P(x)$ will be negative.\n5.  This means we only need to check a limited range of negative integers and all positive integers. While a full proof that no more solutions exist for very large $x$ is complex, we can write a program to search for solutions within a sufficiently large range to find all \"small\" solutions.\n6.  The Python script will:\n    a. Iterate through a range of integers for $x$, for example from -8 up to a large positive number like 100,000.\n    b. For each $x$, calculate $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n    c. If $P(x) \\ge 0$, calculate its integer square root.\n    d. Check if the square of this root equals $P(x)$. If it does, then $P(x)$ is a perfect square.\n    e. Keep a count of all such integer values of $x$ and store them.\n    f. Finally, print the integer solutions found and their count.\n\nBased on this plan, the following Python code will find the solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of integers x for which\n    x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    # For x <= -9, the expression becomes negative.
