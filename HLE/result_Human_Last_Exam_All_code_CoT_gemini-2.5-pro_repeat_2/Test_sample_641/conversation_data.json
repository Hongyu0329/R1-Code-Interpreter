    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to perform a calculation based on the structure of this finite group of Lie type.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Field:** The group is `PSU(n, q)`, which is standard notation for `PSU(n, q^2)`, the projective special unitary group of dimension `n` over the finite field with `q^2` elements. Here, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to SU:** `PSU(n, q^2)` is the quotient of the special unitary group `SU(n, q^2)` by its center, `Z`. An involution in `PSU` is an element `gZ` such that `(gZ)^2` is the identity element, which means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`.\n3.  **Determine the Center:** The center of `SU(4, 997^2)` has an order of `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, the center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n4.  **Count Preimages:** We need to count the elements `g` in `SU(4, 997^2)` for which `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`, excluding the elements of the center themselves. These preimages, when projected into `PSU`, give the involutions.\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Classes:**\n    *   The elements `g` with `g^2 = I` (involutions in `SU`) fall into two types based on the dimension of their -1 eigenspace (which must be even):\n        *   Dimension 2: This forms a conjugacy class of size `N_1 = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n        *   Dimension 4: This is the single element `-I`, which is in the center.\n    *   The elements `g` with `g^2 = -I` form a single conjugacy class of size `N_2 = q^4(q + 1)(q^3 + 1)`.\n6.  **Sum and Simplify:** The total number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is the sum of the sizes of these two sets of preimages, divided by the size of the center (since each involution in `PSU` has two preimages in `SU`).\n    *   Number of involutions = `(N_1 + N_2) / 2`.\n    *   This simplifies to a neat formula: `N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n7.  **Execute Calculation:** Use Python to compute this value for `q = 997`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this final formula and prints the result, showing the numbers involved in the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in the group PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q such that gcd(4, q+1)=2 is\n    # given by the formula: N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1).\n    # We will compute this value for q = 997.\n\n    q_2 = q * q\n    q_4 = q_2 * q_2\n\n    term_in_parentheses = q_4 + q_2 + 1\n    result = q_4 * term_in_parentheses\n\n    print(f\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1), with q = {q}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the powers of q:\")\n    print(f\"q^2 = {q}^2 = {q_2}\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = {q}^4 = {q_4}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Now, we substitute these values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q_4} * ({q_4} + {q_2} + 1)\")\n    print(f\"N = {q_4} * ({term_in_parentheses})\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The final result is:\")\n    print(f\"N = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<976249132201972109409091>>>"
