    "This is a historical question. I will find the answer from my knowledge base and then present it in the requested Python code format.\n\nAndre Vernault, known by the code name 'Worm', was a Belgian refugee who arrived in the UK in 1941. British counterintelligence, MI5, was initially suspicious of him because he was evasive about his background. Upon investigation, they discovered he was hiding his true profession. His actual profession was highly relevant to wartime intelligence, which is why his secrecy raised so many red flags. His true profession was that of a pigeon fancier. He was an expert in breeding and racing pigeons, which were a vital method of communication for intelligence networks at the time.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n  \"\"\"\n  profession = \"pigeon fancier\"\n  print(f\"Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from his WWII interrogators, was: {profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<pigeon fancier>>>"
