    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Order**: The problem concerns the scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction. We are interested in second-order diagrams, which means diagrams containing exactly two interaction vertices.\n2.  **Identify the Diagrams**: We need to find all the unique, connected vacuum bubble diagrams of this order. A vacuum bubble has no external legs. With two $\\phi^4$ vertices, we have a total of 8 \"legs\" (4 per vertex) that must be connected to each other to form internal propagators. There are two such distinct connected diagrams:\n    *   **The Figure-eight Diagram**: Both vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators.\n    *   **The \"Saturn\" Diagram**: The two vertices are connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has one propagator that starts and ends on itself, forming a loop.\n3.  **Define the Symmetry Factor**: The symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's structure. The contribution of a diagram to a physical quantity is inversely proportional to its symmetry factor.\n4.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram**:\n    *   **For the Figure-eight Diagram (S1)**:\n        *   There are 2 identical vertices, which can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n        *   There are 4 identical propagators connecting these two vertices, which can be permuted. This gives a factor of $4!$ (4 factorial).\n        *   $S_1 = 2 \\times 4! = 48$.\n    *   **For the \"Saturn\" Diagram (S2)**:\n        *   There are 2 identical vertices, which can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n        *   There are 2 identical propagators connecting the two vertices, which can be permuted. This gives a factor of $2!$.\n        *   There is one loop on the first vertex. A line that starts and ends on the same vertex contributes a factor of 2.\n        *   There is also one loop on the second vertex, contributing another factor of 2.\n        *   $S_2 = 2 \\times 2! \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n5.  **Sum the Factors**: Finally, we will sum the individual symmetry factors to get the total.\n\nNow, here is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_phi4_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for each second-order vacuum bubble diagram\n    in phi^4 scalar field theory and sums them.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Diagram 1: Figure-eight diagram\n    # This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Its symmetry factor is the product of the symmetry from permuting vertices\n    # and the symmetry from permuting propagators.\n    \n    # Symmetry from swapping the 2 identical vertices\n    vert_sym_d1 = 2\n    # Symmetry from permuting the 4 identical propagators between the vertices\n    prop_sym_d1 = math.factorial(4)\n    s1 = vert_sym_d1 * prop_sym_d1\n\n    # Diagram 2: \"Saturn\" diagram\n    # This diagram has two vertices connected by two propagators, and each\n    # vertex has one self-loop.\n    \n    # Symmetry from swapping the 2 identical vertices\n    vert_sym_d2 = 2\n    # Symmetry from permuting the 2 identical propagators between the vertices\n    prop_sym_d2 = math.factorial(2)\n    # Symmetry from the two self-loops (each loop contributes a factor of 2)\n    loop_sym_d2 = 2 * 2\n    s2 = vert_sym_d2 * prop_sym_d2 * loop_sym_d2\n\n    # Summing the symmetry factors\n    total_s = s1 + s2\n\n    print(\"Calculation of symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubbles in phi^4 theory:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"1.
