    print("\n1. MEDICAL STABILIZATION (TOP PRIORITY):")
    print(f"   - The patient's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is {hba1c_level}%, indicating uncontrolled diabetes.")
    print("   - Action: Immediate referral to a physician or endocrinologist to begin diabetes treatment.")
    print("   - Rationale: High blood sugar impairs wound healing and drastically increases the risk of post-procedural infection. No elective dental surgery should be performed until her diabetes is well-controlled (target HbA1c < 7%).")

    print("\n2. ACUTE DENTAL CARE:")
    print(f"   - The {time_delay_hours}-hour delay in seeking treatment makes reimplantation of the avulsed teeth impossible.")
    print("   - Action: Thorough clinical and radiographic (X-ray/CBCT) examination to check for alveolar bone fractures.")
    print("   - Action: Gentle debridement and irrigation of the tooth sockets.")
    print("   - Action: Prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics for infection and pain control.")
    print("   - Action: Tetanus prophylaxis should be updated if necessary.")

    # --- KEY CELLS OF INTEREST ---
    print("\n--- KEY CELLS OF INTEREST IN HEALING PROCESS ---")
    print("- Neutrophils & Macrophages: These are immune cells crucial for preventing infection and cleaning the wound site. Their function is impaired by high blood sugar.")
    print("- Fibroblasts: Responsible for producing collagen and forming new soft tissue. Their activity is also reduced in uncontrolled diabetes.")
    print("- Osteoblasts & Osteoclasts: These cells are essential for remodeling and healing the bone of the tooth sockets. Proper function is critical for socket preservation and any future implant consideration.")

    # --- PHASE 2: DEFINITIVE PROSTHODONTIC (TOOTH REPLACEMENT) PLAN ---
    print("\n--- PHASE 2: DEFINITIVE TOOTH REPLACEMENT PLAN (POST-MEDICAL STABILIZATION) ---")
    print(f"\nNOTE: The SNB angle of {snb_angle_degrees} degrees indicates a prognathic mandible (Skeletal Class III), which must be factored into the prosthetic design to ensure stability and proper function.")
    print("\nRECOMMENDED OPTION: CAST PARTIAL DENTURE")
    print("   - Denture Type: A removable partial denture with a cast metal (Cobalt-Chrome) framework.")
    print("   - Material Rationale: The metal framework provides rigidity, strength, and optimal support from the remaining teeth. This is superior to a flexible acrylic denture for a long-span case like this, especially with the challenging bite forces of a Class III patient.")
    print("   - Abutment Teeth: The Left Central Incisor and the Left Second Premolar.")
    print("   - Abutment Rationale: These are the teeth directly adjacent to the edentulous space. They are chosen to provide support and retention for the denture. Their periodontal health must be thoroughly assessed and confirmed to be excellent before they are used as abutments.")

    print("\nCONSIDERATION FOR OTHER OPTIONS:")
    print("   - Dental Implants: This is the ideal standard but is CONTRAINDICATED until the patient's diabetes is well-controlled for a sustained period due to the high risk of implant failure.")
    print("   - Fixed Bridge: Not recommended due to the long span (three teeth) and the fact that the canine, a key supporting tooth, has been lost. This would place excessive force on the remaining abutment teeth.")
