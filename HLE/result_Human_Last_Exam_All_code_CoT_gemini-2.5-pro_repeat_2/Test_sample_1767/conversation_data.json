    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems are joined together and the coupling between them is not strong enough to fundamentally change their bulk topological properties (i.e., close the bulk gap), the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n\n*   Chern number of the first insulator, C1 = 1\n*   Chern number of the second insulator, C2 = 1\n\nThe total Chern number of the junction, C_total, is:\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\nThe following Python code calculates and displays this result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two systems are combined, the Chern number of the resulting system\n# is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, provided the junction\n# doesn't close the bulk energy gap.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the result, showing the full equation\nprint(f\"The first Chern insulator has a Chern number C1 = {C1}.\")\nprint(f\"The second Chern insulator has a Chern number C2 = {C2}.\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"{C_total} = {C1} + {C2}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
