    "Of course. Here is a plan to identify the two Nobel laureates and present the answer using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Identify the specific Enron advertising campaign mentioned, which is the \"Ask Why\" campaign from around the year 2000.\n2.  Research which academics or public figures were featured in this campaign.\n3.  Confirm that two of these individuals are indeed Nobel laureates.\n4.  Create a Python script that stores these two names in variables.\n5.  Use the `print()` function to display the names clearly as the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates were Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman.\n    # Amartya Sen won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998.\n    # Paul Krugman won the same prize in 2008, after the commercial aired.\n    laureate_1 = \"Amartya Sen\"\n    laureate_2 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n\n    print(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate_2}\")\n\nfind_laureates()\n```\n<<<Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
