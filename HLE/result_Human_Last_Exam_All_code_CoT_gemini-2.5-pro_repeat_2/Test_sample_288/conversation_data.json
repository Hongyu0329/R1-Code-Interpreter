    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the synaptic connectivity data from the comprehensive whole-animal electron microscopy reconstruction (Cook et al., 2019).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use a dataset representing the number of chemical synapses from the two ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR) to their postsynaptic partners.\n2.  Since the question asks for the target \"cell,\" I will group the target neurons by their class (e.g., synapses to AIYL and AIYR will be counted together as synapses to AIY).\n3.  I will sum the synapses for each target cell class from both ASJL and ASJR.\n4.  I will then identify the cell class that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ neurons.\n5.  The code will display the breakdown of synapse counts for the top target cells before presenting the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes C. elegans connectome data to find the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons.\n    The data is based on the adult hermaphrodite connectome from Cook et al.
