def solve_bayesian_eig_assumptions():
    """
    This function determines the necessary assumptions for the expected information gain
    of a Bayesian agent to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. (a) Finite prior entropy is necessary to bound the total possible information gain.
    2. (b) Regularity of the model class (e.g., finite/compact state space) is a standard
       technical assumption to ensure the learning problem is well-posed.
    3. The data stream must be stable. This can be achieved in two ways from the list:
       - (d) Observations are i.i.d. (the simple, passive learning case).
       - (c) The state occupancy distribution converges (the interactive learning case where
         the agent's policy stabilizes).
       A general proof must cover either case, leading to the clause (c OR d).

    Combining these gives the logical formula: (a) AND (b) AND (c OR d).
    This is then formatted into the required CNF string.
