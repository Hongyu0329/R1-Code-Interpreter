    "To find the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ), we can use methods from group theory, specifically by counting the group's actions on a set of 4 elements.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate Subgroups to Group Actions:** A subgroup of index 4 in a group Γ corresponds to a transitive action of Γ on a set of 4 elements. Such an action is defined by a homomorphism from Γ into the symmetric group S₄, where the image is a transitive subgroup.\n2.  **Identify Possible Images:** The Grigorchuk group Γ is a 2-group (the order of every element is a power of 2). Therefore, any finite homomorphic image of Γ must also be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the Klein four-group (V₄) and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₄).\n3.  **Count Subgroups for Each Case:** We will analyze the cases where the image of the homomorphism is V₄ and D₄ separately.\n    *   **Case 1 (Image ≅ V₄):** This case corresponds to normal subgroups of index 4. The number of such subgroups is related to the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from Γ to V₄.\n    *   **Case 2 (Image ≅ D₄):** This case corresponds to non-normal subgroups of index 4. The number of these subgroups is related to the number of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to D₄.\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers of subgroups found in each case.\n\nThe calculations involve counting homomorphisms, which depends on the generator and relation structure of Γ. A key property is that Γ's abelianization, Γ/[Γ, Γ], is isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)², and the generators `b` and `c` commute.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan and computes the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ).\")\n    print(\"The method is based on counting transitive homomorphisms from Γ to the symmetric group S4.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Case 1: Normal subgroups (Image is V4) ---\n\n    print(\"--- Case 1: Subgroups with quotient V4 (Klein four-group) ---\")\n    # A homomorphism from Γ to an abelian group like V4 must factor through the abelianization Γ_ab = (Z/2Z)^2.\n    # So, we count homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^2 to V4 (which is also (Z/2Z)^2).\n    # Total homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^2 to (Z/2Z)^2 is 4*4 = 16.\n    total_hom_gamma_ab_to_v4 = 16\n    \n    # Non-surjective homomorphisms have images of order 1 (trivial) or 2 (Z/2).\n    # Trivial image: 1 homomorphism.\n    num_hom_trivial_image = 1\n    \n    # Image of order 2: There are 3 subgroups of order 2 in V4.\n    # For each, there are 3 surjective homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^2 onto it.\n    num_hom_z2_image = 3 * 3\n    \n    # Number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from Γ to V4.\n    num_epi_gamma_to_v4 = total_hom_gamma_ab_to_v4 - num_hom_trivial_image - num_hom_z2_image\n    print(f\"Number of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to V4: {num_epi_gamma_to_v4}\")\n\n    # The number of normal subgroups with quotient V4 is |Epi(Γ, V4)| / |Aut(V4)|.\n    # |Aut(V4)| = |GL(2, F_2)| = (2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6.\n    num_aut_v4 = 6\n    print(f\"Number of automorphisms of V4: {num_aut_v4}\")\n    \n    num_normal_subgroups = int(num_epi_gamma_to_v4 / num_aut_v4)\n    print(f\"This gives {num_epi_gamma_to_v4} / {num_aut_v4} = {num_normal_subgroups} normal subgroup of index 4.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Case 2: Non-normal subgroups (Image is D4) ---\n    \n    print(\"--- Case 2: Subgroups with quotient D4 (Dihedral group of order 8) ---\")\n    # The number of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to D4 can be calculated by considering\n    # the generators of Γ and their relations.
