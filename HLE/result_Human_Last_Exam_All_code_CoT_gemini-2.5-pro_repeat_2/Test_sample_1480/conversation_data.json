    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for an interval type-3 fuzzy set, given two values and using a t-norm operation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Inputs:**\n    *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the firing strength of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part).\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the membership degree of an output value in the consequent fuzzy set (the \"THEN\" part).\n    *   **t-norm:** This is a class of functions used for fuzzy logic's \"AND\" operation. The most common and simplest t-norm is the `minimum` operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The problem asks to combine the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership degree using a t-norm. This operation is a key part of the fuzzy inference process (specifically, the implication step). The formula is:\n    `Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    Using the minimum t-norm, this becomes:\n    `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Create the Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script that defines the two input values, calculates their minimum, and prints the full equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nantecedent_firing_level = 0.7\nconsequent_membership = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a fuzzy logic 'AND' operator. The most common t-norm is the minimum function.\n# Although the problem mentions an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set, the provided values are scalars,\n# so the calculation is equivalent to a Type-1 fuzzy logic operation.\n# We apply the minimum t-norm to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\nactivation_level = min(antecedent_firing_level, consequent_membership)\n\n# Print the explanation and the result\nprint(\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm, which finds the minimum of the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: min({antecedent_firing_level}, {consequent_membership}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
