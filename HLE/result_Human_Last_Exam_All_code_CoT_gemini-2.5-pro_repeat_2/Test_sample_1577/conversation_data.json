    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a surface with `n` smooth holes (boundaries) and `m` rough holes (boundaries), we need to determine the number of independent logical operators. Let's assume the base surface is a sphere (genus g=0).\n\nThe logical operators can be categorized into two types: string-like operators that connect boundaries of the same type, and loop-like operators that encircle boundaries. A common model for calculating the degeneracy considers the loop-like operators.\n\n1.  **Z-type logical operators:** These are loop-like products of Pauli `σ_x` operators. A non-trivial `Z` loop can encircle a smooth hole. With `n` smooth holes, we can define `n` such loops. However, the product of all these loops is a trivial operator (equivalent to a product of stabilizers), so there is one constraint. This leaves `n-1` independent logical `Z` operators.\n\n2.  **X-type logical operators:** By duality, these are loop-like products of Pauli `σ_z` operators that encircle rough holes. With `m` rough holes, there are `m-1` independent logical `X` operators.\n\n3.  **Ground Space Degeneracy:** If we assume these two sets of operators (the `X`-loops and `Z`-loops) form the complete basis for the logical operators and they all commute with each other, the total degeneracy is `2` raised to the power of the total number of independent logical operators.\n\nThe total number of logical operators `k` would be the sum of the independent `X` and `Z` operators:\n`k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n + m - 2`\n\nThis gives a ground space degeneracy of `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m-2)`.\n\nThis formula corresponds to option B. It's worth noting that this specific derivation is most accurate when `n ≥ 1` and `m ≥ 1`, as different arguments apply when one type of hole is absent. However, among the given choices, it represents a standard model for this calculation.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the degeneracy for given `n` and `m` using this formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0 or m < 0 or not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(m, int):\n        print(\"Error: Number of holes must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The formula for the number of logical qubits k is k = n + m - 2.\n    # This is based on a model counting independent loop operators and is most\n    # applicable when n>=1 and m>=1.\n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    \n    print(f\"For a toric code with n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes:\")\n    \n    if n + m < 2:\n        # The formula n+m-2 is not applicable for cases with 0 or 1 total holes.\n        # GSD for 0 holes (sphere) is 1.\n        # GSD for 1 hole (disk) is 1.\n        if n + m == 0:\n            exponent_str = \"0 (by definition for a sphere)\"\n            degeneracy = 1\n            print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is {degeneracy}.\")\n        elif n + m == 1:\n            exponent_str = \"0 (by definition for a disk)\"\n            degeneracy = 1\n            print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is {degeneracy}.\")\n        else: # Should not be reached\n             print(\"Invalid case.\")\n    else:\n        exponent = n + m - 2\n        # Use math.pow to handle potentially large numbers, will return float\n        degeneracy = int(math.pow(2, exponent))\n        print(f\"The degeneracy is given by the formula: 2^(n + m - 2)\")\n        print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{exponent} = {degeneracy}\")\n\n\n# Example values for n and m.
