    # 3. Analyze the contract's default procedure
    # The contract requires "written notice of default".
    # Gary sent a "text letting him know that he missed a payment".
    # A simple text message may not legally qualify as formal "written notice of default"
    # which is required to start the three-day cure period.
    # Therefore, Gary's attempt to repossess the vehicle was likely premature
    # because the condition for repossession (proper notice followed by an expired cure period) was not met.
