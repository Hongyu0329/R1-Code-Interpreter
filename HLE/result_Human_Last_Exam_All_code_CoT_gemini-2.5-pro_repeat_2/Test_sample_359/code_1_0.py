    Analyzes the chess position to find the number of moves for a forced win.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Identify the winning condition for King of the Hill (King to a central square).
    2. Analyze the central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) to find a safe target.
    3. The square d5 is identified as the only undefended central square.
    4. Determine the shortest, unstoppable path for White's King from e3 to d5.
    5. The path is Ke3 -> Kd3 -> Kc4 -> Kd5.
    6. This path takes 3 moves for White. We will print the moves and the total count.
