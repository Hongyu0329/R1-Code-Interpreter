    print("The phrase 'measures and re-measures' depicts a rhythmic, repetitive action. This is a powerful metaphor for the sea's tides, which constantly advance and recede, changing the distance from the shore to the water. The appearance of the moon later in the poem reinforces this, as the moon governs the tides.")

    print(f"Reason #{reason_2_number}: To evoke ideas of introspective contemplation.")
    print("The poem sets a scene at the 'grave edge of the world,' establishing a contemplative mood. The sea's vast, unending motion prompts the speaker to turn inward, describing themself as 'agate, opaline'â€”small, still, and complex. The sea's 'measuring' thus becomes a metaphor for the speaker's own process of contemplation and reflection on distance, both physical and emotional.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The best answer choice is the one that combines these two ideas: the physical action of the tides and the psychological state of contemplation.")
    print("Choice A: 'To show the flow of tides and evoke ideas of introspective contemplation' correctly identifies both reasons.")
