    "To answer this question, I will analyze each proposed mechanism for the fate of duplicate genes. The key criteria are that the mechanism must explain both the **retention** of the two gene copies (i.e., both remain functional and are not lost) and their subsequent **divergence** (i.e., their sequences change over time).\n\nI will use a Python script to systematically evaluate each choice against these two criteria. The script will store the definitions and properties of each mechanism and then print a logical breakdown to identify the most suitable answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms for the fate of duplicated genes\n    to determine which best explains both retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'definition': 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical.',\n            'explains_retention': False,\n            'explains_divergence': False,\n            'analysis': 'This mechanism works against divergence by homogenizing gene copies.
