# Final Answer Derivation
#
# Step 1: Identify the reaction.
# The reaction is a stereoselective aza-Claisen rearrangement of an amide enolate.
# Starting Material: N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide
# Reagents: 1. LiHMDS (forms Z-enolate), 2. Heat (triggers [3,3]-rearrangement)
#
# Step 2: Determine the product structure.
# The allyl group migrates from the Nitrogen atom to the alpha-carbon of the propionyl group.
# - A new C-C bond forms between the propionyl alpha-carbon and the C2 of the cyclopentene ring.
# - The double bond shifts to form an exocyclic methylene (=CH2) at C1 of the original cyclopentene.
# - The product is an amide: R-NH-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-(modified cyclopentyl ring)
#
# Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry.
# - Chiral auxiliary: (S)-1-phenylethyl remains (S).
# - Propanamide C2 center: The (S)-auxiliary directs the formation of the (2R) stereocenter.
# - Cyclopentyl ring substituent: Numbering for the IUPAC name starts from the point of attachment (C1).
#   - The original (S)-methyl group is now at C4 of the substituent ring, so it is (4S).
#   - The C-C bond formation occurs trans to this methyl group, resulting in an (R) configuration at the attachment point (C1). So, the ring is (1R,4S).
#
# Step 4: Assemble the IUPAC name.
# - Parent: propanamide
# - N-substituent: N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)
# - C2-substituent: ((1R,4S)-4-methyl-2-methylidenecyclopentyl)
# - C2 configuration: (2R)
#
# Final Name: (2R)-2-((1R,4S)-4-methyl-2-methylidenecyclopentyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propanamide
