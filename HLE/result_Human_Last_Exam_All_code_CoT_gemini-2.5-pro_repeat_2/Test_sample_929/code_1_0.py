    This script analyzes different insect behavior patterns to determine which has the 
    greatest positive effect on plant fitness (pollination).

    The ethogram codes are:
    1: investigation start, 2: investigation end
    3: interaction start,   4: interaction end
    5: feeding start,       6: feeding end

    Plant fitness is assumed to be directly proportional to the total time an insect
    spends feeding, as this is the primary mechanism for pollen transfer.

    We model each answer choice by setting plausible parameters for insect behavior
    and calculate a 'fitness score' based on total feeding time.
