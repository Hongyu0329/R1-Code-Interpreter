    # Part (a)
    print("Part (a): Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?")
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. A lattice is classified by its genus. For unimodular lattices, we distinguish between the genus of odd lattices (type I) and even lattices (type II).")
    print("2. The lattice Z^n is an odd lattice, so Z^12 belongs to genus I_12.")
    print("3. A fundamental theorem by Kneser states that taking a d-neighbor of a lattice preserves its genus.")
    print("4. Therefore, any d-neighbor of Z^12 must also belong to genus I_12, meaning it must be an odd lattice.")
    print("5. The question is about an even unimodular lattice L of rank 12, which belongs to genus II_12.")
    print("6. Farness = 2 would imply that L is isometric to a 2-neighbor of Z^12.")
    print("7. This would mean an even lattice (L) is isometric to an odd lattice (the 2-neighbor), which is impossible as isometry preserves the property of being even or odd.")
    print("Equation of concepts: genus(L) != genus(2-neighbor of Z^12).")
    print("The numbers in this reasoning are the rank, n = 12, and the farness, d = 2.")

    print(f"Conclusion: It is not possible. The answer is {answer_a}.\n")


    # Part (b)
    print("Part (b): Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3. Can L have a vector x such that x.x is divisible by 6 and x is 3-primitive?")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. This question concerns the classification of odd unimodular lattices of rank 14.")
    print("2. It is a known result from the classification of integral lattices that the genus of odd unimodular lattices of rank 14 contains exactly two distinct isometry classes.")
    print("3. The first class is the standard lattice Z^14 itself. Its farness is 1, as it is isometric to Z^14 (a 1-neighbor of itself).")
    print("4. The second class is known to be a 2-neighbor of Z^14. Therefore, its farness is exactly 2.")
    print("5. This means that any odd unimodular lattice L of rank 14 must have far(L) = 1 or far(L) = 2.")
    print("6. The premise of the question states that L has farness 3, which contradicts the classification results.")
    print("Relevant equation from classification: far(L) must be 1 or 2, but the question assumes far(L) = 3.")
    print("The numbers in this reasoning are the rank, n = 14, and the farness values, 2 and 3.")
    print("7. Since no such lattice L exists, it cannot have the specified vector x.")
    answer_b = "no"
    print(f"Conclusion: The premise is false, so the answer is {answer_b}.\n")


    # Part (c)
    print("Part (c): If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24, what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. The lattice L described is the unique Niemeier lattice with root system D_24. It is constructed from the D_24 lattice.")
    print("2. The D_24 lattice is defined as D_24 = {x in Z^24 | the sum of coordinates of x is even}.")
    print("3. The Niemeier lattice L is the overlattice L = <D_24, h>, where h is the 'gluing' vector h = (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2).")
    print("4. Two lattices M1 and M2 are d-neighbors if their intersection M_intersect = M1 intersect M2 has index d in both, i.e., [M1 : M_intersect] = d and [M2 : M_intersect] = d.")
    print("5. We need to find the intersection M = L intersect Z^24.")
    print("   - An element of L is either in D_24 or in the coset h + D_24.")
    print("   - Elements of D_24 have integer coordinates, so D_24 is a subset of Z^24.")
    print("   - Elements of h + D_24 have half-integer coordinates, so they are not in Z^24.")
    print("   - Therefore, the intersection is L intersect Z^24 = D_24.")
    print("6. Now we compute the index d. The final equation is d = [Z^24 : D_24].")
    print("   - The index [Z^24 : D_24] is the size of the quotient group Z^24/D_24.")
    print("   - The map f: Z^24 -> Z/2Z, f(x) = sum(x_i) mod 2, has D_24 as its kernel. The map is surjective.")
    print("   - Thus, the index is 2.")
    print("7. We also verify [L : D_24]. Since L is formed by D_24 and one coset, this index is also 2.")
    print("8. So, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24. Since d=1 is not possible (L is even, Z^24 is odd), the smallest d is 2.")
    d = 2
    rank_c = 24
    print(f"Final Equation: d = [Z^{rank_c} : D_{rank_c}] = {d}")
