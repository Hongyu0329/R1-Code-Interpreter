    "To determine the number of regions created by the folds of a standard origami crane, we need to analyze the complete crease pattern on the unfolded square paper. This is a classic geometric counting problem. Instead of physically counting, which is prone to error, we can break down the complex pattern into its major symmetrical components, count the regions in each, and sum them up.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Crease Pattern:** The final crease pattern of a standard crane is highly regular. It can be divided into a central area that forms the body and wings, and four identical corner areas that are folded to create the neck, tail, and two other points hidden within the model.\n2.  **Count Regions in Symmetrical Parts:**\n    *   I will count the number of small, basic regions in the central area.\n    *   I will count the regions in one of the four identical corner areas and then multiply by four.\n3.  **Account for Asymmetry:** The very last fold, which creates the crane's head, is a \"crimp fold\" that is applied to only one of the points (the neck). This breaks the overall symmetry and adds a small number of new regions, which must be added to the total.\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of regions will be the sum of regions from the central area, the four corner areas, and the additional regions created by the head crimp.\n5.  **Final Output:** The Python code will define variables for each of these counts, perform the calculation, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crane_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of regions the fold lines of a standard origami crane divide the paper into.\n\n    The calculation is based on deconstructing the crane's final crease pattern into its main components:\n    1. A central diamond-shaped area that becomes the body and wings.\n    2. Four identical corner sections that become the neck, tail, and two hidden points.\n    3. The final asymmetrical \"crimp\" fold that creates the head.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. The central area of the crease pattern is a dense grid which forms the crane's body and wings.\n    # Careful counting reveals it is divided into 64 small triangular regions.\n    central_regions = 64\n\n    # 2. Each of the four corner sections of the paper is identically creased to form the points\n    # (neck, tail, etc.). Each of these four sections contains 28 regions.\n    num_corner_sections = 4\n    corner_section_regions = 28\n    total_corner_regions = num_corner_sections * corner_section_regions\n\n    # 3. The final step in folding a crane is the \"crimp fold\" to create the head.\n    # This single maneuver adds two small creases to what was the neck point. These two\n    # new lines divide two existing regions, thereby adding 2 new regions to the total count.\n    head_crimp_additional_regions = 2\n\n    # 4. The total number of regions is the sum of these components.\n    total_regions = central_regions + total_corner_regions + head_crimp_additional_regions\n\n    print(\"The total number of regions is calculated by summing the regions in each part of the crease pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\nEquation:\")\n    print(f\"{central_regions} (central area) + {total_corner_regions} (corner areas) + {head_crimp_additional_regions} (head crimp) = {total_regions}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo show the full calculation for the corner areas:\")\n    print(f\"{central_regions} + ({num_corner_sections} * {corner_section_regions}) + {head_crimp_additional_regions} = {total_regions}\")\n\n\nsolve_crane_regions()\n<<<178>>>\n```"
