    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` followed by a Python script that prints the final result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Euclidean Action (S_E):** In finite-temperature quantum field theory, calculations are performed in Euclidean spacetime where time is imaginary (`t → -iτ`). The partition function `Z` is given by a functional integral over all field configurations `ϕ`, weighted by `exp(-S_E)`. For a neutral scalar field `ϕ` with mass `m`, the free part of the Euclidean action is:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d³x [ ½(∂_τϕ)² + ½(∇ϕ)² + ½m²ϕ² ]`\n    Here, `τ` is the imaginary time, compactified on a circle of length `β = 1/T` (where T is the temperature), and `∇` is the standard spatial gradient.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the Action using Integration by Parts:** The goal is to write the action in the form `S_E = ½(ϕ, Dϕ)`, which will allow us to identify the operator `D` and the inner product. We apply integration by parts to the derivative terms:\n    *   For the time derivative: `∫ dτ (∂_τϕ)² = -∫ dτ ϕ(∂_τ²ϕ)`. The boundary terms at `τ=0` and `τ=β` cancel due to the periodic boundary conditions required in finite-temperature theory (`ϕ(0, x) = ϕ(β, x)`).\n    *   For the spatial derivative: `∫ d³x (∇ϕ)² = -∫ d³x ϕ(∇²ϕ)`. The boundary terms at spatial infinity vanish for physically relevant field configurations.\n\n3.  **Identify the Operator D:** Substituting these back into the action gives:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d³x [ ½(-ϕ ∂_τ²ϕ) + ½(-ϕ ∇²ϕ) + ½m²ϕ² ]`\n    We can factor out `½` and `ϕ`:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d³x ϕ * (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) * ϕ`\n\n4.  **Define the Inner Product:** This expression is now in the desired form `S_E = ½(ϕ, Dϕ)`.\n    *   The differential operator `D` is `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`.\n    *   The inner product `(f, g)` is implicitly defined as the integral over Euclidean spacetime: `(f, g) = ∫ dτ d³x f(x)g(x)`.\n\n5.  **State the Final Result:** Based on this definition, the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is the integral of `ϕ` multiplied by the action of `D` on `ϕ`:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d³x [ ϕ * (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ ]`\n\nThe following Python script will print this final expression, explicitly showing the numerical coefficients as requested.\n\n```python\ndef display_scalar_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and displays the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the kinetic part of the Euclidean action S_E for a scalar field ϕ can be written in the form S_E = ½(ϕ, Dϕ).\")\n    print(\"This allows us to identify the differential operator D and the associated inner product.\\n\")\n    print(\"The operator D is found to be: D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\\n\")\n    print(\"The inner product (f, g) is defined as ∫ dτ d³x f(x)g(x).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ) is given by the following expression.\")\n    print(\"The equation explicitly shows each numerical coefficient as requested.\\n\")\n\n    # Define symbolic components for clarity in the final output\n    phi_symbol = \"ϕ\"\n    dtau2_phi_symbol = \"∂_τ²ϕ\"\n    nabla2_phi_symbol = \"∇²ϕ\"\n    m_symbol = \"m\"\n\n    # Coefficients of the operator D\n    coeff_dtau2 = -1\n    coeff_nabla2 = -1\n    coeff_m2 = 1\n\n    # Construct the string for the integrand, emphasizing the coefficients.\n    integrand = (\n        f\"{phi_symbol} * (\"\n        f\"({coeff_dtau2}) * {dtau2_phi_symbol} + \"\n        f\"({coeff_nabla2}) * {nabla2_phi_symbol} + \"\n        f\"({coeff_m2}) * {m_symbol}² * {phi_symbol}\"\n        \")\"\n    )\n\n    # Construct the final string for the full inner product.\n    final_expression = f\"(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d³x [ {integrand} ]\"\n\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(final_expression)\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_scalar_inner_product()\n```\n<<<∫ dτ d³x [ ϕ * ((-1) * ∂_τ²ϕ + (-1) * ∇²ϕ + (1) * m² * ϕ) ]>>>"
