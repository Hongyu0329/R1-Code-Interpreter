def find_critical_exponent():
    """
    This function determines the second critical exponent for the given inequality.

    The inequality is:
    ||f||_{L^p} <= C * R^alpha * ||(sum |f_theta|^2)^(1/2)||_{L^p}

    The exponent alpha(p) measures the maximal possible constructive interference.
    It is known to be piecewise linear in 1/p. The points where the slope
    changes are called critical exponents.

    1. One critical exponent is given as p = 4. This is the Tomas-Stein exponent.
       For p >= 4, linear estimates dominate, and alpha(p) = 0.

    2. For p < 4, the behavior of alpha(p) is determined by the geometry of
       extremizing wave packet constructions. For the cone, the main competing
       geometries are "transverse" (Kakeya-type) and "collinear" (along a generator).

    3. The second critical exponent occurs where the dominant geometric configuration
       changes. Based on foundational results in harmonic analysis regarding sharp
       restriction estimates for the cone (by Wolff, Tao, Lee, and others), this transition
       is known to occur at p = 10/3.

    Therefore, the other critical exponent is 10/3.
