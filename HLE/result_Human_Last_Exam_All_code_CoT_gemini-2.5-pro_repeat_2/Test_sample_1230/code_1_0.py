    # significant fatigue and nutrient deficiencies. It's very difficult to sustain,
    # especially when combined with starting a new exercise program.
    # This is the most likely source of his struggle.

    print("A more balanced approach, such as focusing on a moderate calorie deficit with sufficient protein and complex carbohydrates, would be more sustainable and provide the energy needed for his new exercise plan and busy travel schedule.")

# The final answer is C because the diet is the most extreme and unsustainable part of his new regimen.
# It directly impacts his energy levels and ability to adhere to the rest of his plan.
