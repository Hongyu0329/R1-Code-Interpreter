# Step 1: Define the numbers from the problem.
# The asymptotic relative area (sausage density) `p` was calculated to be 1/2.
p_num = 1
p_den = 2
p = fractions.Fraction(p_num, p_den)

# The threshold given in the problem is 2/3.
threshold_num = 2
threshold_den = 3
threshold = fractions.Fraction(threshold_num, threshold_den)

# Step 2: The random variable V_n converges in probability to the constant p.
# We need to find the limit of P(V_n > threshold).
# As n -> infinity, this becomes P(p > threshold).
# Since p and threshold are constants, this probability is either 1 (if the inequality is true) or 0 (if it is false).

if p > threshold:
    result = 1
else:
    result = 0

# Step 3: Print the reasoning and the final result.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation can be seen as the comparison p > threshold.
