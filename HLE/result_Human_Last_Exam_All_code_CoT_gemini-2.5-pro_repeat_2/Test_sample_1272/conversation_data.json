    "I will identify the historical event and location, then use a Python script to print the name of the modern-day Vietnamese province.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the specific battle that marks Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam during the Lam Sơn Uprising.\n2.  Research historical records to pinpoint this event. The Battle of Chi Lăng Pass in 1427 is widely recognized as a catastrophic and personal defeat for Mu Sheng, who was leading one of the two main Ming relief armies.\n3.  Determine the modern-day Vietnamese province where the Chi Lăng Pass is located.\n4.  Write a Python script that stores this province name in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam.\n# This occurred during the Lam Sơn uprising in the 15th century.\n# In 1427, Mu Sheng was leading a large relief army to reinforce Ming troops in Vietnam.\n# His army was ambushed and decisively routed at the Chi Lăng Pass (Ải Chi Lăng).\n# This defeat was a critical turning point in the war.\n# The Chi Lăng Pass is located in the modern-day Chi Lăng District, which is part of Lạng Sơn Province.\n\nprovince = \"Lạng Sơn Province\"\n\nprint(f\"The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the Battle of Chi Lăng Pass is: {province}\")\n```\n<<<Lạng Sơn Province>>>"
