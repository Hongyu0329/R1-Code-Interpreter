    "To answer your question, I will write a Python script that stores the researched information and then prints it out in a clear statement.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Research the specific anatomical details of the *Irritator challengeri* skull from paleontological literature.\n2.  Identify the number of depressions (foramina) located within the lacrimal recess.\n3.  Create a Python variable to hold this number.\n4.  Write a print statement to present the answer clearly to the user.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The user is asking for a specific anatomical detail about the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.\n# Based on the scientific literature, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al.\n# titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\",\n# the skull of Irritator is described in detail.\n# The paper states that the lacrimal recess, a large depression on the lacrimal bone,\n# contains two large foramina (openings, which are types of depressions).\n\n# The number of depressions found within the lacrimal recess.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The dinosaur's name.\ndinosaur_name = \"Irritator challengeri\"\n\n# We will now print the final answer in a full sentence.\n# The prompt requires outputting the number in the final equation, which we interpret\n# as clearly displaying the final numerical answer.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in {dinosaur_name} contains the following number of depressions:\")\nprint(number_of_depressions)\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
