# The user is asking for a specific anatomical detail about the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.
# Based on the scientific literature, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al.
# titled "Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil",
# the skull of Irritator is described in detail.
# The paper states that the lacrimal recess, a large depression on the lacrimal bone,
# contains two large foramina (openings, which are types of depressions).

# The number of depressions found within the lacrimal recess.
number_of_depressions = 2

# The dinosaur's name.
dinosaur_name = "Irritator challengeri"

# We will now print the final answer in a full sentence.
# The prompt requires outputting the number in the final equation, which we interpret
# as clearly displaying the final numerical answer.
