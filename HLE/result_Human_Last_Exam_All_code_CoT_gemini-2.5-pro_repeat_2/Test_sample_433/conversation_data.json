    "According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> guidelines on sterile compounding, the rules for Beyond-Use Dates (BUDs) are very specific. The question is about a single-dose *ampule* opened in a sterile environment.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer:\n1.  Identify the key item: a glass ampule, which is a single-dose container.\n2.  Identify the key action: it is punctured or opened. Once an ampule is broken open, it cannot be resealed.\n3.  Identify the environment: a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC).\n4.  Consult the USP <797> standard. For an opened ampule, the contents are exposed to the environment and cannot be stored. They must be used immediately.\n5.  Create a Python script that states this rule clearly and defines the BUD as \"Immediate Use,\" which can be represented as 0 hours of storage time.\n6.  The script will print the explanation and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)\n    for a single-dose ampule opened in a sterile environment.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"Single-dose ampule\"\n    environment = \"Sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner)\"\n    \n    # According to USP <797> guidelines, an ampule is an open system once broken.\n    # It cannot be resealed, and its contents are for immediate use only.\n    # There is no allowable storage time after opening.\n    storage_time_hours = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Environment: {environment}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Guideline: Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed.\")\n    print(\"Its contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\")\n    print(f\"The allowable storage time is {storage_time_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is 'Immediate Use'.\")\n\nget_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate Use>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
