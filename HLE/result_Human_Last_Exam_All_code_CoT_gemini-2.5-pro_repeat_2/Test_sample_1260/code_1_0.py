    # Step 1: Define example market parameters

    p_ask = p_mid + spread / 2
    # The bid price is where an aggressive seller sells.
    p_bid = p_mid - spread / 2

    # Step 2: Assume the mid-price 15 seconds later is unchanged.
    # This is a neutral assumption to isolate the effect of the definition itself.
    p_future_mid = p_mid

    # Step 3: Calculate the buyer's return for a trade at the ask.
    # This happens when a buyer is the aggressor.
    # The trade price 'p' is p_ask.

    # The trade price 'p' is p_bid.
    return_at_bid = (p_future_mid / p_bid) - 1

    # Step 5: Calculate the average return, assuming trades at bid and ask are equally likely.
    # This represents the average buyer's return across all trades.
