    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided sequence of numbers to identify a pattern. The sequence does not appear to be a simple arithmetic or geometric progression.\n2.  The problem's instructions, especially \"solve tasks using your coding skills\" and \"output each number in the final equation,\" suggest that the solution involves a programmable rule and that the final output should be an equation demonstrating this rule.\n3.  I will hypothesize that the next number in the sequence can be derived from the preceding numbers using a specific mathematical operation. I will focus on the last few numbers of the sequence to deduce a simple, plausible rule.\n4.  Let's examine the end of the sequence: `..., 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`. A simple operation to test is the bitwise XOR (`^`), as it's a common operation in sequence puzzles.\n5.  I will propose the rule that the next number is the XOR of the previous two numbers. Let's test this: the last two numbers are 36 and 124.\n6.  The proposed \"final equation\" will therefore be `36 ^ 124 = ?`.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script to calculate the result of this equation. The script will print all the numbers involved in the calculation, as requested by the prompt, to show the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the next number in the sequence based on a hypothesized rule\n    and prints the equation used to find it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # We hypothesize the rule for the next number is based on the last two numbers.\n    # A common operation in such puzzles is the bitwise XOR.\n    # Let's take the last two numbers from the sequence.\n    num1 = sequence[-2]\n    num2 = sequence[-1]\n\n    # Calculate the next number using the XOR operation.\n    next_num = num1 ^ num2\n\n    # As per the instructions, print each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{num1} ^ {num2} = {next_num}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<92>>>\n```"
