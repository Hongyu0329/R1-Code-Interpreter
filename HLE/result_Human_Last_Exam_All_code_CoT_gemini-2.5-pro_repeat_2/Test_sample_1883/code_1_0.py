# Step 1: Define the counts of Z and E isomers from the starting material name.
# The starting material is (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.
num_z_bonds = 3
num_e_bonds = 1

# Step 2: Propose a simple model based on FMO theory principles.
# FMO theory dictates a kinetically controlled reaction. The product ratio is
# determined by the relative energies of the diastereomeric transition states.
# We propose a model where this ratio is influenced by the counts of Z and E
# bonds, which control the steric environment in the transition states.
# The trans product (B) is sterically favored (major), and the cis product (A) is disfavored (minor).
# Model: Ratio of Major/Minor (B/A) = count(Z)/count(E)

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of product B to product A.
ratio_B_to_A = num_z_bonds / num_e_bonds

# Step 4: Express the result as the ratio of A to B.
# The ratio A:B is 1:(B/A)
ratio_A = 1
ratio_B = int(ratio_B_to_A)

# Step 5: Print the final predicted ratio.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
print("Predicted Ratio based on the simplified FMO model:")
print(f"A : B = {ratio_A} : {ratio_B}")
