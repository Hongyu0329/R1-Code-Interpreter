    # Provided Concepts:
    # 1. Self-stabilizing effect: Interest increases as knowledge is acquired.
    # 2. Driving force: The effect is driven by the "increasing number of knowledge gaps that open up".
    # 3. Early Phase: Limited knowledge, unfamiliar with details.
    # 4. Late Phase: Comprehensive knowledge, understanding most material.

    # Answer Choices:
    options = {
        'A': "The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect.",
        'B': "In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur because students knowledge is fragmented and lot is unknown. Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest.",
        'C': "The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase, where a learnerâ€™s foundational understanding allows them to discover more knowledge gaps.",
        'D': "none",
        'E': "The self-stabilizing effect remains constant throughout all learning phases, as the number of knowledge gaps is constant for every gained knowledge."
    }

    # Analysis:
    # Let's evaluate each option based *only* on the text provided.

    # Analysis of A:
    # The core concept states the effect is "driven by the increasing number of knowledge gaps that open up".
    # This implies a positive correlation: as knowledge is acquired, more gaps are revealed, which strengthens the effect (interest).
    # Option A is a direct restatement of this core mechanism. The provided text does not mention any tapering or peak, only this positive feedback loop.
    analysis_A = "CORRECT. This statement accurately describes the mechanism presented in the definition, where acquiring knowledge reveals more gaps, which in turn drives the effect."

    # Analysis of B:
    # In the early phase, one has "limited knowledge". A learner may not know enough to even be aware of the gaps.
    # Therefore, the effect would be weak, not at its strongest.
    analysis_B = "INCORRECT. The effect is likely weak in the early phase because the learner has not yet perceived the vast number of knowledge gaps."

    # Analysis of C:
    # The late phase is defined by "comprehensive knowledge" and understanding "most of the learning material".
    # At this stage, a learner is more likely closing the final gaps rather than discovering a peak number of new ones. The peak of discovery would likely be in an intermediate phase (not described).
    analysis_C = "INCORRECT. The effect would likely be diminishing in the late phase, not peaking, as knowledge becomes comprehensive."

    # Analysis of E:
    # The definition explicitly states the effect is driven by an "increasing number of knowledge gaps", which is a dynamic process, not a constant one.
    analysis_E = "INCORRECT. The effect changes as knowledge is acquired; it is not constant."

    # Conclusion:
    # Based on a strict interpretation of the provided text, Option A is the only one that accurately reflects the described phenomenon.
