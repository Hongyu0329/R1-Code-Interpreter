    Analyzes the choices to find the best predictors for word complexity.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The question asks for features that predict the complexity of individual WORDS, not entire texts.
    2. Features like 'number of unique words' (in choices A and C) and 'number of word categories' (in choices B and E) are measures of TEXT complexity (lexical diversity), not single-word complexity.
    3. Choice D contains features that all directly measure the complexity of a single word:
        - word length (structural complexity)
        - word familiarity rating (psycholinguistic processing load)
        - syllable count (phonological complexity)
        - concreteness rating (psycholinguistic processing load for abstract vs. concrete concepts)
    4. Therefore, this combination represents the most relevant and contributive features for predicting the complexity of a word.
