    "In a dance scene, the soundscape is meticulously crafted to support the visual storytelling, which is centered around movement and rhythm. The hierarchy of importance is determined by what element is most essential to the scene's core purpose.\n\n1.  **Music:** This is the foundational element. The choreography, rhythm, mood, and pacing of the entire scene are dictated by the music. It is the primary driver of the action and the emotional core. Without music, a dance scene loses its fundamental identity.\n\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These add texture, realism, and impact to the dance itself. The sound of footsteps on the floor, the swish of clothing, or the specific percussive sounds of tap shoes are crucial for making the dance feel tangible and grounded. In some cases, like tap dancing, these sounds are an integral part of the rhythm and performance.\n\n3.  **Speech:** Dialogue is the least critical element in a pure dance sequence. It is often minimal or entirely absent, as the focus is on non-verbal expression through movement. If present, it's typically mixed lower than the music or placed in moments where the dancing subsides, so as not to distract from the primary focus.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchy from most to least important is Music, Sound Effects, and Speech. The following Python code will print this order.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in film dance scenes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The hierarchy is ordered from most important to least important.\n    # 1. Music: The foundation of any dance scene, dictating rhythm and emotion.\n    # 2. Sound Effects: Add realism and texture (e.g., footsteps, clothing swishes).\n    # 3. Speech: Often minimal or absent to keep the focus on the dance.\n    hierarchy = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n\n    # Format the list for clear, comma-separated output.\n    output = \", \".join(hierarchy)\n    \n    print(output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
