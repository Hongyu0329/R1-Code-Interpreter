    "Here is a plan to find the radical of the character 謄:\n1.  First, I will analyze the structure of the character 謄.\n2.  The character can be broken down into two parts: a left component and a right component.\n3.  The left component is the radical. In this case, it is 月. However, this form is a variant of the radical 肉 (niku), meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\". When it appears as a left-side component, it's called \"nikuzuki\".\n4.  I will then convert the Japanese name \"にくづき\" (nikuzuki) into its Hepburn romanization.\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print the result.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef get_radical_name_in_hepburn(character):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the Hepburn romanization of the radical for a specific kanji.\n  This is a simplified approach using a predefined dictionary for the requested character.\n  \"\"\"\n  kanji_radicals = {\n      '謄': 'Nikuzuki', # The radical is 肉 (niku), which appears as 月 (tsuki) on the left. This form is called nikuzuki (にくづき).\n      '媛': 'Onnahen'   # Example from the prompt.\n  }\n  \n  radical_name = kanji_radicals.get(character, \"Radical not found in this simple dictionary.\")\n  print(radical_name)\n\n# The character in question is '謄'.\ncharacter_to_find = '謄'\nget_radical_name_in_hepburn(character_to_find)\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
