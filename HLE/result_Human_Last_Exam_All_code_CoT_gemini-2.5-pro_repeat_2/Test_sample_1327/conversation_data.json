    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers** in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Hypothesize a pattern.** A common type of pattern is `x_n = a * x_{n-1} +/- b_n`, where `a` is a constant and `b_n` is a sequence of numbers. Let's test `a=3`.\n    *   From 2 to 11: `3 * 2 = 6`. To get 11, we add 5. (`11 = 3 * 2 + 5`)\n    *   From 11 to 23: `3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we subtract 10. (`23 = 3 * 11 - 10`)\n    *   From 23 to 51: `3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we subtract 18. (`51 = 3 * 23 - 18`)\n    *   From 51 to 119: `3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we subtract 34. (`119 = 3 * 51 - 34`)\n3.  **Identify the pattern in the numbers being subtracted.** The sequence of numbers being subtracted (starting from the third term) is 10, 18, 34.\n4.  **Analyze this secondary sequence.**\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is `8`.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is `16`.\n    *   The differences are `8, 16`. This sequence shows that the difference doubles each time.\n5.  **Predict the next term in the secondary sequence.** The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`. So, the next number to subtract will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n6.  **Calculate the missing number in the original sequence.** Using the established pattern, the next term is `3 * 119 - 66`.\n    *   `3 * 119 = 357`\n    *   `357 - 66 = 291`\n7.  The number that should be in the parentheses is 291.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the next number in the sequence based on the identified pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # The pattern is x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - d_n\n    # The sequence of subtracted numbers (d_n) is 10, 18, 34.\n    d_sequence = [10, 18, 34]\n    \n    # The differences in the d_sequence are 8 (18-10) and 16 (34-18).\n    # This difference doubles each time.\n    last_diff = d_sequence[2] - d_sequence[1]  # 16\n    next_diff = last_diff * 2  # 32\n    \n    # The next number to subtract is the last one plus the new difference.\n    next_d = d_sequence[-1] + next_diff  # 34 + 32 = 66\n    \n    # The last known number in the original sequence.\n    last_term = sequence[-1] # 119\n    \n    # Calculate the next number in the sequence.\n    next_term = 3 * last_term - next_d # 3 * 119 - 66\n    \n    print(\"The pattern is that the next number is 3 times the previous number, minus a value.\")\n    print(\"The sequence of subtracted values is 10, 18, 34, ...\")\n    print(\"The differences between these values are 8, 16, ... which are doubling.\")\n    print(\"The next difference is 16 * 2 = 32.\")\n    print(\"So the next value to subtract is 34 + 32 = 66.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {3} * {119} - {66} = {next_term}\")\n\nfind_next_number()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
