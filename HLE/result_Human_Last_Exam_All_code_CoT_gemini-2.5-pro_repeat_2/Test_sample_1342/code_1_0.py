    # Claim 1: "The proteins coded by genes targeted by sgRNA7 and sgRNA3 do not play a role in activating qNCS."
    # For sgRNA3: mRNA is 25% (good knockdown), but Ki67 is 1% (no change from control). This supports the claim that this protein is not an inhibitor of activation.
    # For sgRNA7: mRNA is 102% (no knockdown). The experiment is inconclusive for this gene. No conclusion can be drawn about its role.
    # The statement interprets the negative outcome (no proliferation increase) for both as "do not play a role".
    # Claim 2: "A low-calorie diet may increase qNCS activation in aged mice"
    # In old mice, glucose starvation (low-calorie) increased Ki67+ in control cells from 3% to 6%. This supports the claim.
    print(f"Claim 1 Analysis: For sgRNA3, knockdown was effective (mRNA level: {exp1_data['sgRNA3']['mrna_level_percent']}%) but proliferation did not increase (Ki67+: {exp1_data['sgRNA3']['ki67_percent']}% vs control {exp1_data['control']['ki67_percent']}%). For sgRNA7, knockdown was ineffective (mRNA level: {exp1_data['sgRNA7']['mrna_level_percent']}%), so the experiment is inconclusive. The statement is partially supported and partially based on an inconclusive result.")

    print("\nEvaluating Answer Choice B:")
    # Claim: "The protein coded by a gene targeted by sgRNA3 does not play a role in activating qNCS."
    # As above, good knockdown (25% mRNA) led to no change in proliferation (1% Ki67+). This is a correct statement based on the data.
    print(f"Claim Analysis: sgRNA3 showed effective knockdown (mRNA level: {exp1_data['sgRNA3']['mrna_level_percent']}%) with no effect on proliferation (Ki67+: {exp1_data['sgRNA3']['ki67_percent']}%). The claim is TRUE.")

    # Claim: "Glucose starvation is a good way to induce activation of qNCS in old and young mice."

    # Young mice: No, Ki67+ remained at 6%.

    print("\nEvaluating Answer Choice E:")
    # Claim: "Downregulation of gene coding GLUT-4 and glucose starvation can increase the activation of qNCS in young mice."
    # GLUT-4 knockdown (sgRNA8) in young mice: Ki67+ was 6% (control) vs 6% (sgRNA8). No increase.

    # Claim 2: "The activation of the qNCS in old mice can not be increased by glucose starvation."

    print("\n--- Final Decision ---")
    print("Choice A correctly identifies that a low-calorie diet (glucose starvation) increases qNCS activation in aged mice. It also summarizes that targeting the genes for sgRNA3 and sgRNA7 did not result in activation. Although the reason for sgRNA7's failure was lack of knockdown, the overall statement captures the outcomes reasonably well and integrates findings from both experiments.")
