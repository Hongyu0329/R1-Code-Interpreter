    "My plan is to determine the answer by comparing the sound frequency of human muscle twitches with the hearing ranges of the animals listed in the options.\n\n1.  **Identify the frequency of human muscle twitches:** These produce very low-frequency sounds (infrasound), typically in the 5-25 Hz range.\n2.  **Research the hearing range of each animal:**\n    *   **Human:** 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The lower limit is generally too high.\n    *   **Dog:** 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. They cannot hear such low frequencies.\n    *   **Bat:** 20,000 Hz to 200,000 Hz. They specialize in high frequencies (ultrasound).\n    *   **Whale:** Baleen whales can hear down to 10-30 Hz, making them a possibility.\n    *   **Herring:** Uniquely, some species in the herring family can detect infrasound down to 1 Hz, using this ability to detect predators.\n3.  **Compare and conclude:** The Herring has the most suitable hearing range for detecting the extremely low-frequency vibrations from muscle movements.\n\nI will write a Python script to display these frequencies and perform the comparison to find the correct answer. The script will fulfill the requirement of outputting the numbers involved in this \"equation\" of frequency comparison.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine\n    which might be able to hear the low-frequency sound of a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the target frequency range for a human muscle twitch.\n    # This is our target \"equation\" to check against.\n    twitch_min_hz = 5\n    twitch_max_hz = 25\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate hearing ranges for the given animals.\n    hearing_ranges = {\n        'Human': (20, 20000),\n        'Dog': (67, 45000),\n        'Bat': (20000, 200000),\n        'Whale': (10, 30000), # Baleen whales are sensitive to very low frequencies.\n        'Herring': (1, 3000)  # The clupeid family (herrings) can detect infrasound.\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Print the analysis.\n    print(\"Problem: Which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The frequency of a human muscle twitch needs to be compared against the hearing range of each animal.\")\n    # Here we output the numbers in the 'equation' as requested.\n    print(f\"Target Frequency Range of Muscle Twitch: {twitch_min_hz} Hz - {twitch_max_hz} Hz\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    best_candidate = None\n    lowest_hearing_freq = float('inf')\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each animal's hearing range:\")\n    for animal, (low_freq, high_freq) in hearing_ranges.items():\n        # Output each number from the hearing range data.\n        print(f\"\\nAnimal: {animal}\")\n        print(f\"Hearing Range: {low_freq} Hz to {high_freq} Hz\")\n        \n        # Check if the animal's hearing range overlaps with the muscle twitch frequency.\n        if low_freq <= twitch_max_hz:\n            print(f\"Result: PLAUSIBLE.
