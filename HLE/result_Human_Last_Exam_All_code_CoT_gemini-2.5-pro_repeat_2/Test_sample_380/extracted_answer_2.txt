No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral effect. The use of a coordinate system with axes perpendicular to the radial direction is a standard convention for data analysis, prized for its simplicity and consistency, even though the physical wave propagation is along the local, non-radial magnetic field.
