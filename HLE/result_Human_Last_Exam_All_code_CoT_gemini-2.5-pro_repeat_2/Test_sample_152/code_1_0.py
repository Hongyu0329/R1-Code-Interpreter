# Step 1: Determine the shape for cell 9.
# The pattern is three of each shape (CCC, SSS, TTT). Cell 9 is the third Triangle.
shape = "Triangle"

# Step 2: Determine the number of dots for cell 9.
# The logic is that the operation converting the 2nd dot count (A) to the 3rd (B)
# for each shape follows a geometric progression (*0.5, *1, *2) when shapes are
# ordered by vertices (Circle, Triangle, Square).
# For the Triangle, the operation is *1.
# The dot count for the 2nd triangle cell (cell 8) is 3.
# So, the dot count for the 3rd triangle cell (cell 9) is 3 * 1.
num_dots = 3 * 1

# Step 3: Calculate the arrow position based on the number of dots.
# The rule is: angle_in_radians = number_of_dots * pi / 3.
angle_rad = num_dots * math.pi / 3

# Step 4: Format the final output string.
# The number of dots is an integer.
dots_str = str(num_dots)

# The angle is pi radians. Based on the formatting of cell 8, which also has an angle of pi,
# the wording should be "is in the π radians position".
# The final equation for the angle is π = 3 * π / 3. The numbers 3 and π are represented.
angle_str = "is in the π radians position"

# Construct the final text in the specified format.
final_text = f"{shape}. {dots_str} dots. Arrow {angle_str}."
