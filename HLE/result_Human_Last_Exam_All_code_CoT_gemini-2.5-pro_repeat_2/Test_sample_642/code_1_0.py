# The problem asks for the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k approaches infinity.
# f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing machine to recognize
# strings with a number of 1s divisible by k.

# As derived in the explanation, by using a custom tape alphabet for each k,
# the state complexity f(k) becomes a constant value, C, for all k >= 2.
# We don't need the exact value of C, only that it is constant.
# Let's use a placeholder value to demonstrate the final calculation.
C = 8 # A placeholder for the constant number of states.

# For any large k, f(k) is C.
f_k = C
# For k+1, f(k+1) is also C.
f_k_plus_1 = C

# The difference is f(k+1) - f(k).
difference = f_k_plus_1 - f_k

# The limit of a constant sequence is the constant value itself.
limit = difference
