# My plan is to test the claim with a specific counterexample.
# The claim is that for any matrix M, the number of its distinct eigenvalues
# is less than or equal to its rank.
# I will construct a 3x3 matrix that violates this claim.

# 1. Define the counterexample matrix M.
# This matrix is already in Jordan Normal Form.
M = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
              [0, 2, 0],
              [0, 0, 0]])

# 2. Calculate its rank.
# The rank is the number of linearly independent rows/columns.
rank_M = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)

# 3. Calculate its distinct eigenvalues.
# The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries.
eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(M)
# Find the unique eigenvalues to get the set E(M).
num_distinct_eigenvalues = len(np.unique(eigenvalues))

# 4. Print the analysis and the results of the "final equation" from the claim.
# The claim's equation is: |{eigenvalues}| <= rank(M)
print("Let's test the claim with a counterexample matrix M:")
print(M)
print(f"\nThe rank of M is: {rank_M}")
print(f"The distinct eigenvalues of M are: {np.unique(eigenvalues)}")
print(f"The number of distinct eigenvalues is: {num_distinct_eigenvalues}")

print("\nThe claim states: |{distinct eigenvalues}| <= rank(M)")
print("For our matrix, this translates to the inequality:")
# This print statement fulfills the requirement to "output each number in the final equation"
print(f"{num_distinct_eigenvalues} <= {rank_M}")
print("This inequality is clearly False.")

print("\nConclusion:")
print("The claim is incorrect because we have found a counterexample.")
print("The proof is flawed. Specifically:")
print("- Line 3 is wrong because the Jordan normal form does not exist for a matrix over an arbitrary field K.")
print("- Line 7 is wrong because the inequality |E(J)| <= rank(J) is false, as our counterexample demonstrates.")
