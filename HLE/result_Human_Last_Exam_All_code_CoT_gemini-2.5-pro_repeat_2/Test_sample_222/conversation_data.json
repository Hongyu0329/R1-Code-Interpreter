    "To solve this problem, we need to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. The inputs are the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`, respectively.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question**: Finding an N-point DFT of a 2N-point sequence is typically interpreted as performing time-domain aliasing. We create a new N-point sequence, `z(n)`, by wrapping the original 2N-point sequence `y(n)` onto itself: `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+N)`. In our case, N=4, so `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`. We will then compute the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`.\n\n2.  **Relate to Frequency Domain**: A key property of the DFT is that this time-domain aliasing corresponds to sampling in the frequency domain. The 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, which we'll call `Z(k)`, is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, which we'll call `Y(k)`. That is, `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Use the FFT Radix-2 Algorithm**: The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be calculated from the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` using the decimation-in-time Radix-2 FFT structure. The sequence `y(n)` is an interleaving of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)`.\n    *   The odd-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)`.\n    The relationship is:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)` is the 8-point DFT twiddle factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: We can now find `Z(k)` by calculating the required values of `Y(k)`:\n    *   `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\nThe Python code below will implement these calculations step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT of an interleaved 8-point sequence\n    using the frequency-domain properties of the DFT.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"Given DFTs:\")\n    print(f\"X(k) = {X}\")\n    print(f\"H(k) = {H}\\n\")\n\n    # The problem is to find the 4-point DFT, Z(k), of the 8-point sequence\n    # formed by interleaving x(n) and h(n).
