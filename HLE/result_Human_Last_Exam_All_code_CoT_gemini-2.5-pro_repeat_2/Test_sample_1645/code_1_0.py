    The problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer n such that there exists a 
    Noetherian local ring A satisfying property (Rn), but its completion Â does not.

    Property (Rn) means the ring is 'regular at codimension n'. Formally, for every 
    prime ideal p in the ring with height(p) <= n, the localization A_p is a regular local ring.

    Step 1: Analyzing the case n = 0.
    - A ring A satisfies (R0) if and only if it is a reduced ring (has no non-zero nilpotents).
    - A fundamental theorem in commutative algebra states that a Noetherian local ring A is 
      reduced if and only if its completion Â is reduced.
    - Therefore, A satisfies (R0) if and only if Â satisfies (R0).
    - This means the property (R0) is always preserved under completion.
    - So, the smallest integer n must be greater than 0.

    Step 2: Analyzing the case n = 1.
    - We need to check if (R1) is preserved. If not, then n=1 is our answer.
    - A counterexample would be a ring A that satisfies (R1), but its completion Â does not.
    - A ring satisfying (R1) is reduced, and its localizations at height-1 primes are regular 
      (specifically, they are discrete valuation rings). A normal ring is an example of a ring 
      that satisfies (R1).
    - The preservation of (R1) can fail if a formal fiber of the ring is not regular.
    - Indeed, counterexamples have been constructed, most famously by Nagata. He showed the 
      existence of a 2-dimensional normal local domain A (which thus satisfies (R1)), 
      whose completion Â is not normal because it fails to satisfy (R1).
    - This demonstrates that the property (R1) is not always preserved by completion.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    - Since (R0) is always preserved and (R1) is not, the smallest non-negative integer n 
      for which (Rn) is not preserved is 1.
