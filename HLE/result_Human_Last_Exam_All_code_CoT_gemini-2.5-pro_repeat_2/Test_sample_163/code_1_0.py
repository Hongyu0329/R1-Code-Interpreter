    print("1. The patient underwent SFA stenting, which has a high risk of restenosis, especially in the first year.")
    print("2. The goal of surveillance is to detect this restenosis early. Arterial duplex ultrasound is the most sensitive non-invasive test for this purpose.")
    print("3. Options A and C are inadequate because they lack duplex ultrasound.")
    print("4. Option E is inadequate because annual follow-up is too infrequent in the first year.")
    print("5. We must choose between B and D. Option B's schedule (1, 3, 12 months) misses the 6-month mark, a critical period for restenosis development.")
    print("6. Option D provides surveillance with duplex at 3, 6, and 12 months. This schedule is a standard of care and effectively covers the period of highest risk for restenosis.")
    print("\nConclusion: Option D represents the most robust and clinically appropriate surveillance program among the choices.")
