    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of total degree 10 that can be formed from two non-commuting variables, `X` and `Y`. This number corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree 10 in the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`.\n\nThis dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Witt's Formula:** The dimension `d(n)` of the subspace of degree `n` of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by the formula:\n    `d(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order of the coefficients (in this case, `n = 10`).\n    *   `k` is the number of generators (in this case, `k = 2` for `X` and `Y`).\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Implement the Formula in Python:**\n    *   Create a helper function to find all divisors of `n`.\n    *   Create a helper function to compute the Möbius function, `μ(x)`.\n    *   Use these functions to compute the sum in Witt's formula for `n=10` and `k=2`.\n    *   Calculate the final result by dividing the sum by `n`.\n\n3.  **Output the Steps:** The Python script will be designed to print out each step of the calculation, showing the values for each divisor `d`, the corresponding Möbius function value, the power of `k`, the resulting term in the sum, and the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of num as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Moebius function μ(n).\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the BCH expansion\n    for k generators using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero coefficients for order n={n} and k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: d(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d\\n\")\n\n    divs = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divs}\\n\")\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms = []\n\n    print(\"Calculating each term in the summation Σ μ(n/d) * k^d:\")\n    for d in divs:\n        n_over_d = n // d\n        mu_val = moebius(n_over_d)\n        k_power_d = k**d\n        term = mu_val * k_power_d\n        \n        print(f\"For d = {d}:\")\n        print(f\"  μ(n/d) * k^d = μ({n}/{d}) * {k}^{d}\")\n        print(f\"               = μ({n_over_d}) * {k_power_d}\")\n        print(f\"               = {mu_val} * {k_power_d}\")\n        print(f\"               = {term}\")\n\n        total_sum += term\n        sum_terms.append(str(term))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe full summation is:\")\n    sum_expression = \" + \".join(sum_terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(f\"Σ μ(n/d) * k^d = {sum_expression} = {total_sum}\\n\")\n    \n    if total_sum % n != 0:\n         print(f\"Warning: Sum ({total_sum}) is not divisible by n ({n}).
