    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of the Current Word:** The Modern English word \"sister\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"systir\". This was adopted into Old English during the period of Viking raids and settlement in England (roughly 8th to 11th centuries), eventually replacing the native word.\n\n2.  **Find the Original Old English Word:** The native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\" was \"sweoster\". This word shares a common ancestor with other Germanic languages.\n\n3.  **Trace the Hypothetical Linguistic Evolution:** We need to apply known English sound and spelling changes to \"sweoster\" to see how it might have evolved into a modern form.\n    *   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*swestÄ“r\n    *   **Old English:** sweoster\n    *   **Middle English Transition:** In many cases, the Old English \"swe-\" combination evolved into \"su-\". A key example is the Old English word \"swilc\" which became \"such\" in Modern English. Another is \"sword\", where the 'w' sound was lost, although the spelling was retained. Following the pattern of \"swilc\" -> \"such\", \"sweoster\" would likely have become \"suster\" in Middle English.\n    *   **Comparison with Cognates:** This hypothetical evolution is strongly supported by looking at closely related West Germanic languages that did not undergo the same Norse influence. For example, the Dutch word is \"zuster\" and the West Frisian word is \"suster\".\n    *   **Final Form:** The Middle English \"suster\" would likely have been retained into Modern English, much like \"brother\" (from Old English \"brothor\") was.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and reveals the final resulting word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines what the Modern English word for 'sister'\n    would be if the Norse had not influenced the English language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The current word and its origin\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    origin = \"Old Norse 'systir'\"\n\n    # The original native word\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n\n    # Cognates in related languages\n    dutch_cognate = \"zuster\"\n    german_cognate = \"Schwester\"\n\n    # The likely evolution path\n    # A common sound change in English was 'swe-' becoming 'su-'.\n    # For example, Old English 'swilc' became Modern English 'such'.\n    # Applying this pattern to 'sweoster' gives 'suster'.\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"--- The Etymological Path of 'Sister' ---\")\n    print(f\"1. The modern word '{current_word}' was borrowed into English from {origin}.\")\n    print(f\"2. Before the Norse influence, the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. Without the borrowing, '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally.\")\n    print(f\"4. A common linguistic development in English was the change from 'swe-' to 'su-', as seen in Old English 'swilc' becoming 'such'.\")\n    print(f\"5. Applying this same change to '{old_english_word}' would have resulted in '{hypothetical_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"6. This is supported by similar words in other West Germanic languages, like Dutch '{dutch_cognate}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the likely Modern English word for 'sister' would be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_word}'\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
