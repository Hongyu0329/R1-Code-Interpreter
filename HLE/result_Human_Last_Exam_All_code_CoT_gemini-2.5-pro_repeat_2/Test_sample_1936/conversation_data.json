    "To find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that does not form a group, we need to understand the properties of a group and check set sizes starting from the smallest possible values.\n\nA group is a set G combined with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four fundamental axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements `a` and `b` in G, the result `a · b` is also in G. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on a set).\n2.  **Associativity**: For any `a, b, c` in G, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There is an element `e` in G such that for every `a` in G, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each `a` in G, there is an element `b` in G such that `a · b = b · a = e`.\n\nMy plan is to check the possible values for $n$ starting from $n=1$.\n*   **Case n=1**: Let's consider a set G with a single element, say `G = {e}`. The only possible binary operation is `e · e = e`. We can check if this structure forms a group.\n    *   Closure: `e · e = e`, which is in G. Satisfied.\n    *   Associativity: `(e · e) · e = e · e = e` and `e · (e · e) = e · e = e`. Satisfied.\n    *   Identity: `e` acts as the identity element since `e · e = e`. Satisfied.\n    *   Inverse: The inverse of `e` is `e` itself since `e · e = e`. Satisfied.\n    Since all axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation must be a group (this is known as the trivial group). Therefore, $n$ cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case n=2**: Let's consider a set G with two elements, say `G = {a, b}`. We need to determine if it's possible to define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is *not* a group. Let's try to construct one.\n    Consider the following operation table, where we let `a` be the identity element:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | b |\n| b | b | b |\n    Let's check the axioms for this structure:\n    *   Closure: All results in the table (`a`, `b`) are in G. Satisfied.\n    *   Associativity: This can be verified for all 8 combinations. For example, `(b · b) · a = b · a = b` and `b · (b · a) = b · b = b`. It holds. Satisfied.\n    *   Identity: The element `a` acts as the identity since `a · x = x` and `x · a = x` for all `x` in G. Satisfied.\n    *   Inverse: The inverse of `a` is `a`. However, for element `b`, we need to find an element `y` such that `b · y = a`. Looking at the row for `b`, we have `b · a = b` and `b · b = b`. Neither result is `a`. Therefore, `b` has no inverse. **Failed**.\n\nSince we have found an example of a set with $n=2$ elements and a binary operation that does not form a group, and we've shown that for $n=1$ this is not possible, the smallest such number is 2.\n\nThe following Python code programmatically verifies this reasoning. It first checks `n=1` and confirms it must be a group, then it checks a constructed example for `n=2` and shows it is not a group, thus concluding that 2 is the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef print_table(elements, op_table, op_symbol='.'):\n    \"\"\"Prints the operation table for a given set of elements.\"\"\"\n    header = f\"  {op_symbol} | \" + \" | \".join(map(str, elements))\n    print(header)\n    print(\"---\" * (len(elements) + 2))\n    for i, row in enumerate(op_table):\n        row_str = f\"  {elements[i]} | \" + \" | \".join(map(str, row))\n        print(row_str)\n\ndef check_axioms(elements, op_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given structure (elements and operation table) forms a group.\n    Assumes elements are the integers 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(elements)\n    \n    # 1.
