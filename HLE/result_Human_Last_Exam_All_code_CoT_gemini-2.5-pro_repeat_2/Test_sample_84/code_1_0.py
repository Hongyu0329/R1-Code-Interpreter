# This script presents the result of a mathematical derivation to find the value of alpha.
# The problem describes the degree d_n of a special polynomial, which grows asymptotically
# according to the formula d_n = Theta(n^alpha).

# Based on the analysis of the polynomial's properties, specifically how fast it must
# transition between two sets of points, the value of alpha is determined to be 6.
alpha = 6

print("The problem is to find the constant alpha in the asymptotic growth rate d_n = Theta(n^alpha).")
print(f"Based on mathematical analysis, the value of alpha is: {alpha}")

# The final equation is d_n = Theta(n^6).
# The user requested to output each number in this final equation.
# The number in the exponent of n is the value of alpha.
print("\nThe number in the exponent of n in the final equation is:")
