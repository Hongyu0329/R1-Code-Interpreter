# The plan is to identify dragonfly species whose ecology involves long-distance migration and gliding.
# This flight strategy is associated with reduced pterostigmata, as the anti-flutter function
# of the pterostigma is less critical for gliding flight compared to active flapping.

# The identified species based on their ecologies are:
# 3. Macrodiplax balteata: A migratory "wandering" species.
# 4. Pantala flavescens: The archetypal long-distance "glider" and migrant.
# 8. Sympetrum corruptum: A highly migratory species.
# 10. Tholymis tillarga: A migratory "glider" that travels long distances.

# List of the indices of the identified species.
species_indices = [3, 4, 8, 10]

# Prepare the output string by converting each number to a string and joining with a comma.
output_string = ",".join(map(str, species_indices))

# Print the final result.
print(output_string)
