The task is to find a True Avalanche using the word '{core_word}' that fits the description: '{description}'.

1.  **Syllable Pattern:** The word '{core_word}' sets the phonetic pattern: '{syllable_pattern}'.
2.  **Repetition:** A True Avalanche must repeat this pattern. The phrase 'Come poo, tern!' is phonetically very similar to '{syllable_pattern}'.
3.  **Meaning:** The phrase depicts a '{core_word}' (the software) telling a 'tern' (a bird) to 'come poo' (relieve itself).

This perfectly satisfies both the structural rules of a True Avalanche and the meaning required by the description.
