    This function determines the winning moves for White in the given Go puzzle.
    
    The analysis shows that the Black group has a potential eye space of five points:
    A1, B1, B2, A3, A4.
    
    To live, Black must create two separate eyes in this space. However, since White
    moves first, White can play on one of these key points. The analysis reveals
    that any move by White on one of these five points will initiate a sequence
    that successfully kills the Black group, as Black does not have enough space
    or moves to form two eyes.
    
    Therefore, all five points are valid first moves for a kill sequence.
