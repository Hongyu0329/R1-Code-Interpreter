def solve_max_ghtw():

    Calculates the maximum generalized hypertreewidth for a hypergraph with 3 edges.
    
    The problem is solved by finding the maximum fractional hypertreewidth (fhw)
    and then taking the ceiling of that value. The fhw is found by solving the
    dual linear programming problem, which is equivalent to finding the
    fractional matching number alpha*.

    We demonstrate this with the worst-case hypergraph structure:
    E = {{a, d}, {b, d}, {c, d}}
    Vertices are represented as an array index [a, b, c, d].
    
    The LP is:
    Maximize: y_a + y_b + y_c + y_d
    Subject to:
        y_a + y_d <= 1
        y_b + y_d <= 1
        y_c + y_d <= 1
        y_i >= 0
    
    `linprog` minimizes, so we minimize the negative of the objective function.
