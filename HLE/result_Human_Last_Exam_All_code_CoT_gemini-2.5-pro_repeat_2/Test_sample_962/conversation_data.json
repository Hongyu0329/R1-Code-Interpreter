    "Of course. I can provide a solution for a tightly secure, two-round, t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Choose the Right Scheme**: I will use the **BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) threshold signature scheme**. This scheme is an excellent choice because it naturally supports signature aggregation, is provably secure under the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption with a \"tight\" security reduction, and features a remarkably efficient signing protocol.\n2.  **Explain the Protocol**: I will outline the three main phases of the scheme:\n    *   **Key Generation (Setup)**: A trusted dealer (or a more complex distributed key generation protocol) creates a master secret key and distributes secret \"shares\" to `n` participants. We will simulate this using Shamir's Secret Sharing. The master public key is made public.\n    *   **Signing (Two Rounds)**:\n        *   **Round 1**: An aggregator requests a signature on a message `m` from a group of at least `t` participants. Each participant validates the request, computes their *partial signature* using their secret share, and sends it back to the aggregator.\n        *   **Round 2**: The aggregator receives at least `t` partial signatures. It then uses a mathematical technique called Lagrange interpolation to combine these partial signatures into a single, valid signature for the master public key.\n    *   **Verification**: Anyone with the master public key can verify the final aggregated signature against the message.\n3.  **Implement in Python**: I will provide a Python script that simulates this entire process. The script will use the `py_ecc` library, which provides the necessary elliptic curve and pairing-based cryptography functions for the BLS12-381 curve.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the BLS threshold signature scheme.\n\n```python\n# First, you need to install the required library:\n# pip install py_ecc\n\nfrom py_ecc.bls import G2ProofOfPossession as bls\nfrom py_ecc.bls.api import signature_to_G1, hash_to_G1\nfrom py_ecc.typing import BLSPubkey, BLSSignature\nimport random\n\n# ===================================================================\n# Helper Functions for Shamir's Secret Sharing & Lagrange Interpolation\n# ===================================================================\n\n# The order of the G1 group in the BLS12-381 curve\nMODULUS = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617\n\ndef shamir_share_secret(secret: int, t: int, n: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates n secret shares for a given secret, where any t shares can reconstruct it.\n    Using Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    if t > n:\n        raise ValueError(\"Threshold t cannot be greater than the number of participants n.\")\n    \n    # Generate a random polynomial of degree t-1, where the constant term is the secret\n    coeffs = [secret] + [random.randint(1, MODULUS - 1) for _ in range(t - 1)]\n\n    def poly(x: int) -> int:\n        val = 0\n        for i in range(t):\n            val = (val + coeffs[i] * (x ** i)) % MODULUS\n        return val\n\n    # Generate n shares by evaluating the polynomial at points 1, 2, ..., n\n    shares = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        shares.append((i, poly(i)))\n        \n    return shares\n\ndef lagrange_interpolate(x_coords: list[int], y_coords: list[int], x_target: int = 0) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the y-value at x_target for a polynomial defined by a set of points (x, y).\n    Uses Lagrange interpolation.
