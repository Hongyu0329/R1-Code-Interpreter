        "packing": "The absence of double bonds allows these straight chains to align parallel to each other, maximizing attractive van der Waals forces. This leads to very tight, dense, and highly ordered packing."

        "packing": "This structural disruption or 'kink' prevents the molecules from packing as closely together as their fully saturated counterparts. The packing is less efficient, less dense, and therefore less ordered."

    conclusion = "When lipids are compressed in a monolayer, the surface area they occupy is a direct result of their packing efficiency. Tighter and more ordered packing means each molecule takes up less space. Since C16-dihydroceramide packs more tightly due to its fully saturated chains, it will occupy a smaller area per molecule."
