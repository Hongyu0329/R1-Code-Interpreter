    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" is most commonly interpreted as two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This edge is the \"bottleneck\". This structure is formally known as `B(5,0)`. The total number of nodes, N, is 10.\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees**: I will calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call these nodes `u` and `v`.\n    *   Within its 5-node clique, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   The bottleneck edge adds one more connection to both `u` and `v`.\n    *   Therefore, the degree for both `u` and `v` will be `(5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n3.  **Understand the Gossiping Process**: In randomized uniform gossiping, a single step involves:\n    *   First, selecting a node `i` uniformly at random from all `N` nodes (with probability `1/N`).\n    *   Second, selecting one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random (with probability `1/degree(i)`).\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The event \"sampling the bottleneck edge `(u,v)`\" can happen in two ways:\n    *   We select node `u` first, then its neighbor `v`.\n    *   We select node `v` first, then its neighbor `u`.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: `P(sample u,v) = P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)`.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that implements these calculations and prints the final equation showing each number used, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during a uniform gossiping step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the graph structure.\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K_5 (5-node complete graphs)\n    # connected by a single bottleneck edge.\n    total_nodes = 10\n    nodes_per_clique = 5\n\n    # 2. Determine the degree of the nodes (u, v) connected by the bottleneck.\n    # Degree within the clique is (nodes_per_clique - 1).\n    # The bottleneck edge adds 1 to the degree.\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # Assign variables for the formula\n    N = total_nodes\n    deg_u = degree_bottleneck_node\n    deg_v = degree_bottleneck_node\n\n    # 3. Calculate the probability using the uniform gossiping formula.\n    # P(u,v) = P(pick u)*P(pick v|u) + P(pick v)*P(pick u|v)\n    # P(u,v) = (1/N)*(1/deg(u)) + (1/N)*(1/deg(v))\n    total_prob_float = (1/N) * (1/deg_u) + (1/N) * (1/deg_v)\n\n    # Calculate the fraction for a clear explanation\n    numerator = 2\n    denominator = N * deg_u\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    simple_num = numerator // common_divisor\n    simple_den = denominator // common_divisor\n\n    # 4. Print the final equation with all the numbers.\n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u,v) is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"P(u,v) = (1/Total_Nodes) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/Total_Nodes) * (1/deg(v))\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values for the 10-node barbell graph:\")\n    print(f\"P(u,v) = (1/{N}) * (1/{deg_u}) + (1/{N}) * (1/{deg_v}) = {numerator}/{denominator} = {simple_num}/{simple_den} = {total_prob_float}\")\n\nsolve_gossip_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
