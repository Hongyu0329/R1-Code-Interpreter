# The problem is to find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, T^2.

# 1. According to Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) theory, the number of critical
#    points of a smooth function on a compact manifold M is at least its
#    L-S category, cat(M).

# 2. For an n-dimensional torus, T^n, the L-S category is given by the formula:
#    cat(T^n) = n + 1.

# 3. Our manifold is the 2-torus, so we set n=2.
n = 2

# 4. We calculate the minimal number of critical points using the formula.
#    This gives a theoretical lower bound.
minimal_critical_points = n + 1

# 5. This bound is known to be sharp, meaning there exists a smooth function
#    on the 2-torus with exactly this many critical points. Therefore, the
#    minimal number is the value of this calculation.
