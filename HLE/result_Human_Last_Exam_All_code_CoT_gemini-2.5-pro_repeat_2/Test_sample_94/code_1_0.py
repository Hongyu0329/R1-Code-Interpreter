# This script prints the name of the physicist who fits the description.
# The story describes Paul Kirkpatrick, who, while investigating reflections
# from a large concave mirror, had a key insight after a janitor
# described seeing a line of light instead of a point. This led him
# (along with Albert Baez) to develop the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system
# for focusing X-rays, a fundamental technique in X-ray microscopy.
