    "The user is asking for the name of a physicist based on a specific anecdote. I need to identify the physicist and the story.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues:**\n    *   Physicist\n    *   Known for work in microscopy.\n    *   Discovered/investigated an optical effect.\n    *   The effect was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Recall or search for the anecdote:** This is a famous story in physics. The story describes how a physicist, when investigating the reflection from a large, slightly imperfect concave mirror, asked a janitor what he saw. The janitor described a line of light, not a point. This observation of astigmatism in a cylindrical mirror led the physicist to devise a new way to focus X-rays.\n\n3.  **Identify the physicist:** The physicist in this story is Paul Kirkpatrick. He, along with Albert Baez, developed the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, a crucial component in X-ray microscopy.\n\n4.  **Confirm the details:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, Paul Kirkpatrick was a physicist at Stanford University.\n    *   **Microscopy?** Yes, his work led to the Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray microscope.\n    *   **Optical effect?** Yes, he utilized the astigmatism of a cylindrically curved mirror.\n    *   **Custodial worker story?** Yes, this anecdote is widely attributed to him.\n\n5.  **Formulate the response:** I will provide the answer within a Python code block using a `print` statement, as requested by the instructions.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the physicist who fits the description.\n# The story describes Paul Kirkpatrick, who, while investigating reflections\n# from a large concave mirror, had a key insight after a janitor\n# described seeing a line of light instead of a point. This led him\n# (along with Albert Baez) to develop the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system\n# for focusing X-rays, a fundamental technique in X-ray microscopy.\n\nprint(\"Paul Kirkpatrick\")\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
