# Based on the principles of Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW/TIG), we can determine the appropriate parameters.

# 1. Voltage Analysis based on Arc Gap
# The arc voltage is primarily a function of the arc length.
# A long arc gap of 6 mm requires a significantly higher voltage than typical TIG operations.
# Estimated Voltage â‰ˆ 10V + (1V to 2V per mm of arc)
# For a 6mm arc, this results in a voltage range of approximately 16V to 22V.
# From the choices, only options C (15 V) and E (17.5 V) have plausible voltages.

# 2. Current Analysis for the Application
# The application is a material build-up on an Inconel 718 turbine blade tip.
# This requires enough heat (current) to melt both the base metal and the filler material to ensure a strong, fused bond.
# - A current of 25 A (Choice E) is generally too low for anything other than very thin sheet metal and would struggle to create a stable weld pool on a turbine blade.
# - A current of 100 A (Choice C) is a much more appropriate and common value for welding a component of this thickness and material, providing adequate energy for a sound repair.

# 3. Final Selection
# Therefore, the combination of 100 A and 15 V is the most suitable for the specified welding procedure.
welding_current_amps = 100
welding_voltage_volts = 15
