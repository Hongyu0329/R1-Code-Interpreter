    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle that relies on visual decomposition. The character is formed by pictographic elements that match the description.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Analyze the riddle's phrases and map them to pictographic components of a Chinese character.\n2.  \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box\": This can be interpreted as the top part of the character.\n3.  \"a ladder placed in the center\": This can be interpreted as the bottom part of the character, where an outer frame represents the ladder's sides and an inner component represents the rungs.\n4.  Combine these components to identify the final character.\n5.  Write a Python script to print the explanation and the final \"equation\" that builds the character from its parts.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set encoding to UTF-8 to correctly display Chinese characters\nsys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    character = \"高\"\n    meaning = \"gāo (high, tall)\"\n\n    print(f\"The riddle describes the Chinese character: {character} ({meaning})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Explanation of the first part of the riddle\n    print(\"1. 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box'\")\n    print(\"   This creatively describes the top portion of the character.\")\n    print(\"   Top Components: 亠 + 口\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Explanation of the second part of the riddle\n    print(\"2. 'a ladder placed in the center'\")\n    print(\"   This describes the bottom portion, which looks like a ladder.\")\n    print(\"   The outer part '冂' is the frame, and the inner '口' forms the rungs.\")\n    print(\"   Bottom Components: 冂 + 口\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Display the final 'equation'\n    print(\"Putting it all together:\")\n    print(\"Top Part ('stick and box') + Bottom Part ('ladder') = Final Character\")\n    print(\"(亠 + 口) + (冂 + 口) = 高\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_riddle()\n```\n<<<高>>>"
