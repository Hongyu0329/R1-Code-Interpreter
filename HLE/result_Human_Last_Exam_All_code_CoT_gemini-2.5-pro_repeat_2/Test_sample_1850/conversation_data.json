    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** I will use the full text of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" from the Project Gutenberg digital library.\n2.  **Define \"Historical Saint\":** This term can be ambiguous. It could mean only post-biblical figures (like St. Augustine) or any historical person recognized as a saint (including biblical figures like St. Peter). To be thorough, my search list will include prominent names from both categories.\n3.  **Methodology:** I will write a Python script to:\n    a.  Download the text of \"Paradise Lost\".\n    b.  Clean the text by removing the Project Gutenberg header and footer, which contain metadata and not the poem itself. This is crucial to avoid false positives (e.g., finding \"John\" in \"John Milton\").\n    c.  Iterate through a list of saints' names, searching for each name within the cleaned text. The search will be case-insensitive and look for whole words only.\n    d.  Count the number of unique saints' names found.\n4.  **Output:** The script will print the list of saints found, the total count, and a final equation as requested. Based on literary analysis, the number is expected to be zero, as the poem's narrative scope is confined to the biblical story and does not mention post-biblical figures. The script will programmatically verify this.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    Downloads, cleans, and searches the text of \"Paradise Lost\" for the names\n    of historical saints.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Downloading the text of 'Paradise Lost'...\")\n    # URL for the plain text version of Paradise Lost from Project Gutenberg\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20/pg20.txt\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)\n        full_text = response.text\n        print(\"Download complete.\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not download the text. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Cleaning the text (removing Gutenberg header/footer)...\")\n    try:\n        # The main content is between these markers\n        start_marker = \"*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARADISE LOST ***\"\n        end_marker = \"*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARADISE LOST ***\"\n        start_index = full_text.find(start_marker) + len(start_marker)\n        end_index = full_text.find(end_marker)\n        poem_text = full_text[start_index:end_index]\n        print(\"Text cleaned successfully.\")\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"Could not find start/end markers.
