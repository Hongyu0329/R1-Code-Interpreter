    # To find the smallest x for which success is guaranteed (P(f)=1), we look for the point where the
    # two solutions for P(f) from the quadratic formula merge. This occurs when the discriminant is zero.
    # The quadratic is (1-x)P(f)^2 - P(f) + x = 0.
    # The discriminant is (-1)^2 - 4*(1-x)*x = 1 - 4x + 4x^2 = (1-2x)^2.
