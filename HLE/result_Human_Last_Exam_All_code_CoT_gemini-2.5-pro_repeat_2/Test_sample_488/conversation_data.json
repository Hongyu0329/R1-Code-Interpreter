    "In conceptual metaphor theory, as developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, we understand one conceptual domain in terms of another. The phrase \"my love for humanity\" is an example of this.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the relevant types of conceptual metaphors: Orientational and Structural.\n2.  Analyze the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n3.  Explain how the phrase treats the abstract concept of \"love\" as a concrete entity or substance.\n4.  Conclude which category of metaphor this falls into based on the analysis.\n5.  Present this explanation in a Python script that prints the reasoning.\n\nThe script will clarify that the phrase treats 'love' as a possessable object or substance. This is a form of ontological metaphor, which gives abstract concepts a structure, thereby falling under the broader category of structural metaphors.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_metaphor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conceptual metaphor in the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the phrase: \\\"{phrase}\\\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the types of metaphors.\")\n    print(\" - Orientational Metaphor: Relates concepts to spatial orientation (e.g., UP/DOWN, IN/OUT). Example: 'HAPPY IS UP' as in 'I'm feeling up today.'\")\n    print(\" - Structural Metaphor: Structures one abstract concept in terms of another, more concrete concept. Example: 'ARGUMENT IS WAR' as in 'He won the argument.'\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the phrase itself.\")\n    print(f\"The phrase \\\"{phrase}\\\" treats the abstract emotion 'love' as if it were a physical substance or object.\")\n    print(\"Specifically:\")\n    print(\" - It can be possessed: 'MY love'. This treats love like property.\")\n    print(\" - It can be contained and directed: 'love FOR humanity'. This frames love as a substance held by a person and directed at a target.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"This act of treating an abstract concept (love) as a physical entity (a possessable substance) is a way of giving it structure.\")\n    print(\"This falls under the category of a Structural Metaphor, as it imposes the structure of a physical object/substance onto the abstract concept of love.\")\n    print(\"It is not an Orientational Metaphor because it does not rely on spatial orientation like up/down or in/out.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    analyze_metaphor()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
