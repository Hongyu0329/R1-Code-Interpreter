    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number and type of atoms** in the molecule. Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions for each type of atom** according to the 6-31G basis set.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H)**: The 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split-valence representation: '31'). So, each H atom has **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C)**:\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by one basis function (the '6').\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two parts (the '31' part). This means one set of s and p functions for the inner valence ('3') and another set for the outer valence ('1').\n        *   This results in: 1 (core 1s) + [1 (inner 2s) + 3 (inner 2p)] + [1 (outer 2s) + 3 (outer 2p)] = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9** contracted functions for each C atom.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions** by summing the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_C_functions = num_C * functions_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_H_functions = num_H * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_C_functions + total_H_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"Toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_H}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_H}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Total functions = (C atoms * functions/C) + (H atoms * functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_C} * {functions_per_C}) + ({num_H} * {functions_per_H})\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_C_functions} + {total_H_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = {total_functions}\")\n<<<79>>>\n```"
