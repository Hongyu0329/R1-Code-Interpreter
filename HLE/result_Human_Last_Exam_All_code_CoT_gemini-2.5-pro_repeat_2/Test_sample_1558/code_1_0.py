# Plan:
# 1. Define the Red Blood Cell (RBC) counts for pregnant mice from Experiment 1.
# 2. Calculate the difference in RBC counts between the control group and the RTI-treated group.
# 3. Print a clear explanation of the findings and how they support the conclusion.
#    The explanation will show the numbers involved in the calculation.

# RBC counts from Experiment 1 for pregnant mice (cells per microliter)
preg_control_rbc = 10 * 10**6
preg_rti_rbc = 8 * 10**6

# Calculate the reduction in RBC count due to RTI treatment
rbc_reduction = preg_control_rbc - preg_rti_rbc

print("This suggests that the natural activity of transposable elements during pregnancy increases Red Blood Cell production.")
