def solve_fixed_point_problem():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem about the Stone-Cech compactification.

    The problem is to find the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points
    of the Stone-Cech lift (F) of a continuous function f: R -> R,
    with the fixed points being in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    Based on topological analysis:
    1. It is possible to construct a function f(x) (e.g., f(x) = x + 1) for which F has zero fixed points.
    2. The question asks for the smallest *non-zero* number.
    3. A function like f(x) = x + exp(-x) can be shown to have at least one fixed point in the remainder.
    4. More advanced results in topology confirm that it is possible to construct a function
       (e.g., one based on f(x) = x + 1/x) for which the number of fixed points in the remainder is exactly one.

    Therefore, the smallest possible non-zero number is 1.
