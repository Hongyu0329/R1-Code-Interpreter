# The problem is to find the maximum number of eigenvalues greater than 2.
# Based on the analysis, this maximum is given by a concise mathematical formula.
# The code below prints this formula. As requested, it explicitly shows
# the numbers used in the final equation.

# Define the components of the formula symbolically
