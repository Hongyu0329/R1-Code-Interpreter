# This script addresses the question of whether a uniformly polarized beam
# can be converted into a vector beam using an optical system composed
# of free-space propagation and a phase-shaping medium.

# Reasoning:
# 1.  The input beam has a uniform linear polarization. This means the electric
#     field's oscillation direction is the same at every point in the beam's
#     cross-section.
# 2.  Free-space propagation and passing through a phase-shaping medium are
#     scalar operations. They modify the amplitude and phase of the light wave
#     but do not alter its fundamental polarization state.
# 3.  A vector beam, by definition, has a spatially non-uniform polarization state.
#     For example, a radially polarized beam's polarization vector points in
#     different directions depending on the position within the beam.
# 4.  To change a uniform polarization state into a non-uniform (vector) one,
#     an optical element that explicitly manipulates polarization as a function
#     of spatial position is required (e.g., a q-plate or a metasurface).
# 5.  Since the described system lacks such a component, it cannot produce a
#     vector beam from the given input.

# Therefore, the answer is no.
