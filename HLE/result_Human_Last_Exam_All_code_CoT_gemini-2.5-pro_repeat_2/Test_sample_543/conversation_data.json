    "The user wants to find the IUPAC name for the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: I will identify the starting material (1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene) and the reagent (excess phenyl magnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**: This is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction where an organometallic reagent replaces halogen atoms on an aromatic ring.\n3.  **Evaluate Reactivity**: I will consider the relative reactivity of the different carbon-halogen bonds present in the starting material. The order of reactivity for aryl halides in such reactions is typically C-I > C-Br > C-Cl.\n4.  **Predict the Product**:\n    *   The most reactive site is the carbon bonded to iodine. The iodo group at position 2 will be replaced first by a phenyl group.\n    *   The problem states that *excess* phenyl magnesium bromide is used and the reaction is refluxed in THF. These conditions are forcing enough to also replace the less reactive bromo groups.\n    *   Therefore, the bromo groups at positions 1 and 3 will also be substituted by phenyl groups.\n    *   The final product will be a benzene ring with phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: I will name the resulting structure, which is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n6.  **Create a Python Script**: I will write a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final IUPAC name, ensuring to output the numbers in the name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of\n    1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
