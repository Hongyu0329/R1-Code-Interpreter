    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the given differential equation, followed by the Python code that implements the solution.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Differential Equation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation's Structure**: The given equation, $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$, is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. It contains terms like $y^2$, $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $(y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2$. This structure suggests that a substitution might simplify it.\n\n2.  **Perform a Substitution**: I will use the substitution $u(x) = y(x)^2$. The derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which can be written as $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$. This will transform the original equation into a new differential equation in terms of $u$ and its derivative $u'$.\n\n3.  **Solve the Transformed Equation**: The new equation in $u$ is of a form that is solvable for $u$. By expressing $u$ as a function of $x$ and $u'$, i.e., $u = f(x, u')$, we can then differentiate this expression with respect to $x$. This standard technique yields a new, simpler differential equation for $u'$.\n\n4.  **Factor and Solve for u'**: The resulting equation for $u'$ can be factored into two parts. One part will lead to the general solution, while the other will lead to a singular solution.\n\n5.  **Derive the General Solution**: By solving the part that corresponds to the general solution, we find an expression for $u'$. We then substitute this back into the equation for $u$ to find the general form of $u(x)$. Finally, by reverting the substitution from $u$ back to $y^2$, we obtain the general solution of the original differential equation.\n\n6.  **Python Code**: The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these steps symbolically and prints each stage of the derivation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_differential_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the given ordinary\n    differential equation using symbolic mathematics with SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols and functions for the equation\n    x = sp.Symbol('x')\n    C = sp.Symbol('C') # Arbitrary constant\n    y_func = sp.Function('y')(x)\n    \n    print(\"--- Solving the Differential Equation ---\")\n    print(\"Original Equation:\")\n    print(f\"x**2*y**2 = x**3*y*(dy/dx) + y**2*(dy/dx)**2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x**2\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Rearrange the equation and introduce a substitution.\")\n    print(\"The equation can be rewritten by grouping terms involving y*(dy/dx):\")\n    print(\"(y*dy/dx)**2 + x*(x**2+1)*(y*dy/dx) - x**2*(y**2 - 9) = 0\")\n    print(\"We use the substitution u(x) = y(x)**2.
