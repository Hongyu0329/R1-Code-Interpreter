    "To answer this question, I will identify the historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, find their respective elevations, and then determine the tallest among them, excluding Mount Olympus.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary containing the names of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (other than Olympus) and their corresponding elevations in meters. The key mountains are Ida, Samothrace (Fengari), and Athos, which are all vantage points for gods watching the Trojan War.\n2.  I will then programmatically find the mountain with the highest elevation from this dictionary.\n3.  Finally, I will print the name of the tallest mountain and its elevation.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    # A dictionary of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus (2918m) is excluded as per the user's request.\n    # Sources for mountains mentioned:\n    # - Mount Ida: Zeus watches the battle from its peak.\n    # - Mount Samothrace (Fengari): Poseidon watches the battle from here.\n    # - Mount Athos: Mentioned in a simile by Hera.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Fengari)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033\n    }\n\n    # Find the mountain with the highest elevation\n    if not mountains:\n        print(\"No mountains to compare.\")\n        return\n\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(\"After Mount Olympus, the historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad are:\")\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    print(\"\\nComparing their heights:\")\n    # The \"final equation\" is finding the maximum value among the heights.\n    # We will show the numbers being compared.\n    heights = list(mountains.values())\n    print(f\"max({', '.join(map(str, heights))}) = {tallest_mountain_height}\")\n\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus, is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
