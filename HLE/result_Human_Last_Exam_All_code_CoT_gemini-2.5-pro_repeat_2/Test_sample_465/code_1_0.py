# This script determines the correct answer based on the properties of chromatic polynomials.

# Analysis of each statement:
# A. True. The largest real orbital chromatic root is bounded above by the largest real chromatic root.
# B. True. Chromatic polynomials can have complex roots.
# C. False. Real chromatic roots are always non-negative.
# D. True. Real chromatic roots can be non-integers (and even irrational).
# E. False. Chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).

# The set of true statements is {A, B, D}.
# Sorting these letters alphabetically gives "ABD".
