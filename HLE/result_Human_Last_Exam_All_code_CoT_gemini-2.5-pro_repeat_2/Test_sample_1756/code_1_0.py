    """

    # Detailed analysis of each statement:
    # A) Correct. The effective pool is the intersection of the tokens selected by
    #    top-k and nucleus sampling. The intersection will be the smaller of the two sets,
    #    which corresponds to the more restrictive condition.
    # B) Incorrect. Beam search with b=1 is mechanistically identical to greedy decoding.
    #    Both select the token with the highest probability at each step. Tie-breaking
    #    mechanisms would be consistent between them in any reasonable implementation.
    # C) Correct. A temperature τ > 1 flattens the probability distribution. This means
    #    more tokens are needed to sum up to the cumulative probability p, so the nucleus
    #    can expand to include tokens that were originally outside of it.
    # E) Correct. When resampling from a truncated set of tokens, their probabilities are
    #    renormalized by dividing by the sum of their original probabilities (S).
    #    The ratio of two renormalized probabilities p'a/p'b = (pa/S)/(pb/S) = pa/pb.
    # F) Incorrect. A counterexample is easy. If p=0.9 and the top token has probability 0.95,
    #    nucleus sampling excludes 5% of the mass. top-k with k=50 might exclude 50% of the mass.
    #    The term "properly tuned" is ambiguous, but the claim "can never exceed" is too strong.
    # G) Incorrect. Sequential filtering is not commutative. Applying top-k then nucleus can
    #    yield a different set of tokens than applying nucleus then top-k, because the first
    #    operation changes the distribution on which the second one operates.
    # H) Incorrect. Greedy decoding is deterministic and has minimal (zero) diversity. Beam search,
    #    especially with diversity penalties, is designed to explore more of the search space
    #    and thus increases output diversity.
    # I) Incorrect. Temperature τ < 1 sharpens the distribution, making the model more confident.
    #    This increases the likelihood of beams converging on the same high-probability path.
    # J) Incorrect. Length normalization helps counteract the model's bias towards shorter
    #    sequences but does not "completely eliminate" the beam curse (beams converging).
    # K) Incorrect. Lowering temperature (τ < 1) sharpens the distribution, making previously
    #    seen tokens *more* likely to be sampled again, which encourages repetition. A repetition
    #    penalty is more akin to *raising* the temperature for specific tokens.
    # L) Incorrect. Nucleus sampling with p=1 means the candidate pool is the entire vocabulary.
    #    This is the definition of standard multinomial sampling. The presence of ties in
    #    probabilities is irrelevant to this equivalence.
    # M) Correct. The statement says it "can be" deterministic. While MoE models often have
    #    non-deterministic components on GPUs, running the model on a CPU with a fixed seed
    #    would result in deterministic execution, including the routing decisions.
    # N) Incorrect. Deeper models are often better trained and more confident, leading to
    #    lower-entropy (sharper) distributions. This would decrease, not monotonically
    #    increase, the variance of sampled outputs.
    # O) Correct. Different GPU architectures (like V100 vs A100) have different hardware for
    #    floating-point calculations. This can lead to tiny numerical differences that accumulate,
    #    especially in sequential processes like beam search, causing different outcomes even with the same seed.
    # P) Correct. If expert pruning is dynamic and based on runtime factors not controlled by the
    #    random seed, it can be a source of non-determinism. This would change the model's
    #    output distribution from run to run, affecting the nucleus sampling set.
    # Q) Incorrect. Even with deterministic routing and constant attention patterns, non-deterministic
    #    floating-point operations within the expert modules themselves can lead to different outputs.
    #    Therefore, those conditions are not sufficient to guarantee identical outputs.
    # R) Correct. When batching sequences of variable length, padding is used. This changes the
    #    shape of the tensors, which can cause underlying libraries (like cuDNN/cuBLAS) to use
    #    different computation kernels that are not bit-wise identical, introducing non-determinism.
    # S) Incorrect. The entropy of a mixture of distributions can be higher than the entropy of any of
    #    its components. For example, mixing two sharp, low-entropy distributions peaked on different tokens
    #    results in a flatter, bimodal, higher-entropy distribution.
    # T) Incorrect. Quantization introduces errors that alter logits. This can easily change the
    #    relative ordering of tokens with similar probabilities.
    # W) Incorrect. The statement claims this is "always" true. If all experts are identical or produce
    #    very similar outputs, the mixture's effective temperature will be the same as the experts', not higher.
    # X) Correct. This is a primary source of non-determinism on GPUs. The order of floating-point
    #    additions in operations like matrix multiplication is not guaranteed, and due to the
    #    non-associativity of floating-point math, this leads to slightly different results across runs.
    # Y) Correct. Activation checkpointing involves recomputing parts of the forward pass. This
    #    recomputation is subject to the same sources of numerical non-determinism as the original
    #    computation. The recomputed activation may not be bit-wise identical to the original,
    #    affecting the final distribution.
