# Step 1: Find the coefficients of f(x)
# From the limit condition, we determined c = -3 and b_coeff = 1.
# From the condition f(ln(2)) = 0, we solve for a_coeff.
# a_coeff * exp(2*ln(2)) + b_coeff * exp(ln(2)) + c = 0
# a_coeff * 4 + 1 * 2 - 3 = 0
# 4 * a_coeff - 1 = 0
a_coeff = 1/4
b_coeff = 1
c = -3

print(f"The coefficients of f(x) are a = {a_coeff}, b = {b_coeff}, and c = {c}.")
print(f"So, f(x) = ({a_coeff})*e^(2x) + ({b_coeff})*e^x + ({c}).")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation and find a unique solution
# The integral equation holds if a = f(ln(b)).
# f(ln(b)) = a_coeff * (e^ln(b))^2 + b_coeff * e^ln(b) + c
# a = a_coeff * b^2 + b_coeff * b + c
# We assume the 'b' in the integral equation is the coefficient b=1 we found earlier.
b_integral = b_coeff
print(f"Assuming the parameter b in the integral is the coefficient b = {b_integral}.")

# Now we calculate the value of 'a' from the integral equation.
# a = f(ln(b_integral)) = f(ln(1)) = f(0)
a_integral = a_coeff * math.exp(0) + b_coeff * math.exp(0) + c
a_integral = a_coeff + b_coeff + c

print(f"The integral parameters are:")
print(f"a = {a_integral}")
print(f"b = {b_integral}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Calculate the final sum
final_sum = a_integral + b_integral

print(f"The final equation to solve is a + b.")
print(f"The sum is {a_integral} + {b_integral} = {final_sum}.")

# The final answer in the required format
answer = final_sum
