    print("E. Duloxetine+acetamophen: Acetaminophen is generally not effective for fibromyalgia pain.")
    print("F. Duloxetine+cyclobenzaprine: A reasonable option for pain and sleep, but Gabapentin is superior to cyclobenzaprine in this case because it also treats restless leg syndrome and paraesthesia.")
