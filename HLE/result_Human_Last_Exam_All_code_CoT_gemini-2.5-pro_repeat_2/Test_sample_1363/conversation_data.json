    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core technique of each dance listed in the options. The key is to identify the dance whose fundamental principles are directly violated by the physical actions required to overturn a reverse turn.\n\n1.  **Define \"Overturning a Reverse Turn\":** This means turning more than the standard amount for the figure, which requires generating extra rotational momentum.\n2.  **Analyze Dance Techniques:**\n    *   **Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep:** These dances all utilize body sway, and rise and fall (to varying degrees) as core components. Using sway and a slight lift to create more turn is a natural extension of their technique, even if not always syllabus. It's a variation, not a violation.\n    *   **European Tango:** This dance is fundamentally different. Its core technique is characterized by *no rise or fall* and *no sway*. The body must remain on a level plane, and movements are sharp and staccato.\n3.  **Connect Overturning to Technique:** To overturn a turn, a dancer almost invariably needs to use sway and a slight lifting action to maintain balance and power the rotation. This action is perfectly acceptable in the other dances but is a direct contradiction—a technical violation—of the foundational \"no rise, no fall, no sway\" rule of European Tango.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is in the European Tango that overturning a reverse turn is impossible without disregarding the dance's core technique.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that assigns a \"technique violation score\" to each dance. The Tango will have the highest score. The script will then find the maximum score in this \"equation\" of scores and print the corresponding answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer the user's question.\n\n    The script determines which dance's core technique is fundamentally\n    violated by the action of overturning a reverse turn.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Assign a \"technique violation score\" for overturning a reverse turn.\n    # A higher score means the action is more fundamentally against the dance's technique.\n    # Tango's score is highest because its core principles (no rise/fall, no sway)\n    # are directly broken by the mechanics of an overturn.\n    dance_violation_scores = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Viennese Waltz', 'score': 2},\n        'B': {'name': 'English Waltz', 'score': 3},\n        'C': {'name': 'European Tango', 'score': 10},\n        'D': {'name': 'Slow Foxtrot', 'score': 4},\n        'E': {'name': 'Quickstep', 'score': 5},\n    }\n\n    print(\"The core of this problem lies in the unique technique of the European Tango.\")\n    print(\"Unlike other standard dances, Tango has no rise and fall, and no body sway.\")\n    print(\"Overturning a rotation requires mechanics (like lifting or swaying) that fundamentally violate this core principle.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe can model this with a 'technique violation score' for each dance.\")\n\n    # Find the dance with the maximum violation score.\n    highest_score = 0\n    correct_answer_letter = ''\n    for letter, data in dance_violation_scores.items():\n        if data['score'] > highest_score:\n            highest_score = data['score']\n            correct_answer_letter = letter\n\n    # Construct and print the \"equation\" of scores to satisfy the prompt.\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is finding the maximum of the scores:\")\n    all_scores = [str(data['score']) for data in dance_violation_scores.values()]\n    print(f\"max({', '.join(all_scores)}) = {highest_score}\")\n\n    winner_name = dance_violation_scores[correct_answer_letter]['name']\n    print(f\"\\nThe dance with the highest violation score is '{winner_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct answer is {correct_answer_letter}.\")\n\n\nsolve_dance_technique_puzzle()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
