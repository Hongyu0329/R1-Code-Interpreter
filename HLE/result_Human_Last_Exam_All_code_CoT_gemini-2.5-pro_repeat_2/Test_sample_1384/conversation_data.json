    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can follow these steps. The number is extremely small, so we'll use logarithms to determine its leading digits.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Let the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$.\n2.  To find the leading digits of $N$, we analyze its base-10 logarithm, $\\log_{10}(N)$.\n3.  Using the properties of logarithms, we have $\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$.\n4.  We can express $\\log_{10}(N)$ as the sum of its integer part (characteristic) and its fractional part (mantissa): $\\log_{10}(N) = I + f$, where $I$ is an integer and $0 \\le f < 1$.\n5.  From this, we can write $N = 10^{I+f} = 10^f \\times 10^I$.\n6.  The factor $10^I$ determines the position of the decimal point (i.e., the number of leading zeros).\n7.  The factor $A = 10^f$ determines the sequence of non-zero digits. Since $0 \\le f < 1$, we have $1 \\le A < 10$. The first digits of $N$ will be the first digits of $A$.\n8.  The calculation involves very large and very precise numbers, so we will use the `mpmath` library in Python for high-precision arithmetic. The script will calculate the values for each part of the governing equation and print them.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision for the calculations. 50 decimal places is sufficient.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 50\n\n# We want to find the first two non-zero digits of N = e^(-7^13).\n# The method is to compute the base-10 logarithm of N.\n# log10(N) = log10(e^(-7^13)) = -7^13 * log10(e)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the value of the exponent 7^13.\nc = 7**13\nprint(f\"The governing equation is log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e).\")\nprint(f\"First, we evaluate the term 7^13:\")\nprint(f\"7^13 = {c}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Get a precise value for log10(e).\nlog10_e = mpmath.log10(mpmath.e)\nprint(f\"Next, we evaluate the term log10(e):\")\nprint(f\"log10(e) = {log10_e}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Compute the full logarithm log10(N).\nlog_N = -c * log10_e\nprint(f\"Now, we compute the product to get log10(N):\")\nprint(f\"log10(N) = -{c} * {log10_e}\")\nprint(f\"log10(N) = {log_N}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Decompose log10(N) into its integer and fractional parts.\n# N = 10^(log_N) = 10^(integer_part + fractional_part)\n# N = 10^fractional_part * 10^integer_part\n# The leading digits are determined by 10^fractional_part.\ninteger_part = mpmath.floor(log_N)\nfractional_part = log_N - integer_part\nprint(f\"We decompose the logarithm into its integer and fractional parts (mantissa):\")\nprint(f\"Integer Part = {integer_part}\")\nprint(f\"Mantissa = {fractional_part}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the value of the leading digits.\nleading_digits_val = mpmath.power(10, fractional_part)\nprint(f\"The leading non-zero digits are given by 10 to the power of the mantissa:\")\nprint(f\"10^{fractional_part} = {leading_digits_val}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 6: Extract the first two digits from the result.\nleading_digits_str = str(leading_digits_val)\nfirst_digit = leading_digits_str[0]\nsecond_digit = leading_digits_str[2]\nresult = first_digit + second_digit\n\nprint(f\"The first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are the first two digits of the number above.\")\nprint(f\"The first two non-zero digits are: {result}\")\n```\n<<<36>>>"
