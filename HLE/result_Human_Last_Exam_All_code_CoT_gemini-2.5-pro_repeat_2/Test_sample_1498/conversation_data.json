    "My plan is to first identify the specific verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi where the names of the prophets are explicitly listed. The poem dedicates a specific section to enumerate the 25 prophets one must know. I will pinpoint the starting verse and the ending verse of this enumeration.\n\nThen, I will write a simple Python script. This script will store the starting and ending verse numbers in variables and then print them out in a clear, formatted message, fulfilling the requirement to output each number.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The enumeration of the 25 prophets begins at verse 34.\n    start_bayt = 34\n\n    # The list of names concludes at verse 37.\n    end_bayt = 37\n\n    print(\"In Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen), the names of the Prophets are mentioned in the verses spanning from:\")\n    print(f\"Starting Bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"Ending Bayt: {end_bayt}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the names are listed from bayt 34 to bayt 37.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 34 to bayt 37>>>"
