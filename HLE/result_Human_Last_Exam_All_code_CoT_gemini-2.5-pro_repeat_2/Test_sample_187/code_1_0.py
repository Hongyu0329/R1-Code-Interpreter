    - Line 11: Uses `^` for power, but it's XOR in Python. Should be `**`.
    - Lines 22, 23: Use `/` for division, which results in float division in Python, not the required exact rational division from Sage.
    - Lines 29, 30, 31: Use `^` on a Sage symbolic expression, which raises a TypeError because XOR is not defined for that type.
