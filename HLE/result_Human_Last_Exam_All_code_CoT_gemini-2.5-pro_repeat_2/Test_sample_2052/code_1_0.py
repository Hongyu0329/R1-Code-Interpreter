  This function provides the answers to the user's questions based on the theory of matrix models and integrable systems.

  (a) For n=3, the model corresponds to the celebrated Kontsevich model, which is a prime example of a superintegrable system. Its partition function is the tau-function of the KdV hierarchy.

  (b) For n=4, the model's integrability is governed by the W3-algebra, which is richer than the Virasoro algebra (W2) for the n=3 case. To generate the partition function, an operator reflecting this more complex W3 structure is essential and cannot be reduced to simpler operators.
