def find_maclaurin_coefficient():
    """
    This function calculates the 4th Maclaurin series coefficient of the given expression.

    The function is of the form f(x) = f1(x) + f2(x), where:
    f1(x) = 9 * x**4 / (16 * e)
    f2(x) is a very complex fraction.

    A leading-order analysis of f2(x) shows that its numerator is of order O(x^7)
    and its denominator is of order O(x^12). This results in f2(x) having a pole
    of order 5 at x=0 (O(x^-5)), which means the function as written does not have
    a Maclaurin series.

    This suggests a typo in the problem statement. Assuming the problem intends for f2(x)
    to be analytic and its series expansion to start at a power higher than 4 (a common
    construct in such problems), the contribution of f2(x) to the 4th coefficient would be 0.
    For instance, if the term (cos(...) - 1/e) was (cos(...) - 1), f2(x) would be O(x^19).

    Under this assumption, the 4th Maclaurin coefficient is determined solely by f1(x).
