    "This statement is true. Here is an explanation and a simulation to demonstrate why.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the concepts:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical, population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of variation in a trait that is due to the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered. It's the *maximum possible* predictive power you could achieve if you knew the true effect size of every single SNP.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. It's a number calculated for an individual that summarizes their genetic predisposition for a trait. It is built using SNP effect sizes that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) conducted on a finite sample of people (the \"discovery cohort\").\n\n2.  **Explain the discrepancy:**\n    *   Because the effect sizes used to build a PGS are *estimated* from a limited sample, they are not the true effect sizes. They contain statistical noise and are subject to errors.\n    *   When this PGS is then applied to a new, independent group of people (the \"target cohort\") to predict their traits, its accuracy is measured. This accuracy, often quantified by R² (the variance explained), will be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP) because it's based on imperfect, estimated data.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate with a simulation:**\n    *   We will simulate a scenario where we know the \"true\" SNP heritability.\n    *   We will generate a \"discovery\" dataset and use it to estimate SNP effect sizes, just like in a real GWAS.\n    *   We will then generate a \"target\" dataset.\n    *   We will calculate a PGS for the target dataset using the estimated effects and measure its predictive R².\n    *   Finally, we will compare the resulting PGS R² to the true SNP heritability we started with, showing that the former is lower than the latter.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\ndef simulate_pgs_vs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the variance explained by a Polygenic Score (PGS R^2)\n    is lower than the true SNP heritability (h^2_SNP).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
