    "This is a biological question about the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish. I will provide the answer in the requested Python code format by using a print statement to output the information.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the brain anatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*) or closely related cephalopods.\n2.  Identify the palliovisceral lobe within the subesophageal mass of the brain.\n3.  Locate the structures that are positioned posteriorly (towards the rear of the animal) and adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe.\n4.  Write a Python script that uses a `print()` function to display the names of these adjacent posterior brain regions.\n\n```python\ndef print_cuttlefish_brain_anatomy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions that lie\n    adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a large lobe in the posterior subesophageal mass\n    # of the cephalopod brain. It is primarily involved in controlling the viscera,\n    # gills, and mantle for respiration and locomotion.\n    \n    # The brain regions lying most posteriorly in the brain, adjacent to the\n    # palliovisceral lobe, are the giant fiber lobes and the posterior chromatophore lobes.\n    # The giant fiber lobes initiate the powerful jet-propulsion escape response, and\n    # the posterior chromatophore lobes control skin patterning on the mantle.\n\n    adjacent_posterior_lobes = [\n        \"Giant fiber lobes\",\n        \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for lobe in adjacent_posterior_lobes:\n        print(f\"- {lobe}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nprint_cuttlefish_brain_anatomy()\n```\n<<<The giant fiber lobes and the posterior chromatophore lobes lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
