    Analyzes the set theory problem and provides a step-by-step logical argument

    print("Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.")
    print("We are asked if a function f: [kappa^{++}]^2 -> kappa can exist with the following property:")
    print("For every subset x of kappa^{++} with order type (otp) kappa^+ + kappa, the size of the image |f''[x]^2| must be kappa.")
    print("\n--------------------------------\n")

    print("Logical Derivation:")
    print("Step 1: Assume for contradiction that such a function 'f' exists.")
    print("\nStep 2: Apply partition calculus theorems (provable in ZFC).")
    print("A key result in partition calculus is that for any coloring, we can find large 'almost monochromatic' structures.")
    print("A careful application of the proof method for the theorem kappa^{++} -> (kappa^+)^2_kappa allows us to find two sets, A and C:")

    print("  - A set C with |C| = kappa^{++}.")
    print("These sets have the property that f is constant on pairs within A (with color 'c'), and also on pairs between A and C (also with color 'c').")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Construct a specific counterexample set, x_contra.")
    print("The function f, when restricted to pairs from C, is a coloring. We can apply another ZFC theorem: kappa^{++} -> (kappa + 1)^2_kappa.")
    print("This theorem guarantees a subset B_star of C with otp(B_star) = kappa + 1, on which f is constant with some color 'd'.")
    print("Let's take B to be an initial segment of B_star with otp(B) = kappa. We can arrange it so that all elements of B are greater than all elements of A.")
    print("Now, we form our special set: x_contra = A U B.")
    print("The order type of x_contra is otp(A) + otp(B) = (kappa^+) + (kappa) = kappa^+ + kappa.")
    print("This means x_contra is a set for which the property of f must hold.")

    print("\nStep 4: Analyze the colors on x_contra to find a contradiction.")
    print("The set of pairs from x_contra, [x_contra]^2, can be broken into three parts:")
    print("  1. Pairs within A: f''[A]^2 = {c} (by construction of A).")
    print("  2. Pairs within B: f''[B]^2 = {d} (by construction of B).")
    print("  3. Cross-pairs {a, b} where a is in A and b is in B: The image is {c} (by construction of C).")
    print("So, the total set of colors f''[x_contra]^2 is the union {c} U {d} U {c}, which is {c, d}.")
    print("The size of this set, |f''[x_contra]^2|, is at most 2.")

    print("\nStep 5: The Contradiction.")
    print("The property of our assumed function 'f' requires that for x_contra, |f''[x_contra]^2| = kappa.")
    print("Our construction shows that for this same set, |f''[x_contra]^2| <= 2.")
    print("This implies the following equation must be true:")
    
    kappa = "kappa"
    equation_rhs = 2
    print(f"Final Equation: {kappa} <= {equation_rhs}")

    print(f"\nThis is a contradiction, as kappa is an infinite cardinal, so it cannot be less than or equal to {equation_rhs}.")
    print("Our initial assumption must be false.")

    print("\n--------------------------------\n")
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("No such function 'f' can exist. The argument relies only on ZFC and does not need any extra assumptions like the existence of a Kurepa tree.")
