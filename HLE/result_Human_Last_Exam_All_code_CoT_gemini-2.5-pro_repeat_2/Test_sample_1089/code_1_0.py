    # Analysis: The repair method is "build-up of layers of filler material".
    # This method is additive, designed to restore lost material and dimensional integrity.
    # Let's evaluate the choices based on this repair method.
    
    # Blade Tip Rub and Wear is a gradual loss of material from the blade tip due to contact
    # with the engine shroud. Restoring the lost material by adding "layers of filler material"
    # via TIG welding is the direct and standard repair for this type of damage.
    # This ensures the correct tip clearance is maintained for engine efficiency.
