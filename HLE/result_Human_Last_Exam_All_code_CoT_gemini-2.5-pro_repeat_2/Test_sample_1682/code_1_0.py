While the phoenix crown (凤冠) and xiapei (霞帔) were indeed formalized as elite wedding attire in the Ming Dynasty, the 'dragon and phoenix robe' was not. This makes the statement inaccurate.",
        'B': "Correct. In the Zhou Dynasty, it was a custom for brides to cover their face with a veil, a practice recorded in classic texts like the 'Book of Rites,' symbolizing modesty.",
        'C': "Correct. During the Tang and Song dynasties, it was a common practice for women, including brides, to use a fan (often a round fan, 团扇) to shield their faces as a sign of coyness and modesty.",
        'D': "Correct. The xiapei (霞帔), a decorative stole, became a part of the official attire for noblewomen from the Song dynasty onward. The phoenix crown (凤冠) became exceptionally elaborate during the Ming Dynasty (after the Song), serving as formal headdress for empresses and high-ranking nobility, and was adopted for weddings.",
        'E': "Correct. This description accurately portrays a common wedding outfit for Han Chinese brides during the Qing Dynasty, which combined Han traditions (red color, embroidery) with some elements of Manchu clothing styles."
