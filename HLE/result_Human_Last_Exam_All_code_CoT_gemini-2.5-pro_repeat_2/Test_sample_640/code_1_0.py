# The problem asks to identify all correct statements from the given list.
# Based on the principles of quantum scattering theory, we have determined the validity of each statement.

# 1) Correct. Coupling in the S-matrix reflects coupling in the potential.
# 2) Correct. This is a specific case of statement 1. A diagonal S-matrix implies the potential is diagonal in the same basis.
# 3) Correct. Coupling in the potential propagates to the Jost matrix.
# 4) False. A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix can result in a trivially coupled S-matrix (e.g., S=I).
# 5) False. A diagonal (trivially coupled) Jost matrix implies a trivially coupled potential.

# The list of correct statement numbers.
correct_statements = [1, 2, 3]

# Print the final answer.
print("The list of all correct statements is:")
