    # (since u''(x) = exp(u(x)) > 0). A convex function on [0, 1] with
    # u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0 must be non-positive (u(x) <= 0).

    # This property is essential to prove that the integral operator associated with the
    # problem is a contraction. Therefore, we must include this constraint in the
    # definition of our space M.
