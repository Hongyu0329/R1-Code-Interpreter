    This function solves part (b) of the problem by calculating the number of
    similarity classes for 3x3 diagonal matrices with eigenvalues chosen from
    a distinct set of three values.

    Plan:
    1. A similarity class of a diagonal matrix is determined by its multiset of
       eigenvalues.
    2. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct multisets of size 3
       from a set of 3 distinct elements {alpha, beta, gamma}.
    3. This is a combinations with replacement problem, solved with the formula
       C(n + k - 1, k).
