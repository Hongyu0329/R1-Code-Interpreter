    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Curve's Jacobian:** I will use the established formula that connects the Neron-Severi rank of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, to the Neron-Severi rank of its Jacobian variety, $\\rho(J(C))$.\n2.  **Find the Minimum Rank of NS(J(C)):** I will determine the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve. This corresponds to the case of a \"very general\" curve.\n3.  **Find the Maximum Rank of NS(J(C)):** I will determine the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$. This occurs for \"special\" curves whose Jacobians have additional structure, specifically Complex Multiplication (CM) and are decomposable into a product of elliptic curves.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ranks for X:** Using the results from steps 2 and 3 and the formula from step 1, I will calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n\nThe python code below will walk through these steps, explain the reasoning, and compute the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15),\")\n    print(f\"where C is a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: The Key Formula ---\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the symmetric power, rho(C^(d)), is related to the rank\")\n    print(\"of the Neron-Severi group of the curve's Jacobian variety, rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(f\"For a symmetric power of degree d >= g (here, {d} >= {g}), the formula is:\")\n    print(\"rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1\")\n    print(\"Thus, our task is to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(J(C)).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The minimum value for rho(J(C)) occurs for a 'very general' curve C.\")\n    print(\"For such a curve, its Jacobian J(C) has only the trivial endomorphisms (End(J(C)) = Z).\")\n    print(\"In this case, the Neron-Severi group NS(J(C)) has rank 1, generated by the class of the theta divisor.\")\n    min_rho_JC = 1\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimum possible rank is rho(J(C)) = {min_rho_JC}.\")\n\n    # Calculate the smallest rank for X\n    smallest_rank_X = min_rho_JC + 1\n    print(\"\\nThe smallest rank of NS(X) is then:\")\n    print(f\"rho_min(X) = rho_min(J(C)) + 1 = {min_rho_JC} + 1 = {smallest_rank_X}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Largest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The maximum value for rho(J(C)) occurs for a 'special' curve C, whose Jacobian has\")\n    print(\"the largest possible number of endomorphisms (a property called Complex Multiplication) and is decomposable.\")\n    print(f\"For a genus g = {g} curve, the maximum is achieved when J(C) is isogenous to a product of g elliptic curves,\")\n    print(\"each with Complex Multiplication (CM).
