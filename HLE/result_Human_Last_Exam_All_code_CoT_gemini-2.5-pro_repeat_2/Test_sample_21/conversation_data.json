    "This problem requires finding the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which a given polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This can be solved using the Chebotarev Density Theorem from algebraic number theory.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Connection to Galois Theory:** The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is related to the structure of the Galois group of $f(x)$, let's call it $G$.\n2.  **Identify the Condition for Irreducibility:** For $f(x)$ (a degree 7 polynomial) to be irreducible modulo $p$, the corresponding element in the Galois group (the Frobenius element) must act as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots of the polynomial.\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group:** The crucial step is to identify the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. This is a known result from the mathematical literature: the Galois group is the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, one of the finite simple groups.\n4.  **Calculate the Order of the Group:** I will calculate the size of the group $G = PSL(2,7)$.\n5.  **Count the 7-Cycles:** I will count the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$. In its degree-7 permutation representation, these elements are precisely the 7-cycles. This can be done using Sylow's Theorems.\n6.  **Compute the Density:** The desired density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nThe following Python code carries out these calculations and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the problem and the relevant theorem.\n    # By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the desired density is the proportion of\n    # elements in the Galois group G of f(x) that act as 7-cycles on the polynomial's roots.\n    print(\"The density is given by the formula: (Number of 7-cycles in G) / (Order of G)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the Galois group G and its order.\n    # For the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22, the Galois group G\n    # is known to be the projective special linear group PSL(2,7).\n    # The order of PSL(2,q) is given by (q+1)*q*(q-1) / gcd(2, q-1).\n    # For q=7: (7+1)*7*(7-1) / gcd(2, 6) = 8*7*6 / 2 = 168.\n    group_order = 168\n    print(f\"The Galois group is G = PSL(2,7).\")\n    print(f\"The order of G is {group_order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of 7-cycles in G.\n    # In the degree-7 permutation representation of G, the 7-cycles are the elements of order 7.\n    # We can count these using Sylow's Theorems.\n    # The number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide |G|/7 and be congruent to 1 mod 7.\n    # n_7 divides 168/7 = 24.
