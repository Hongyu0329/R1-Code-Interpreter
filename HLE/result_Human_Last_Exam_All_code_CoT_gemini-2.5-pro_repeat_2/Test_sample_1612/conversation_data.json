    "Of course. In Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batters and one for pitchers. To find the total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown, we need to count the winners for each category and add them together.\n\nHere is the Python code that calculates and displays the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mlb_triple_crown():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n    The Triple Crown can be won by a batter (leading the league in batting average,\n    home runs, and RBIs) or a pitcher (leading in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n    This function sums the unique winners from both categories.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # There are 16 unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n    num_batting_winners = 16\n\n    # There are 22 unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n    num_pitching_winners = 22\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners.\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of unique Triple Crown winners in MLB, we add the number of batting winners and pitching winners.\")\n    print(\"\\nNumber of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {}\".format(num_batting_winners))\n    print(\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {}\".format(num_pitching_winners))\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(\"{} + {} = {}\".format(num_batting_winners, num_pitching_winners, total_winners))\n\nsolve_mlb_triple_crown()\n<<<38>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
