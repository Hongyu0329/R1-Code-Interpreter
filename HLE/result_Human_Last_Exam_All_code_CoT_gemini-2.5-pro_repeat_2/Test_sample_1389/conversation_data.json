    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is one that provides complete protection to a fraction of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the rest. We want to determine if the standard formula for vaccine efficacy, `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)`, accurately reflects the true efficacy of this type of vaccine.\n\nHere is the plan to answer this question using a logical demonstration:\n1.  Define the parameters for a hypothetical scenario, including the true vaccine efficacy (`VE_s`), which is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected.\n2.  Assume a constant background infection rate (force of infection, `λ`) for any susceptible person.\n3.  Calculate the incidence rate (IR) in an unvaccinated group, where all individuals are susceptible.\n4.  Calculate the incidence rate (IR) in the vaccinated group. In this group, only the unprotected fraction (`1 - VE_s`) is susceptible to the infection rate `λ`. The overall IR for the vaccinated group will be lower because a large portion of the group is immune.\n5.  Compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_vaccinated / IR_unvaccinated`).\n6.  Calculate the estimated vaccine efficacy using the formula `VE_estimated = 1 - IRR`.\n7.  Compare the `VE_estimated` to the original `VE_s` to see if the formula results in an overestimate, underestimate, or a correct estimate.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to demonstrate the relationship.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_all_or_nothing_vaccine():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether 1 - IRR correctly estimates the efficacy\n    of an all-or-nothing vaccine by demonstrating with a hypothetical scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for the hypothetical scenario.\n    # True efficacy (VE_s): The proportion of vaccinated people who are fully protected.\n    ve_s_true = 0.90  # 90% of vaccinated individuals are rendered fully immune.\n\n    # Force of infection (lambda): The rate at which susceptible individuals get infected.\n    # We'll use a rate of 50 cases per 1,000 person-years.\n    force_of_infection = 0.050\n\n    # Total person-time observed in each group (e.g., 100,000 people followed for 1 year).\n    person_years_unvaccinated = 100000.0\n    person_years_vaccinated = 100000.0\n\n    print(\"--- Scenario: All-or-Nothing Vaccine Efficacy Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"True Vaccine Efficacy (VE_s), i.e., the proportion protected: {ve_s_true:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Infection rate for any susceptible person (lambda): {force_of_infection:.3f} cases per person-year\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n    # In the unvaccinated group, all 100,000 person-years are at risk.\n    cases_unvaccinated = person_years_unvaccinated * force_of_infection\n    ir_unvaccinated = cases_unvaccinated / person_years_unvaccinated\n    print(\"1.
