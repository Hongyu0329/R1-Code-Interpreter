    "This is a fascinating question from the field of topology, a branch of mathematics. The problem of classifying all homogeneous planar continua was a long-standing open problem that was solved through the contributions of several mathematicians over many decades.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: First, I'll explain what a \"homogeneous planar continuum\" is. This will involve defining each term: continuum, planar, and homogeneous.\n2.  **The Classification Theorem**: The solution to this problem comes from a major theorem in topology. The theorem classifies these objects by dividing them into two distinct categories: those that separate the plane and those that do not.\n3.  **Count the Classes**:\n    *   I'll state the number of homeomorphism classes for the continua that **do not** separate the plane, based on a result by R. H. Bing.\n    *   I'll state the number of homeomorphism classes for the continua that **do** separate the plane, based on a result by J. Prajs and J. T. Rogers, Jr.\n4.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of classes is simply the sum of the counts from the two categories.\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script that assigns these counts to variables and prints the final summation, showing how the total is calculated.\n\n### Execution:\n\nA **homogeneous planar continuum** is a specific type of geometric object that can be drawn on a flat plane without lifting the pen (it's connected and compact) and has the special property that it \"looks the same\" from every point. For any two points on the object, there's a way to bend and stretch the object (a homeomorphism) to move the first point to the second.\n\nThe classification of these objects splits them into two types:\n\n1.  **Non-separating continua**: These are objects that, when placed in the plane, do not cut it into two or more pieces. A famous theorem by R. H. Bing proved there are exactly **2** such objects: the **circle** and the **pseudo-arc**.\n2.  **Separating continua**: These objects do cut the plane into separate regions. A theorem by J. Prajs and J. T. Rogers, Jr. proved there are exactly **3** such objects.\n\nTo find the total number of homeomorphism classes, we add the number of classes from each category.\n\n```python\n# The problem of classifying homogeneous planar continua is solved by\n# dividing them into two types based on whether they separate the plane.\n\n# 1. According to a theorem by R. H. Bing, the number of homogeneous\n#    planar continua that DO NOT separate the plane is 2.\n#    (These are the circle and the pseudo-arc).\nnum_non_separating_classes = 2\n\n# 2. According to a theorem by J. Prajs and J. T. Rogers, Jr., the number of\n#    homogeneous planar continua that DO separate the plane is 3.\nnum_separating_classes = 3\n\n# The total number of classes is the sum of these two counts.\ntotal_classes = num_non_separating_classes + num_separating_classes\n\n# Print the final equation and the answer.\nprint(f\"The total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is the sum of the non-separating and separating classes.\")\nprint(f\"{num_non_separating_classes} + {num_separating_classes} = {total_classes}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
