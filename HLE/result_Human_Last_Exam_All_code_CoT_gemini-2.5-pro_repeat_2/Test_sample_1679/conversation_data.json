    "To find the first Best Picture winner featuring a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisk Locations:** There are two famous Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, at the entrance to the Luxor Temple. The other was gifted to France in 1833 and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n2.  **Compile a Database:** I will create a data structure containing a list of early Academy Award winners for Best Picture, along with their primary settings.\n3.  **Programmatic Search:** I will write a Python script to iterate through this list chronologically.\n4.  **Identify the Film:** The script will search the setting information of each film for \"Place de la Concorde\" or \"Luxor Temple\". The first film that matches this condition is the answer.\n5.  **Output the Answer:** The script will print the title of the identified film.\n\nThis approach simulates a search through film history to pinpoint the correct movie.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \n    This is done by searching a pre-compiled list of winners and their settings\n    for key locations: Place de la Concorde in Paris or Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A database of early Best Picture winners and their settings.\n    # The settings are annotated with specific landmarks where known.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        # Award year corresponds to the film's release year.\n        1928: {\"winner\": \"Wings\", \"setting\": [\"France\", \"World War I\"]},\n        1929: {\"winner\": \"The Broadway Melody\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1930: {\"winner\": \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"setting\": [\"Germany\", \"France\"]},\n        1931: {\"winner\": \"Cimarron\", \"setting\": [\"Oklahoma\"]},\n        1932: {\"winner\": \"Grand Hotel\", \"setting\": [\"Berlin\"]},\n        1933: {\"winner\": \"Cavalcade\", \"setting\": [\"London\"]},\n        1934: {\"winner\": \"It Happened One Night\", \"setting\": [\"United States\"]},\n        1935: {\"winner\": \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"setting\": [\"Sea\", \"Tahiti\", \"England\"]},\n        1936: {\"winner\": \"The Great Ziegfeld\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1937: {\"winner\": \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"setting\": [\"Paris\"]},\n        1938: {\"winner\": \"You Can't Take It with You\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1939: {\"winner\": \"Gone with the Wind\", \"setting\": [\"American South\"]},\n        1940: {\"winner\": \"Rebecca\", \"setting\": [\"England\"]},\n        1941: {\"winner\": \"How Green Was My Valley\", \"setting\": [\"Wales\"]},\n        1942: {\"winner\": \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"setting\": [\"England\"]},\n        1943: {\"winner\": \"Casablanca\", \"setting\": [\"Morocco\"]},\n        1944: {\"winner\": \"Going My Way\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1945: {\"winner\": \"The Lost Weekend\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1946: {\"winner\": \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", \"setting\": [\"United States\"]},\n        1947: {\"winner\": \"Gentleman's Agreement\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1948: {\"winner\": \"Hamlet\", \"setting\": [\"Denmark\"]},\n        1949: {\"winner\": \"All the King's Men\", \"setting\": [\"American South\"]},\n        1950: {\"winner\": \"All About Eve\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1951: {\"winner\": \"An American in Paris\", \"setting\": [\"Paris\", \"Place de la Concorde\"]},\n        1952: {\"winner\": \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"setting\": [\"United States\"]},\n        1953: {\"winner\": \"From Here to Eternity\", \"setting\": [\"Hawaii\"]},\n        1954: {\"winner\": \"On the Waterfront\", \"setting\": [\"New Jersey\"]},\n        1955: {\"winner\": \"Marty\", \"setting\": [\"New York City\"]},\n        1956: {\"winner\": \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \"setting\": [\"Global\", \"Paris\"]},\n        1962: {\"winner\": \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"setting\": [\"Arabian Peninsula\", \"Egypt\"]},\n    }\n\n    # The locations of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n    obelisk_locations = [\"Place de la Concorde\", \"Luxor Temple\"]\n\n    # Sort the dictionary by year to find the *first* winner chronologically.\n    sorted_years = sorted(best_picture_winners.keys())\n\n    for year in sorted_years:\n        film = best_picture_winners[year]\n        film_settings = film[\"setting\"]\n        \n        # Check if any of the film's settings match our target locations.\n        for location in obelisk_locations:\n            if location in film_settings:\n                print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk is: {film['winner']} ({year})\")\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_first_movie_with_luxor_obelisk()\n\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
