    "To solve this, we need to understand the principles of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal of CTIS:** The objective of CTIS is to capture a 3D data cube, which contains two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ), all from a single 2D image captured by a camera sensor.\n2.  **Relate to Computed Tomography (CT):** The technique is analogous to medical CT scanning. In medical CT, a 3D volume of a body is reconstructed from multiple 2D X-ray projections taken from different angles. In CTIS, the 3D data cube (x, y, λ) is reconstructed from multiple 2D \"projections\" that are created on the sensor by a diffraction grating.\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** The diffraction grating is a disperser. It splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders. The 0th order is an undispersed image, while the higher orders (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.) are dispersed, meaning the light is spread out by wavelength.\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Requirement:**\n    *   To reconstruct the two spatial dimensions (x and y) for each wavelength, the tomographic algorithm needs projections from at least two non-collinear (i.e., not parallel) directions.\n    *   A single **1D grating** only disperses light along one axis. This provides projections in only one direction, which is insufficient to resolve the 2D spatial information without severe artifacts and ambiguity. It's like trying to figure out the shape of a 2D object from shadows cast from only one direction.\n    *   To provide projections along two independent axes (e.g., an X-axis and a Y-axis), we need dispersion in two directions. This is achieved by using the equivalent of **two 1D gratings**, typically oriented perpendicularly to each other.\n    *   In practice, these two gratings are often fabricated as a single component known as a **2D crossed grating** or a computer-generated hologram (CGH) that serves the same purpose. However, fundamentally, it performs the function of two gratings.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of gratings (or grating functions) required is 2.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_requirement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    needed for computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In CTIS, we want to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, lambda).\n    # For each wavelength (lambda), we need to reconstruct a 2D spatial image (x, y).\n    # This is a tomographic reconstruction problem.\n    num_spatial_dimensions_to_reconstruct = 2\n\n    # A single 1D diffraction grating provides spectral dispersion along one axis.\n    # This provides the \"projections\" needed for reconstruction along one dimension.\n    gratings_needed_per_dimension = 1\n\n    # To reconstruct a 2D image, we need projections along two independent axes.\n    # Therefore, we need the function of two gratings.\n    min_required_gratings = num_spatial_dimensions_to_reconstruct * gratings_needed_per_dimension\n\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) reconstructs a 3D data cube (2 spatial, 1 spectral dimension).\")\n    print(\"The reconstruction of the 2D spatial image at each wavelength requires tomographic projections from multiple angles.\")\n    print(f\"To reconstruct the {num_spatial_dimensions_to_reconstruct} spatial dimensions (x and y), we need projections along {num_spatial_dimensions_to_reconstruct} independent axes.\")\n    print(f\"One diffraction grating provides the necessary projections for {gratings_needed_per_dimension} dimension.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimum number of gratings is determined by the number of spatial dimensions.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_spatial_dimensions_to_reconstruct} (spatial dimensions) * {gratings_needed_per_dimension} (grating per dimension) = {min_required_gratings}\")\n\nsolve_ctis_grating_requirement()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
