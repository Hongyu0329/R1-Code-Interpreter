    "My plan is to identify the specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* based on the details provided. The key clues are: the character visited a Roman city and described a religious practice involving founders who are recognizable as Romulus and Remus (i.e., suckled by a she-wolf).\n\nAfter reviewing the text's summary and character list, I have identified the character as Othr, Thiodolf's foster-father. He was once a captive of the Romans and recounts his experiences, including their origin story, in Chapter V.\n\nTo meet the request format, I will now create a Python script that prints this character's name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character\n    from William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes\n    the Roman foundation myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character who was a captive of the Romans and tells their story.\n    character_name = \"Othr\"\n    \n    # Print the full answer for the user.\n    print(f\"The character who visited a Roman city and described their religious practices, referring to a myth similar to Romulus and Remus, is {character_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Othr>>>"
