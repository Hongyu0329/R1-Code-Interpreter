    "Of course, I can help with that. The concept you're asking about is a \"tripled fixed point,\" which is a generalization of the idea of a fixed point (`f(x) = x`) to three functions and three variables.\n\n### **Plan and Explanation**\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the function definitions. The user's query has a likely typo, defining a function `G` twice. Standard definitions for an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" involve three distinct functions, typically `F`, `G`, and `H`. I will proceed assuming the standard cyclic definition:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z -> X`\n*   `G: Y * Z * X -> Y`\n*   `H: Z * X * Y -> Z`\n\nHere, `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are sets, often complete metric spaces (like the set of all real numbers, `R`).\n\n**1. What is an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point?**\n\nA triplet of points `(x, y, z)` from the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` respectively is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, z, x) = y`\n*   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\n**2. What are the Conditions for its Existence?**\n\nThe primary condition for the existence (and uniqueness) of such a fixed point comes from an extension of the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**. The core idea is that the combined operation must be a **contraction mapping**.\n\nLet's consider the three functions acting together as a single transformation `T` on the product space `X*Y*Z`:\n`T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y) )`\n\nThe main condition is:\n**The mapping `T` must be a contraction on the product space `X*Y*Z`.**\n\nThis means that for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)`, the distance between their transformations `T(p1)` and `T(p2)` is strictly less than the distance between `p1` and `p2`, scaled by a constant factor `k < 1`. Mathematically:\n\n`distance( T(p1), T(p2) ) <= k * distance( p1, p2 )` for some `0 <= k < 1`.\n\nIf this condition holds and the spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete, then a unique tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.\n\n**3. Demonstration with Code**\n\nI will now provide a Python script that demonstrates this. The script will:\n1.  Define three linear functions `F`, `G`, `H` that collectively satisfy the contraction condition over the real numbers.\n2.  Start from an initial guess `(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)`.\n3.  Iteratively apply the functions (`x_new = F(x, y, z)`, etc.) until the values converge to the fixed point.\n4.  Print the final equations with the calculated fixed point values, demonstrating that they satisfy the conditions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define three functions F, G, H that satisfy the contraction condition.\n# For these linear functions, the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients\n# is 0.1+0.1+0.1 + 0.2+0.1+0.05 + 0.1+0.1+0.05 = 0.9, which is less than 1.\n# This guarantees that a unique tripled fixed point exists.\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Function F: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return 0.1 * x + 0.1 * y - 0.1 * z + 5\n\ndef G(y, z, x):\n    \"\"\"Function G: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return 0.2 * y + 0.1 * z + 0.05 * x + 2\n\ndef H(z, x, y):\n    \"\"\"Function H: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return -0.1 * z + 0.1 * x - 0.05 * y + 1\n\ndef find_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Iteratively finds the tripled fixed point (x, y, z) such that:\n    F(x, y, z) = x\n    G(y, z, x) = y\n    H(z, x, y) = z\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess\n    x, y, z = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n\n    # Iteration parameters\n    max_iterations = 1000\n    tolerance = 1e-9\n\n    print(\"Searching for the FGH-tripled fixed point...\")\n    print(\"Initial point (x,y,z) = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\\n\")\n\n    for i in range(max_iterations):\n        # Calculate the next point in the sequence\n        x_new = F(x, y, z)\n        y_new = G(y, z, x)\n        z_new = H(z, x, y)\n\n        # Check for convergence\n        if (math.isclose(x, x_new, rel_tol=tolerance) and\n            math.isclose(y, y_new, rel_tol=tolerance) and\n            math.isclose(z, z_new, rel_tol=tolerance)):\n            print(f\"Convergence reached after {i+1} iterations.\\n\")\n            x, y, z = x_new, y_new, z_new\n            break\n\n        # Update the current point\n        x, y, z = x_new, y_new, z_new\n    else:\n        print(\"Did not converge within the maximum number of iterations.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the results in the required format\n    print(f\"The calculated tripled fixed point is (x, y, z) = ({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}, {z:.4f})\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Final Equations ---\")\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"F({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}, {z:.4f}) = {F(x, y, z):.4f}, which is approximately x ({x:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"G({y:.4f}, {z:.4f}, {x:.4f}) = {G(y, z, x):.4f}, which is approximately y ({y:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"H({z:.4f}, {x:.4f}, {y:.4f}) = {H(z, x, y):.4f}, which is approximately z ({z:.4f})\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tripled_fixed_point()\n\n```\n<<<The essential condition is that the combined transformation T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y)) must be a contraction mapping on the product space X*Y*Z.>>>"
