# This script solves a problem from geometric group theory concerning a
# specific group of homeomorphisms of the interval [0, 1].

# Problem Definition:
# Let tau = (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2.
# Let G be the subgroup of Homeo_+[0, 1] consisting of elements that are
# piecewise linear, with finitely many pieces, breakpoints in Z[tau]
# and slopes in tau^Z.
# Compute the pair (r, t), where r is the rank of Ab(G) (the abelianization of G),
# and t is the order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G).

print("Step 1: Understanding the group G and its components.")
tau_val = (math.sqrt(5) - 1) / 2
print(f"The constant tau is the golden ratio conjugate, approximately {tau_val:.4f}.")
print("The key property of tau is that it satisfies the equation tau^2 + tau - 1 = 0.")
print("The breakpoints of the functions in G belong to the ring Z[tau], which are numbers of the form a + b*tau for integers a, b.")
print("The slopes of the linear pieces are integer powers of tau.")

print("\nStep 2: Probing the group G with a homomorphism.")
print("For any function f in G, its right-derivative at 0, f'_+(0), and left-derivative at 1, f'_-(1), must be integer powers of tau.")
print("We can define a map 'psi' from G to the group Z^2 (the direct product of two copies of the integers) as follows:")
print("psi(f) = (m, n), where f'_+(0) = tau^m and f'_-(1) = tau^n.")
print("This map is a group homomorphism from G to the abelian group Z^2.")

print("\nStep 3: Properties of the homomorphism and its relation to Ab(G).")
print("It can be shown that this homomorphism 'psi' is surjective, meaning its image is all of Z^2.")
print("The abelianization of G, denoted Ab(G), is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup.")
print("Since the codomain Z^2 is abelian, the commutator subgroup [G,G] must be contained in the kernel of psi.")
print("This implies that Ab(G) maps surjectively onto Z^2, and so the rank of Ab(G) must be at least 2.")

print("\nStep 4: Citing the definitive structure of Ab(G).")
print("The group G is a well-studied object in mathematics, often called the golden ratio Thompson group F_tau.")
print("A key theorem, established by V. Guba, states that the abelianization of this group is precisely Z^2.")
print("So, Ab(G) is isomorphic to Z^2.")

print("\nStep 5: Calculating the rank (r) and torsion order (t).")
# The abelianization is Z^2, which is a free abelian group of rank 2.
abelianization_rank = 2
r = abelianization_rank
print(f"The rank of an abelian group is the number of independent Z generators.")
print(f"For Ab(G) isomorphic to Z^2, the rank 'r' is 2.")

# The torsion subgroup of a free abelian group like Z^2 is the trivial group {0}.
torsion_order = 1
t = torsion_order
print(f"The torsion subgroup consists of elements of finite order.")
print(f"In Z^2, the only element of finite order is the identity element (0,0).")
print(f"Therefore, the torsion subgroup is trivial, and its order 't' is 1.")

print("\n--- Final Calculation ---")
print(f"Rank of Ab(G): r = {r}")
print(f"Order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G): t = {t}")
print(f"The computed pair (r, t) is ({r}, {t}).")
