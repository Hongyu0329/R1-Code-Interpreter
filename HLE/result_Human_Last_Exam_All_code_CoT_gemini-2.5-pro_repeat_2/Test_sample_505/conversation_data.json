    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to use the formula for surface codes.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Understand the Surface Code Formula:** For a 2D planar patch of surface code (which has a topological genus, g=0), the number of logical qubits `k` is determined by the number of holes `h` in the patch. The formula is `k = h`.\n2.  **Analyze the System:** The problem describes a system composed of two separate patches of surface code. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n3.  **Distribute the Holes:** We have a total of two holes to distribute across the two patches. The number of logical qubits is maximized when the total number of holes is maximized. Since the total is fixed at two, any distribution will result in the same total number of logical qubits.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** We will calculate the total number of logical qubits by summing the qubits from each patch, based on the principle that `total_qubits = total_holes`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and demonstrates it for a possible distribution of holes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_surface_code_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the problem statement\n    num_patches = 2\n    total_holes = 2\n\n    print(f\"System Configuration:\")\n    print(f\"- Number of separate surface code patches: {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"- Total number of holes across all patches: {total_holes}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculation Principle:\")\n    print(\"For a single planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to its number of holes (k=h).\\n\")\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each patch.\n    # Total k = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = h_patch1 + h_patch2\n    # Since h_patch1 + h_patch2 is the total number of holes, the total number of logical qubits\n    # is simply equal to the total number of holes, regardless of distribution.\n    total_logical_qubits = total_holes\n\n    # To demonstrate, let's consider one possible distribution:\n    # 1 hole in the first patch and 1 hole in the second patch.\n    holes_in_patch1 = 1\n    holes_in_patch2 = 1\n\n    # Calculate logical qubits for each patch based on this distribution\n    qubits_in_patch1 = holes_in_patch1\n    qubits_in_patch2 = holes_in_patch2\n    \n    print(\"Illustrative Calculation (1 hole per patch):\")\n    print(f\"Qubits in Patch 1 = {qubits_in_patch1}\")\n    print(f\"Qubits in Patch 2 = {qubits_in_patch2}\")\n    \n    # The final equation summing the parts\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = {qubits_in_patch1} + {qubits_in_patch2} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_surface_code_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
