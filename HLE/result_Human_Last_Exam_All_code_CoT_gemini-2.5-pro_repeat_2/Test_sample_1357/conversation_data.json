    "This is a problem in algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the classification of stable reduction types for curves. The condition that the Jacobian of the curve has good reduction imposes a strong topological constraint on the stable reduction: its dual graph must be a tree. This means the special fiber is a curve of \"compact type\".\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve `C_0` made of `v` components `C_i` is given by `p_a(C_0) = sum(p_a(C_i)) + delta - v + 1`, where `delta` is the number of nodes. For a tree-like dual graph, `delta_intercomponent = v - 1`. If we let `d_i` be the number of self-nodes on component `C_i` and `g_i` its geometric genus, the formula simplifies to `g = sum(g_i + d_i)`.\n\nFor a genus `g=4` curve, this means the sum of `g_i + d_i` over all components must be 4. Each component `C_i` must also satisfy the stability condition `2g_i - 2 + n_i > 0`, where `n_i` is the total number of nodes attached to it (`n_i = 2d_i + deg(v_i)` in the dual graph). This implies `2(g_i + d_i) - 2 + deg(v_i) > 0`.\n\nThe problem then becomes a combinatorial enumeration of all possible stable curves of arithmetic genus 4 whose dual graphs are trees. We can solve this by considering the number of components `v` in the stable reduction.\n\nThe following Python script systematically calculates the number of types for each possible number of components and sums them up to get the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    with good Jacobian reduction.\n\n    The method is a combinatorial enumeration based on the properties of\n    stable curves of compact type. The total number of types is the sum of\n    the types possible for each number of components (v) in the reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve with good Jacobian reduction.\")\n    print(\"The calculation proceeds by analyzing the possible number of components (v) in the stable reduction.\\n\")\n\n    # List to store the number of types for each case\n    num_types_per_case = []\n\n    # --- Case v=1: 1 component ---\n    # Equation: g + d = 4. g is geometric genus, d is number of self-nodes.\n    # The pairs (g,d) are (4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3), (0,4).\n    # All are stable.\n    v1_types = 5\n    num_types_per_case.append(v1_types)\n    print(f\"Number of types with v=1 component: {v1_types}\")\n\n    # --- Case v=2: 2 components ---\n    # Partition of 4 into 2 parts >= 1: {3,1} and {2,2}.\n    # Partition {3,1}:\n    #   p=3 types: 4 ((3,0),(2,1),(1,2),(0,3))\n    #   p=1 types: 2 ((1,0),(0,1))\n    v2_part1_types = 4 * 2\n    # Partition {2,2}:\n    #   p=2 types: 3 ((2,0),(1,1),(0,2))\n    #   Multiset of size 2 from 3 types: (3+2-1 choose 2) = 6\n    v2_part2_types = 6\n    v2_types = v2_part1_types + v2_part2_types\n    num_types_per_case.append(v2_types)\n    print(f\"Number of types with v=2 components: {v2_types}\")\n\n    # --- Case v=3: 3 components ---\n    # Partition of 4 into 3 parts >= 1: {2,1,1}.\n    # Arrangement 1: (p=1)--(p=2)--(p=1) on a path graph.\n    #   Center (p=2): 3 types.
