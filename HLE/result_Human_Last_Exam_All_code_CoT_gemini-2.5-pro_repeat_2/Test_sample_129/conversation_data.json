    "An excellent question that combines recursion, dynamic programming, and string manipulation. Here is a plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Generate Expressions**: We need to generate all syntactically valid boolean expressions of exactly length 5. A brute-force check of all 7^5 symbol combinations would be inefficient and complex. Instead, we can build expressions recursively (or using dynamic programming). An expression of length `k` can be formed from smaller valid expressions in three ways:\n    *   `!A`, where `A` is a valid expression of length `k-1`.\n    *   `(A)`, where `A` is a valid expression of length `k-2`.\n    *   `A op B`, where `op` is `&` or `|`, and `A` and `B` are valid expressions with lengths that sum to `k-1`.\n\n2.  **Memoize Results**: To avoid re-generating expressions for the same length multiple times, we'll store the set of generated expressions for each length in a cache (a technique called memoization).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Expressions**: For each unique valid expression of length 5, we need to determine its boolean value. We can write a helper function that converts the expression's symbols (`T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`) into their Python equivalents (`True`, `False`, `not`, `and`, `or`) and then uses Python's `eval()` function. This is a reliable approach because Python's boolean operators follow the same precedence rules specified in the problem (`! > & > |`).\n\n4.  **Count and Display**: We will iterate through all the generated expressions of length 5, evaluate each one, and count how many result in `True`. Finally, we will print each true expression and the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Use a dictionary for memoization to cache results for generate_expressions(k)\nmemo = {}\n\ndef generate_expressions(length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all syntactically valid boolean expressions of a given length\n    using dynamic programming and memoization.\n    Returns a set of expression strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # If we have computed this length before, return the cached result.\n    if length in memo:\n        return memo[length]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    if length <= 0:\n        return set()\n    if length == 1:\n        return {\"T\", \"F\"}\n\n    expressions = set()\n\n    # Rule 1: Form '!A' from expressions of length k-1\n    if length > 1:\n        sub_exprs = generate_expressions(length - 1)\n        for s in sub_exprs:\n            expressions.add(f\"!{s}\")\n\n    # Rule 2: Form '(A)' from expressions of length k-2\n    if length > 2:\n        sub_exprs = generate_expressions(length - 2)\n        for s in sub_exprs:\n            # We only add parentheses if the sub-expression is not a single literal,\n            # to avoid redundant forms like (T). However, the recursive generation\n            # might produce complex but valid expressions that need wrapping.\n            # A full parser would handle this, but for generation, adding all forms\n            # is safer.
