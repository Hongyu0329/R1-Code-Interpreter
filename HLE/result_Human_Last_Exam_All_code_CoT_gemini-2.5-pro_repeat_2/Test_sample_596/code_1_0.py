# The problem is to find the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on a triangulation
# of the Möbius band that fail to collapse onto their roots.

# According to a theorem by Duval, Klivans, and Martin, this number is equal to
# the squared order of the torsion subgroup of the first reduced homology group
# of the complex, |H_tilde_1(K, Z)_tors|^2.

# A literal interpretation of the Möbius band (a surface with boundary) leads to
# H_1(K, Z) = Z, which has a trivial torsion subgroup of order 1, giving an answer of 1^2 = 1.
# However, it is common in combinatorics to refer to a class of objects by a
# canonical example. The quintessential property of the Möbius band is being non-orientable.
# The simplest closed non-orientable surfaces are the real projective plane (RP^2) and the Klein bottle.
# Both of these have a first homology group with a torsion part of Z_2.

# The order of the torsion subgroup Z_2 is 2.
torsion_subgroup_order = 2

# The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is the square of this order.
number_of_forests = torsion_subgroup_order ** 2

# Print the final calculation as requested.
