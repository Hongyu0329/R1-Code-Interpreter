    "An elegant explanation of your method to solve the problem, followed by the complete code needed to achieve the solution.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Recurrence and its Characteristic Equation**:\n    The given recurrence relation is $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$. We assume a solution of the form $a_n = x^n$, which leads to the characteristic equation:\n    $x^n = 88x^{n-3} + 57x^{n-4}$\n    Dividing by $x^{n-4}$ (for $x\\neq 0$) gives:\n    $x^4 = 88x + 57 \\implies x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Factor the Characteristic Polynomial**:\n    The quartic polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials. By assuming a factorization of the form $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$, we can solve for the coefficients and find:\n    $x^4 - 88x - 57 = (x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Find the Roots**:\n    We find the roots of each quadratic factor:\n    -   For $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$, the roots are $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    -   For $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$, the roots are $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Dominant Root**:\n    The asymptotic behavior of the sequence $a_n$ is determined by the root with the largest magnitude. Let's compare the magnitudes:\n    -   $|2 + \\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n    -   $|2 - \\sqrt{7}| \\approx |2 - 2.646| = 0.646$\n    -   $|-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\n    The dominant root is $\\lambda = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$. For large $n$, $a_n$ behaves like $a_n \\sim C \\cdot \\lambda^n$ for some non-zero constant $C$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Asymptotic Behavior of $s_n$**:\n    The sum $s_n$ is composed of two parts: $s_{n} = S_1(n) - S_2(n-1)$.\n    -   $S_1(n) = \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$. For large $k$, the term $a_{2k-3} \\sim C\\lambda^{2k-3}$ grows much faster than $a_{k+100}$ or $a_{k+51}$. The sum is dominated by its last term, so $S_1(n) \\sim a_{2n-3} \\sim C\\lambda^{2n-3}$.\n    -   $S_2(n-1) = \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$. For large $k$, a term like $a_{k+i}a_{k-j}$ behaves like $(C\\lambda^{k+i})(C\\lambda^{k-j}) = C^2\\lambda^{2k+i-j}$. The dominant terms in the sum are $a_{k+1}a_{k-2}$, $a_{k+2}a_{k-3}$, and $a_{k+3}a_{k-4}$, which all grow like $\\lambda^{2k-1}$. The sum is dominated by its last term, so $S_2(n-1)$ is proportional to $\\lambda^{2(n-1)-1} = \\lambda^{2n-3}$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Limit**:\n    Since both $S_1(n)$ and $S_2(n-1)$ grow proportionally to $\\lambda^{2n-3}$, their difference $s_n$ will also grow proportionally to $\\lambda^{2n-3}$ (assuming the leading coefficients don't cancel out to exactly zero, which is a reasonable assumption in such problems). So, $s_n \\sim K \\cdot \\lambda^{2n-3}$ for some constant $K$.\n    The limit is then:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(K \\cdot \\lambda^{2n-3})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln K + (2n-3)\\ln\\lambda}{n}$\n    This simplifies to $2\\ln\\lambda$.\n    The value we need to find is the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**:\n    We will use Python to compute this value with sufficient precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the integer part of 10^4 * lim (ln(s_n)/n)\n    where the limit is 2 * ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final expression to calculate is 10000 * 2 * ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    # Let's break down the calculation and print each part as requested.\n\n    # Numbers from the final equation\n    multiplier = 10000\n    factor1 = 2\n    inner_val1 = 2\n    inner_val2 = 7\n    \n    print(f\"The equation is: floor({multiplier} * {factor1} * ln({inner_val1} + sqrt({inner_val2})))\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the value of the dominant root lambda = 2 + sqrt(7)\n    sqrt_of_7 = math.sqrt(inner_val2)\n    lambda_val = inner_val1 + sqrt_of_7\n    print(f\"The value of the dominant root lambda is: {lambda_val}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the limit L = 2 * ln(lambda)\n    limit_val = factor1 * math.log(lambda_val)\n    print(f\"The value of the limit L = 2 * ln(lambda) is: {limit_val}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Multiply by 10^4\n    final_value = multiplier * limit_val\n    print(f\"The value of 10^4 * L is: {final_value}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Find the integer part\n    integer_part = int(final_value)\n    print(f\"The integer part of the final value is: {integer_part}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<30721>>>"
