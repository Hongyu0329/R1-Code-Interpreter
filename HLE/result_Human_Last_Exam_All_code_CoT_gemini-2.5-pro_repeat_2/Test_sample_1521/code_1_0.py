    Solves the theoretical questions about the two Markov chains.

    Part 1 Analysis:
    The first Markov chain has an associated function h which is non-negative, zero on a finite set A,
    positive and harmonic outside A, and tends to infinity. The existence of such a function,
    often called an "escape function" or a non-constant potential, is a classic criterion
    for the transience of an irreducible Markov chain. A recurrent chain would be guaranteed
    to hit the finite set A, which is incompatible with the martingale properties of h(X_n).
    Therefore, the first chain must be transient.
    Answer: "t"

    Part 2 Analysis:
    The second Markov chain is a Doob's h-transform of the first. The transformation
    q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x) is defined on the state space where h(x) > 0, i.e., Sigma \ A.
    This new chain describes the behavior of the original chain conditioned on the event
    that it never enters the set A. Since the first chain is transient, it has a non-zero
    probability of escaping to infinity without hitting A. The second chain describes
    exactly these escaping paths. A chain that is conditioned to escape to infinity must
    itself be transient.
    Answer: "t"

    The combined answer is (t, t).
