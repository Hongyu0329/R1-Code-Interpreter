    "This is a historical question, not a coding problem. To answer it, we need to look at the historical records for both Geoffrey Chaucer and Blanche of Lancaster. My plan is to identify the year of Blanche's death and then determine Chaucer's documented whereabouts during that year. I will then present these facts in a Python script that prints the logical conclusion.\n\n1.  **Blanche of Lancaster's Death:** Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died in 1368.\n2.  **Geoffrey Chaucer's Location:** During the 1360s, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III of England. While he did travel to the continent on diplomatic missions, historical records, such as royal annuities, place him in England in 1368. His famous and influential trips to Italy did not occur until the 1370s.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on these facts, Chaucer was in England at the time of Blanche's death. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written in her memory shortly afterward.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to lay out these facts and print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death based on historical data.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Fact 1: The year Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    \n    # Fact 2: Geoffrey Chaucer's documented location in that year.\n    # Records from the court of King Edward III show Chaucer was in England.\n    chaucer_location_in_1368 = \"England\"\n    \n    # Fact 3: Blanche of Lancaster also died in England.\n    death_location_of_blanche = \"England\"\n    \n    # Print the reasoning\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(f\"In {year_of_death}, Geoffrey Chaucer was serving the royal court and his documented location was {chaucer_location_in_1368}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the evidence points to Geoffrey Chaucer being in {chaucer_location_in_1368} when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\n\nsolve_historical_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
