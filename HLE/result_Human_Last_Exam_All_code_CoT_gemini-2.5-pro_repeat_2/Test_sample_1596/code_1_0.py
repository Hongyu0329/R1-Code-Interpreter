def solve_quaternion_rope():
    """
    This function analyzes a series of statements about a proposed Quaternion-based
    Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and identifies the true ones.

    The Quaternion RoPE applies a rotation to a 4D vector (represented as a quaternion)
    v at position m via left multiplication: R_m(v) = R_m * v.
    The rotation quaternion is R_m = cos(mθ) + û*sin(mθ), where û is a fixed
    unit pure quaternion (the rotation axis).

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    - A: False. The inner product ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ depends on the relative position (n-m), not its absolute value |n-m|.
    - B: False. Quaternion multiplication is not commutative in general, so the equality does not hold.
    - C: True. A fixed rotation axis û is required for the key property R_m * R_n = R_{m+n} to hold, which enables relative position encoding.
    - D: False. The position m is a 1D scalar, so this scheme encodes 1D relative positions, not 3D.
    - E: True. |R_m| is 1 because it's a unit quaternion. The norm of a product is the product of norms, so |R_m(v)| = |R_m|*|v| = |v|.
    - F: True. Real scalars commute with all quaternions, so the operation is linear. R_m*(αv) = α*(R_m*v).
    - G: True. Left multiplication by a unit quaternion is an isometry, which preserves inner products. If ⟨p,q⟩=0, then ⟨R_m(p), R_m(q)⟩=0.
    - H: True. Since R_m and R_n share a common axis, they commute, and their product R_m * R_n is R_{m+n}. Composition follows directly.
    - J: True. The expression is the commutator [R_m, R_n] applied to v. Since R_m and R_n commute, the result is the zero quaternion, which has a real part of 0 and is therefore purely imaginary.
    - K: False. The real part of the rotated vector is not preserved.
    - L: True. The trace of the 4x4 left-multiplication matrix for a quaternion r is 4 times its real part. For R_m, the real part is cos(mθ).
    - M: False. The commutator [R_m, R_n] is zero for *any* fixed rotation axis, not only for a specific one.
    - N: False. The magnitude |R_m(v)| is always equal to |v|. For a unit vector, this is 1. The limit is 1.

    The correct statements are C, E, F, G, H, J, L.
