    "In quantum game theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma can be modeled using an entangled initial state and quantum operators as strategies. This approach, pioneered by Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein, can lead to new equilibria that are not present in the classical version of the game.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Setup the Quantum Game:** I will model the game using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. To achieve an optimal outcome that resolves the dilemma, I will choose a maximally entangled initial state. This is created by applying an entangling operator `J` to the base state `|00>`.\n2.  **Define Strategies:** The players' strategies are no longer limited to the classical \"Cooperate\" (C) and \"Defect\" (D). They can now use a broader set of quantum operations. I will include the classical strategies C and D, and a new, purely quantum strategy known as the \"miracle\" move, `Q`.\n3.  **Calculate Payoffs:** I will write a Python script to simulate the game. For each pair of strategies (e.g., Player A plays Q, Player B plays D), the script will:\n    a. Construct the corresponding quantum operators `U_A` and `U_B`.\n    b. Calculate the final state of the system after the players apply their strategies and the state is disentangled.\n    c. Determine the probabilities of the four classical outcomes: (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D).\n    d. Calculate the expected payoff for each player using the given payoff matrix.\n4.  **Find the Equilibrium:** After calculating the payoffs for all possible strategy combinations {C, D, Q}, I will analyze the resulting 3x3 payoff matrix to find the Nash Equilibrium. A Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. The payoff at this equilibrium is the \"equilibrium point\".\n5.  **Output the Result:** The code will print the final equilibrium payoff calculation in the format `Payoff = P_CC * p_cc + P_CD * p_cd + P_DC * p_dc + P_DD * p_dd`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and identifies the Nash Equilibrium for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix from the problem description\n    #           B: Cooperate(0)  B: Defect(1)\n    # A: Coop(0)   (5, 5)           (0, 7)\n    # A: Defect(1)  (7, 0)           (1, 1)\n    payoffs_A = np.array([[5, 0], [7, 1]])\n    payoffs_B = np.array([[5, 7], [0, 1]])\n\n    # Initial state |00>\n    psi_0 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Maximal entanglement operator J(gamma) for gamma = pi/2\n    gamma = np.pi / 2\n    J = np.cos(gamma / 2) * np.identity(4) + 1j * np.sin(gamma / 2) * np.kron(\n        np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]]),  # sigma_x\n        np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])   # sigma_x\n    )\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n\n    # Define strategy operators\n    # C: Cooperate (Identity)\n    U_C = np.identity(2, dtype=complex)\n    # D: Defect (a specific unitary operator, U(pi, 0))\n    U_D = np.array([[0, 1], [-1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    # Q: Quantum \"Miracle\" Move (U(0, pi/2))\n    U_Q = np.array([[1j, 0], [0, -1j]], dtype=complex)\n\n    strategies = {'C': U_C, 'D': U_D, 'Q': U_Q}\n    strategy_names = ['C', 'D', 'Q']\n    \n    print(\"--- Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix ---\")\n    print(\"Payoffs are shown as (Player A, Player B)\\n\")\n    \n    # Store results for analysis\n    results = {}\n\n    for name_A in strategy_names:\n        for name_B in strategy_names:\n            U_A = strategies[name_A]\n            U_B = strategies[name_B]\n\n            # Combined operator for players' strategies\n            U = np.kron(U_A, U_B)\n\n            # Calculate the final state before measurement\n            psi_final = J_dag @ U @ J @ psi_0\n\n            # Probabilities of the four classical outcomes |00>, |01>, |10>, |11>\n            probs = np.abs(psi_final)**2\n            p_cc, p_cd, p_dc, p_dd = probs[0], probs[1], probs[2], probs[3]\n\n            # Calculate expected payoffs\n            payoff_A = p_cc * payoffs_A[0, 0] + p_cd * payoffs_A[0, 1] + \\\n                       p_dc * payoffs_A[1, 0] + p_dd * payoffs_A[1, 1]\n            payoff_B = p_cc * payoffs_B[0, 0] + p_cd * payoffs_B[0, 1] + \\\n                       p_dc * payoffs_B[1, 0] + p_dd * payoffs_B[1, 1]\n            \n            results[(name_A, name_B)] = (round(payoff_A, 2), round(payoff_B, 2))\n\n    # Print the payoff table\n    header = \"B->\".ljust(6) + \"\".join([f\"{name.center(12)}\" for name in strategy_names])\n    print(header)\n    print(\"-\" * len(header))\n    for name_A in strategy_names:\n        row_str = f\"A:{name_A}\".ljust(6)\n        for name_B in strategy_names:\n            row_str += f\"{str(results[(name_A, name_B)]).center(12)}\"\n        print(row_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"In the classical game, the Nash Equilibrium is (D, D) with payoff (1, 1).\")\n    print(\"In this quantum game with maximal entanglement:\")\n    print(\"1.
