def solve_agent_problem():
    """
    Solves the agent probability problem analytically using sympy.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the probability of Agent A winning for a given F, P(F), based on the
       derivation described in the plan.
       P(F) = 1 - (1/pi) * integral from F to 1 of acos(F/r) dr.
    2. Symbolically integrates to find the closed-form expression for P(F).
    3. Differentiates P(F) with respect to F to find the optimal F for Agent B.
    4. The derivative is always positive, so the minimum is at F=0.
    5. Calculates the minimum probability by taking the limit of P(F) as F -> 0.
    6. Computes the final answer based on this minimized probability.
