    "This problem requires a retrosynthetic analysis of a Robinson Annulation reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is `ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate`. I will break down this name to understand its structure. It's a two-ring system (decalin skeleton) with a ketone (`7-oxo`), a methyl group (`4-methyl`), and an ethyl ester (`ethyl ... 4a-carboxylate`) at a bridgehead carbon.\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagents are methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), a strong base (potassium methoxide), and another base (potassium carbonate). This sequence signifies a Robinson Annulation, a powerful method for forming a six-membered ring.\n3.  **Perform Retrosynthesis:** I will work backward from the product.\n    *   The Robinson Annulation builds a new ring. The presence of an ester group at the bridgehead carbon (`4a`) is a key clue. This specific feature indicates that the starting material was a cyclic Î²-keto ester, likely a derivative of `ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate`.\n    *   The new ring, including the `7-oxo` group, is formed from MVK and parts of the original ring. The `4-methyl` group was not part of MVK, so it must have been present on the original starting material.\n    *   By tracing the carbon atoms through the reaction mechanism, I will determine the position of the methyl group on the starting `ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate` ring that results in the `4-methyl` substituent in the final product.\n4.  **Construct the Final Answer:** Based on the analysis, I will assemble the IUPAC name of the starting compound and present it as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_retrosynthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs a logical retrosynthesis to identify the starting\n    material for a given chemical reaction product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
