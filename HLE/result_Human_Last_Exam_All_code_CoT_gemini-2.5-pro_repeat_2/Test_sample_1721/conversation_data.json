    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible density `c` for a set `A` of integers from 1 to `N`, such that the sum of any two elements in `A` (including an element with itself) is never a perfect square. The size of `A` is given as `|A| = (c + o(1))N`, which means we are interested in the ratio `|A|/N` as `N` becomes very large.\n\n2.  **Use Modular Arithmetic for Construction:** A powerful way to construct such a set `A` is to use modular arithmetic. If we can ensure that for any `a, a'` in `A`, the sum `a + a'` belongs to a specific residue class modulo some number `m`, and if that residue class contains no squares, then we have found a valid construction.\n\n3.  **Test Modulus `m=3`:** Let's consider the remainders when numbers are divided by 3.\n    *   The possible squares modulo 3 are:\n        *   `0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)`\n        *   `1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`\n        *   `2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`\n    *   So, any perfect square must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. No perfect square is congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n    *   Let's construct our set `A` by picking all numbers in `{1, ..., N}` that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n    *   `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}`.\n    *   If we take any two numbers `a` and `a'` from this set `A`, their sum will be `a + a' ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n    *   Since no square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, `a + a'` can never be a perfect square. This construction is valid.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Density `c`:** The set `A` consists of numbers `1, 4, 7, 10, ...`. The number of such elements up to `N` is approximately `N/3`. As `N` approaches infinity, the density `|A|/N` approaches `1/3`. This construction shows that a value of `c = 1/3` is achievable.\n\n5.  **Optimality:** It is a famous result in combinatorial number theory, proved by A. Sárközy, that this density is the best possible. Therefore, the largest number `c` is `1/3`.\n\n6.  **Demonstration with Code:** I will provide a Python script that implements this construction for a given `N`. The script will build the set `A`, verify that `A+A` indeed contains no squares, and then compute the density `|A|/N` to show that it is close to `1/3`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_square_free_sumset(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the construction of a set A such that A+A has no squares,\n    and shows its density c = |A|/N approaches 1/3.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Demonstration for N = {N} ---\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Construct the set A = {n in {1, ..., N} | n = 1 (mod 3)}.\n    A = {n for n in range(1, N + 1) if n % 3 == 1}\n    \n    # Step 2: Verify that A+A contains no perfect squares.\n    # First, generate all perfect squares up to the maximum possible sum 2*N.\n    max_sum = 2 * N\n    squares = {k*k for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(max_sum)) + 2)}\n    \n    # Check if any sum of two elements from A is a square.\n    contains_square = False\n    for a1 in A:\n        for a2 in A:\n            if (a1 + a2) in squares:\n                print(f\"Error: Found a square in A+A: {a1} + {a2} = {a1+a2}\")\n                contains_square = True\n                break\n        if contains_square:\n            break\n\n    if not contains_square:\n        print(\"Verification successful: The constructed set A has the property that A+A contains no squares.\")\n        print(\"This is because any sum a1+a2 is congruent to 1+1 = 2 (mod 3), and no square is congruent to 2 (mod 3).\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the density c = |A|/N, which relates to the equation |A| = c * N.\n    size_A = len(A)\n    c = size_A / N\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the density c:\")\n    print(f\"The size of the set A is |A| = {size_A}\")\n    print(f\"The size of the base set is N = {N}\")\n    print(f\"The calculated density is c = |A| / N = {size_A} / {N} = {c:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAs N gets larger, this density approaches 1/3.\")\n    print(f\"The value of 1/3 is approximately {1/3:.6f}\")\n\n# You can run the demonstration with a large N.\ndemonstrate_square_free_sumset(10000)\n```\n<<<1/3>>>"
