    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest amount of information that can distinguish between all 21 possible permutations of the last layer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the requirements:** The goal is to uniquely identify one of the 21 PLL cases. The top-facing stickers are all the same color (e.g., yellow) after OLL, so they provide no useful information for permutation. We can only use the side stickers of the top layer's four corner and four edge pieces.\n2.  **Consider simple cases:** For many PLLs, like the T-perm or J-perm, the pattern of stickers on a single face is unique. A single face shows 3 stickers (one for each of the three top-layer pieces on that side). So, for these cases, 3 stickers are enough.\n3.  **Consider worst-case scenarios:** The question asks for the number of stickers required for *any* case. We must find the minimum number that works for the most difficult-to-distinguish cases. PLLs like the N-perms lack obvious patterns like \"headlights\" or \"blocks\" and can look very similar to other cases from a single angle.\n4.  **Test the \"3 sticker\" hypothesis:** While looking at 3 stickers on one face works for many cases, it is not always enough. A single sticker's color is not always a unique identifier for a piece. For example, multiple pieces have a red sticker, so seeing a red sticker on the green face doesn't definitively tell you which piece it is without more context. This can lead to ambiguity between different PLLs.\n5.  **Test the \"4 sticker\" hypothesis:** If 3 is not enough, we try 4. A well-chosen set of 4 stickers can provide enough information to resolve any ambiguity. A good set to consider is the three stickers on one face, plus one sticker on an adjacent face (for example, the three stickers on the Front face and the sticker on the side of the Right edge).\n6.  **Conclusion:** This set of 4 stickers is sufficient to distinguish between even the most similar cases (like the Na and Nb perms). Since 3 stickers are not sufficient for the worst cases, but 4 are, the minimum number required is 4.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to see\n    to identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the information available.\n    # We can't use the top stickers. We use the side stickers of the 4 corners and 4 edges.\n    total_pll_cases = 21\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate if seeing the 3 stickers on one face is always enough.\n    # For many cases (like T-perm or J-perm), the 3-sticker pattern on one face is a unique signature.\n    # For example, a T-perm gives you \"headlights\" (e.g., Green, Blue, Green on the Green face).\n    # A J-perm gives you a \"block\" (e.g., Green, Green, Red on the Green face).\n    stickers_on_one_face = 3\n\n    # However, for complex cases like N-perms or some G-perms, the pattern on one face\n    # can be ambiguous or look similar to other cases. For example, multiple PLLs can result\n    # in a pattern where all 3 stickers on one face are different colors.\n    # Therefore, 3 stickers are NOT always enough to guarantee identification.\n    is_3_stickers_sufficient = False\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate if 4 stickers are enough.\n    # We need to find a set of 4 stickers that can distinguish all cases.\n    # A good candidate set is the 3 stickers on the Front face, plus the sticker on the Right edge.\n    # Let's analyze this for the notoriously similar Na and Nb perms.\n    #\n    # - Na-perm: Swaps two corners and two edges. The edge on the right face (UR) is swapped\n    #   with the edge on the left face (UL). So the sticker seen on the side of the UR piece\n    #   will be the color of the left face center.\n    #\n    # - Nb-perm: Swaps two pairs of corners, but all edges are in the correct place.\n    #   The sticker seen on the side of the UR piece will be the color of the right face center.\n    #\n    # By observing this 4th sticker, we can distinguish Na from Nb.
