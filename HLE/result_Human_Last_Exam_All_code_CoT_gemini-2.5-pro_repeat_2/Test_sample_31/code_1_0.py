    # Step 2: Evaluate if seeing the 3 stickers on one face is always enough.
    # For many cases (like T-perm or J-perm), the 3-sticker pattern on one face is a unique signature.
    # For example, a T-perm gives you "headlights" (e.g., Green, Blue, Green on the Green face).
    # A J-perm gives you a "block" (e.g., Green, Green, Red on the Green face).

    # However, for complex cases like N-perms or some G-perms, the pattern on one face
    # can be ambiguous or look similar to other cases. For example, multiple PLLs can result
    # in a pattern where all 3 stickers on one face are different colors.
    # Therefore, 3 stickers are NOT always enough to guarantee identification.

    # Step 3: Evaluate if 4 stickers are enough.
    # We need to find a set of 4 stickers that can distinguish all cases.
    # A good candidate set is the 3 stickers on the Front face, plus the sticker on the Right edge.
    # Let's analyze this for the notoriously similar Na and Nb perms.
    #
    # - Na-perm: Swaps two corners and two edges. The edge on the right face (UR) is swapped
    #   with the edge on the left face (UL). So the sticker seen on the side of the UR piece
    #   will be the color of the left face center.
    #
    # - Nb-perm: Swaps two pairs of corners, but all edges are in the correct place.
    #   The sticker seen on the side of the UR piece will be the color of the right face center.
    #
    # By observing this 4th sticker, we can distinguish Na from Nb. This principle
    # extends to all other potentially ambiguous cases.

    # Step 4: Conclude the minimum number.
