    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Condition:** First, I will analyze the given condition. The set of lines includes `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`. Since if `(p, q)` is a coprime pair, so is `(-p, -q)`, the domain `K` must also intersect the lines `-px - qy = 1`. For a convex set `K`, intersecting both `px+qy=1` and `px+qy=-1` implies that the range of values of the function `f(x,y) = px+qy` over `K` must span `[-1, 1]`. This can be expressed using the support function `h_K` of the domain. For a centrally symmetric domain (which I'll argue is optimal), this simplifies to `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\n\n2.  **Using Polar Duality:** The problem of finding the minimum-area `K` can be translated into a problem about its polar body, `K^*`. The condition `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all primitive integer vectors `(p,q)` is equivalent to the condition that the interior of the polar body `K^*` must not contain any primitive integer vectors. Our goal is to find the smallest `K`, which corresponds to finding the largest `K^*`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Maximal Polar Body:** I will argue that the largest (in terms of area) convex, centrally-symmetric set `K^*` whose interior is free of primitive integer points is the square `S = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`. Any such set must be contained within this square, so this square is the maximal one.\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimal Domain:** Using the inclusion-reversing property of polarity (`A ⊂ B` implies `B^* ⊂ A^*`), if `K^* ⊂ S`, then `S^* ⊂ K`. This means any valid domain `K` must contain `S^*`, the polar of the square `S`. The minimal area of `K` is therefore at least the area of `S^*`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Area and Verifying the Solution:** I will provide a Python script that calculates the polar `S^*` of the square `S`, which turns out to be the diamond-shaped region `D = { (x,y) | |x|+|y| ≤ 1 }`. The script will then calculate the area of this diamond `D`, which is 2. Finally, to confirm that this is a valid solution, the script will verify that the domain `D` itself satisfies the condition for a sample of coprime pairs `(p,q)`. Since `D` is a valid domain and its area is the minimum possible, it is the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_coprime_pairs(limit):\n    \"\"\"Generates coprime pairs (p,q) with |p|, |q| <= limit.\"\"\"\n    pairs = set()\n    for p in range(-limit, limit + 1):\n        for q in range(-limit, limit + 1):\n            if p == 0 and q == 0:\n                continue\n            if math.gcd(p, q) == 1:\n                pairs.add((p, q))\n    return list(pairs)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the minimal area of a convex domain K intersecting all lines\n    px + qy = 1 for coprime integers p, q.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Based on theoretical analysis, the minimal domain K is the set of points (x, y) satisfying |x| + |y| <= 1.\")\n    print(\"This domain is a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the area of this domain.\n    # The domain is composed of two triangles, e.g., one with vertices (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1)\n    # and another with vertices (1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1).\n    # Each triangle has a base of length 2 (from x=-1 to x=1) and a height of 1.\n    base = 2\n    height = 1\n    num_triangles = 2\n    area = num_triangles * (1/2 * base * height)\n\n    print(\"The area of this domain can be calculated as the sum of the areas of two triangles.\")\n    print(\"Final equation for the area calculation:\")\n    # The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Minimal Area = {num_triangles} * (1/2 * {base} * {height})\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Area = {area}\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 2: Verify that this domain K satisfies the condition.\n    # A convex domain K intersects a line px+qy=1 if and only if\n    # the values of px+qy on K span across 1.\n    # For a centrally symmetric K, this is equivalent to its support function h_K(p,q) >= 1.\n    # For K = { (x,y) | |x|+|y|<=1 }, the support function is h_K(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|).\n    # So we must verify that max(|p|, |q|) >= 1 for all coprime integers (p, q).\n\n    print(\"Verification Step:\")\n    print(\"The condition is equivalent to checking if max(|p|, |q|) >= 1 for all coprime integers (p, q).\")\n    print(\"This is true because if (p,q) are coprime, they cannot both be zero.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, at least one of them must have an absolute value of at least 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Demonstrate this verification for a sample of coprime pairs.\n    limit = 4\n    coprime_pairs = generate_coprime_pairs(limit)\n    print(f\"Checking the condition for coprime pairs (p,q) where |p|,|q| <= {limit}:\")\n    all_hold = True\n    for p, q in sorted(coprime_pairs):\n        max_val = max(abs(p), abs(q))\n        condition_holds = (max_val >= 1)\n        print(f\"  For (p,q) = ({p:2}, {q:2}): max(|p|,|q|) = {max_val}.
