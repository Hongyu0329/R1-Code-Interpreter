    print("A. not stable to oxygen because it is highly reactive")
    print("   - This is incorrect. The question specifies 'air-stable' radicals, a class of molecules designed to resist degradation from oxygen.\n")

    print("B. wide FWDH because it has multiple emissions")
    print("   - This relates to color purity. While a valid concern for device performance, it is not as fundamental as core efficiency loss mechanisms.\n")

    print("C. low luminance because radical can quench with each other")
    print("   - This describes doublet-doublet annihilation, where two *excited* radicals quench each other. This is a major cause of efficiency roll-off at high brightness, but it's not the only quenching pathway.\n")

    print("D. low EQE because excitons can be quenched by the radicals")
    print("   - This is the most fundamental issue. The high concentration of *ground-state* radicals in the emissive layer can act as quenching sites for the excitons (excited-state radicals). This process reduces the number of excitons that can emit light, directly lowering the overall External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) at all operating brightness levels. This is a primary challenge that must be overcome.\n")

    print("E. low EQE because delocalization of the radical will have multiple emissions")
    print("   - Delocalization is what typically stabilizes the radical. It affects the emission energy, but is not itself a primary cause of low efficiency through 'multiple emissions'.\n")

    print("="*60)
    print("Conclusion: The most significant and fundamental disadvantage is the quenching of excitons by the ground-state radicals themselves, which fundamentally limits the device's peak efficiency.")
