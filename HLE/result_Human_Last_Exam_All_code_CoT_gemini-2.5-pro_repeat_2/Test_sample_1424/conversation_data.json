    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Explain the Concept:** First, I will explain the physical meaning of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) in the context of quantum many-body theory and the Feynman path integral. It represents the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle.\n2.  **State the Formula:** I will present the standard formula for the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain, which is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.\n3.  **Identify the Dependence:** From the formula, it's clear that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. This is the core of the answer.\n4.  **Provide a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship. The script will define values for the frequency ($\\omega$), the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$), and the infinitesimal term ($\\eta$), and then calculate $G_0$. The script will print out the formula with the specific numerical values to make the calculation transparent, as requested.\n\nThe bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle from one point to another. In the frequency-momentum representation, which is natural in the path integral formalism after a Fourier transform from time to frequency, the Green's function takes on a particularly simple algebraic form.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. The specific formula is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere:\n-   $\\omega$ is the frequency (representing the energy of the propagating particle).\n-   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum $k$.\n-   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term (with $\\eta \\to 0^+$) that enforces causality by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe following Python code calculates a value for $G_0$ given a set of parameters and prints the full equation, clearly showing this inverse dependence.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for given parameters\n    and prints the functional dependence and final equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters for the calculation\n    # (using natural units where h-bar = 1)\n    omega = 3.5  # Frequency (energy of the probe)\n    epsilon_k = 3.0  # Single-particle energy eigenvalue\n    eta = 0.1  # Infinitesimal positive value for causality\n\n    # The formula for the bare Green's function\n    # G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    \n    # In Python, the imaginary unit 'i' is represented by 'j'\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    g0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Output the explanation and the final equation with numbers\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy epsilon_k is:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"This shows G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency omega and the energy epsilon_k.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Let's use the following values:\")\n    print(f\"omega (frequency) = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"epsilon_k (single-particle energy) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"eta (infinitesimal for causality) = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers substituted in\n    print(\"The equation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i * {eta})\")\n    \n    # Simplify the denominator to show the next step\n    real_part_denom = omega - epsilon_k\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({real_part_denom:.2f} + {eta:.2f}i)\\n\")\n    \n    # Print the final complex number result\n    print(f\"The resulting value for the bare Green's function is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {g0.real:.4f} + ({g0.imag:.4f})i\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ has an inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, as described by the formula $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.>>>"
