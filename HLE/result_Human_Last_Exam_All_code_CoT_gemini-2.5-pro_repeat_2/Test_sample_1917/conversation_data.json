    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine how many distinct values the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can produce as $a$ takes on all natural numbers $1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  The value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ depends on the base, $a \\pmod{22}$, and the exponent, which also depends on $a$.\n2.  According to modular arithmetic properties, specifically the generalization of Euler's totient theorem using the Carmichael function $\\lambda$, the exponent's behavior repeats. The Carmichael function for 22 is $\\lambda(22) = \\text{lcm}(\\lambda(2), \\lambda(11)) = \\text{lcm}(1, 10) = 10$.\n3.  This means the sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is determined by the pair of values $(a \\pmod{22}, a \\pmod{10})$. This pair repeats every $\\text{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$ integers.\n4.  Therefore, to find all possible unique remainders, we only need to check the values of $a$ over one full cycle. We can iterate $a$ from 1 up to a number covering this period, for instance, up to 220, to ensure we capture all possible outcomes.\n5.  We will use a Python script to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for each $a$ in this range, store the unique results in a set, and then output the elements of the set and its size.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set sys.set_int_max_str_digits(0) to handle potentially large 'a' as a string if we were converting it\n# but pow() handles large integers directly, so this is not strictly necessary for this code.\n# However, it's good practice to be aware of potential limits.\nif sys.version_info.major == 3 and sys.version_info.minor >= 11:\n    sys.set_int_max_str_digits(0)\n\ndef find_cardinality_of_remainders():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 for a in N}.\n\n    The sequence of values a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is a divisor of\n    lcm(22, lambda(22)), where lambda is the Carmichael function.\n    lambda(22) = lcm(lambda(2), lambda(11)) = lcm(1, 10) = 10.\n    The overall period for the pair (a mod 22, a mod 10) is lcm(22, 10) = 110.\n    We iterate up to 220 to be certain we have covered a full cycle and the\n    values have stabilized.\n    \"\"\"\n    remainders = set()\n    \n    # We loop from a = 1 up to 220. This range is sufficient to find all unique remainders.\n    for a in range(1, 221):\n        # We use pow(base, exp, mod) for efficient modular exponentiation.\n        remainder = pow(a, a, 22)\n        remainders.add(remainder)\n        \n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We interpret this as showing the set of unique remainders found.\n    sorted_remainders = sorted(list(remainders))\n    \n    print(\"The set of unique remainders S = {a^a mod 22} is:\")\n    print(sorted_remainders)\n    \n    cardinality = len(sorted_remainders)\n    print(\"\\nThe cardinality of the set S is:\")\n    print(cardinality)\n\nfind_cardinality_of_remainders()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
