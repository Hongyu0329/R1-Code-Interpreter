    # The reasoning for the solution is derived from analyzing the poem's form and content.
    # 1. The poem is a double sestina, and its end-word pattern is perfectly preserved.
    # 2. This implies any swapped lines must share the same end-word to not break the pattern.
    # 3. A thematic and tonal inconsistency is found between Strephon's angry Stanza 9 and Klaius's melancholic Stanza 10.
    # 4. Line 50, spoken by Strephon, has a melancholic tone fitting Klaius.
    # 5. Line 58, spoken by Klaius, is an angry wish fitting Strephon's stanza.
    # 6. Both lines end in "evening".
    # 7. Swapping them resolves the inconsistency and strengthens the characterization.
