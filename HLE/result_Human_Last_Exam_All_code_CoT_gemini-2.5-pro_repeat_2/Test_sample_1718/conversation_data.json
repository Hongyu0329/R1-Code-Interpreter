    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a manifold depends on its dimension and any additional geometric structures it possesses.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Manifold:** We are considering a Kähler manifold. A key property of a Kähler manifold is that its real dimension, let's call it `n`, must be even. We can therefore define its complex dimension as `m = n / 2`.\n2.  **State the Formula:** Unlike a general Riemannian manifold, a Kähler manifold has a covariantly constant complex structure. This imposes additional symmetries on its Riemann tensor. These symmetries significantly reduce the number of independent components. The final formula for the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is:\n    $N = (\\frac{m(m+1)}{2})^2 = \\frac{m^2(m+1)^2}{4}$\n3.  **Provide a Calculation:** I will write a Python script to compute this value for an example case. Let's choose a 6-dimensional Kähler manifold, which has a complex dimension of `m = 3`. The code will show the step-by-step calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation for a 6D Kähler manifold (`m=3`):\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_kahler_riemann_components(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    n = 2 * m\n    \n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m} (real dimension n = {n}):\")\n    print(\"The number of independent real components (N) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"N = (m^2 * (m + 1)^2) / 4\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n\n    # Step-by-step calculation\n    m_plus_1 = m + 1\n    m_sq = m**2\n    m_plus_1_sq = m_plus_1**2\n    numerator = m_sq * m_plus_1_sq\n    denominator = 4\n    result = numerator // denominator\n\n    # Outputting the equation with numbers\n    print(f\"First, substitute m = {m} into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = ({m}^2 * ({m} + 1)^2) / {denominator}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThen, evaluate the terms in the numerator:\")\n    print(f\"N = ({m_sq} * {m_plus_1}^2) / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"N = ({m_sq} * {m_plus_1_sq}) / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"N = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinally, perform the division:\")\n    print(f\"N = {result}\")\n    \n    # This part is for the final answer block\n    # print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n\n\n# We will use a 6-dimensional Kähler manifold (m=3) as an example.\ncalculate_kahler_riemann_components(3)\n```\n<<<36>>>"
