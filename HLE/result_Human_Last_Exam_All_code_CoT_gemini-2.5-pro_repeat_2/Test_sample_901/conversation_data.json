    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type**: First, I'll analyze the reactants. We have a secondary alkyl halide, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and a strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide. These conditions are ideal for an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the Reactant's Stereochemistry**: The key to predicting the product for an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring is to analyze its three-dimensional structure. The specified (1S,2R) stereoisomer is a *cis* isomer. This means the bromo and methyl groups are on the same face of the ring.\n3.  **Evaluate the Chair Conformations**: A cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane ring rapidly interconverts between two chair conformations.\n    *   Conformer A: The bromine is **axial**, and the methyl group is **equatorial**. This is the more stable conformation because the bulky methyl group occupies the less crowded equatorial position.\n    *   Conformer B: The bromine is **equatorial**, and the methyl group is **axial**. This is the less stable conformation.\n4.  **Apply the E2 Mechanism Rule**: A critical requirement for the E2 reaction is that the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an *anti-periplanar* (trans-diaxial) alignment. This is only possible when the bromine atom is in the **axial** position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the more stable Conformer A.\n5.  **Identify Potential Products**: In Conformer A, there are two different beta-protons that are trans-diaxial to the axial bromine atom:\n    *   The proton at C2 can be eliminated to form **1-methylcyclohexene** (the more substituted Zaitsev product).\n    *   The proton at C6 can be eliminated to form **3-methylcyclohexene** (the less substituted Hofmann product).\n6.  **Determine the Major Product**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, sterically hindered (bulky) base. Bulky bases preferentially remove the least sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is shielded by the methyl group). Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this logical deduction to identify the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactants and reaction type\n    reactant = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    base = \"potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Starting analysis for the reaction of {reactant} with {base}.\")\n    print(f\"This is an {reaction_type} reaction due to the strong, bulky base and secondary alkyl halide.\\n\")\n\n    # Analyze stereochemistry and conformations\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure.\")\n    print(\"The reactant is a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\")\n    print(\"The reaction must proceed from a chair conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the more stable conformer where Br is axial and the methyl group is equatorial.\\n\")\n\n    # Identify possible products based on beta-proton removal\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify potential products.\")\n    print(\"From the reactive conformation, there are two possible elimination pathways:\")\n    zaitsev_product = \"1-methylcyclohexene\"\n    hofmann_product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    print(f\"  - Path A (Zaitsev): Removal of a proton from C2 yields {zaitsev_product}.\")\n    print(f\"  - Path B (Hofmann): Removal of a proton from C6 yields {hofmann_product}.\\n\")\n\n    # Determine the major product based on the base's properties\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the major product.\")\n    print(f\"The base, {base}, is sterically bulky.\")\n    print(\"Bulky bases preferentially attack the less sterically hindered proton.\")\n    print(\"The proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2 (which is near the methyl group).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the Hofmann pathway (Path B) is favored.\\n\")\n\n    # State the final product\n    major_product = hofmann_product\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The major product of the reaction is: {major_product}\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nidentify_elimination_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
