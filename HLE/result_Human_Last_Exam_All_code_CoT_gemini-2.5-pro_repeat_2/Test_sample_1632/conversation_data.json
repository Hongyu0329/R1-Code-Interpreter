    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** The goal is to find `a(10)`, which represents the number of distinct self-avoiding walks of 10 steps on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice), starting from the origin. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that never visits the same point twice.\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** This combinatorial problem can be solved by exploring all possible paths of length 10 and counting the ones that are self-avoiding. A recursive backtracking algorithm is a natural fit for this task.\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   I will create a recursive function that explores paths step by step.\n    *   The function will take the number of steps remaining, the current position, and the set of visited points (the path) as input.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when 0 steps are remaining, which means we've successfully found a valid 10-step walk. In this case, we count it as 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, I will try to move to each of the four neighbors from the current position. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, I move to it and make a recursive call with one less step remaining.\n    *   The results from all valid moves will be summed up to get the total count.\n4.  **Optimize the Calculation:** The lattice is symmetrical. The number of walks starting with a move to the right `(1,0)` is the same as starting with a move left `(-1,0)`, up `(0,1)`, or down `(0,-1)`. I can exploit this by calculating the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., to the right) and multiplying the final result by 4. This significantly reduces the total computation required.\n5.  **Final Code:** The Python code will implement this optimized recursive approach to calculate and print the value of `a(10)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This script is set to calculate a(10).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    def _count_walks_recursive(steps_left, current_pos, path):\n        \"\"\"\n        A recursive helper function to count valid walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left: The number of steps remaining.\n            current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinates of the walk.\n            path: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        x, y = current_pos\n        total_walks = 0\n\n        # Explore the four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n            \n            # If the neighbor has not been visited, proceed down this path.\n            if next_pos not in path:\n                # Add the new position to the path for the recursive call.\n                path.add(next_pos)\n                \n                # Recursively call the function for the next step and add to the total.\n                total_walks += _count_walks_recursive(steps_left - 1, next_pos, path)\n                \n                # Backtrack: remove the position to allow exploration of other branches.\n                path.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return total_walks\n\n    # For n=0, there is one walk (the starting point).\n    if n == 0:\n        result = 1\n    else:\n        # Optimization using symmetry:\n        # Calculate walks for one initial direction and multiply by 4.\n        # We assume the first step is from (0,0) to (1,0).\n        \n        # The path starts with the origin and the first step.\n        initial_path = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}\n        \n        # We now have n-1 steps left from the new position (1,0).\n        count_for_one_branch = _count_walks_recursive(n - 1, (1, 0), initial_path)\n        \n        # The total number of walks is 4 times the count from one branch.\n        result = 4 * count_for_one_branch\n\n    # Print the final result, showing the numbers in the equation a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n<<<44100>>>"
