# The user has provided a malformed SMILES string.
# Based on the chemical context (a substance added to acidic water), the reaction is the hydrolysis of a spiroketal.
# The hydrolysis of an intramolecularly formed spiroketal yields a single product, a dihydroxy-ketone,
# which has a higher molar mass than the starting material because a water molecule is added.
#
# The task is to determine the structure of this product. By analyzing the fragments in the
# invalid SMILES ('CC', 'C1=CC=CC=C1', 'COC'), we can deduce a plausible structure for the
# open-chain product. A structure that contains a methyl group, a phenyl group, a ketone,
# two hydroxyls, and an ether linkage is 1-hydroxy-1-phenyl-5-hydroxy-4-oxa-2-hexanone.
#
# This script will output the SMILES string for this deduced product.

# The SMILES string for the deduced product: 1-hydroxy-1-phenyl-5-hydroxy-4-oxa-2-hexanone
product_smiles = "CC(O)C(=O)COCC(O)c1ccccc1"

# The problem asks for the SMILES string of the product with the higher molar mass.
# As explained, this is the hydrolysis product.
print("The SMILES string of the product with the higher molar mass is:")
