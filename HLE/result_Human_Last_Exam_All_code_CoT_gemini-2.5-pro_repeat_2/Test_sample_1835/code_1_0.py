# Let's model the philosophical concepts with Python code.

# 1. Define a "domain of discourse", which is the set of all 'x' we are talking about.
domain_of_discourse = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# 2. Define a predicate 'F'. Let F(x) mean "x is an even number".
# This is our concept of the property 'F'.
def F(x):
  """Predicate F: Returns True if x is even, False otherwise."""
  return x % 2 == 0

# 3. Define an individual 'a' from our domain.
a = 4

# 4. Model the understanding of the proposition 'Fa'.
# If you understand 'Fa', you can grasp the meaning of applying the property F to the individual a.
# In our model, this means we can execute F(a) and understand the result.
print("--- Step 1: Understanding the proposition 'Fa' ---")
print(f"The individual 'a' is: {a}")
print(f"The predicate 'F' is the property 'is_even'.")
fa_result = F(a)
print(f"Evaluating 'F(a)': Is {a} even? --> {fa_result}")
print("Conclusion: By evaluating F(a), we demonstrate understanding of the components 'F' and 'a'.\n")

# 5. Model the understanding of universal quantification '∀x' (for all x).
# We assume this understanding. In Python, this is analogous to using the `all()` function,
# which checks if a condition is true for all elements in an iterable.

# 6. Now, combining the concepts to form '∀x Fx'.
# According to the Generality Constraint, if we have the concept 'F' (from Fa)
# and the concept '∀' (which we assumed), we should be able to combine them.
# Let's evaluate 'For all x in our domain, is F(x) true?'.
print("--- Step 2: Forming the proposition '∀x Fx' ---")
print(f"The domain of 'x' is: {domain_of_discourse}")
print(f"The predicate 'F' is the same property 'is_even'.")
# Here we apply the universal quantifier (all()) to our predicate (F) over the domain.
forall_x_fx_result = all(F(x) for x in domain_of_discourse)
print(f"Evaluating '∀x Fx': Is every number in {domain_of_discourse} even? --> {forall_x_fx_result}")
print("Conclusion: We successfully constructed and evaluated '∀x Fx' by combining our concept 'F' with the '∀' operator.")
print("\nThis demonstrates that if you understand Fa and you understand universal quantification, you can understand ∀x Fx.")
