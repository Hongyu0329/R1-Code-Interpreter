# The probability of measuring the |0> state at the output is given.
p0_out = 0.36

# Based on the most plausible interpretation that resolves the problem's
# inherent contradictions, we model the circuit B as a quantum NOT gate.
# This implies that the probability of the |0> state at the output is equal
# to the probability of the |1> state at the input, which is |β|^2.
beta_squared = p0_out

# The input state is normalized, which means the sum of the probabilities
# of its components is 1.
# |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1
# We want to find the value of |α|^2.
alpha_squared = 1 - beta_squared

# Print the final calculation
print(f"Given P(0)_out = |β|² = {p0_out}")
print(f"From normalization, |α|² + |β|² = 1")
print(f"Therefore, |α|² = 1 - |β|²")
print(f"|α|² = 1 - {beta_squared}")
print(f"|α|² = {alpha_squared}")

# Final Answer
# <<<0.64>>>
