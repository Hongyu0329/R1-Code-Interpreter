  # The reasoning is as follows:
  # A. No. A rational set K can consist of a single torsion element. Its conjugates are all torsion.
  #    An element admits a fully quasireduced word if and only if it is loxodromic.
  #    Torsion elements are not loxodromic, so they do not have any fully quasireduced representatives,
  #    let alone all their geodesics being so.
  # B. No. As a continuation of A, if we choose a rational set K consisting only of torsion elements
  #    (e.g., a finite set of them), then alpha(K) also consists only of torsion elements.
  #    No element in alpha(K) is loxodromic, so no fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word exists for any
  #    element in alpha(K), for any epsilon. Therefore, no such universal finite bound can exist.
  # C. No. The statement is ambiguous, but false under any reasonable interpretation.
  #    For instance, if we interpret "contains only quasigeodesic words" as "every reduced word
  #    representing an element in alpha(K) is a quasigeodesic".
  #    Consider a hyperbolic group G with a relator r (e.g., from small cancellation theory). The word r is
  #    reduced but traces a closed loop, so it's not a quasigeodesic. Now, let K = {1}. This is a
  #    context-free (even rational) set. Then alpha(K) = {1}. The word r represents 1 and is in the
  #    language of alpha(K), but is not a quasigeodesic.
