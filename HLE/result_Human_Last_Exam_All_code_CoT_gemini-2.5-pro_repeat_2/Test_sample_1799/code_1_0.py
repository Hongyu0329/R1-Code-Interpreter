Is it true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first?

No, the second postulate is not considered superfluous. Here's why:

1. The First Postulate Alone: The first postulate (the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames) does not, by itself, determine the rules for how to relate measurements between different frames. For centuries, it was combined with Galilean relativity, where velocities add up. In such a universe, the speed of light would change depending on the observer's motion.

2. The Role of Maxwell's Equations: The conflict arises with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, which predict that light travels at a constant speed 'c'. If one assumes that Maxwell's equations are fundamental laws of physics, then the first postulate implies that this predicted speed 'c' must be the same for all inertial observers.

3. Einstein's Insight: Einstein's great insight was to resolve the conflict between classical mechanics and electromagnetism by trusting both the Principle of Relativity (Postulate 1) and the consequence of Maxwell's equations (the constancy of 'c'). By stating the constancy of the speed of light as a separate, second postulate, he made it clear that our classical understanding of space and time (Galilean transformations) had to be abandoned in favor of a new one (Lorentz transformations).

In summary, you cannot derive the 2nd postulate from the 1st postulate in isolation. You need to add another major physical assumption (e.g., the universal validity of Maxwell's equations). Therefore, the 2nd postulate is not superfluous; it represents a distinct and fundamental statement about the nature of spacetime.
