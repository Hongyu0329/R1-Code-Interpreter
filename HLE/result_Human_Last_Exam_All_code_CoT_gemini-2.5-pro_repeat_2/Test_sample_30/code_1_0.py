    # Statement D is the most accurate description among the choices. In the generalization of proofs
    # to interactive systems (like the class IP), the verifier is required to be efficient
    # (polynomial-time), while the prover is modeled as being computationally powerful (often
    # computationally unbounded or with exponential-time capabilities) to be able to answer
    # the verifier's challenges for complex problems (e.g., PSPACE-complete problems).
    # This asymmetry is a defining feature.

    # Let's briefly explain why other key options are incorrect:
    # A is wrong: Interactive verification is precisely about the verifier communicating with a prover.
    # E is wrong: The second part is incorrect. Standard amplification techniques show that the exact
    #            completeness/soundness values (as long as there is a gap) do NOT affect the
    #            class of languages, making the model robust.
    # F is wrong: Using two provers (MIP) allows for verification of a larger class of problems (NEXP)
    #            than with one prover (IP = PSPACE).
    # G is wrong: A polynomial-time verifier with a prover can solve problems in PSPACE (IP=PSPACE),
    #            which is believed to be vastly larger than NP.
    # I is wrong: The soundness condition is stated incorrectly. It should state that for a false
    #            statement (z not in L), the verifier rejects ALL possible proofs.

    explanation = "The correct statement is D. In generalized proof systems, such as interactive proof systems, a fundamental principle is the computational asymmetry between the prover and the verifier. The verifier must be efficient (run in polynomial time) for the verification to be considered practical. In contrast, the prover is assumed to have immense computational power (often modeled as unbounded or exponential-time) to find the proofs or answers needed to convince the verifier, especially for problems in complex classes like PSPACE."
