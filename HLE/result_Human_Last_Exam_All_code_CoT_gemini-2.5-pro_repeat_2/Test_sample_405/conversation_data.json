    "Here is a plan to determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the known allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will list the distinct colors associated with these allotropes, including common variations and more recently discovered forms.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script to gather these colors, count the number of unique colors, and present the result as a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes or categories to their observed colors.\n    # Some allotropes can exhibit more than one color.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": [\"White\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"Red\", \"Scarlet\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"Violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"Black\"],\n        \"2D Phosphorus\": [\"Blue\", \"Green\"] # Newer, synthesized 2D forms\n    }\n\n    print(\"The allotropes of phosphorus and their associated colors are:\")\n    \n    # Collect all unique colors from the dictionary values\n    unique_colors = set()\n    for allotrope, colors in allotrope_colors.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope}: {', '.join(colors)}\")\n        for color in colors:\n            unique_colors.add(color)\n\n    # Sort for consistent ordering\n    sorted_colors = sorted(list(unique_colors))\n    \n    total_colors = len(sorted_colors)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe unique colors are: {', '.join(sorted_colors)}.\")\n    print(f\"This gives a total of {total_colors} observable colors.\")\n    \n    # Building the equation string as requested\n    # It represents counting each unique color once.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in sorted_colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<8>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
