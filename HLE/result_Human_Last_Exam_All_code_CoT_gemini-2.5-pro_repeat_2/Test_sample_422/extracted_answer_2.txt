The two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems, are:
1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The requirement that a belief be justified can lead to an infinite regress (a belief is justified by another, which is justified by another, and so on forever), circular reasoning (A justifies B and B justifies A), or resting on an arbitrary foundational belief that has no justification itself. The JTB model does not inherently solve how to properly ground justification.
2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The requirement that a belief be true depends on an objective state of the world that is external to the believer's mind. A person can have a belief that is perfectly supported by their evidence and reasoning, yet they can never be absolutely certain it is true. This means a person can never definitively know if they possess "knowledge" or simply a very well-justified (but potentially false) belief.
