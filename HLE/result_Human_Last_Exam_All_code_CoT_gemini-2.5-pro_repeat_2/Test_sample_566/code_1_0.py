    # Step 1: Define the core process of CARS.
    # CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering) is a nonlinear optical technique.
    # It uses a pump beam (frequency ω_p) and a Stokes beam (frequency ω_s) to coherently
    # excite molecular vibrations at a frequency Ω = ω_p - ω_s.
    # A probe beam (frequency ω_pr, often the same as the pump) then scatters off this
    # coherent vibration to generate a signal at the anti-Stokes frequency ω_as = ω_pr + Ω.

    print("=" * 40)
    print("1. The fundamental signal in CARS is an anti-Stokes beam. This process requires input pump and Stokes beams.")
    print("   - This fact immediately invalidates option A ('You can only generate a Stokes beam') and E ('You cannot generate an anti Stokes beam').")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Step 2: Define the "Broadband" aspect.
    # The goal of "broadband" CARS is to acquire a wide portion of a sample's vibrational spectrum at once.
    # This is typically done by using one broadband laser pulse and one narrowband pulse.
    # For example, using a broadband Stokes beam allows the frequency difference (ω_p - ω_s) to span
    # a wide range, simultaneously exciting many different vibrational modes (Ω).
    print("2. The purpose of 'broadband' CARS is to excite and detect a wide range of vibrational frequencies simultaneously.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Step 3: Analyze the information content of the signal.
    # When many vibrational modes are excited, the resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as) is also broadband.
    # This broadband signal is a composite of signals from all the excited vibrational modes.
    # By using a spectrometer to disperse this signal, one can see a spectrum where each peak
    # corresponds to a specific molecular vibration.
    # Therefore, the anti-Stokes beam contains separable, or distinguishable, vibrational information.
    print("3. The generated broadband anti-Stokes signal contains the spectral information from all excited vibrations.")
    print("   When this signal is analyzed with a spectrometer, each frequency component corresponds to a distinct molecular vibration.")
    print("   - This directly supports option C.")
    print("   - This directly contradicts option B, which claims the information is not separate.")
    print("=" * 40)

    # Step 4: Conclude the analysis.
    final_answer = 'C'
    explanation = "You can generate a anti Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information"
    print(f"Conclusion: The correct statement is '{final_answer}'.")
    print(f"The primary advantage of broadband CARS is that the generated anti-Stokes signal is spectrally rich, allowing for the rapid acquisition of a vibrational spectrum where different molecular vibrations can be distinguished.")
