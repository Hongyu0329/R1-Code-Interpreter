    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between uncertainties:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp ⋅ Δx = ħ / 2\n    From this, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  **Determine the momentum in the first Bohr orbit:** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized:\n    L = n ⋅ ħ\n    For the first Bohr orbit, n = 1, so L = ħ.\n    The classical definition of angular momentum is L = r ⋅ p, where r is the orbital radius and p is the linear momentum. For the first orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n    Therefore, ħ = a₀ ⋅ p, which gives the momentum:\n    p = ħ / a₀\n\n3.  **Calculate the required ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p):\n    Ratio = Δp / p\n    Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:\n    Ratio = [ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)] / [ħ / a₀]\n    The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the formula to:\n    Ratio = a₀ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** We will use the known values for the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m) and the given uncertainty in position (Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m) to compute the final ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum\n# to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n#\n\n# Step 1: Define the known constants.\n# The Bohr radius (a0) in meters.\nbohr_radius_a0 = 5.29177e-11  # meters\n\n# The given uncertainty in position (delta_x) in meters.\n# 10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 meters\nuncertainty_position_dx = 10e-12  # meters\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio using the derived formula: Ratio = a0 / (2 * dx).\n# The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the uncertainty in momentum (dp):\n# dp = h_bar / (2 * dx)\n# The momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p) is:\n# p = h_bar / a0\n# The ratio dp / p simplifies to a0 / (2 * dx).\nratio = bohr_radius_a0 / (2 * uncertainty_position_dx)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation with the numbers used and the result.\nprint(\"The final equation for the ratio is:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = Bohr Radius / (2 * Uncertainty in Position)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {bohr_radius_a0} / (2 * {uncertainty_position_dx})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
