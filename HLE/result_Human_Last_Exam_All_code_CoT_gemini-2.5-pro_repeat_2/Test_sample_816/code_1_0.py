    # A. Marangoni Force
    print("\n[A] Marangoni Force: This force is driven by a gradient in surface tension (γ).")
    print("   - The flow direction is from low surface tension to high surface tension.")
    print("   - In pure metals, surface tension decreases with temperature (dγ/dT < 0), causing outward flow.")
    print("   - However, 304 stainless steel contains surfactants like sulfur. For these alloys, surface tension INCREASES with temperature (dγ/dT > 0).")
    print("   - Therefore, the hot center has the HIGHEST surface tension, and the cool edges have a LOWER surface tension.")
    print("   - This creates a flow from the edges to the center (inward flow), which matches the observation.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This is a very strong candidate.")

    # B. Arc drag Force
    print("\n[B] Arc drag Force: This is a shear force from the plasma jet that pushes the fluid.")
    print("   - It pushes fluid away from the center of the arc. This causes an OUTWARD flow.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This force opposes the observed inward flow.")

    print("\n[C] Arc Pressure Force: This is a normal force that depresses the weld pool center.")
    print("   - It does not primarily drive the radial surface flow.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Not the dominant mechanism for the observed flow pattern.")

    # D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force
    print("\n[D] Lorentz Force: This force is caused by the interaction of the welding current and its magnetic field.")
    print("   - It generally pinches the fluid, driving it downwards and outwards from the center.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This force causes an OUTWARD flow, opposing the observation.")

    # E. Buoyancy Force
    print("\n[E] Buoyancy Force: This is caused by density differences due to temperature.")
    print("   - It primarily causes vertical circulation (convection) and is generally weaker than surface forces in GTAW.")
