    "To find the small molecules that interact with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817`, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install necessary library**: First, I'll need to use the `chembl_webresource_client` library to programmatically access the ChEMBL database. I will include the installation command in the comments.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will establish a connection to the ChEMBL database using the client.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: I will query the 'activity' endpoint of the ChEMBL database, filtering for all recorded bioactivities associated with the target ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817`. This target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro).\n4.  **Extract Molecule IDs**: From the list of activities, I will extract the ChEMBL ID for each unique small molecule (ligand) involved in these interactions.\n5.  **Print Results**: Finally, I will print the list of ChEMBL IDs for these small molecules.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the ChEMBL web resource client.\n# You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that have recorded interactions\n    with a given target ChEMBL ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Initialize the client for accessing the ChEMBL database\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # Query for activities associated with the specified target ID\n        print(f\"Querying ChEMBL for activities related to target: {target_chembl_id}...\")\n        res = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id)\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No activity data found for ChEMBL ID: {target_chembl_id}\")\n            return\n\n        # Use a set to store unique molecule ChEMBL IDs\n        molecule_ids = set()\n        for item in res:\n            # Add the molecule's ChEMBL ID to the set\n            if item['molecule_chembl_id']:\n                molecule_ids.add(item['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        if molecule_ids:\n            print(f\"\\nFound {len(molecule_ids)} unique small molecules that interact with {target_chembl_id}:\")\n            # Print each molecule ID\n            for mol_id in sorted(list(molecule_ids)):\n                print(mol_id)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Although activities were found, no specific molecule IDs were associated with them for {target_chembl_id}.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have an active internet connection and that the 'chembl_webresource_client' library is installed correctly.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_id)\n```"
