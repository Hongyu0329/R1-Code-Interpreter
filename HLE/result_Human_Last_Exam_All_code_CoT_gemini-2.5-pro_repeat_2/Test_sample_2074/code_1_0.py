# Based on the derivation, the value of l(b) is a constant for all b in (-1, 1).
# The complex definitions in the problem simplify significantly.
# 1. The condition on the matrix space L implies that M is symmetric.
# 2. The image of the space of symmetric matrices under the exponential map f(M)=e^M
#    is the space of symmetric positive-definite (s.p.d.) matrices.
# 3. The minimization expression for a given set of eigenvalues {nu_i} simplifies to the sum of the eigenvalues,
#    which is the trace of the matrix.
# 4. The eigenvalues nu_i are those of X + I, where X = A^T * [B*B^T]^-1 * A.
#    So the expression to minimize is Tr(X + I) = Tr(X) + 101.
# 5. l(b) becomes inf_{A is s.p.d.} [Tr(A * [B*B^T]^-1 * A) + 101].
# 6. The term Tr(A * [B*B^T]^-1 * A) is always non-negative, and its infimum is 0
#    (approached as A goes to the zero matrix).
# 7. Therefore, l(b) = 0 + 101 = 101.

# The value of l(b) is 101, regardless of b.
l_b_value = 101

# We need to compute l(1/2) and l(-1/2).
l_half = l_b_value
l_neg_half = l_b_value

# The final calculation is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2)).
result = 6 * (l_half + l_neg_half)

# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in.
print(f"The value of l(1/2) is {l_half}.")
print(f"The value of l(-1/2) is {l_neg_half}.")
print(f"The final computation is 6 * ({l_half} + {l_neg_half}) = {result}")

# Final Answer
print("<<<1212>>>")
