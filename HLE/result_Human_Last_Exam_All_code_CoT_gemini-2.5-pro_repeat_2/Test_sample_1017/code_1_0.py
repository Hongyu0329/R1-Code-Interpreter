# Step 1: Define the given stable commutator length (scl) values as fractions.
# Based on our interpretation, the numbers in the problem correspond to scl values.
scl_g1 = Fraction(2, 27)
scl_h2 = Fraction(16, 27)

# Step 2: State the formula being used.
# For an element w = g1*h2 in the free product G1*G2, where g1 and h2 are in the
# commutator subgroups of G1 and G2, the formula for stable commutator length is:
# scl(w) = 1/2 - (1/2) * (scl(g1) + scl(h2))

# Step 3: Perform the calculation step-by-step, printing the equation.

# Sum of the individual scl values
scl_sum = scl_g1 + scl_h2

# The term to be subtracted
subtrahend = Fraction(1, 2) * scl_sum

# Final result
result = Fraction(1, 2) - subtrahend

# Step 4: Print the full calculation in a clear, readable format.
