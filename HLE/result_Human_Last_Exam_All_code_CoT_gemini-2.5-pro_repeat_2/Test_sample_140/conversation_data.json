    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal packing strategy for 9x1x1 blocks inside a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes gives an upper bound, but doesn't account for the empty space created by packing.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Decomposition Strategy:** The most effective approach is to divide the 15x15x15 cube into smaller cuboids. Since the block's length is 9 and the cube's side is 15, a natural way to split the cube is along planes at 9 units from each face. This divides the 15x15x15 cube into 8 smaller cuboids with side lengths of either 9 or 6 (since 15 = 9 + 6).\n2.  **The 8 Sub-regions:**\n    *   One 9x9x9 cuboid.\n    *   Three 9x9x6 cuboids.\n    *   Three 9x6x6 cuboids.\n    *   One 6x6x6 cuboid.\n3.  **Calculate Blocks per Region:** For each sub-region, we'll calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit. A 9x1x1 block can only fit if at least one dimension of the sub-region is 9 or more.\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each of the 8 sub-regions.\n\nThis method accounts for all the space in the cube and provides the maximum possible number of blocks. The following Python code implements this strategy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_blocks_in_region(region_dims, block_dims):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the maximum number of blocks that fit in a region by checking all 3 orientations.\"\"\"\n    rx, ry, rz = sorted(region_dims, reverse=True)\n    bx, by, bz = sorted(block_dims, reverse=True) # (9, 1, 1)\n\n    # Only need to check one orientation since we sorted the dimensions.\n    # The longest side of the block must align with a side of the region that is long enough.\n    if rx < bx:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Pack along the longest dimension\n    fit = math.floor(rx / bx) * math.floor(ry / by) * math.floor(rz / bz)\n    return fit\n\n# Define dimensions\ncube_dim = 15\nblock_dims = (9, 1, 1)\nsplit_dim = block_dims[0]\nremaining_dim = cube_dim - split_dim\n\n# Define the 8 sub-regions based on the 9+6 split\nsub_regions = {\n    \"9x9x9\": (split_dim, split_dim, split_dim),\n    \"9x9x6\": (split_dim, split_dim, remaining_dim),\n    \"9x6x9\": (split_dim, remaining_dim, split_dim),\n    \"6x9x9\": (remaining_dim, split_dim, split_dim),\n    \"9x6x6\": (split_dim, remaining_dim, remaining_dim),\n    \"6x9x6\": (remaining_dim, split_dim, remaining_dim),\n    \"6x6x9\": (remaining_dim, remaining_dim, split_dim),\n    \"6x6x6\": (remaining_dim, remaining_dim, remaining_dim)\n}\n\ntotal_blocks = 0\ncalculation_parts = []\n\nprint(\"Calculating the number of blocks for each sub-region:\")\nfor name, dims in sub_regions.items():\n    num_blocks = calculate_blocks_in_region(dims, block_dims)\n    print(f\"- Region {name}: {num_blocks} blocks\")\n    if num_blocks > 0:\n        calculation_parts.append(str(num_blocks))\n    total_blocks += num_blocks\n\n# Final equation output\nfinal_equation = \" + \".join(calculation_parts)\nprint(f\"\\nTotal blocks = {final_equation} = {total_blocks}\")\n<<<351>>>\n```"
