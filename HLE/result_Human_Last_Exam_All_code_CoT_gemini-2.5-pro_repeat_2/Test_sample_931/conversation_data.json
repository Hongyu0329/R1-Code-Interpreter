    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Research the Diet:** I will first research the established diet of adult snakeflies from entomological sources. The key is to understand their primary and secondary food sources.\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will then systematically evaluate each answer choice against the research findings.\n    *   A. Nectar\n    *   B. Māhoe pollen\n    *   C. Fungus\n    *   D. Karamū leaf tissue\n    *   E. Totara Aphids\n3.  **Identify Correct Components:** I will identify all the food sources from the list that are consumed by adult snakeflies.\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:** Based on the correct components, I will choose the most comprehensive answer from the list, which includes combined options like F and G.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this reasoning and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Research indicates that adults are primarily predatory on other small,\n    # soft-bodied arthropods.

They are not herbivores (leaf-eaters) or fungivores.\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each food choice based on the known facts.\n    diet_analysis = {\n        \"A.
