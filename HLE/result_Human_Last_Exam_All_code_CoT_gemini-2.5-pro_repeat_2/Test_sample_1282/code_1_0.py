    print("A standard diffusion (or heat) equation, which has a smoothing effect, is of the form ∂_t u = +νΔu, where ν > 0 is the viscosity.")
    print("Our equation's linear part behaves like a 'backward' heat equation, as the coefficient of the Laplacian, -(1+t), is negative for t >= 0. This suggests anti-diffusion and instability.")

    print("The linear part of the equation is a backward heat equation, which is severely ill-posed and causes instantaneous blow-up for smooth initial data.")
