    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure to identify all chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule is built around a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring, with three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry is key because it means we only need to count the unique proton environments in the central core and within *one* of the three identical substituent \"arms\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Central Core and Linkers:**\n    *   **2,4,6-trimethyl groups:** The three methyl groups attached to the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **1,3,5-methyl linkers:** The molecule has three `-CH2-` (methylene) groups linking the central ring to the large indazolyl substituents. These three `CH2` groups are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. However, each `CH2` group is attached to a chiral center (the entire substituent is chiral). This makes the two protons on each `CH2` group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these linker protons will give rise to two distinct signals.\n\n3.  **Analyze one Substituent Arm:** The substituent `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` is a complex, rigid, and chiral structure derived from camphor (often called a camphopyrazole). Due to its rigidity and lack of internal symmetry, nearly all of its protons are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   **Pyrazole ring proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the ring system. (1 signal)\n    *   **Bridgehead proton:** There is a single proton on one of the bridgehead carbons of the bicyclic framework. (1 signal)\n    *   **Methylene protons (C5):** A `CH2` group in the six-membered ring has two diastereotopic protons (endo and exo). (2 signals)\n    *   **Methylene protons (C6):** Another `CH2` group in the six-membered ring also has two diastereotopic protons, which are different from the C5 protons. (2 signals)\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl group:** There is one unique methyl group at a bridgehead position. (1 signal)\n    *   **Gem-dimethyl group:** There is a pair of methyl groups on the one-carbon bridge of the framework. These two methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. (2 signals)\n\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** We add the number of signals from each distinct part of the molecule.\n    *   From the core methyl groups: 1\n    *   From the linker `CH2` groups: 2\n    *   From one substituent arm: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9\n    *   Total expected signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this breakdown.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the number of signals from the central core methyl groups.\n# 2. Define the number of signals from the methylene linkers.\n# 3. Define the number of signals from one of the identical substituent arms by summing its components.\n# 4. Sum these counts to get the total number of expected 1H NMR peaks.\n# 5. Print the detailed breakdown and the final calculation.\n\n# 1.

Signals from the -CH2- linkers\n# The three -CH2- groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n# However, each CH2 is attached to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic.\nlinker_ch2_signals = 2\n\n# 3.
