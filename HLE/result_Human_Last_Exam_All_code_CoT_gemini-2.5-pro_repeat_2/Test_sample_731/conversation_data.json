    "A power subgroup of a group is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. Our task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the group structure:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the general form $SD_{2^n}$, the size is $2^n$. So, for size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = 9$.\n2.  **Use the formula for the number of cyclic subgroups:** For a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, the total number of cyclic subgroups is given by the formula:\n    $N = n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$\n    This formula comes from summing the distinct cyclic subgroups of three types:\n    *   Subgroups of the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$: There are $n$ of these.\n    *   Cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements outside $\\langle r \\rangle$: There are $2^{n-2}$ of these.\n    *   Cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements outside $\\langle r \\rangle$: There are $2^{n-3}$ of these.\n3.  **Calculate the result:** We will substitute $n=9$ into the formula to find the total number of power subgroups.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will perform the calculation and print the result in the format of an equation.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   $n = 9$\n*   Number of subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle = n = 9$\n*   Number of subgroups of order 2 = $2^{n-2} = 2^{9-2} = 2^7 = 128$\n*   Number of subgroups of order 4 = $2^{n-3} = 2^{9-3} = 2^6 = 64$\n*   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the size is 2^n.\n    # We need to find the value of n.\n    # 2^n = 512 => n = log2(512)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The number of power (cyclic) subgroups in SD_{2^n} is given by the formula:\n    # n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\n    \n    # Calculate the three terms of the sum.\n    # 1. Number of cyclic subgroups within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>.\n    term1 = n\n    \n    # 2. Number of cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements not in <r>.\n    term2 = 2**(n - 2)\n    \n    # 3. Number of cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements not in <r>.\n    term3 = 2**(n - 3)\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of subgroups.\n    total = term1 + term2 + term3\n    \n    # Print the result as an equation.\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is calculated as the sum of three components:\")\n    print(f\"{term1} + {term2} + {term3} = {total}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<201>>>"
