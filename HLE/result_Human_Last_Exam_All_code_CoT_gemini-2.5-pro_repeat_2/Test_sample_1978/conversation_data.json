    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Index:** The index of a boundary-value problem is defined as the number of independent boundary conditions minus the number of first-order differential equations in the system (which is the dimension of the vector function $x(t)$).\n    \n    Index = (Number of independent boundary conditions) - (Dimension of the system)\n\n2.  **Determine the Dimension of the System (n):** The system's state is described by the vector $x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))$. This vector has 2024 components, which means the system consists of 2024 first-order differential equations. Therefore, the dimension of the system is $n = 2024$. The dimensions mentioned for matrix A and vector I(t) appear to be typos and are inconsistent with the definition of x(t) and the boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Count the Number of Independent Boundary Conditions (m):** We need to analyze the given boundary conditions to find how many of them are linearly independent.\n\n    The given conditions are:\n    1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0 \\implies 5(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is the same as condition 2.\n    4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0 \\implies 100(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is the same as condition 2.\n    5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0 \\implies -1000(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is also the same as condition 2.\n    6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0 \\implies 100(x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0)) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$.\n\n    After removing the redundant (linearly dependent) conditions, we are left with three unique conditions:\n    *   $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    *   $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\n    Thus, the number of independent boundary conditions is $m = 3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index:** Now we can compute the index using the formula from step 1.\n    Index = $m - n = 3 - 2024 = -2021$.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the system (n) is the number of functions in x(t).\n# x(t) = (x_1(t), ..., x_2024(t)), so n = 2024.\nn = 2024\n\n# The number of independent boundary conditions (m) is found by analyzing the given equations.\n# The unique conditions are for x_1, x_2, and x_2024. All conditions on x_2 are multiples of each other.\n# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n# 3. x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0\n# So, m = 3.\nm = 3\n\n# The index of the problem is defined as m - n.\nindex = m - n\n\n# Print the calculation step-by-step.\nprint(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of independent boundary conditions is m = {m}.\")\nprint(\"The index of the problem is calculated as m - n.\")\nprint(f\"Index = {m} - {n} = {index}\")\n```\n<<<-2021>>>"
