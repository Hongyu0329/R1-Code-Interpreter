# The dimension of the system (n) is the number of functions in x(t).
# x(t) = (x_1(t), ..., x_2024(t)), so n = 2024.
n = 2024

# The number of independent boundary conditions (m) is found by analyzing the given equations.
# The unique conditions are for x_1, x_2, and x_2024. All conditions on x_2 are multiples of each other.
# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
# 3. x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0
# So, m = 3.
m = 3

# The index of the problem is defined as m - n.
index = m - n

# Print the calculation step-by-step.
