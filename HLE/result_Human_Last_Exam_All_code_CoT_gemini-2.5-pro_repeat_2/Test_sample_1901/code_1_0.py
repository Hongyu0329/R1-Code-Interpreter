# Liquid Crystal Molecular Design Script

# 1. Define the design parameters based on the provided guidelines.
#    - The general structure is C(n)H(2n+1)-Ph-CN.
#    - 'Ph' represents the single benzene ring core.
#    - '-CN' is the polar group.
#    - We will start with an alkyl chain length of n=5, a common choice for
#      achieving room-temperature liquid crystal phases.

n = 5

# 2. Define the components of the molecule
core = "Ph"  # Represents a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)
polar_group = "CN"
alkyl_chain_prefix = "C(n)H(2*n+1)"

# 3. Calculate the specific alkyl chain formula based on n=5
#    This fulfills the requirement to output each number in the final equation.
