    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each individual surface.** The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\geq 2$, denoted $\\Sigma_g$, is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This is because the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$, and for hyperbolic surfaces ($g \\geq 2$), the simplicial volume is $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$.\n2.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented, hyperbolic manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $||M_1 \\times M_2|| = \\binom{\\dim M_1 + \\dim M_2}{\\dim M_1} ||M_1|| \\cdot ||M_2||$\n    Since the genera are $g_1=31$ and $g_2=17$ (both $\\geq 2$), the surfaces $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are hyperbolic. The dimension of any surface is 2.\n3.  **Combine the results.** We will plug the values for the individual simplicial volumes and the binomial coefficient into the product formula to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# The dimensions of the surfaces are 2\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface\n# The formula for a surface with genus g >= 2 is ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1)\nsv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\nsv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of the surface Σ_g with genus g >= 2 is ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1).\")\nprint(f\"For Σ_{g1}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = {sv1}.\")\nprint(f\"For Σ_{g2}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = {sv2}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula\n# The formula is C(dim(M1) + dim(M2), dim(M1))\ncoefficient = math.comb(n1 + n2, n1)\n\nprint(f\"The product formula for simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = C({n1} + {n2}, {n1}) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||.\")\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient C({n1 + n2}, {n1}) is {coefficient}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final simplicial volume of the product space\nresult = coefficient * sv1 * sv2\n\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} x \\u03A3_{g2}|| = {coefficient} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
