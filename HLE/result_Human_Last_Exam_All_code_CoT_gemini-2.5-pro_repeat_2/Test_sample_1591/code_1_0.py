# Based on the analysis, the problem simplifies to calculating (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
# The boundary conditions, after correcting a likely typo, give us the values for x_0^1 and x_0^2.

# From x_0^2 = 10^20
x0_2_base = 10
x0_2_exp = 20

# From x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2
x0_1_coeff_sq = 3 # (sqrt(3))^2

# Calculate the squares of the components
# (x_0^1)^2 = (sqrt(3) * 10^20)^2 = 3 * 10^40
term1_coeff = x0_1_coeff_sq
term1_exp = 2 * x0_2_exp

# (x_0^2)^2 = (10^20)^2 = 1 * 10^40

term2_exp = 2 * x0_2_exp

# Sum the terms: 3 * 10^40 + 1 * 10^40 = 4 * 10^40
final_coeff = term1_coeff + term2_coeff
