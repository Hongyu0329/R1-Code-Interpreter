# Based on the mathematical derivation, the expression simplifies significantly.
# The numerator term is 2 * ||alpha||^2, and we found ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# So, 2 * ||alpha||^2 = 2 * 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1) = (pi^2/6 - 1).
# The denominator is (pi^2/6 - 1).
# The fraction simplifies to (pi^2/6 - 1) / (pi^2/6 - 1) = 1.

# Therefore, the entire expression becomes 1 + 10^15.

# The first number in the final equation
num1 = 1

# The second number in the final equation
num2 = 10**15

# The result of the expression
result = num1 + num2

# As requested, printing each number in the final equation.
# We use integers for a clean representation.
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the equation: {num1} + {int(num2)} = {int(result)}")
