def solve_hopf_algebra_problem():
    """
    Solves the three-part problem based on the provided Hopf algebra action formula.

    Plan:
    1.  For part (a), the conditions on the action on the identity element 1_R are insufficient to
        constrain the action on a general element r. Therefore, no general property of symmetry
        can be implied. The answer is 'No'.
    2.  For parts (b) and (c), the key condition is `g · 1_R = 0`. For a group-like element `g`,
        its action on an algebra is typically homomorphic (`g · (st) = (g · s)(g · t)`).
        This implies `g · r = g · (1_R * r) = (g · 1_R)(g · r) = 0 · (g · r) = 0` for all `r`.
        Thus, the action of `g` is the zero map.
    3.  This further implies that for any k >= 1, the action of `g^k a` is also zero, since
        `(g^k a) · r = g^k · (a · r) = 0`.
    4.  As a result, the summation in the given formula for `x^j a · r` collapses to only the k=0 term.
    5.  The k=0 term is `(x · 1_R)^j * (a · r)`. Let `w = x · 1_R`. The expression simplifies to `w^j * (a · r)`.
    6.  For (b), with j=2 and r=1_R, the expression is `w^2 * (a · 1_R)`.
    7.  For (c), with j=3 and r=1_R, the expression is `w^3 * (a · 1_R)`.
    8.  The final formatted answer is constructed from these results.
