    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the base molecule:** The name is \"perfluoronanocar\", so the base molecule is a \"nanocar\". We need to find its chemical structure and formula. A nanocar is a real molecule designed by chemists, consisting of a chassis and four fullerene (C60) wheels.\n2.  **Count the hydrogen atoms:** The key part of the name is the prefix \"perfluoro-\". In chemical nomenclature, this means all hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. So, our main task is to find out how many hydrogen atoms are in a standard nanocar. The fullerene wheels (C60) are pure carbon, so we only need to consider the chassis and axles. The chemical formula for the chassis/axle part is C44H28O4.\n3.  **Perform the substitution:** Since \"perfluoro-\" means replacing all hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in a regular nanocar.\n4.  **Write the code:** The Python code will define the number of hydrogen atoms based on the chemical formula and then state that this is equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version, printing the final result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar.\n    # The nanocar's chassis and axle structure has the chemical formula C44H28O4.\n    # The four C60 fullerene wheels have no hydrogen atoms.\n    # Therefore, the entire molecule has 28 hydrogen atoms.\n    num_hydrogen_atoms = 28\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the \"perfluoro-\" rule.\n    # The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n    # Thus, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n\n    # Step 3: Display the reasoning and the final equation.\n    print(\"A standard nanocar molecule contains a chassis and four fullerene wheels.\")\n    print(f\"The chassis and axles part contains all the hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms in a nanocar = {num_hydrogen_atoms}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe prefix 'perfluoro-' means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is also {num_fluorine_atoms}.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine Atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
