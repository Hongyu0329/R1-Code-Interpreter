    print("closely spaced energy levels:")
    print("  1. A symmetric ground state.")
    print("  2. An antisymmetric excited state.")
    print("\nFor tunneling to be an observable effect (like the ~24 GHz absorption in ordinary")
    print("ammonia), both of these energy levels must be allowed to exist according to the")
    print("fundamental symmetry rules of quantum mechanics.\n")

    print("Step 2: The Role of Nuclear Spin and Symmetry")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("The key difference lies in the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms.")
    print("  - Ordinary Hydrogen (Proton): Has nuclear spin 1/2. Particles with half-integer spin are FERMIONS.")

    print("  - For FERMIONS, Ψ_total must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - For BOSONS, Ψ_total must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("\nOur exotic ammonia molecule is made of three identical bosons (the H nuclei), so its")
    print("total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC upon exchange of any two H nuclei.\n")

    print("Step 3: Deconstructing the Total Wavefunction")
    print("----------------------------------------------")
    print("The total wavefunction is approximately a product of its components:")
    print("Ψ_total = Ψ_electronic × Ψ_vibrational × Ψ_rotational × Ψ_nuclear_spin")
    print("\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each part for our exotic molecule:")
    print("  - Ψ_nuclear_spin: For three spin-0 nuclei, there is only one possible combined spin")
    print("    state. This state is necessarily SYMMETRIC under exchange.")
    print("  - Ψ_electronic: The ground electronic state is SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - Ψ_vibrational: The inversion (tunneling) mode can be SYMMETRIC or ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - Ψ_rotational: The molecule has rotational states that are SYMMETRIC and others that")
    print("    are ANTISYMMETRIC with respect to H-H exchange.\n")

    print("Step 4: Applying the Overall Symmetry Requirement")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("The required symmetry is: (Ψ_electronic) × (Ψ_vibrational) × (Ψ_rotational) × (Ψ_nuclear_spin) = SYMMETRIC")
    print("Substituting the known symmetries:")
    print("(SYMMETRIC) × (Ψ_vibrational) × (Ψ_rotational) × (SYMMETRIC) = SYMMETRIC")

    print("Step 5: Checking if Both Tunneling States Can Exist")
    print("---------------------------------------------------")

    print("\n  Case A: The Symmetric Vibrational State")
    print("  To satisfy the rule, (Ψ_vibrational = SYMMETRIC) must be paired with a (Ψ_rotational = SYMMETRIC).")
    print("  Result: This is ALLOWED, because symmetric rotational states exist for ammonia.\n")

    print("  Case B: The Antisymmetric Vibrational State")
    print("  To satisfy the rule, (Ψ_vibrational = ANTISYMMETRIC) must be paired with a (Ψ_rotational = ANTISYMMETRIC).")
    print("  Result: This is also ALLOWED, because antisymmetric rotational states exist for ammonia.\n")


    print("Step 6: Final Conclusion")
    print("------------------------")
    print("Since the overall symmetry rules permit the existence of both the symmetric and")
    print("the antisymmetric vibrational states (by pairing them with appropriate rotational")
    print("states), the energy level splitting caused by tunneling will occur.")
