    "This is a question of theological history. My plan is to identify the key concepts in the question—\"specialized terminology,\" \"changes in the laws of nature,\" \"virgin birth,\" and \"the Fall\"—and search for the earliest major Christian theologian who systematically addressed all of them. The most likely candidates are foundational figures like Augustine of Hippo or later scholastics like Thomas Aquinas. The key will be to determine who was the *first* to develop a specific framework for this.\n\nBased on historical records, the theologian who first developed a sophisticated framework and terminology for this is Augustine of Hippo. He argued that miracles are not \"contrary to nature\" (*contra naturam*), but are only contrary to nature *as we know it* (*contra notam nobis naturam*). In his view, God is the author of all of nature's laws and can, therefore, act outside the usual and observable \"course of nature\" that He established, without any self-contradiction. This theological framework is directly applicable to explaining the virgin birth as a unique act of God outside the normal rules of procreation, and it can also be used to describe how the fundamental operations of the natural world could have been altered after the Fall of Man.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the theologian\n    who first developed terminology for changes in natural law\n    applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nsolve_theology_question()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
