    "I will write a Python script to determine the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a dictionary containing the names of major real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid and their corresponding approximate lengths in kilometers. The mythical underworld rivers will be excluded.\n2.  Sort this dictionary in descending order based on the rivers' lengths.\n3.  Select the top three rivers from the sorted list.\n4.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
