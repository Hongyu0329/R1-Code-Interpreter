# The solvability conditions for the nonlinear boundary value problem lead to an
# algebraic relationship between the initial values of the linear problem (x0, y0, z0).
# This relationship defines a surface in the (x0, y0, z0) space.

# The derivation described above yields the following equation for the surface:
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = C
# where the constant C is derived from the given condition.
# The given condition is: alpha + beta + gamma = 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T))
# Our derivation resulted in: alpha + beta + gamma = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))

# Equating these gives:
# 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T)) = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
# Dividing by 2 * (1 - exp(-T)) (assuming T > 0), we get:
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = 10^25 / 2

# This is the equation of a sphere: x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2
# The square of the radius, R^2, is:
given_sum_coeff = 1e25
divisor = 2
R_squared = given_sum_coeff / divisor

# The problem asks for the area of this surface.
# The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# We will use this formula for the calculation.

num_4 = 4
num_pi = math.pi
num_1e25 = 1e25
