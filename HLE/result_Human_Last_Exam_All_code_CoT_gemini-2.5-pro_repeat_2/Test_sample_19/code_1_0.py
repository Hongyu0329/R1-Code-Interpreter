    explanation = """
Kant's account of aesthetic judgment in the Critique of Judgment is best understood as being both descriptive and normative. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1.  The Descriptive Aspect: Kant's account is descriptive because it provides a detailed analysis of the cognitive faculties at play when a person makes an aesthetic judgment. He describes the inner workings of the mind, specifically the 'free play' between the faculties of imagination and understanding, which he argues is the basis for the feeling of pleasure in the beautiful. This is a description of the structure of our experience.

2.  The Normative Aspect: The account is also, and perhaps more importantly, normative. Kant's primary goal is to explain how a judgment of taste, which is based on a subjective feeling, can nevertheless claim universal validityâ€”that is, how we can expect others to agree with us. To achieve this, he prescribes the conditions a judgment must meet to be considered a 'pure' judgment of taste.

3.  The Normative Conditions: The key condition is disinterestedness. Kant argues that for a judgment of beauty to be valid, it must be detached from any personal interest, desire, or utility regarding the object's existence. By setting this rule, he establishes a norm or a standard. A judgment that fails to meet this standard (e.g., "I like this painting because it would fetch a high price") is not, for Kant, a true aesthetic judgment. This is a prescription for how one *ought* to judge.

Conclusion: Because Kant sets forth the rules and necessary conditions for a judgment to be valid and to command universal assent, his project is not merely to describe any and all aesthetic experiences. He is building a framework to justify the legitimacy of aesthetic judgments. Therefore, the account is both descriptive and normative.
