    "It seems there might be a slight confusion in the question's details. The most famous and iconic sequence of turns performed by Kitri in *Don Quixote* is the 32 fouetté turns, which traditionally take place in the grand pas de deux coda of **Act III**, not the Act I variation. While the Act I variation is technically demanding, it doesn't feature a famous, set number of \"single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n\nAssuming you are referring to the renowned sequence of 32 fouettés, I will provide the code to output that number.\n\n```python\n# The famous turning sequence associated with Kitri in Don Quixote\n# is the 32 fouettés from the Act III grand pas de deux.\n\n# The number of turns in this iconic sequence.\nnumber_of_turns = 32\n\n# The following equation represents the number of turns.\n# We will print the number.\nprint(number_of_turns)\n```\n<<<32>>>"
