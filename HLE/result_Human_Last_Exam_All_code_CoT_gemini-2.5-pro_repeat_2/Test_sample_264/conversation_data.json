    "To solve this problem, we'll determine the shape and size of the overlapping region between the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes and the Shift:** We can model the first cube, `C1`, as being centered at the origin, occupying the space where `-0.5 <= x, y, z <= 0.5`. The second cube, `C2`, is identical but translated. The translation is specified as a shift of magnitude `0.5` along the main diagonal. The direction of the main diagonal can be represented by the vector `(1, 1, 1)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Shift Vector:** The shift vector `s` must have a length of `0.5` and be in the direction of `(1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   First, we find the unit vector `u` in the direction `(1, 1, 1)`:\n        `u = (1, 1, 1) / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = (1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3))`\n    *   Then, we scale this unit vector by the shift magnitude `0.5`:\n        `s = 0.5 * u = (0.5/sqrt(3), 0.5/sqrt(3), 0.5/sqrt(3))`\n    *   Let's call the component of this shift vector `d = 0.5 / sqrt(3)`. So, the center of the second cube `C2` is at `(d, d, d)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intersection Volume:** Since both cubes are axis-aligned, their intersection is also an axis-aligned shape (a cuboid). We can find the dimensions of this intersection by finding the overlap along each axis.\n    *   **For the x-axis:**\n        *   `C1` spans `[-0.5, 0.5]`.\n        *   `C2` spans `[d - 0.5, d + 0.5]`.\n        *   The intersection on the x-axis is `[max(-0.5, d - 0.5), min(0.5, d + 0.5)]`. Since `d` is a small positive number, this simplifies to `[d - 0.5, 0.5]`.\n    *   The length of this intersection along the x-axis is `L_x = 0.5 - (d - 0.5) = 1 - d`.\n    *   The situation is identical for the y and z axes, so `L_y = 1 - d` and `L_z = 1 - d`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a cube with a side length of `(1 - d)`. The volume `V` is therefore `(1 - d)^3`.\n    *   `V = (1 - 0.5 / sqrt(3))^3`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting volume.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_intersection_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes shifted along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of each cube\n    cube_side_length = 1.0\n\n    # The magnitude of the shift along the main diagonal\n    shift_magnitude = 0.5\n\n    # The main diagonal is in the direction (1, 1, 1). The length of this direction vector is sqrt(3).\n    # We need to find the component 'd' of the shift vector along each axis.\n    # The shift vector s = (d, d, d), and its magnitude is ||s|| = sqrt(d^2 + d^2 + d^2) = d*sqrt(3).\n    # We are given ||s|| = 0.5.\n    # So, d*sqrt(3) = 0.5, which means d = 0.5 / sqrt(3).\n    d = shift_magnitude / math.sqrt(3)\n\n    # The intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube.\n    # Its side length is the original side length minus the shift component 'd'.\n    intersect_side_length = cube_side_length - d\n\n    # The volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length.\n    volume = intersect_side_length ** 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the initial parameters.\")\n    print(f\"Side length of the cubes (L): {cube_side_length}\")\n    print(f\"Shift magnitude along the main diagonal: {shift_magnitude}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the shift component 'd' along each axis.\")\n    print(f\"d = shift_magnitude / sqrt(3) = {shift_magnitude} / {math.sqrt(3):.6f} = {d:.6f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the side length of the intersection volume.\")\n    print(f\"Intersection side length = L - d = {cube_side_length} - {d:.6f} = {intersect_side_length:.6f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the final volume.\")\n    # Show the equation with numbers\n    print(\"The final equation for the volume is (L - d)^3.\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ({cube_side_length} - {shift_magnitude} / sqrt(3))^3\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ({cube_side_length:.1f} - {d:.6f})^3 = ({intersect_side_length:.6f})^3\")\n    print(f\"Final Volume: {volume:.6f}\")\n\nsolve_intersection_volume()\n```\n<<<0.359918>>>"
