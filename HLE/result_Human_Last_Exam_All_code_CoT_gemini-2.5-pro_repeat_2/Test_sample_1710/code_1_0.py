    """
    This function identifies the correct moves for Black on the given Go board.
    The problem is a classic tactical Go problem (Tsumego). The analysis involves
    identifying the weak white group and the vital points for attack and defense.

    The two white stones to be captured are at (4, 2) and (4, 3).
    The black group that needs to ensure its survival is the one in the center.

    The vital points that achieve both objectives are (3, 1) and (4, 1).
    Playing at either of these points initiates a sequence that leads to the
    capture of the two white stones while securing the black group.
