    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Use the definition of the complex power, $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. The term $i^z$ is multi-valued because the complex logarithm $\\ln(i)$ is multi-valued.\n    $\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n    So, the equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. A value of $z$ is a solution if this equality holds for at least one integer $k$.\n\n2.  To simplify the equation, we perform a substitution. Let $z = a \\cdot i$ for some complex number $a$. This substitution is a one-to-one mapping of the complex plane to itself, so we can solve for $a$ and then find $z$ without loss of generality.\n    Substituting $z=ai$ into the equation:\n    $(ai) \\cdot i = e^{(ai) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n    $-a = e^{-a(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\n3.  This is a transcendental equation for $a$. Let $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation is $-a = e^{-aC_k}$. We can rearrange this to match the form required for the Lambert W function, which is defined by $W(x)e^{W(x)}=x$.\n    $a = -e^{-aC_k}$\n    $a e^{aC_k} = -1$\n    Multiply by $C_k$:\n    $(aC_k)e^{(aC_k)} = -C_k$\n    This is in the form $X e^X = Y$, with $X = aC_k$ and $Y = -C_k$.\n\n4.  The solution for $X$ is given by the Lambert W function, $X = W(Y)$.\n    $aC_k = W(-C_k)$\n    Since the Lambert W function is multi-valued for non-zero arguments, we denote its branches by an integer index $j$, $W_j$.\n    $a_{j,k} = \\frac{W_j(-C_k)}{C_k} = \\frac{W_j(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n\n5.  Finally, we find the solutions for $z$ by substituting back $z=ai$.\n    $z_{j,k} = i \\cdot a_{j,k} = i \\frac{W_j(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n    This formula gives all solutions for $z$ for all integers $j$ (branch index) and $k$ (logarithm branch).\n\nThis general solution includes several types of solutions:\n*   **Real solutions**: $z=1$ and $z=-1$. These can be verified to be solutions for any integer $k$. For instance, for $z=1$, the equation is $1 \\cdot i = i^1$, which simplifies to $i=i$. For $z=-1$, we have $-1 \\cdot i = i^{-1}$, which simplifies to $-i=-i$.\n*   **Purely imaginary solutions**: For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is exactly one purely imaginary solution. This corresponds to the case where $a$ is real, which happens when the principal branch $W_0$ is taken and its argument $-C_k$ is positive.\n*   **Complex solutions**: For other choices of $j$ and $k$, we get complex solutions for $z$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy` library to calculate some of these solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_z(k, j):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a solution z for the equation z*i = i^z based on integer indices k and j.\n    k: integer for the branch of the logarithm of i.\n    j: integer for the branch of the Lambert W function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate C_k = (pi/2 + 2*k*pi)\n    C_k = np.pi / 2 + 2 * k * np.pi\n    \n    # Argument for the Lambert W function\n    arg_W = -C_k\n    \n    # Calculate a = W_j(-C_k) / C_k\n    try:\n        a = lambertw(arg_W, k=j) / C_k\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        return None # In case of invalid inputs for lambertw\n    \n    # Calculate z = a * i\n    z = a * 1j\n    \n    return z\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints various solutions to z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The equation is z * i = i^z.\")\n    print(\"Solutions are of the form z = i * W_j(-(pi/2 + 2*k*pi)) / (pi/2 + 2*k*pi)\")\n    print(\"where k is the integer index for the logarithm branch and j is for the Lambert W function branch.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Two special real solutions are:\")\n    # We can verify z=1 and z=-1 are solutions\n    print(f\"z = {1.0:.1f}\")\n    print(f\"z = {-1.0:.1f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Examples of purely imaginary solutions (for k <= -1, j = 0):\")\n    for k in range(-1, -4, -1):\n        z = solve_z(k, 0)\n        print(f\"For k={k}, j=0:  z = {z:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nExamples of complex solutions (for k >= 0):\")\n    # For k=0, let's check a few branches j\n    k = 0\n    for j in range(-2, 3):\n        z = solve_z(k, j)\n        print(f\"For k={k}, j={j}: z = {z.real:.6f} + {z.imag:.6f}i\")\n\n    # For k=1, let's check a few branches j\n    k = 1\n    print()\n    for j in range(-2, 3):\n        z = solve_z(k, j)\n        print(f\"For k={k}, j={j}: z = {z.real:.6f} + {z.imag:.6f}i\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<z_{j,k} = i \\frac{W_j(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} \\text{ for } j, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}>>>"
