    # decomposition of the N=4 fields (e.g., Phi_{i4} = (phi_i + phi_i*)/sqrt(2))
    # results in a coefficient of k_Yuk / sqrt(2) for this interaction.

    # From the Yukawa term matching, we found g=1. So, L_D is exactly the canonical D-term potential V_D for g=1.

    # The term L_{F+D}(SU(4)) represents the full N=4 scalar potential, scaled by k_{D+F}.
    # The full potential V_N=4 decomposes into F-term and D-term parts: V_N=4 = V_F + V_D.
    # So, the D-term part of L_{F+D}(SU(4)) is k_{D+F} * V_D.
