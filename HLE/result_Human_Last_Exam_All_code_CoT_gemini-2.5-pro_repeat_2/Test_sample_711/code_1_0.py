    This function determines the solution to the Minecraft block riddle.

    The riddle describes the initial state of a Skyblock-like challenge.
    The key constraint is that this block is the first one that must be obtained
    to enable the acquisition of all other blocks.

    In Minecraft, progression begins with wood. A player must punch a tree
    to get a Log. This Log is then used to craft planks, a crafting table,
    and then tools. Without the initial Log, no other resources can be gathered.
