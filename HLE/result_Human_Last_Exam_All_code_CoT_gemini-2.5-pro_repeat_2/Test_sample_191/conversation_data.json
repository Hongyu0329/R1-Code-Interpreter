    "The protein in question is **CD47**.\n\nCD47 is a protein found on the surface of many cells and has also been identified on amyloid plaques. It functions as a \"don't eat me\" signal by binding to the SIRPÎ± receptor on macrophages. This interaction inhibits phagocytosis (the process of engulfment). When the function of CD47 is disrupted, either by being blocked with antibodies or by being cleaved/broken down, the inhibitory signal is removed. This allows macrophages to recognize and engulf the amyloid plaques.\n\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
