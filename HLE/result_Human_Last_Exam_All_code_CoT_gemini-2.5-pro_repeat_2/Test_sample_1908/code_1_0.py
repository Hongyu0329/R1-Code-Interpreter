    This function explains the solution to the problem and prints the final answer.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology T on a set X with cardinality c can have.

    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {empty_set, X}.

    The smallest possible number of complements is 0. Here is a proof by construction:

    1.  Let X be a set with cardinality c. We partition X into two sets, P and {q},
        where |P| = c and {q} is a singleton set.

    2.  Define a topology T on X as follows:
        T = {U subset of X | q is in U and P \ U is finite} U {empty_set}.
        This can be shown to be a valid non-trivial, non-discrete topology.

    3.  Assume S is a complement to T. The first condition for a complement is that
        for any point x in X, there must be a set U in T and V in S such that
        U intersect V = {x}.

    4.  Let's test this condition. The whole set X is an open set in T (because q is in X
        and P \ X is the empty set, which is finite).
        So, we can choose U = X for any x in X.
        The condition becomes: X intersect V = {x}, which implies V = {x}.
        This must hold for every x in X.

    5.  Therefore, for S to be a complement of T, it must contain all singleton sets {x}
        for every x in X.

    6.  Since S is a topology, it must be closed under arbitrary unions. If S contains
        all singletons, it must be the discrete topology P(X) (the power set of X).

    7.  Now we check the second condition for a complement: T intersect S = {empty_set, X}.
        If S is the discrete topology P(X), the intersection is T intersect P(X) = T.
        So, the condition becomes T = {empty_set, X}.

    8.  However, T is not the trivial topology. For example, for any p in P, the set
        X \ {p} is in T. This is a contradiction.

    9.  The contradiction arose from the assumption that a complement S exists. Therefore,
        the topology T has no complements.

    10. Since it is possible for a topology to have 0 complements, and the number of
        complements cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.
