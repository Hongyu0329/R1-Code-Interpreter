    "To determine a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles for the knot $9_{23}$, we can use its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$. A key result in knot theory provides a relationship between the span of the z-variable in this polynomial and the number of Seifert circles, $s(K)$, for any diagram of a knot $K$:\n\n$s(K) \\geq \\frac{\\text{span}_z(P)}{2} + 1$\n\nHere, $\\text{span}_z(P)$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of the variable 'z' in the polynomial.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the `spherogram` library in Python to programmatically obtain the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$.\n2.  Analyze the resulting polynomial to find the highest and lowest powers of the variable 'z'.\n3.  Calculate the span of 'z': $\\text{span}_z = z_{max} - z_{min}$.\n4.  Apply the formula above to compute the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n5.  Print the entire calculation process, including the intermediate values, to show how the final result is obtained.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this plan. You will need the `spherogram` and `sympy` libraries, which can be installed via pip if you don't have them (`pip install spherogram sympy`).\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_seifert_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    of a knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
