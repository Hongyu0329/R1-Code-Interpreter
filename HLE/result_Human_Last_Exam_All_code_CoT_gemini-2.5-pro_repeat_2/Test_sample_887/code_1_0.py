    # The question asks to identify the correct statement about the effect of
    # exciting the C-H bond in CHD3 before it reacts with a fluorine atom.

    # Step 1: Analyze the effect of vibrational excitation.
    # Exciting a bond with a laser adds vibrational energy to that specific bond.
    # This energy can help overcome the activation energy barrier for a chemical reaction.
    explanation_part1 = "1. Exciting the C-H bond with an infrared laser adds energy specifically to that bond."
    explanation_part2 = "2. This added energy helps the molecule overcome the activation barrier for breaking the C-H bond."

    # Step 2: Consider the consequences for the reaction rate.
    # By making it easier to break the C-H bond, the rate of that specific reaction pathway increases.
    # This leads to an overall acceleration of the reaction.
    explanation_part3 = "3. As a result, the reaction channel that involves breaking the C-H bond (to form HF) becomes much faster."
    explanation_part4 = "4. This increase in the rate of one channel accelerates the overall reaction."

    # Step 3: Consider the consequences for selectivity.
    # The molecule CHD3 has one C-H bond and three C-D bonds.
    # Since only the C-H bond is excited, the reaction is preferentially directed to that site.
    explanation_part5 = "5. Since the energy is targeted to the C-H bond, the probability of an H atom being removed becomes much higher than the probability of a D atom being removed."

    # Step 4: Conclude and match with the best option.
    # The overall effect is an accelerated reaction with a strong preference for H-atom abstraction over D-atom abstraction.
    # This matches option D.
    conclusion = "Therefore, exciting the C-H bond accelerates the reaction by enhancing the likelihood of H atom removal over D atoms."
