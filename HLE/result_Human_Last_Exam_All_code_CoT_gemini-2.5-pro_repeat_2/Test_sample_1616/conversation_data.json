    "My plan is to solve this linguistic puzzle by first defining Trisyllabic Laxing and then analyzing each word against this definition.\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** This is a sound rule in English where a tense vowel (like the \"i\" in `derive`) becomes a lax vowel (like the \"i\" in `derivative`) when it falls on the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of a word, usually due to the addition of a suffix.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:**\n    *   `southern`: From `south` (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/). Vowel laxing occurs, but the word has only two syllables, so it's not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   `derivative`: From `derive` (/aɪ/ -> /ɪ/). The vowel is in the third-from-last syllable of a four-syllable word. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   `serenity`: From `serene` (/iː/ -> /ɛ/). The vowel is in the third-from-last syllable of a four-syllable word. This is also a classic example.\n    *   `pleasant`: From `please` (/iː/ -> /ɛ/). Vowel laxing occurs, but the word is disyllabic, so it isn't *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   `gratitude`: From `grate` (/eɪ/ -> /æ/). The vowel is in the third-from-last syllable of a three-syllable word. This fits the pattern.\n    *   `shadow`: This word comes from Old English and is not formed by adding a suffix to a base word like `shade`. It has two syllables, and its vowel laxness is not a result of this specific sound-change rule.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` have all undergone trisyllabic laxing. `southern` and `pleasant` have undergone a similar laxing process but don't fit the \"trisyllabic\" rule. `shadow` is the only word that has not undergone this type of derivational sound change at all.\n\nI will now create a Python script to present this analysis and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"root\": \"south\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"undergone\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Vowel laxing from 'south' (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/) occurred, but the word is disyllabic, so it's not *trisyllabic* laxing.\"\n        },\n        \"derivative\": {\n            \"root\": \"derive\",\n            \"syllables\": 4,\n            \"undergone\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Classic example.
