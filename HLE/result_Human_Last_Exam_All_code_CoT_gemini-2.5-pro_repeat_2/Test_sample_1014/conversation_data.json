    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will use the method of trial division. This is a systematic way to perform prime factorization.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will write a script to check for divisibility by prime numbers, starting from the smallest prime, 2.\n3.  The script will then check for odd divisors (3, 5, 7, ...) up to the square root of `n`.\n4.  If a divisor `d` is found, I will divide `n` by `d` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible, recording `d` as a factor.\n5.  This process continues with the reduced value of `n` until all factors are found.\n6.  If no factors are found by the time the search reaches the square root of the original number, it means the number itself is prime. In this case, it is its own largest prime divisor.\n7.  The script will print the complete prime factorization and then state the largest prime divisor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n    It finds all prime factors and then identifies the largest one.\n    The code also prints the full prime factorization equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = {}\n\n    # Check for factor 2\n    count = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n = n // 2\n    if count > 0:\n        factors[2] = count\n\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 up to sqrt(n)\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        count = 0\n        while n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n = n // i\n        if count > 0:\n            factors[i] = count\n        i += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 2, it's a prime factor itself\n    if n > 2:\n        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1\n\n    # If the number is prime, it's the only factor\n    if not factors:\n        # This case handles n=1, but for a prime number,\n        # the previous block would have added it.\n        # This is a fallback.\n        factors[original_n] = 1\n\n    largest_prime = max(factors.keys())\n\n    # Prepare the equation string\n    equation_parts = []\n    for factor in sorted(factors.keys()):\n        power = factors[factor]\n        if power > 1:\n            equation_parts.append(f\"{factor}^{power}\")\n        else:\n            equation_parts.append(str(factor))\n\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    if original_n == largest_prime and len(factors) == 1:\n        print(f\"{original_n} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is: {original_n} = {equation_str}\")\n    \n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
