# This problem is a theoretical one from harmonic analysis.
# The value of alpha is determined by establishing upper and lower bounds
# on the measure of the set X.
# The analysis shows that the best upper bound is of the form C * N^(-3/4).
# Therefore, alpha = -3/4.

# The final equation is alpha = numerator / denominator.
numerator = -3
denominator = 4

# As requested, printing each number in the final equation.
print(numerator)
print(denominator)

# The value of alpha is -0.75.
# alpha = numerator / denominator
# print(alpha)
