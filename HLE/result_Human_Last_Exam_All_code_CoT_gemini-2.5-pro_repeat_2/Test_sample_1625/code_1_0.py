    explanation = """
    Step 1: Understand the Coordinate System
    In toroidal plasma physics (e.g., in a tokamak), the magnetic field and plasma properties are described in a coordinate system that fits the doughnut shape (torus). The position of a point is often given by (r, θ, φ), where 'r' is a radial coordinate, 'θ' is the poloidal angle (the short way around the torus), and 'φ' is the toroidal angle (the long way around the torus).

    Step 2: Identify the Nature of Poloidal Dependence
    The poloidal angle 'θ' is periodic. If you move around the poloidal direction by 2π radians, you return to your starting point. Any physical quantity, let's call it F, must be periodic in θ, meaning F(θ) = F(θ + 2π).

    Step 3: Match the Property with the Mathematical Technique
    We need a spectral series expansion technique that is naturally suited for periodic functions. Let's evaluate the options:
    - Polynomials (Legendre, Chebyshev, etc.): These are typically defined and are orthogonal over a finite, non-periodic interval like [-1, 1]. They are not the natural choice for a periodic variable.
    - Spherical Harmonics: These are the standard basis functions for describing functions on the surface of a SPHERE, not a torus. The symmetries are different.
    - Fourier Series: A Fourier series is the fundamental mathematical tool for representing a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine functions (which are themselves periodic). A function f(θ) can be written as Σ [a_n*cos(nθ) + b_n*sin(nθ)]. This perfectly matches the periodic nature of the poloidal angle.

    Step 4: Conclusion
    Because the poloidal dependence is inherently periodic, the Fourier series is the adapted and most commonly used spectral expansion technique in toroidal systems for this coordinate.
