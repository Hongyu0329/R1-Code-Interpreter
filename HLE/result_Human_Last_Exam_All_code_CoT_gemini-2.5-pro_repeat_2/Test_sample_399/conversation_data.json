    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the ODE type:** The given differential equation $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation.\n2.  **Separate variables:** We can rewrite the equation by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n3.  **Integrate both sides:** Next, we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This integration yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition:** We use the given initial condition, $x(0)=-8$, to find the value of $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C \\implies \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n5.  **Write the particular solution:** Now we substitute $C = 1/8$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n6.  **Solve for x(1):** Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n    $$\n    Solving for $x(1)$, we get:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} \\implies x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n7.  **Code Implementation:** The following Python code will perform the final calculation for $x(1)$ using the `fractions` module for an exact result, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# This script calculates x(1) for the initial value problem\n# x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\n# The analytical solution leads to the equation for x(1):\n# -1/x(1) = (1)^2/2 - 1 + 1/8\n\nprint(\"Solving for x(1) from the equation: -1/x(1) = (1)^2/2 - 1 + 1/8\")\n\n# Define the numbers in the equation using the Fraction class for exact arithmetic\nval1 = Fraction(1**2, 2)\nval2 = Fraction(-1, 1)\nval3 = Fraction(1, 8)\n\n# Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation\nrhs = val1 + val2 + val3\n\n# Calculate the final result for x(1), which is -1 / RHS\nx1 = -1 / rhs\n\nprint(f\"The numbers on the right-hand side of the equation are: {val1}, {val2}, and {val3}\")\nprint(f\"The sum on the right-hand side is: {rhs}\")\nprint(f\"The equation becomes: -1/x(1) = {rhs}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, x(1) = -1 / ({rhs})\")\nprint(f\"The final exact result is: x(1) = {x1}\")\nprint(f\"As a decimal, the result is approximately: {float(x1)}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
