# Given parameters from the problem
R0 = 3.0
infection_rate_in_vaccinated = 0.06

# Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (E)
# The vaccine is effective if a vaccinated person does not get an infectious case.
# If 6% of vaccinated people get infected, the effectiveness is 1 minus this rate.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - infection_rate_in_vaccinated

# Step 2: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (Vc) for herd immunity
# The formula is Vc = (1 - 1/R0) / E
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be effectively immune.
herd_immunity_threshold = (1 - (1 / R0)) / vaccine_effectiveness

# Step 3: Print the results and the formula used
print("To solve this, we first calculate the vaccine's effectiveness and then use it to find the herd immunity threshold.")
print("-" * 30)

print(f"1. Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (E):")
print(f"   E = 1 - (Infection Rate in Vaccinated)")
print(f"   E = 1 - {infection_rate_in_vaccinated}")
print(f"   E = {vaccine_effectiveness}")

print(f"   Vc = {numerator:.4f} / {vaccine_effectiveness}")
print("-" * 30)

# Final result
print(f"The theoretical threshold of vaccine coverage we should reach is {herd_immunity_threshold*100:.2f}%.")
