# The problem is a question of set theory, and the solution relies on established
# theorems within ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice)
# combined with the given assumption 2^ω₁ = ω₂.

# Step 1: Define the values of delta_1 and delta_2 based on mathematical deduction.
# The set X is the set of regular cardinals λ for which a tower of uncountable
# subsets of ω₁ of length λ exists.
#
# Theorem 1: The minimum length of such a tower is ω₂.
# This means no tower exists for any λ < ω₂, so the infimum of X is at least ω₂.
#
# Theorem 2: The maximum length of such a tower is at most 2^ω₁.
# Given 2^ω₁ = ω₂, the maximum length is at most ω₂.
#
# Theorem 3: Under 2^ω₁ = ω₂, a tower of length ω₂ exists.
#
# Combining these facts, the only regular cardinal for which a tower exists is ω₂.
# So, the set X = {ω₂}.

# The supremum of X is the largest value in X.
delta_1 = "ω₂"

# The infimum of X is the smallest value in X.
delta_2 = "ω₂"

# Step 2: Calculate the sum delta_1 + delta_2 using cardinal arithmetic.
# For any infinite cardinal κ, the sum κ + κ = κ.
# Therefore, ω₂ + ω₂ = ω₂.
result = "ω₂"

# Step 3: Print the final equation with all its components.
print("Based on the analysis of the set theory problem:")
print(f"The supremum δ₁ is {delta_1}.")
print(f"The infimum δ₂ is {delta_2}.")
print("The final calculation is δ₁ + δ₂.")
print(f"So, the equation is: {delta_1} + {delta_2} = {result}")
