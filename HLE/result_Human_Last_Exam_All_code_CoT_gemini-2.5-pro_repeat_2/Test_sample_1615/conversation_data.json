    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the question:** The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\n2.  **Recall graph coloring basics:**\n    *   A proper vertex coloring assigns a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n    *   The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring.\n    *   A complete graph $K_n$ has all possible edges, and its chromatic number is $\\chi(K_n) = n$, since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, requiring a unique color for each.\n\n3.  **Analyze the constraint:** The problem states that $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This is the key piece of information. If a graph is not complete, it means there is at least one pair of vertices that are not connected by an edge.\n\n4.  **Establish an upper bound:** Let the number of vertices be $n=12345$. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, such that there is no edge between them. Because $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring. If we assign them the same color, we would need at most $n-1$ colors for the entire graph (one color for both $u$ and $v$, and potentially a new color for each of the other $n-2$ vertices). Therefore, for any non-complete graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, its chromatic number must be less than $n$. So, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n5.  **Show the upper bound is achievable:** To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that actually requires $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Consider a graph $G$ constructed as follows: take a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and add one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph $G$ has $n$ vertices in total. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   To color this graph, the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these colors. Thus, the minimum number of colors needed for the entire graph $G$ is $n-1$. So, $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n    *   Another example is the graph $G = K_n - e$ (a complete graph with a single edge removed). This graph contains a clique of size $n-1$, which means it requires at least $n-1$ colors. It can also be colored with exactly $n-1$ colors.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors, and there exists a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n7.  **Calculation:** With $n=12345$, the result is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n8.  **Code Implementation:** A simple Python script can perform this calculation and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G\nnum_vertices = 12345\n\n# The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n# with 'num_vertices' vertices, given that the graph is not a complete graph.\n\n# The chromatic number of a complete graph Kn is n.\n# If a graph G is not complete, it means there's at least one pair of vertices\n# that are not adjacent. These two vertices can be given the same color.\n# This implies that the chromatic number of a non-complete graph on n vertices\n# can be at most n-1.\n\n# To show this maximum is achievable, consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph\n# on (n-1) vertices (a K_{n-1}) and one isolated vertex. This graph is not complete,\n# has n vertices, and its chromatic number is n-1.\n\n# Therefore, the maximum number of colors is num_vertices - 1.\nmax_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n# The final code should output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with {num_vertices} vertices is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
