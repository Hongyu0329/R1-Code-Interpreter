    "Here is a plan to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the basic properties of the function $f$.**\n    Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective (one-to-one) function, the composition $f \\circ f$ is injective. This implies that the function $f$ itself must be injective. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with the behavior of $\\exp(x)$.\n    Let's analyze the limits. Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(L, M)$, where $L = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$.\n    The equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ implies a powerful identity: $f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$ and $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$. Therefore, we have the functional equation $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Let $t = e^x$. For any $t > 0$, we have $f(t) = e^{f(\\ln t)}$.\n    The range of the function $g(t) = e^{f(\\ln t)}$ is $(e^L, e^M)$ because the range of $f$ is $(L, M)$.\n    The range of the function $h(t) = f(t)$ for $t > 0$ is $(\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} f(t), \\lim_{t\\to 0^+} f(t)) = (L, f(0))$, since $f$ is decreasing.\n    For the equality $f(t) = e^{f(\\ln t)}$ to hold, their ranges must be identical. This means $(L, f(0)) = (e^L, e^M)$.\n    This implies $L = e^L$. However, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (the graph of $y=x$ never intersects the graph of $y=e^x$).\n    This contradiction shows that no strictly decreasing continuous solutions exist.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    If $f$ is increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also increasing, which is consistent.\n    Similar to the decreasing case, we can show that for a solution to exist, its structure is highly constrained but allows for some freedom. Let's define a constant $c = f(0)$.\n    From $f(f(x)) = e^x$, we can generate a sequence of points that must lie on the graph of $f$:\n    *   $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$. Since $f(0)=c$, we have $f(c) = 1$.\n    *   $f(f(c)) = e^c$. Since $f(c)=1$, we have $f(1) = e^c$.\n    *   $f(f(1)) = e^1 = e$. Since $f(1)=e^c$, we have $f(e^c) = e$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing:\n    *   If $c=1$, then $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=1$. This contradicts $f$ being strictly increasing.\n    *   If $c>1$, then $0 < 1 < c$. This would imply $f(0) < f(1) < f(c)$. Substituting the values, we get $c < e^c < 1$. But $c>1$ contradicts $c<1$.\n    *   If $c<0$, then $c < 0$. This would imply $f(c) < f(0)$, so $1 < c$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   If $c=0$, then $f(0)=0$. This would imply $f(f(0))=f(0)=0$, but $f(f(0))=e^0=1$. A contradiction.\n    The only possibility is $0 < c < 1$. In this case, the sequence of arguments $0 < c < 1 < e^c < e < \\dots$ and the sequence of values $c < 1 < e^c < e < e^{e^c} < \\dots$ are both strictly increasing, which is consistent.\n\n4.  **Constructing the solutions and determining the cardinality.**\n    For any chosen $c \\in (0,1)$, a solution $f$ is fixed by the relation $f(f(x))=e^x$ everywhere, provided we define it on an initial interval, for instance $[0, c]$.\n    We need to define $f$ on $[0, c]$ as a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(0) = c$ and $\\phi(c) = 1$. Any such choice of $\\phi$ can be uniquely extended to a full solution on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    The question is: how many such functions $\\phi$ can we choose?\n    For any fixed $c \\in (0,1)$, we can choose the value of $\\phi(c/2)$ to be any number in $(c, 1)$. This freedom of choice at just one point already gives uncountably many options. A more rigorous analysis shows that the set of such functions $\\phi$ has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers, which is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the initial function $\\phi$ for each $c \\in (0,1)$, and there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $c$, the total number of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, so the set of solutions cannot have a larger cardinality.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R that satisfy f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Basic properties of the function f\")\n    print(\"The equation is f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    print(\"Since exp(x) is injective (one-to-one), f must also be injective.\")\n    print(\"A continuous and injective real-valued function on R must be strictly monotonic.\")\n    print(\"This leaves two cases: f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Case 1 - f is strictly decreasing\")\n    print(\"If f is decreasing, then f(f(x)) is increasing, which is consistent with exp(x).\")\n    print(\"From f(f(x)) = exp(x), we can derive the identity f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).\")\n    print(\"Let the range of f be (L, M).\")\n    print(\"The range of the left side, f(exp(x)) = f((0, inf)), is (L, f(0)).\")\n    print(\"The range of the right side, exp(f(x)), is (exp(L), exp(M)).\")\n    print(\"Equating the ranges gives (L, f(0)) = (exp(L), exp(M)).\")\n    print(\"This implies L = exp(L).
