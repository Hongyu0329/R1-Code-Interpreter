    # Step 1: Formalizing the problem.
    # A compactification of the ray [0, 1) with remainder X is determined by its
    # "endset", which is a non-empty closed subset of X.
    # Two such compactifications are topologically equivalent if and only if their
    # endsets belong to the same orbit under the action of the group of
    # self-homeomorphisms of X, denoted Homeo(X).
    # Thus, the problem is to find the minimum size of the set of these orbits.

    # Step 2: Establishing a lower bound.
    # Let X be any space satisfying the given conditions.
    # Consider two non-empty closed subsets of X:
    # C1 = {p}, a set with a single point p from X.
    # C2 = X, the entire space.
    # Since X is nondegenerate, it has more than one point, so C1 and C2 are different sets.
    # For C1 and C2 to be in the same orbit, a homeomorphism h in Homeo(X) must exist
    # such that h(C1) = C2. This means h({p}) = X.
    # However, a homeomorphism maps a point to a point, so h({p}) = {h(p)}, which is a
    # single-point set. For {h(p)} to equal X, X must be a single-point space.
    # This contradicts the condition that X is nondegenerate.
    # Therefore, the orbits of C1 and C2 are always distinct.
    # This proves that there must be at least two orbits.
    
    min_possible_orbits_lower_bound = 2

    # Step 3: Showing the lower bound is achievable.
    # We need to find a space X that has exactly 2 such orbits.
    # Let's consider X = {a, b}, a two-point space with the discrete topology.
    # This space is:
    # - Nondegenerate: Yes, it has 2 points.
    # - Locally-connected: Yes, each point is a connected open neighborhood.
    # - Compact: Yes, it's a finite space.
    # - Metric: Yes, the discrete metric induces this topology.
    
    # The non-empty closed subsets of X are: {a}, {b}, and {a, b}.
    # The homeomorphisms of X are the identity map and the map that swaps a and b.
    
    # Let's find the orbits:
    # - Orbit of {a}: Applying the identity gives {a}; applying the swap gives {b}.
    #   The orbit is {{a}, {b}}.
    # - Orbit of {a, b}: Applying the identity or the swap gives {a, b}.
    #   The orbit is {{a, b}}.
    
    # There are exactly two orbits for this space X.
    
    number_of_orbits_for_two_point_space = 2
    
    # Step 4: Conclusion.
    # The minimum number of orbits is at least 2, and we have found a space
    # for which the number of orbits is exactly 2.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of topologically distinct
    # compactifications is 2.
