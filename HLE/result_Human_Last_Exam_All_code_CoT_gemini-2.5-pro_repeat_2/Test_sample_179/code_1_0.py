# Given constants
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1
T = 10**20

# From the analysis of the differential equation for X_0(t) and its boundary conditions,
# the solution X_0(t) is found to be a constant value.
# The equation for this constant is X_0(t) = A / (B + 1).

# Calculate B + 1
B_plus_1 = B + 1

# Calculate the value of X_0(t). Since it's a constant,
# X_0(10^20) is the same as X_0(t) for any t.
x0_at_T = A / B_plus_1

# The problem asks to output the final equation with the numbers.
# We will present the calculation step-by-step.
