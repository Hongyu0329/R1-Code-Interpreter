    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem parameters.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for all choices of agents 
    and their preferences over m items, there exists a suitable subset O.
    
    A subset O is suitable if:
    1. For every item j in O, the number of agents who prefer it most within O is > t.
    2. For every item k not in O, the number of agents who prefer k over all items in O is <= u.
    
    This is a known problem in social choice theory. For m >= 4, the smallest such u
    is given by the formula u = (m-2)*t + 1.
