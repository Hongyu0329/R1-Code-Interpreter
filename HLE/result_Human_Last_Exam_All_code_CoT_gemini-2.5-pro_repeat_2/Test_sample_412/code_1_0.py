    print(" - x ~ y means x and y are infinitesimally close.")
    print(" - For a standard point x0 in X, the 'monad' of x0 is the set of all points in X* that are infinitesimally close to x0.")
    print(" - The established nonstandard characterization of continuity is: A function f is continuous if and only if for every STANDARD point x0 in X, f maps the monad of x0 into the monad of f(x0).\n")

    print("--- Evaluating the Options ---\n")

    # --- Option A ---
    print("A. forall x0, x1 in X: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)")
    print("   Analysis: This property only considers standard points from X. In a typical space like the real numbers (which is a Hausdorff space), two standard points are never infinitesimally close unless they are identical. In that case, the statement just says f(x0) ~ f(x0), which is always true and gives no information. This condition is too weak to ensure continuity.\n")

    # --- Option B ---
    print("B. forall x0 in X, forall x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)")
    print("   Analysis: This statement says that for any standard point x0, if x1 (which can be nonstandard) is infinitesimally close to x0, then f(x1) is infinitesimally close to f(x0). This is exactly the nonstandard definition of continuity: f maps the monad of every standard point into the monad of its image. This property is equivalent to continuity.\n")

    # --- Option C ---
    print("C. forall x0, x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)")
    print("   Analysis: This is a much stronger condition, often called 'S-continuity'. It requires the property to hold for ANY pair of infinitesimally close points, even if both are nonstandard (e.g., infinite).")
    print("   Counterexample: Consider f(x) = x^2, which is continuous on R. Let w be an infinite number in R*. Let x0 = w and x1 = w + (1/w).")
    print("   - The difference x1 - x0 = 1/w is infinitesimal, so x0 ~ x1.")
    print("   - Now look at the images: f(x1) - f(x0) = (w + 1/w)^2 - w^2 = (w^2 + 2 + 1/w^2) - w^2 = 2 + 1/w^2.")
    print("   - The difference f(x1) - f(x0) is infinitesimally close to 2, not 0. So f(x0) is NOT infinitesimally close to f(x1).")
    print("   Since the continuous function f(x) = x^2 fails this condition, C is not equivalent to continuity.\n")

    # --- Option D ---
    print("D. forall x0, x1 in X: f(x0) ~ f(x1) ==> x0 ~ x1")
    print("   Analysis: This is a kind of inverse property, restricted to standard points.")
    print("   Counterexample: Consider the constant function f(x) = 5. This function is continuous.")
    print("   - For any two distinct points x0 and x1 (e.g., x0=1, x1=2), f(x0)=5 and f(x1)=5. So f(x0) ~ f(x1) is true.")
    print("   - However, x0 and x1 are not infinitesimally close. So the implication fails.")
    print("   Therefore, D is not equivalent to continuity.\n")

    # --- Option E ---
    print("E. forall x0 in X, forall x1 in X*: f(x0) ~ f(x1) ==> x0 ~ x1")
    print("   Analysis: This is the converse of the correct definition in B.")
    print("   Counterexample: Again, consider f(x) = x^2. Let x0 = 1 (a standard point). Let x1 = -1 + e, where e is a positive infinitesimal.")
    print("   - f(x0) = 1^2 = 1.")
    print("   - f(x1) = (-1 + e)^2 = 1 - 2e + e^2. This is infinitesimally close to 1. So f(x0) ~ f(x1).")
    print("   - However, x0=1 is not infinitesimally close to x1 (which is close to -1).")
    print("   The implication fails for a continuous function, so E is not equivalent to continuity.\n")

    # --- Option F ---
    print("F. forall x0, x1 in X*: f(x0) ~ f(x1) ==> x0 ~ x1")
    print("   Analysis: This is the converse of S-continuity (C). The same counterexample for E works here, showing it is not equivalent to continuity.\n")
