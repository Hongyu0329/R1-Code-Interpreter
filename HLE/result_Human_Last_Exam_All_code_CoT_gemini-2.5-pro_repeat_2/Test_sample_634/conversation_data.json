    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use an approach based on the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix**: We combine the two matrices P1 and P2 into a single larger matrix M by stacking them vertically: M = [P1; P2].\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations**: We apply a sequence of elementary row operations to M to transform it into a row-echelon form. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD**: The goal of the row reduction is to transform M into the form [D; 0], where D is a square matrix (2x2 in this case) and 0 is a zero matrix. The resulting matrix D is a GCRD of the original matrices P1 and P2.\n\nI will use the `sympy` library in Python to handle the symbolic polynomial calculations and perform the row reduction on the stacked matrix. The code will execute these steps to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the Euclidean algorithm via row reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variable and the polynomial matrices.\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Step 2: Form the augmented matrix M by stacking P1 and P2.\n    # The rows are indexed 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    M = sympy.Matrix.vstack(P1, P2)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    # The goal is to create zero rows at the bottom.\n    \n    # Let R0, R1, R2, R3 be the rows of M.\n    # Use R3 = [-s-1, 1] to eliminate terms in other rows.\n\n    # Operation: R0 -> R0 + s * R3\n    # This makes the first row [0, 0]\n    M[0, :] = M.row(0) + s * M.row(3)\n\n    # Operation: R1 -> R1 - s**2 * R3\n    # This eliminates the s**2 term in the second column of R1\n    M[1, :] = M.row(1) - (s**2) * M.row(3)\n\n    # Now M has two zero-rows in-the-making.
