    # --- Part 2: Numerical Answers for the 1D Case ---

    # In 1D, for any n>=2, we can place k=2. For example, starting with ones at
    # positions 1 and 3, we can place 2 at position 2.
    # To place k=3, we need neighbors summing to 3. This requires a 1 and a 2.
    # A logical contradiction arises: for a 2 to be at position p, we need 1s at p-1
    # and p+1. To place a 3 at an empty cell q using this 2, q would need to be
    # p-1 or p+1. But those cells are already occupied. So, 3 can never be placed.
    # Thus, for any n>=2, a(n)=2 in the 1D case.
