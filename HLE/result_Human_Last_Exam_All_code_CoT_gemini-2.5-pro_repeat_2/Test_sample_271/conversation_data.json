    "Answering your question requires a multi-step analysis involving polynomial factorization, Galois theory, and group theory. I will use Python to perform the initial computational step and then to present the overall reasoning and final results.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: The first step is to factor the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ into its irreducible factors over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: For the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$, we need to find its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. This group will be constructed from the Galois groups of the irreducible factors.\n3.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L \\subset K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. We need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n4.  **Calculate Field Degrees**: For each normal subgroup $H$ found, the degree of the corresponding field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of the subgroup, $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n5.  **List the Degrees**: Finally, we will list all the unique degree values obtained.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by determining the Galois group of the polynomial,\n    finding its normal subgroups, and calculating the degrees of the\n    corresponding normal subfields.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    f = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Factor the polynomial over Q.\")\n    print(f\"Original polynomial: f(x) = {f}\")\n    \n    # Factor the polynomial over the rational numbers\n    factors = sympy.factor(f, domain='QQ')\n    \n    print(f\"The factored polynomial is: {factors}\\n\")\n    \n    # The factors are f1(x) = x**2 - 3 and f2(x) = x**5 - 6*x + 2\n    f1 = factors.args[0]\n    f2 = factors.args[1]\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Galois group G = Gal(K/Q).\")\n    print(f\"Let K1 be the splitting field of f1(x) = {f1}.\")\n    print(\"The roots of x^2 - 3 are +/- sqrt(3).
