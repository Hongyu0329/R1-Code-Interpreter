    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the atoms in the molecule. Since no molecule was specified, I will explain the calculation method and provide a Python script that can calculate the total number of primitives for any given molecular formula composed of first and second-row elements. I will use water (Hâ‚‚O) as an example.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G\\*\\*)**: I will break down what each part of the name means in terms of primitive Gaussians for different types of atoms.\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom**:\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H)**: I'll calculate the primitives from its `s` orbital and the added `p` polarization functions.\n    *   **For 2nd-Row Heavy Atoms (C, N, O, etc.)**: I'll calculate the primitives from the core `1s` orbital, the valence `2s` and `2p` orbitals, and the added `d` polarization functions.\n3.  **Develop a Python Script**: I'll write a Python script that:\n    *   Takes a molecular formula as a string (e.g., \"H2O\").\n    *   Parses the formula to count each type of atom.\n    *   Uses the per-atom primitive counts to calculate the total for the molecule.\n    *   Prints the detailed calculation and the final result.\n\n### Primitive Gaussian Calculation:\n\n*   **6-311G\\*\\*** notation breakdown:\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals are represented by a single function contracted from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are split into three functions. The first is contracted from **3** primitives, the second is a single primitive, and the third is also a single primitive.\n    *   **First \\* (on heavy atoms)**: Adds one set of **d-type** polarization functions. This is a set of 6 primitive functions (in the Cartesian representation).\n    *   **Second \\* (on Hydrogen)**: Adds one set of **p-type** polarization functions. This is a set of 3 primitive functions.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen atom (H)**:\n    *   Valence (1s) orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives.\n    *   Polarization (p-functions): 3 primitives.\n    *   **Total for H = 5 + 3 = 8 primitives.**\n\n*   **For a 2nd-row heavy atom (like C, N, O)**:\n    *   Core (1s) orbital: 6 primitives.\n    *   Valence (2s) orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives.\n    *   Valence (2p) orbitals: (3 + 1 + 1) primitives for each of p_x, p_y, p_z = 5 * 3 = 15 primitives.\n    *   Polarization (d-functions): 6 primitives.\n    *   **Total for a heavy atom = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32 primitives.**\n\nNow, here is the Python script to perform the calculation for a given molecule.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_6_311Gss_primitives(molecule_formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions for a given molecule\n    using the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n    This function supports H and common 2nd-row elements (C, N, O, F).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Primitives per atom for the 6-311G** basis set\n    # H: 1s(3,1,1) + p(pol) = (3+1+1) + 3 = 8\n    # 2nd Row (e.g., C,N,O): 1s(core, 6) + 2s(val, 3,1,1) + 2p(val, 3,1,1) + d(pol)\n    #                      = 6 + (3+1+1) + 3*(3+1+1) + 6 = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32\n    primitives_per_atom = {\n        'H': 8,\n        # Add other 2nd-row elements, they have the same count\n        'C': 32,\n        'N': 32,\n        'O': 32,\n        'F': 32,\n    }\n\n    # Find all element symbols followed by an optional number\n    atom_counts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', molecule_formula)\n\n    total_primitives = 0\n    calculation_parts = []\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing formula: {molecule_formula}\")\n\n    for element, count_str in atom_counts:\n        if element not in primitives_per_atom:\n            print(f\"Warning: Atom '{element}' is not supported in this script.
