    This function determines the categories for the arboricity bounds f1(n) and f2(n).
    
    Let's analyze the expected density of any induced subgraph of G'.
    Let S be any subset of V(G), and H = G[S].
    Let S' = S intersect V' and H' = G'[S'].
    The expected number of vertices in H' is E[|V(H')|] = sum_{u in S} (1/d_u^c).
    The expected number of edges in H' is E[|E(H')|] = sum_{(u,v) in E(H)} (1/(d_u^c * d_v^c)).

    Using 2ab <= a^2 + b^2, we have:
    2 * E[|E(H')|] <= sum_{(u,v) in E(H)} (1/d_u^{2c} + 1/d_v^{2c})
                     = sum_{u in S} d_H(u) / d_u^{2c}
    Since d_H(u) <= d_u, this is <= sum_{u in S} d_u / d_u^{2c} = sum_{u in S} 1 / d_u^{2c-1}.

    Case c = 1:
    2 * E[|E(H')|] <= sum_{u in S} 1 / d_u.
    E[|V(H')|] = sum_{u in S} 1 / d_u.
    So, 2 * E[|E(H')|] <= E[|V(H')|].
    The expected average degree is at most 1 for any induced subgraph. This implies f1(n) = O(1).
    This corresponds to category 1.
    """
    f1_category = 1
    
    """
    Case c = 2:
    2 * E[|E(H')|] <= sum_{u in S} 1 / d_u^3.
    E[|V(H')|] = sum_{u in S} 1 / d_u^2.
    Since d_u >= 1, we have d_u^3 >= d_u^2, so 1/d_u^3 <= 1/d_u^2.
    Therefore, sum_{u in S} 1/d_u^3 <= sum_{u in S} 1/d_u^2.
    This gives 2 * E[|E(H')|] <= E[|V(H')|].
    Again, the expected average degree is at most 1, implying f2(n) = O(1).
    This also corresponds to category 1.
