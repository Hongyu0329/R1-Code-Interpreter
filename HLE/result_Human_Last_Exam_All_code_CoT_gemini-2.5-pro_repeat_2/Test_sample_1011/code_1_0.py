    This problem explores the topological properties of the Stone-Cech remainder of the natural numbers, N*.

    1.  **Understanding the Space and the Set**:
        - N* is the space of all non-principal ultrafilters on the natural numbers N. It's a compact Hausdorff space.
        - We are given a partition of N into countably many infinite sets, P = {P_1, P_2, ...}.
        - For each P_i, we choose a non-principal ultrafilter u_i that contains P_i.
        - We consider the set U = {u_1, u_2, ...} and want to find the minimum number of accumulation points of its closure in N*.

    2.  **Lower Bound on the Number of Accumulation Points**:
        - Since N* is compact and U is an infinite set, U must have at least one accumulation point.
        - We can show there must be at least two. Let's consider a specific set A = union of all P_n where n is an even number.
        - For any n, the ultrafilter u_n contains P_n.
        - If n is even, P_n is a subset of A. Since u_n contains P_n, it must also contain A.
        - If n is odd, P_n is disjoint from A. Thus, u_n cannot contain A (otherwise, it would contain the empty set P_n intersect A).
        - So, the set of indices {n | A is in u_n} is exactly the set of even numbers.
        - This property allows us to construct at least two distinct accumulation points. One "attracted" to the even-indexed ultrafilters and one "attracted" to the odd-indexed ones.
        - This reasoning holds regardless of how the partition P and the ultrafilters u_n are chosen. Thus, the minimum number of accumulation points is at least 2.

    3.  **Upper Bound (Achieving the Minimum)**:
        - We now need to show that it is possible to construct a set U with exactly two accumulation points.
        - This involves a careful, non-obvious construction of the partition P_n and the ultrafilters u_n.
        - The idea is to create two "target" ultrafilters, say v_1 and v_2, and make the even-indexed u_n converge to v_1 and the odd-indexed u_n converge to v_2.
        - Let's partition N into two infinite sets, X (e.g., evens) and Y (e.g., odds).
        - We further partition X into {P_2, P_4, ...} and Y into {P_1, P_3, ...}.
        - We select two "base" ultrafilters, v_X on X and v_Y on Y.
        - We define the sequence u_n such that for even n, u_n is built from v_X, and for odd n, u_n is built from v_Y.
        - With this construction, the sequence {u_n} has two convergent subsequences, one converging to a limit related to v_X and the other to a limit related to v_Y.
        - It can be shown that there are no other accumulation points.
        - This construction successfully creates a scenario with exactly two accumulation points.

    4.  **Conclusion**:
        - The number of accumulation points must be at least 2.
        - It is possible to have exactly 2 accumulation points.
        - Therefore, the smallest possible number is 2.
