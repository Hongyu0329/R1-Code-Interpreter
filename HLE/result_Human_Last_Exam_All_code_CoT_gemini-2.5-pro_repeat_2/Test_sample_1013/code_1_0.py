    This function explains and provides the answer to the set-theoretic problem.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of nonprincipal
    ultrafilters on N, all of which are below a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V in a
    specific order (related to the Rudin-Frolik order).

    The answer to this question is a classic result in combinatorial set theory. The
    cardinality is 2 raised to the power of aleph_0 (the cardinality of the natural
    numbers), which is also known as the cardinality of the continuum.
