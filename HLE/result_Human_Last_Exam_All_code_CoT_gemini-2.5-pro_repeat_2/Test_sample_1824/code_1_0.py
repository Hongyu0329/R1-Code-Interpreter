    # The goal is to keep the concepts distinct after mapping.
    #
    # Let's define the feature sets for the two English concepts before mapping:
    # F_cellar = {'f_fungus', 'f_decay', 'f_damp', 'f_musty', 'f_earthy', 'f_stone'}
    # F_fabric = {'f_fungus', 'f_decay', 'f_damp', 'f_musty', 'f_textile'}
    #
    # To maintain discrimination, the mapped representations must not be identical.
    # To maintain the "mouldy" meaning, at least one core feature (e.g., 'f_fungus') must be kept.
    #
    # Test case 1: Retain 1 feature (e.g., {'f_fungus'}).
    # Mapped 'cellar': {'f_fungus'}. Mapped 'fabric': {'f_fungus'}. They are identical. Discrimination fails.
    #
    # Test case 2: Retain 2 features.
    # Let's retain one core feature ('f_fungus') and one discriminating feature ('f_stone').
    # Retained set R = {'f_fungus', 'f_stone'}.
    # Mapped 'cellar' (F_cellar & R) = {'f_fungus', 'f_stone'}.
    # Mapped 'fabric' (F_fabric & R) = {'f_fungus'}.
    # The sets are different. Discrimination is successful.
    # Therefore, the minimum number of features to retain is 2.
