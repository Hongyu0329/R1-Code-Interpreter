    # Step 1 & 2: As derived in the reasoning, the eigenvalues of W_n are all 1.
    # The function f(n) is the sum of the absolute cubes of these eigenvalues.
    # f(n) = sum(|1|^3 for _ in range(n)) = n.

    # Step 3: Find the smallest integer n such that f(n) > 10.
    # This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer n > 10.
    n = 11
    print(f"The smallest integer n where f(n) > 10 is {n}.")

    # Step 4: Determine the structure of W_n.
    # As reasoned, W_n is the n x n Jordan block for the eigenvalue 1, because
    # the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue is 1.
    # So, W_11 is J_11(1).
    # W_11 is a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the superdiagonal.
    W_n = np.eye(n) + np.diag(np.ones(n - 1), 1)
    # print("The matrix W_{} is:\n{}".format(n, W_n)) # Optional: view the matrix

    # Step 5: Calculate the infinity norm of W_11.
    # The infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
    # For W_11 (a Jordan block), the first n-1 rows have sum |1|+|1|=2,
    # and the last row has sum |1|=1.

    # Step 6: Calculate the final result.
    result = n * infinity_norm
