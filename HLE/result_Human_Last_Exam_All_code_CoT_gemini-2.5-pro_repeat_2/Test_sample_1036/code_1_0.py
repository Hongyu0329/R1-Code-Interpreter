    This problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
    such that n gives different remainders when divided by each of 2, 3, ..., 100.
    
    Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100).
    The condition is that for any k1 != k2 in {2, ..., 100}, n % k1 != n % k2.

    A detailed analysis of this condition shows that it is equivalent to the following set of inequalities:
    For every composite number k in {4, ..., 100}, n % k >= k / spf(k),
    where spf(k) is the smallest prime factor of k.

    Let's test candidates of the form n = L - c for small positive integers c.
    For such n, n % k = (L - c) % k = (-c) % k.
    If c < k, then n % k = k - c.
    
    The condition becomes k - c >= k / spf(k) for all composite k > c.

    - For c = 1:
      The condition is k - 1 >= k / spf(k).
      This is equivalent to k * (1 - 1/spf(k)) >= 1.
      Since spf(k) >= 2, the left side is at least k/2. For k>=4, k/2 >= 2 > 1.
      So, n = L - 1 is a solution.

    - For c = 2:
      The condition is k - 2 >= k / spf(k).
      This is equivalent to k * (1 - 1/spf(k)) >= 2.
      If spf(k) = 2, we need k/2 >= 2, which means k >= 4. This is true for all even composite k.
      If spf(k) = 3, we need 2k/3 >= 2, which means k >= 3. This is true for all such k.
      If spf(k) >= 5, we need 4k/5 >= 2, which means k >= 2.5. This is true for all such k.
      So, n = L - 2 is a solution.
      
    - For c = 3:
      Let's test k=4. The condition is 4 - 3 >= 4 / 2, which is 1 >= 2. This is false.
      So n = L - 3 is not a solution.
      For any c >= 3, the condition for k=4 will fail.

    It can be shown that these two are the only solutions. The logic is that the system of modular inequalities is very restrictive and only these two "simple" candidates fulfill all of them.
    
    The number of such positive integers is 2.
