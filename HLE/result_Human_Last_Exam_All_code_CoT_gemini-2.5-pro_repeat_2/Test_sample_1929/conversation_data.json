    "The user wants to know the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves butadiene, which is a conjugated diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, which is an alkene (a dienophile). This combination is characteristic of a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n2.  **Predict the Product Structure:** In a Diels-Alder reaction, the four carbons from the diene and the two carbons from the dienophile combine to form a cyclohexene ring. The substituents originally on the dienophile (two Cl atoms on one carbon, two F atoms on the other) will be attached to adjacent carbons in the new ring.\n3.  **Name the Product:** The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexene. Following IUPAC naming conventions, we prioritize giving the double bond the lowest locant numbers (1 and 2). Then, we number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Applying alphabetical priority for the substituents (\"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\"), the product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n4.  **Create the Python Script:** I will write a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will:\n    *   State the reactants and the product.\n    *   Show the balanced chemical equation using chemical formulas.\n    *   Provide details about the product, including its IUPAC name and SMILES string (a textual representation of the molecule).\n    *   As per the instructions, explicitly extract and print the subscript numbers from the chemical formulas in the reaction equation.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef chemical_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactants and product information\n    diene = {\n        \"name\": \"Butadiene\",\n        \"formula\": \"C4H6\"\n    }\n    dienophile = {\n        \"name\": \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\",\n        \"formula\": \"C2Cl2F2\"\n    }\n    product = {\n        \"name\": \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\",\n        \"formula\": \"C6H6Cl2F2\",\n        \"smiles\": \"C1=CCC(Cl)(Cl)C(F)(F)C1\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"### Analysis of the Chemical Reaction ###\")\n    print(\"\\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction.\")\n    print(\"It forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a cyclohexene derivative.\")\n\n    # Print the reaction equation\n    print(\"\\nReaction Equation:\")\n    final_equation = f\"{diene['formula']} + {dienophile['formula']} -> {product['formula']}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(f\"{diene['name']} + {dienophile['name']} -> {product['name']}\")\n\n    # Print product details\n    print(\"\\nProduct Details:\")\n    print(f\"  IUPAC Name: {product['name']}\")\n    print(f\"  Chemical Formula: {product['formula']}\")\n    print(f\"  SMILES String: {product['smiles']}\")\n\n    # Fulfill the special request to output numbers from the final equation\n    print(\"\\nNumbers from the final equation's chemical formulas:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {final_equation}\")\n\n    def extract_and_print_numbers(label, formula):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to extract and print numbers from a formula string.\"\"\"\n        # A '1' is implied for elements with no subscript.
