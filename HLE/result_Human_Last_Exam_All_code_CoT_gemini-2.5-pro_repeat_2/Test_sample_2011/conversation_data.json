    "To solve this problem, we need to find a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices that maximizes the number of different values of `k` for which a clique of size `k` (`K_k`) exists as an induced subgraph.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to maximize the number of distinct clique sizes present as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n2.  **Propose a Construction:** The most straightforward way to create many different clique sizes is to use a structure that is rich in cliques. The densest possible graph, a complete graph (`K_n`), is an ideal candidate. A complete graph on `n` vertices has all possible edges connecting its vertices.\n3.  **Analyze the Construction:** Let's consider a complete graph `G = K_{128}`.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** on a set of vertices `S` is formed by the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect pairs of vertices in `S`.\n    *   In our `K_{128}`, if we choose any subset of `k` vertices, all these `k` vertices are connected to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph on these `k` vertices is a complete graph on `k` vertices, i.e., a `K_k`.\n    *   This holds true for any integer `k` from 1 to 128. For `k=1`, we get an induced `K_1` (a single vertex). For `k=2`, we get an induced `K_2` (an edge). This continues up to `k=128`, where the induced subgraph is the entire graph `K_{128}` itself.\n4.  **Determine the Number of Sizes:** The `K_{128}` graph contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128. The number of these distinct sizes is 128.\n5.  **Confirm Maximality:** Could we have more than 128 different clique sizes?\n    *   A clique is a set of vertices within the graph. The size of a clique `k` cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph, so `k <= 128`.\n    *   Clique sizes are positive integers, so `k >= 1`.\n    *   This means any set of possible clique sizes must be a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`. The maximum possible size of this set is 128.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since our construction using a `K_{128}` graph achieves this theoretical maximum of 128, this is the answer.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph.\nn = 128\n\n# The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n# that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs in a graph with n vertices.\n\n# The optimal construction is a complete graph, K_n.\n# In a complete graph, any subset of k vertices forms an induced K_k clique.\n# This means a K_n graph contains induced cliques of all possible integer sizes from 1 to n.\n# The set of different clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., n}.\n\n# The total count of these distinct sizes is simply n.\nmaximum_number_of_sizes = n\n\n# We can't have more than n sizes, because any clique's size k must be\n# between 1 and n. The K_n construction shows that n is achievable.\n\n# The final equation is that the maximum number of sizes is equal to n.\nprint(f\"For a graph with n = {n} vertices:\")\nprint(f\"The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is {maximum_number_of_sizes}.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{maximum_number_of_sizes} = {n}\")\n\n```\n<<<128>>>"
