    "This is a movie trivia question. My plan is to use Python to programmatically search the web to find the movie that best matches the description. I will use the `duckduckgo_search` library to perform the search.\n\nThe user's description contains a few key elements:\n1.  Oscar-nominated film.\n2.  A character seals his fate.\n3.  The event happens while boarding or on a bus.\n4.  The character says \"Thank you\".\n\nThe detail about \"Thank you\" might be a common misremembering, as the most famous scene matching the other criteria does not include this line.
