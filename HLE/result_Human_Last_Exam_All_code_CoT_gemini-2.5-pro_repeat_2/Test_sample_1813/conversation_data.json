    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by leveraging the connection between generalized Markov numbers and continued fractions. The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is constructed directly from the continued fraction of the rational number $p/q$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, we need to compute the standard continued fraction of the rational number $p/q$. For this problem, $p/q = 4/7$. The continued fraction of $4/7$ is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n2.  We take the sequence of partial quotients following the integer part. Let's call this sequence $W$. Here, $W = (1, 1, 3)$.\n3.  A key step in the construction requires this sequence $W$ to have an odd number of elements. In our case, the length of $W$ is 3, which is already odd, so we can proceed.\n4.  The periodic part of the continued fraction for $m_{4/7}$ is created by concatenating the sequence $W$ with its reverse, which we'll call $W^R$. Here, $W^R = (3, 1, 1)$. The resulting periodic sequence is $(1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n5.  Finally, we assemble the continued fraction for $m_{4/7}$ using the integer part from Step 1 (which is 0) and the repeating block from Step 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure and prints the final continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction coefficients for the rational number p/q\n    using the Euclidean algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    if q == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    \n    coeffs = []\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction associated with the \n    generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the rational number for the problem\n    p = 4\n    q = 7\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of p/q.\n    # For 4/7, this results in [0, 1, 1, 3].\n    coeffs = get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q)\n    \n    a0 = coeffs[0]\n    W = coeffs[1:]\n\n    # Step 2: Ensure the sequence W has an odd number of elements.\n    # For W = (1, 1, 3), the length is 3 (odd), so no modification is needed.\n    if len(W) % 2 == 0:\n        # If the length were even, e.g., (a_1,...,a_n), we would transform it to\n        # (a_1,...,a_n-1, 1) to make the length odd. This case is not needed for 4/7.\n        an = W.pop()\n        if an > 1:\n            W.append(an - 1)\n            W.append(1)\n        else: # an == 1\n             # This case requires a different rule, e.g., [..., a_{n-1}] -> [..., a_{n-1}+1]\n             # but we'll stick to the simpler rule as it's not needed here.\n             pass\n\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the periodic part of the target continued fraction.\n    # It is formed by concatenating W with its reverse, W^R.\n    W_R = W[::-1]\n    periodic_part = W + W_R\n\n    # Step 4: Assemble and print the final continued fraction.\n    # The final result is in the format [a_0; (periodic_part)], where parentheses\n    # denote the repeating block. The \"equation\" for the number m_{4/7} is its\n    # continued fraction representation, and we print all its constituent numbers.\n    periodic_str = \", \".join(map(str, periodic_part))\n    print(f\"m_{p}/{q} = [{a0}; ({periodic_str})]\")\n\ncompute_generalized_markov_cf()\n```\n<<<m_4/7 = [0; (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)]>>>"
