def solve_genji_ko_partition():
    """
    This function determines and prints the Genji-kō partition for Chapter 39.

    The pattern for Chapter 39, "Yūgiri", connects the 2nd and 4th incense sticks,
    leaving the 1st, 3rd, and 5th as distinct. This creates the partition
    {{1}, {3}, {5}, {2, 4}} of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

    To format the output as a "set of sets sorted increasingly", we sort the
    subsets based on their minimum element.
    - min({1}) = 1
    - min({2, 4}) = 2
    - min({3}) = 3
    - min({5}) = 5
    The sorted list of subsets is [{1}], [{2, 4}], [{3}], [{5}].
