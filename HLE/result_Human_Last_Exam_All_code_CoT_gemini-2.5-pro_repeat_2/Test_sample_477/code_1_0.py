# The user wants to know the impact of knocking out LIG1 on CTG somatic instability in Myotonic Dystrophy.
#
# 1.  Understand the disease: Myotonic Dystrophy is caused by an unstable CTG repeat expansion. "Somatic instability" means the number of repeats changes in the body's cells over time, usually increasing (expansion).
# 2.  Understand the proposed mechanism: This expansion is thought to happen through a faulty DNA repair process. When the CTG repeats form a hairpin loop, the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system tries to "fix" it but ends up adding more repeats.
# 3.  Understand the role of LIG1: DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is an enzyme that seals nicks in DNA strands. It's the final step in many DNA replication and repair processes, including the one implicated in CTG expansion. It ligates the flap created after the new DNA is synthesized across the hairpin.
# 4.  Connect LIG1 to the problem: If LIG1 is knocked out, it cannot perform the final ligation step. Without ligation, the expansion process is aborted. The unsealed DNA flap is removed, and the repeat tract does not expand.
# 5.  Conclusion: Knocking out LIG1 interrupts the pathway that causes expansions. This leads to a stabilization of the repeat tract, meaning reduced instability.
# 6.  Evaluate the choices:
#    A. Increased instability - Incorrect. LIG1 is required for the expansion part of the instability.
#    B. Contraction of repeat length - While lack of expansion might lead to a relative increase in contractions, the primary and most documented effect is the stabilization of the repeats, i.e., reduced overall instability.
#    C. Reduced instability - Correct. This accurately describes the outcome of blocking the expansion pathway.
#    D. No impact - Incorrect. LIG1 is a key player in the proposed mechanism.
#    E. Knockout is lethal - While a systemic LIG1 knockout is lethal due to its role in replication, in experimental models (conditional knockouts, cell lines), its effect on instability can be studied, and that effect is a reduction. The question is about the impact on instability, not the organism's viability.
#
# The final answer is C.

print("Based on scientific literature, DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is a key enzyme in the DNA repair pathway that leads to the expansion of CTG repeats.")
print("Its role is to complete the final step of this process by ligating the newly synthesized DNA.")
print("Therefore, knocking out or reducing LIG1 function disrupts this pathway, preventing the expansions from occurring.")
print("This results in a stabilization of the repeat tract.")
print("Answer: C. Reduced instability")
