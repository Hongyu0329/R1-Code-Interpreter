    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will rely on established biological knowledge from microRNA databases like miRBase. The plan is to create a Python script that:\n1.  Defines a list containing the names of the recognized members of the human let-7 family. This family includes let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98, which shares high sequence homology.\n2.  Calculates the total number of items in this list.\n3.  Prints the result in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The let-7 family in humans is a group of microRNAs sharing a conserved seed sequence.\n# The members are well-established in biological databases.\n# This script lists the primary members and then prints the total count.\n\n# List of human let-7 family members, including miR-98 which is part of the family.\nlet7_family_members = [\n    \"let-7a\",\n    \"let-7b\",\n    \"let-7c\",\n    \"let-7d\",\n    \"let-7e\",\n    \"let-7f\",\n    \"let-7g\",\n    \"let-7i\",\n    \"miR-98\"\n]\n\n# Calculate the number of members in the list\nnumber_of_members = len(let7_family_members)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"To date, {number_of_members} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    To date, how many members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
