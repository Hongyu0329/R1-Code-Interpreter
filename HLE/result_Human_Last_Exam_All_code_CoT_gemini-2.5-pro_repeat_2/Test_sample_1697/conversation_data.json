    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Directed *ortho*-Metallation (DoM) reaction. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA, which is a strong base system designed for deprotonation, specifically for Directed *ortho*-Metallation (DoM). This is followed by a reaction with an electrophile, methyl iodide.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Groups**: The starting material has two directing groups on the benzene ring:\n    *   **-CONEt₂ (N,N-diethylcarboxamide)** at position C1. This is a very powerful directing group for metallation.\n    *   **-NMe₂ (dimethylamino)** at position C3. This is also a directing group, but it is weaker than the amide group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**: The sec-BuLi base will remove the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring, a position determined by the directing groups.\n    *   The powerful -CONEt₂ group at C1 directs deprotonation to its adjacent (*ortho*) positions, C2 and C6.\n    *   The -NMe₂ group at C3 directs to its *ortho* positions, C2 and C4.\n    *   The C2 position is *ortho* to both groups. The reaction is directed primarily by the stronger amide group, and the activation from the dimethylamino group at the same C2 position makes this site overwhelmingly the most favorable for deprotonation. A lithium atom will replace the hydrogen at the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Reaction with the Electrophile**: The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile. It will react with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The carbanion at C2 attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n\n5.  **Final Product**: This sequence results in the addition of a methyl group (-CH₃) at the C2 position of the starting material.\n\nThe following Python code determines and prints the name of the final compound based on this chemical logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of the described chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the starting material and key structural features\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    parent_structure = \"N,N-diethyl-benzamide\"\n    substituents = {\n        3: \"dimethylamino\"  # -N(Me)2 group at C3\n    }\n    # The amide group itself is at C1 and is the primary directing group.\n\n    # Reagents\n    reagent_1 = \"sec-BuLi / TMEDA\"\n    reagent_2 = \"methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n    electrophile = \"methyl\"\n\n    # Reaction Logic: Directed ortho-Metallation (DoM)\n    # The strongest directing group is the amide at C1.\n    # It directs lithiation to the ortho-position, C2.\n    # The dimethylamino group at C3 also directs to C2, reinforcing this choice.\n    position_of_methylation = 2\n\n    # Add the new substituent from the electrophile\n    substituents[position_of_methylation] = electrophile\n\n    # Construct the final product name by ordering substituents numerically\n    sorted_positions = sorted(substituents.keys())\n    product_substituents = []\n    for pos in sorted_positions:\n        product_substituents.append(f\"{pos}-{substituents[pos]}\")\n\n    final_product_name = f\"N,N-diethyl-{'-'.join(product_substituents)}benzamide\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the result\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
