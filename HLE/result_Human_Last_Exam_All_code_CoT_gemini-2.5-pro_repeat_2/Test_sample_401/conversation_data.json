    "This is a question from the mathematical field of point-set topology. My plan is to break down the definitions and use established theorems to find the answer.\n\n1.  **Define the Terms**: I will first clarify the definitions of a continuum, an indecomposable continuum, and a composant.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound**: Using the properties of these definitions, I will show that the number of composants must be greater than one.\n3.  **Consider Different Types of Continua**: The distinction between metric and non-metric continua is critical. I'll explain the known result for metric continua.\n4.  **State the Decisive Theorem**: I will state the key theorem for general (not necessarily metric) continua that allows for the construction of indecomposable continua with a variable number of composants.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on this theorem, I will deduce the smallest possible number.\n6.  **Code Formulation**: Finally, I will present the explanation and the result within a Python script that prints the information, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the question about the\n    smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the concepts\n    print(\"To determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have, we need to understand the following concepts:\")\n    print(\"1.
