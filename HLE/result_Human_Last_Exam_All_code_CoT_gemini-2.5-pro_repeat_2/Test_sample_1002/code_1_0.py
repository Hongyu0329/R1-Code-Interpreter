    This function computes the symbolic result for the limit based on the provided integer k.

    The problem asks for the limit: lim_{m -> infinity} ln(f(m))/ln(m).
    Based on extremal graph theory, specifically Turan-type problems for bipartite graphs (related to the Zarankiewicz problem), this limit can be derived.

    The derivation shows that the asymptotic growth of f(m) is on the order of m^(k/(k+1)).
    Therefore, the limit of the ratio of logarithms is the exponent k/(k+1).
