    Analyzes the statements about State Enumeration Graphs (SEG) and
    Logical Attack Graphs (LAG) to find the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Worst-case complexity is exponential for both.
    B. Correct. SEG is more expressive and can model non-monotonic paths which LAG cannot.
    C. Correct. Monotonicity is the key reason for the smaller size of LAG.
    D. Incorrect. Probabilities can be calculated on graphs with loops using advanced methods
       (e.g., Markov chains), so it is not impossible.
    E. Correct. LAGs struggle with negation on non-static conditions due to monotonicity.

    The incorrect statement is D.
