    Explains why multiple assumptions are necessary for a valid Network Meta-Analysis (NMA).

    print("The validity of a Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) rests on several key assumptions being met. Let's analyze if any single one is sufficient:")
    print("\n*   **A, D. Transitivity and Similarity of Effect Modifiers:** These are foundational clinical assumptions. They state that it is reasonable to compare treatments indirectly (e.g., A vs. C via a common comparator B). While essential, this is not sufficient. The statistical data might still reveal significant disagreement (inconsistency) between direct and indirect evidence, invalidating the results.")
    print("\n*   **B. Consistency:** This is a statistical finding that direct and indirect evidence agree. This is a crucial check, but it is not sufficient. Consistency could be spurious if the underlying studies are not clinically comparable (i.e., if transitivity is violated). A consistent result from a flawed set of comparisons is not valid.")
    print("\n*   **C. Homogeneity:** This refers to the similarity of effect sizes for the same comparison across different studies. A network can be built from studies with low heterogeneity, but still be invalid if it is inconsistent or violates the transitivity assumption.")
    print("\n*   **F. Exchangeability:** This is a broader statistical assumption, often in a Bayesian context, that encompasses ideas of consistency and homogeneity. However, the overall validity of the analysis still depends on the fundamental clinical plausibility of the comparisons (transitivity) and the quality of the primary studies.")
    print("\n**Conclusion:**")
    print("A valid NMA requires that the network is clinically and methodologically appropriate (transitivity), and that this is confirmed by statistical agreement between different sources of evidence (consistency), with variability (heterogeneity) being properly assessed and managed. Since all these interconnected conditions must hold, no single assumption is sufficient on its own to ensure the validity of the analysis.")
