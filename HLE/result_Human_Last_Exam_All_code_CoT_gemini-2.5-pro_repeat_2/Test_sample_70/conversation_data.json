    "The task is to identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. We are to assume that the numerical values assigned to colors are chosen to maximize the rank of the resulting matrix for each flag.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. When we represent this flag as a matrix, we can assign numerical values to the colors (e.g., Red=1, White=2). The rows of this matrix will have two distinct patterns:\n    *   Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross: `[2, 2, 2, ..., 2]`\n    *   Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar: `[1, 1, ..., 2, ..., 1, 1]`\n    These two types of row vectors are linearly independent because one is not a scalar multiple of the other. Since all rows in the matrix are of one of these two types, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify African Flags with Rank 2:** We need to find flags of African nations whose structure also results in a rank of 2. A rank of 2 means the flag's matrix representation has a row space (or column space) that can be spanned by exactly two basis vectors. This occurs in a few common patterns:\n    *   **Pattern A: Stripes with a Central Emblem:** A flag with a background of horizontal or vertical stripes (which by itself would have a rank of 1) and a single, centered, symmetric emblem. The stripes provide one basis vector (a vector of ones), and the emblem provides a second, linearly independent \"shape\" vector.\n    *   **Pattern B: Intersecting Stripes:** A flag composed of a set of horizontal stripes that is intersected by a single vertical stripe. The column space for this design is spanned by two vectors: one representing the pattern of the horizontal stripes and one representing the solid color of the vertical stripe.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code below will encode this logic. It will define the target rank from the Danish flag and then check a list of African nations' flag descriptions against the patterns that result in a rank of 2. Finally, it will print the names of the matching nations.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_flag_rank(description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the algebraic rank of a flag based on its structural description.\n    This is a simplified model based on geometric patterns.\n\n    - Rank 1: Simple horizontal or vertical stripes without other features.\n    - Rank 2: A base of stripes (rank 1) with a simple, centered emblem,\n              or intersecting uniform stripes.\n    - Rank > 2: More complex patterns like multiple emblems, complex shapes (e.g., pall),\n                or cantons with detailed elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    if \"horizontal stripes with central emblem\" in description:\n        return 2\n    if \"vertical stripes with central emblem\" in description:\n        return 2\n    if \"horizontal stripes intersected by vertical stripe\" in description:\n        return 2\n    if \"cross\" in description and \"complex\" not in description:\n        return 2\n    if \"horizontal stripes\" in description or \"vertical stripes\" in description:\n        return 1\n    # Default for more complex or unclassified flags\n    return 3\n\ndef find_flags_with_same_rank_as_denmark():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds African flags with the same algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
