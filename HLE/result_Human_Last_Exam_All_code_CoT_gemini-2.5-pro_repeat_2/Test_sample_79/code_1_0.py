    print("The problem describes a population that meets all the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium:")
    print("- Infinitely large population (no genetic drift)")
    print("- Random mating throughout the population")
    print("- No mutations")
    print("- No gene flow (migration)")
    print("- No natural selection ('no bearing on fitness', 'all genotypes have equal fitness')")

    # Analysis of Statement 1
    print("Analysis of Statement 1: 'There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.'")
    print("The problem text explicitly states the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and that 'all genotypes have equal fitness'.")
    print("Conclusion: This statement is a direct restatement of the given conditions. It must be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 2
    print("Analysis of Statement 2: 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
    print("The problem states generations are 'discrete and non-overlapping'. This is a modeling assumption meaning the parental generation reproduces and then dies before their offspring reach sexual maturity. This assumption does not logically forbid parental care of young (e.g., feeding nestlings). Therefore, we cannot conclude that parents will not raise their offspring.")
    print("Conclusion: This statement does not have to be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 3
    print("Analysis of Statement 3: 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
    print("The conditions given are 'currently true'. The problem does not state these conditions will hold forever. Speciation could occur in the future if conditions change (e.g., a geographic barrier forms, selection pressures appear). The word 'never' makes this statement too strong.")
    print("Conclusion: This statement does not have to be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 4
    print("Analysis of Statement 4: 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.'")
    print("The population engages in random mating across the entire region, which prevents the formation of genetic differences between any geographic subgroups. Since the population is genetically uniform and there is no mention of environmental differences, the phenotypic distributions in the west and east must be the same. The infinite sample size eliminates any possibility of finding a difference due to random sampling error.")
    print("Conclusion: This statement must be true.\n")
    
    print("--- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, only statements 1 and 4 must always be true.")
    print("The correct answer choice is the one that includes '1 and 4 only'.")
