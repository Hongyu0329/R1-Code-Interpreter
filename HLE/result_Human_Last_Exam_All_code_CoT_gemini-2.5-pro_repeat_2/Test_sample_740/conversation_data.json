    "To find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$ can be simplified using the formula for a geometric sum:\n    $K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n    This shows the kernel is \"separable\" or \"degenerate\".\n\n2.  **Convert to a Linear System**: Because the kernel is separable, the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. We can write the solution in the form $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k$. Substituting this back into the integral equation leads to a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients $c_k$. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$\n    where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. The exact entries of $A$ depend on the choice of basis for the polynomial solution. A careful derivation shows that the problem is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n-j+k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Find Characteristic Values**: The system fails to have a unique solution if the determinant of $(I - \\lambda A)$ is zero. This happens when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. These values of $\\lambda$ are the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\n4.  **Apply Fredholm's Alternative Theorem**: For a characteristic value $\\lambda$, the inhomogeneous equation has no solution if the forcing term, $f(x) = 1$, is not orthogonal to the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation. Since the kernel is symmetric ($K(x,y)=K(y,x)$), the adjoint solutions are the same as the eigenfunctions $u_h(x)$ of the homogeneous equation $u(x) = \\lambda \\int K(x,y)u(y)dy$. The condition for no solution is $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$. Based on analysis for small values of $n$, this condition holds for all characteristic values.\n\n5.  **Computational Solution**: The problem thus reduces to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. The required values of $\\lambda$ are their reciprocals. As finding an analytical formula for these eigenvalues for a general $n$ is complex, we provide a Python script to compute them numerically for a given $n$. We will demonstrate the solution for the non-trivial case $n=2$.\n\nThe following Python code constructs the matrix $A$ for $n=2$, computes its eigenvalues ($\\mu$), finds the characteristic equation for $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, and then solves for the values of $\\lambda$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set the parameter n for the equation.\n# For n=1, the only value is λ=1.\n# We choose n=2 for a non-trivial example.\nn = 2\n\n# Based on Fredholm theory, the problem reduces to an eigenvalue problem.\n# The values of λ for which there are no solutions are the reciprocals\n# of the eigenvalues of the matrix A, defined below.\n\n# The matrix A is defined as A_jk = 1 / (n - j + k)\n# where j, k are 0-indexed, from 0 to n-1.\nA = np.zeros((n, n))\nfor j in range(n):\n    for k in range(n):\n        A[j, k] = 1.0 / (n - j + k)\n\n# The characteristic equation for λ is derived from det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0.\n# This results in a polynomial in λ.
