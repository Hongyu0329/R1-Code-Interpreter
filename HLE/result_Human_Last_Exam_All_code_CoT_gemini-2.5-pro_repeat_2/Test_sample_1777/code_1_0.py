# --- Given Parameters ---
# Band gap in eV
E_g = 3.0
# Resonance peak for 1s exciton in eV
E_1s = 1.0
# Target principal quantum number
n_target = 3

# --- Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton ---
# The energy of the 1s exciton state is E_1s = E_g - Eb_1s.
# Therefore, the binding energy Eb_1s is the difference.
Eb_1s = E_g - E_1s
print("Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (Eb_1s).")
print(f"Eb_1s = E_g - E_1s = {E_g} eV - {E_1s} eV = {Eb_1s} eV\n")

# --- Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (R_y*) ---
# For a 2D system, the binding energy is Eb_n = R_y* / (n - 0.5)^2.
# For n=1, this is Eb_1s = R_y* / (1 - 0.5)^2 = R_y* / 0.25 = 4 * R_y*.
# We can now solve for the effective Rydberg energy, R_y*.
n1_denominator = 1 - 0.5
n1_factor = 1 / (n1_denominator**2)
Ry_star = Eb_1s / n1_factor
print("Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (R_y*).")
print(f"R_y* = Eb_1s / (1 / ({1} - 0.5)^2) = {Eb_1s} eV / {n1_factor} = {Ry_star} eV\n")

# --- Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for n = 3 ---
# The "Rydberg energy for n=3" is interpreted as the binding energy for the n=3 state.
# We use the 2D formula with n=3 and the calculated R_y*.
n_target_denominator = n_target - 0.5
n_target_denominator_sq = n_target_denominator**2
Eb_n_target = Ry_star / n_target_denominator_sq

print(f"Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for n = {n_target} (Eb_{n_target}).")
print(f"Eb_{n_target} = R_y* / ({n_target} - 0.5)^2 = {Ry_star} eV / ({n_target_denominator})^2 = {Ry_star} eV / {n_target_denominator_sq} = {Eb_n_target:.3f} eV\n")

print("--- Final Answer ---")
print(f"The Rydberg energy for n = {n_target} is {Eb_n_target:.3f} eV.")
