    2. Define a hypothetical fitness for the F1 hybrid, which may show a small cost.
    3. Define a lower fitness for the F2 hybrid, representing the cost after "within mating"
       and meiotic recombination, which breaks up co-adapted gene complexes.
    4. Calculate the selection coefficient (s) for both hybrid generations, where s = 1 - W.
