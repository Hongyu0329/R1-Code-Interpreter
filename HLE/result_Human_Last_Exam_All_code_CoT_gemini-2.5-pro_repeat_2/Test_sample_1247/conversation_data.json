    "Answering the question \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) requires us to find the number of permutations of length 333 that have exactly 3 inversions and avoid the pattern 1324.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze Permutations with 3 Inversions:** The number of permutations of length `n` with `k` inversions is independent of `n` for `n >= 2k`. Since `n=333` is much larger than `k=3`, we can analyze the structure of permutations with 3 inversions by considering which elements are moved from their original positions in the identity permutation `1, 2, ..., n`. These permutations are typically formed by a small number of swaps on a small number of elements.\n    The permutations with 3 inversions are generated by:\n    a) Reversing a block of 3 consecutive elements.\n    b) Applying a specific permutation to a block of 4 consecutive elements. There are 5 such patterns of S_4 that result in 3 inversions: `1432`, `2341`, `2413`, `3142`, `4123`. The pattern `3214` is the same as reversing a block of 3 elements followed by a fixed element.\n    c) Composing disjoint swaps, which create more complex structures. For 3 inversions, these are either three disjoint adjacent swaps or a pair of adjacent swaps disjoint from a third adjacent swap.\n\n2.  **Check for the 1324 Pattern:** For each type of permutation with 3 inversions, we will check if it contains the `1324` pattern. A permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern `1324` if there exist four indices `i < j < k < l` such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n\n3.  **Identify the Avoider Permutations:** Our analysis will show that most permutations with 3 inversions contain the `1324` pattern. The only exceptions are those where the permuted elements are located at the very beginning or the very end of the permutation. This is because the formation of a `1324` pattern often requires elements both before and after the main inverted block, which are not available at the boundaries.\n\n4.  **Count the Avoider Permutations:** We will list and count the specific permutations that are found to be 1324-avoiding. The total count will be the sum of counts from each case.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will implement this logic. It will define the classes of permutations and verify which ones are 1324-avoiding. The final output will be the sum of the counts from each class, showing the contribution of each.\n\n### Analysis of Permutation Types\n\nLet `n = 333`.\n*   **Type A (3-reversal):** Permutations like `... p+2, p+1, p ...`. These contain `1324` unless `p=1` or `p=n-2`. This gives 2 avoiding permutations.\n*   **Type B (1432-block):** Permutations like `... p, p+3, p+2, p+1 ...`. These contain `1324` unless `p=n-3`. This gives 1 avoiding permutation.\n*   **Type C (2341-block):** Permutations like `... p+1, p+2, p+3, p ...`. These contain `1324` unless `p=1` or `p=n-3`. This gives 2 avoiding permutations.\n*   **Type D (2413-block):** Permutations like `... p+1, p+3, p, p+2 ...`. These contain `1324` unless `p=n-3`. This gives 1 avoiding permutation.\n*   **Type E (3142-block):** Permutations like `... p+2, p, p+3, p+1 ...`. These always contain `1324`. This gives 0 avoiding permutations.\n*   **Type F (4123-block):** Permutations like `... p+3, p, p+1, p+2 ...`. These contain `1324` unless `p=1` or `p=n-3`. This gives 2 avoiding permutations.\n*   **Other types (disjoint swaps):** Permutations formed by disjoint swaps, like `2,1,4,3,6,5,...`, can be shown to contain the `1324` pattern. This gives 0 avoiding permutations.\n\nThe total count is the sum of the counts from these cases: `2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 8`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result by defining the specific permutations that avoid the pattern and summing up the counts.\n\n```python\ndef count_1324_avoiding_perms_with_3_inversions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n\n    with exactly 3 inversions. The result is known to be constant for n >= 5.\n    We list the permutations based on their structure.\n    \n    A permutation is represented as a list or tuple of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 4:\n        # For n < 4, it's impossible to have some of these structures.\n        # k=3 inversions are not possible for n<3. For n=3, only one perm 321 has 3 inv.\n        # 321 is 1324-avoiding (vacuously). So av_3^3(1324) = 1.\n        # For n=4, the 8 perms are distinct.
