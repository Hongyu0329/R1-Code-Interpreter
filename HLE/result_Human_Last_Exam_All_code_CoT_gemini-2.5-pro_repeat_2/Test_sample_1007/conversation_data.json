    "An entrechat is a ballet step where the dancer jumps into the air and rapidly crosses their legs before and behind each other. The number after \"entrechat\" indicates the total number of leg movements (counting both opening and closing motions).\n\n- An **Entrechat six** starts in fifth position. The dancer jumps, uncrosses their legs to a small second position (1), beats them back to front (2), opens again (3), beats front to back (4), opens again (5), and finally lands back in the original fifth position (6). Because there are three openings and three closings, the legs end up exactly where they started.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n- **Échappé battu changé**: The word \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" The dancer starts in fifth position and ends in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.\n- **Assemblé**: Means \"to assemble.\" A common assemblé (dessus or dessous) involves jumping from one foot and landing on two in fifth position, but with the feet having changed places (the working leg lands in front or in back of where it started).\n- **Glissade derrière**: A gliding, traveling step. The dancer starts in fifth, the back leg glides out and the front leg closes to the back of the new fifth position. The feet have changed.\n- **Gargouillade**: A complex, decorative jump where each leg performs a rond de jambe. It typically starts on one foot and lands on one foot, not necessarily returning to a standard starting position like fifth.\n\nTherefore, the only step listed that returns to the identical starting position is Entrechat six.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to demonstrate this logic. The script will define each step and its properties, then identify and print the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'A vertical jump from fifth position.
