# Step 1: Define the symbolic variable for integration.
y = sympy.Symbol('y')

# Step 2: Define the integrand for the mean response time x.
# This expression is derived from the standard formula for mean response time
# in an M/G/1 queue under the SRPT policy, applied to the given parameters.
# E[T(y)] = (y - y**3/2) / (1 - 3*y**2/4)**2
mean_response_time_y = (y - y**3/2) / (1 - sympy.Rational(3,4)*y**2)**2

# Step 3: Calculate the definite integral from y=0 to y=1 to find the
# overall optimal mean response time, x.
x = sympy.integrate(mean_response_time_y, (y, 0, 1))

# Step 4: The result x is a sum of terms. We need to separate them
# to identify the part to remove and the part to keep.

        rational_term += term
    else:
        # This assumes x is a sum of a rational part and one other term.
        remaining_term += term

# Step 5: Identify the final remaining term based on the problem's rules.
# The rational term to be removed is `rational_term`.
# The other term is `remaining_term`, which is (8/9)*ln(2).
# This can be written as ln(2**(8/9)). Since 2**(8/9) is not a rational number,
# this term is not a "logarithm of a rational number" and is kept.
# Thus, `remaining_term` is the final answer.

# Step 6: Extract the numbers from the final term's equation as requested.
# The remaining term is of the form (numerator/denominator) * ln(argument).
# We parse the expression to get these numbers.
