    "Of course, I can help you with that. This problem requires knowledge of the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity. Here is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the mathematical setting:** The problem is about the representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. In the language of this theory, this sets the parameter $e$ (the order of the root) to 3. The category $C$ consists of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations. The question asks for the percentage of these objects that are irreducible.\n\n2.  **Count the irreducible representations:** First, I will determine the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at an $e$-th root of unity, the number of non-isomorphic irreducible highest-weight representations is finite and equal to $e-1$.\n\n3.  **Count all indecomposable representations:** Next, I will determine the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. The representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity is known to be of \"tame\" representation type. This means that, in addition to the finite number of irreducible representations, there are infinite families of indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the percentage:** Finally, I will calculate the percentage by taking the ratio of the number of irreducible representations to the total number of indecomposable representations. Since we have a finite number divided by an infinite number, the result will be zero.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_representation_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible representations among all\n    indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of u_q(sl_2) for q\n    a primitive third root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the mathematical context.\n    # q is a primitive third root of unity, so the order 'e' is 3.\n    e = 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the number of irreducible representations.\")\n    print(\"For the quantum group u_q(sl_2) with q a primitive e-th root of unity,\")\n    print(\"the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations is finite and equals e-1.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of irreducible representations.\n    num_irreducible = e - 1\n    print(f\"Given e = {e}, the number of irreducible representations is {e} - 1 = {num_irreducible}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the total number of indecomposable representations.\")\n    print(\"The representation theory of u_q(sl_2) at a root of unity is 'tame'.\")\n    print(\"This means there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\")\n    print(\"These include infinite families of modules, such as Weyl modules and cyclic modules.\")\n    \n    # In Python, float('inf') represents infinity.\n    num_total_indecomposable = math.inf\n    num_total_indecomposable_str = \"infinity\"\n    print(f\"The total number of indecomposable representations is {num_total_indecomposable_str}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the percentage.\n    # The percentage is the number of irreducibles divided by the total number of indecomposables.\n    if num_total_indecomposable == float('inf'):\n        percentage = 0.0\n    else:\n        # This branch is not expected to be reached.\n        percentage = (num_irreducible / num_total_indecomposable) * 100\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the final percentage.\")\n    print(\"The percentage is the ratio of these two counts multiplied by 100.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    # We output each number involved in the symbolic calculation.\n    # The numbers are 2 (num_irreducible) and 100.\n    # The final result is 0.0.\n    print(f\"Percentage = ({num_irreducible} / {num_total_indecomposable_str}) * 100 = {percentage}\")\n\nsolve_representation_percentage()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
