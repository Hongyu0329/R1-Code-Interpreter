# Plan:
# 1. Interpret "mercedesbenzene" as a central benzene ring with three attached phenyl groups (1,3,5-triphenylbenzene).
# 2. A benzene or phenyl ring contains 6 carbon atoms.
# 3. The total number of carbons is the sum of carbons in the central ring (1 * 6) and the three attached rings (3 * 6).
# 4. The script will perform this calculation and print the full equation as requested.

# Number of carbons in a single benzene or phenyl ring
carbons_per_ring = 6

# The structure has one central ring
num_central_rings = 1

# It has three rings attached to the central one, like the points of the Mercedes star
num_attached_rings = 3

# Calculate the total number of carbon atoms
total_carbons = (num_central_rings * carbons_per_ring) + (num_attached_rings * carbons_per_ring)

# Print an explanation and the final equation showing all the numbers
print("The molecule 'mercedesbenzene' is interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.")
print("It has 1 central benzene ring and 3 attached phenyl groups.")
print("The final equation to calculate the total number of carbons is:")
print(f"({num_central_rings} * {carbons_per_ring}) + ({num_attached_rings} * {carbons_per_ring}) = {total_carbons}")
