# The final product of the reaction sequence is an aldehyde.
# Its IUPAC name is determined by identifying the longest carbon chain
# containing the aldehyde group and locating the substituents and double bonds.
# The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO.
# The main chain has 6 carbons (hex-).
# The aldehyde group is at position 1 (-al).
# The double bond starts at position 4 (-4-en-).
# A methyl group is on position 5 (5-methyl-).

# The number 5 specifies the location of the methyl group.
# The number 4 specifies the location of the double bond (ene).
