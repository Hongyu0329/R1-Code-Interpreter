    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Values:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the official Terraria Wiki, this is **3640 HP**.\n2.  **Understand Health Scaling:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player. The formula for the health multiplier is `1 + 0.35 * (N - 1)`, where `N` is the number of players.\n3.  **Find the Player Cap:** The game does not scale health to an actual infinite number of players. The health calculation is capped at a maximum value. For Terraria, this cap is **255 players**.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Health:** I will use these values in a Python script to calculate the theoretical maximum health. The script will first calculate the total health multiplier using the 255-player cap and then multiply it by the boss's base Expert Mode health.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The script will print the complete equation with all the numbers, showing how the final result is achieved, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_max_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n    This is based on the game's health scaling formula and its internal player cap\n    for health calculations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    base_expert_health = 3640\n    per_player_increase_factor = 0.35\n    player_cap_for_scaling = 255\n\n    # The problem asks for the theoretical maximum, which is not infinite but\n    # capped by the game's code at 255 players for the scaling calculation.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of \"additional\" players for the formula\n    # The formula is Health = Base * (1 + Factor * (Players - 1))\n    additional_players = player_cap_for_scaling - 1\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total health multiplier\n    health_multiplier = 1 + (per_player_increase_factor * additional_players)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final maximum health\n    max_health = base_expert_health * health_multiplier\n\n    # Step 5: Print the equation with all the numbers and the final result.\n    # The result is cast to an integer as health points are whole numbers.\n    print(\"Equation for the Eye of Cthulhu's theoretical maximum health in Expert Mode:\")\n    print(\n        f\"{base_expert_health} * (1 + {per_player_increase_factor} * ({player_cap_for_scaling} - 1)) = {int(max_health)}\"\n    )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_terraria_max_boss_health()\n\n<<<327236>>>\n```"
