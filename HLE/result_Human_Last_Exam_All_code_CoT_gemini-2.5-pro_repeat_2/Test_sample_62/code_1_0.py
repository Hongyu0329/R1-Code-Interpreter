# The riddle's clues point to a specific type of Italian coffee.

# The first clue, "Cafi," is a slight misspelling of the Italian word for coffee.
first_part = "Caff√®"

# The second clue, the preference for something "not of the correct" shape,
# is a play on the Italian word for "corrected."
second_part = "corretto"

# We combine the two parts to form the full name of the drink.
full_name = f"{first_part} {second_part}"

print(f"The first part of the name is: {first_part}")
print(f"The second part of the name is: {second_part}")
print(f"Therefore, the correct name is: {full_name}")
