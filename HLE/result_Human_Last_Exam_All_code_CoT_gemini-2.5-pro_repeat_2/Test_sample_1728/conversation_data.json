    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: First, I'll break down the term \"sum of three cycles\". The \"sum\" of graphs, often called the graph join, connects every vertex of one graph to every vertex of the other(s). So, our graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\) is composed of three cycles of length \\( n \\), let's call them \\(C_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(2)}, C_n^{(3)}\\), where every vertex in \\(C_n^{(i)}\\) is connected to every vertex in \\(C_n^{(j)}\\) for \\( i \\neq j \\).\n2.  **Recall the Chromatic Number Formula**: I'll use the well-known property for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This extends to three graphs, so \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Analyze \\( \\chi(C_n) \\)**: The chromatic number of a single cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on its length \\( n \\) (for \\( n \\ge 3 \\)).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, \\( C_n \\) is bipartite, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n4.  **Find the Maximum**: The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize \\( 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\), I need to maximize \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3 (when \\( n \\) is odd).\n5.  **Calculate and Format the Output**: The final step is to calculate the result: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\). The Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The chromatic number of a sum (join) of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\n    # For a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n (G = C_n + C_n + C_n),\n    # the chromatic number is chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n).\n\n    # To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we need the maximal chromatic number of a cycle C_n.\n    # A cycle C_n has a chromatic number of 2 if n is even, and 3 if n is odd (for n >= 3).\n    # The maximum of these two values is 3.\n    max_chi_cn = 3\n    \n    # The number of cycles being summed is 3.\n    num_cycles = 3\n    \n    # The maximal chromatic number of G is the sum of the maximal chromatic numbers of the three cycles.\n    total_max_chi = max_chi_cn * num_cycles\n    \n    # Construct the equation string as requested.\n    equation_parts = [str(max_chi_cn)] * num_cycles\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number for one cycle C_n is {max_chi_cn}.\")\n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number for the sum of three cycles is the sum of their individual maximal chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_max_chi}\")\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
