    # of a free group is indeed context-free.

    # (b) If alpha(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(alpha(K)) is also context-free?
    # In a free group, the geodesic language Geo(S) is the language of reduced words for elements in S.
    # A subset S is defined as context-free if and only if its language of reduced words is context-free.
    # Therefore, the statement is true by definition.

    # (c) If K is context-free, determine if Geo(alpha(K)) must be context-free for a different choice of generating set A.
    # The property does not hold for context-free sets. The conjugacy closure of a context-free set
    # is not necessarily context-free.
    # A counterexample: In F(a,b), let K = {a^n b^n | n >= 1}. K is context-free.
    # Its conjugacy closure alpha(K) contains the set {a^(n+1) b^n a^(-1) | n >= 1},
    # which can be shown to not be a context-free language.
