    "This is a classic word-play riddle that relies on a pun between Russian and English. My plan is to solve it by identifying the key geographical feature in Vienna, finding its Russian translation, and then connecting that translation phonetically to the surname of a famous English poet.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the famous \"wide boulevards\" of Vienna. This refers to the Ringstrasse, which translates to \"Ring Boulevard\".\n2.  Find the Russian word for \"Ring\", as the clue mentions a \"Russian translation\".\n3.  Search for an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, creates a pun with the Russian word for \"Ring\".\n4.  Print the steps of this deduction and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by identifying a phonetic pun between Russian and English.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The 'wide boulevards of Vienna' almost certainly refers to the famous Ringstrasse ('Ring Boulevard').\")\n    print(\"The key word here is 'Ring'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The riddle mentions a 'Russian translation'. We need the Russian word for 'Ring'.\")\n    russian_ring = \"Кольцо\"\n    pronunciation_ring = \"kol'tso\"\n    print(f\"The Russian word for 'Ring' is '{russian_ring}', pronounced roughly as '{pronunciation_ring}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: The riddle is a pun. We are looking for an English poet whose name sounds like the Russian word for 'Ring'.\")\n    poet_name_english = \"Coleridge\"\n    poet_name_russian = \"Кольридж\"\n    pronunciation_poet = \"Kol'ridzh\"\n    print(f\"The surname of the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge is transliterated into Russian as '{poet_name_russian}' ({pronunciation_poet}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: The first part of the surname, 'Коль-' (Kol'-), is a clear phonetic pun on 'Кольцо' (kol'tso).\")\n    print(\"Thus, in a Russian text about the Vienna 'Ring' (Кольцо), the name 'Coleridge' (Кольридж) is evoked.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    final_answer = poet_name_english\n    print(f\"The surname is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
