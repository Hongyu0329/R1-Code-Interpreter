# Step 1: Identify the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.
# The reaction causes a ring contraction, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.
# The molecular formula of the product is C6H10O2.

# Step 2: Define the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula.
# BMC = (N_A * N_B) / N_P
# N_A = number of non-hydrogen atoms
# N_B = number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms
# N_P = number of molecular partitions (1 for a single connected molecule)

# Step 3: Calculate the parameters for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

# N_A: Count the non-hydrogen atoms (6 Carbon + 2 Oxygen).
N_A = 6 + 2

# N_B: Count the bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.
# - 5 C-C bonds in the cyclopentane ring.
# - 1 C-C bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group.
# - 2 bonds from the carboxyl carbon to the two oxygens (C=O and C-O).
N_B = 5 + 1 + 2

# N_P: The product is a single molecule.
N_P = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity.
bottcher_complexity = (N_A * N_B) / N_P

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final result.
