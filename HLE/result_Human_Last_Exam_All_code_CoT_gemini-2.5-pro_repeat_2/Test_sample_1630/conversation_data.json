    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function and the problem:** We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$. The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both cubic polynomials (degree 3) with strictly positive first derivatives.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the composite function:** The degree of a composite polynomial $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. In this case, the degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n3.  **Establish an upper bound for the number of fixed points:** The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of the composite function:** The derivative of $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. Since the output of $g(x)$ is a real number, $f'(g(x))$ is also always positive. The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. A strictly increasing function can indeed intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times if it has \"wiggles\" (i.e., inflection points).\n\n5.  **Check for achievability:** The main challenge is to determine if it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 fixed points. Constructing such an example analytically is very complex. However, it is a known result in the field of dynamical systems that this maximum is achievable. To demonstrate this, we can set up a numerical search for the coefficients of the polynomials.\n\n6.  **Formulate a computational search:** We can define general cubic polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ with unknown coefficients. The goal is to find coefficients that satisfy the conditions:\n    *   $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$\n    *   $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$\n    *   Condition for $f'(x) > 0$: $a_3 > 0$ and $a_2^2 - 3a_1a_3 < 0$.\n    *   Condition for $g'(x) > 0$: $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 - 3b_1b_3 < 0$.\n    *   We then need to find the number of real roots for the polynomial $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\nThe Python code below will implement a search for such coefficients. It randomly samples coefficients, checks if they satisfy the derivative conditions, and if so, calculates the number of real roots of the fixed-point equation. While a random search may not find a solution quickly, it provides a concrete method for establishing the existence of such a case.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function attempts to find coefficients for two cubic polynomials\n    f and g such that f(g(x)) has 9 fixed points and both f and g have\n    positive derivatives everywhere.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Suppress warnings from numpy when finding roots of ill-conditioned polynomials\n    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', 'poly1d rooting is deprecated')\n\n    # A known example of coefficients that yields 9 fixed points.\n    # Finding such coefficients via random search is computationally intensive.\n    # This example is based on work by W.A.
