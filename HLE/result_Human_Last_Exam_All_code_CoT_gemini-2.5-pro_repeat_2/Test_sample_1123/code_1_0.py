    # Step 1: Identify the goal of the experiment
    print("Step 1: The experiment is a photo-proximity labeling study.")
    print("         A probe is activated by light to covalently label nearby proteins.")
    print("         The labeling is detected by the fluorescence of a 'clicked' cy5 tag.\n")

    # Step 2: Compare the two probes
    print("Step 2: Identify the key structural difference between the two probes.")
    print("         - Probe 1 contains a '4-hydroxyphenyl' group (a phenol).")
    print("         - Probe 2 contains a '4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl' group (a benzyl alcohol).\n")

    # Step 3: Explain the reaction mechanism for the successful probe (Probe 1)
    print("Step 3: Analyze the reaction with Probe 1 (which gives a strong signal).")
    print("         a) The photosensitizer absorbs light and becomes highly reactive.")
    print("         b) It then abstracts a hydrogen atom from the phenol group of Probe 1.")
    print("         c) This reaction is highly efficient because phenols are excellent hydrogen donors.")
    print("         d) The result is the formation of a 'phenoxyl radical'.\n")

    # Step 4: Identify the reactive species
    print("Step 4: The phenoxyl radical is extremely reactive and short-lived.")
    print("         It quickly forms a covalent bond with nearby proteins, attaching the probe.")
    print("         This efficient labeling leads to a strong fluorescent signal after adding cy5-azide.\n")

    # Step 5: Explain the result for the less successful probe (Probe 2)
    print("Step 5: Analyze the reaction with Probe 2 (which gives a weak signal).")
    print("         The benzyl alcohol in Probe 2 is a much poorer hydrogen donor than the phenol.")
    print("         Therefore, the formation of a reactive radical is very inefficient.")
    print("         This leads to minimal protein labeling and a weak fluorescent signal.\n")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("Step 6: Conclude the cause of the difference.")
    print("         The significant difference in fluorescence is due to the efficient formation of the")
    print("         'phenoxyl radical' from Probe 1, and the lack of its formation from Probe 2.\n")

    # Final Answer
    print("Therefore, the molecule that is central to the high-efficiency reaction and explains the observed difference is the phenoxyl radical.")
    print("The correct answer choice is B.")
