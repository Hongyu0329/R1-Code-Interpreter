**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**

1.  **The Group:** We are considering the group of integers, G = (Z, +), under the operation of addition.

2.  **The Topology Conditions:** We are looking for the number of topologies on Z that satisfy three conditions:
    a) It is a group topology.
    b) It is totally bounded.
    c) It has no "nontrivial convergent sequences".

3.  **Analyzing the Core Condition:** Let's focus on condition (c) and the provided definitions.
    -   A sequence (x_n) is defined as **nontrivial** if its terms are non-zero for all but finitely many n (i.e., x_n != 0 for n > N for some integer N).
    -   The condition is: There are **no nontrivial convergent sequences**. This means that if a sequence is nontrivial, it cannot converge to any limit in Z.

4.  **Constructing a Test Case:** Let's pick any non-zero integer, for example, the number 1.
    -   Consider the constant sequence S = (1, 1, 1, 1, ...).

5.  **Checking for Convergence:** By the fundamental definition of a topology and convergence, any constant sequence always converges to its value.
    -   Therefore, the sequence S converges to the limit 1.

6.  **Checking if the Sequence is "Nontrivial":** We use the problem's definition.
    -   The terms of the sequence S are all 1.
    -   None of the terms are 0.
    -   Thus, the condition "x_n != 0 for all but finitely many n" is satisfied.
    -   This means S is a **nontrivial** sequence.

7.  **Reaching a Contradiction:**
    -   From step 5, we established that S is a convergent sequence.
    -   From step 6, we established that S is a nontrivial sequence.
    -   Therefore, S is a "nontrivial convergent sequence".
    -   However, the problem requires a topology with **no** such sequences. This is a direct logical contradiction.

8.  **Conclusion:** The conditions given in the problem are self-contradictory. The existence of any non-zero element in the group Z, combined with the basic axioms of topology, makes it impossible to satisfy the condition. Therefore, no such topology can exist.

The equation for the final answer is:
Number of such topologies = 0
