    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we need to analyze its structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: The flag of Tonga is primarily red with a white canton in the top-left corner. Inside the canton is a red cross. We can represent this with a matrix where red pixels have a value `a` and white pixels have a value `b`. To maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to be distinct values, for example, `a=1` and `b=2`.\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure**: The resulting matrix `M` will have large blocks of the value `a`. The interesting part is the canton. The canton itself is a submatrix where the background is `b` and a cross shape is `a`.\n3.  **Determine Linear Independence of Rows**: The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's inspect the different types of rows that can appear in the matrix `M`.\n    *   Any row that lies entirely in the main red field of the flag will be `[a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   Any row that passes through the horizontal bar of the red cross in the canton will also be `[a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   Any row that passes through the white part of the canton will consist of `b`'s (for the white areas), `a`'s (for the vertical bar of the cross), and `a`'s (for the main red field outside the canton). All such rows will have the same pattern, for instance, `[b, b, a, b, b, a, a, ..., a]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank**: Since all rows in the entire matrix must be one of these two types, the row space of the matrix is spanned by only two distinct vectors.\n    *   Vector 1: `v1 = [a, a, a, ..., a]`\n    *   Vector 2: A vector corresponding to a row through the white part of the canton.\n    As long as we choose `a â‰  b`, these two vectors will be linearly independent. Therefore, the dimension of the row space is 2.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The maximal possible rank is 2. We can demonstrate this by constructing such a matrix in Python and using NumPy to compute its rank.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that builds a representation of the Tongan flag matrix and computes its rank to verify this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a matrix representing the flag of Tonga\n    and calculates its maximal possible rank.\n    \"\"\"\n    # To find the maximal rank, we choose distinct values for a and b.\n    # Let red pixels be represented by a=1 and white pixels by b=2.\n    a = 1  # Red\n    b = 2  # White\n\n    # Define the dimensions of the flag matrix\n    height = 30\n    width = 60\n\n    # The main field of the flag is red.\n    # Initialize the matrix with the value 'a'.\n    flag_matrix = np.full((height, width), fill_value=a, dtype=int)\n\n    # Define the canton (the top-left rectangle).\n    # According to the flag's proportions, it's roughly the top-left quadrant.\n    canton_height = height // 2\n    canton_width = width // 3\n\n    # The canton's background is white.\n    flag_matrix[0:canton_height, 0:canton_width] = b\n\n    # Define the red cross within the canton.\n    # The cross should be \"couped\", meaning it doesn't touch the canton's edges.\n    cross_v_start = canton_height // 4\n    cross_v_end = canton_height * 3 // 4\n    cross_h_start = canton_width // 4\n    cross_h_end = canton_width * 3 // 4\n    \n    # Thickness of the cross arms\n    arm_thickness_v = max(1, canton_height // 10)\n    arm_thickness_h = max(1, canton_width // 10)\n    \n    # Horizontal arm of the cross (red)\n    h_arm_center = canton_height // 2\n    flag_matrix[h_arm_center - arm_thickness_v : h_arm_center + arm_thickness_v, cross_h_start:cross_h_end] = a\n    \n    # Vertical arm of the cross (red)\n    v_arm_center = canton_width // 2\n    flag_matrix[cross_v_start:cross_v_end, v_arm_center - arm_thickness_h : v_arm_center + arm_thickness_h] = a\n\n    # Calculate the rank of the resulting matrix\n    matrix_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n    # The \"equation\" is simply that the rank is a certain number.\n    # We output the numbers involved: the values for a and b, and the final rank.\n    print(f\"Assigning red pixels the value a={a} and white pixels the value b={b}.\")\n    print(\"The resulting matrix has the structure of the Tongan flag.\")\n    # Printing the full matrix can be very long, so we'll just print the rank.\n    # print(\"Generated Flag Matrix:\\n\", flag_matrix)\n    print(f\"The rank of this matrix is {matrix_rank}.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the analysis that the matrix contains only two types of linearly independent rows, the maximal possible rank is 2.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
