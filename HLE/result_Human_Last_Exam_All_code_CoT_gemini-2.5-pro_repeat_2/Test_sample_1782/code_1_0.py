    """
    This function simulates the construction of a tree where each level is a
    partition that refines the previous level. This is a finite analogy for
    the set-theoretic construction described in the user's question.

    In this analogy:
    - A finite set of integers stands in for the uncountable set omega_1.
    - A partition of this set stands in for a maximal antichain.
    - Splitting a set in a partition stands in for the refinement process.
