# The problem asks for the largest cardinality guaranteed to exist for a collection A
# of omega_4-sized subsets of omega_4, with the property that the intersection of any
# two distinct sets in A is smaller than omega_4.

# Let kappa = omega_4. The maximum size of such a family is 2^kappa.
# The question asks for the largest cardinality *guaranteed* to exist, which means
# we are looking for the minimum possible value of 2^omega_4 consistent with ZFC
# and the given condition 2^omega_3 = omega_4.

# By Cantor's theorem, 2^omega_4 must be strictly greater than omega_4.
# The smallest cardinal greater than omega_4 is the successor cardinal, omega_5.
# Therefore, 2^omega_4 must be at least omega_5.

# It is consistent with ZFC (for example, in a model with the Generalized Continuum
# Hypothesis) that 2^omega_4 is exactly omega_5.

# Thus, the largest cardinality that is guaranteed to exist is omega_5.
# The index of this cardinal is 5.
