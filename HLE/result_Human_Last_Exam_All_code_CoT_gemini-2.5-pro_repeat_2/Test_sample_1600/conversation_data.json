    "The problem asks for the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This is a well-known sequence in theoretical physics. The term \"order 2n\" refers to diagrams with `n` loops (which typically have `2n` vertices).\n\nThe values of this sequence are not generated by a simple formula but are computed using complex combinatorial algorithms or found in physics literature. The first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` are:\n*   `a(1)` (1-loop diagrams): 1\n*   `a(2)` (2-loop diagrams): 2\n*   `a(3)` (3-loop diagrams): 10\n*   `a(4)` (4-loop diagrams): 74\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that provides the value for `a(3)` by looking it up from this known sequence.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  I will define a Python function that encapsulates the known values of the sequence `a(n)`.\n2.  This function will use a dictionary to store the sequence, mapping `n` to `a(n)`.\n3.  The script will then call this function with the input `n=3`.\n4.  Finally, it will print the result in the required equation format, `a(3) = value`.\n\n```python\ndef get_feynman_diagram_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n\n    for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics.\n\n    This corresponds to the number of n-loop one-particle-irreducible (1PI)\n    diagrams.
