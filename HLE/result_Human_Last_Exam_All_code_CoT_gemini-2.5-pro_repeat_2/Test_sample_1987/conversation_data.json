    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`.\nThe function is defined by three rules:\n1.  It's 0 for invalid inputs (`a_1 < 0` or the sequence `a_k` is not non-decreasing). A non-decreasing sequence means `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n2.  `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is a base case.\n3.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ...) + f(a_1, a_2-1, ...) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)`. This is the recursive step.\n\nThis recurrence relation describes the number of lattice paths from the origin `(0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` that are confined to the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics. The number of such paths can be identified with the number of Semi-Standard Young Tableaux (SSYT) of a certain shape. Specifically, `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is the number of SSYT of shape `λ = (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)` with entries from the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`.\n\nThe number of such SSYT is given by the hook-content formula:\n`N(λ) = Product_{u in λ} (n + c(u)) / h(u)`\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the partition (shape) of the tableau.\n*   The product is over all boxes `u` in the Young diagram of `λ`.\n*   `n` is the number of variables/dimensions.\n*   `c(u)` is the content of the box `u` at position `(i, j)` (row `i`, column `j`), defined as `j - i`.\n*   `h(u)` is the hook length of the box `u`, defined as `(λ_i - j) + (λ'_j - i) + 1`, where `λ'` is the conjugate partition of `λ`.\n\nI will use this formula to calculate the required values.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`**\nHere, `n=3` and the sequence is `a = (2, 4, 5)`. The corresponding partition is `λ = (5, 4, 2)`.\nI will implement a function to calculate the hook-content formula for a given partition `λ` and dimension `n`.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`**\nThis is a special case where all `a_k` are equal. `n=3`, `a = (9000, 9000, 9000)`.\nThe partition `λ` is a rectangle: `(9000, 9000, 9000)`.\nFor a rectangular partition `λ = (a, a, ..., a)` (`n` times), the hook length of a box at `(i, j)` is simpler: `h(i, j) = (n - i) + (a - j) + 1`.\nI will use the formula with these values. The result will be a very large number, so I'll use Python's arbitrary-precision integers.\n\n**Part 3: Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`**\nHere, `n=4`, and all `a_k` are `p = 10^9 + 7`. The partition is `λ = (p, p, p, p)`.\nI will use the same hook-content formula and perform all calculations modulo `p`. This involves modular inverse for division.\nThe formula is `Product_{i=1..n, j=1..a} (n + j - i) / (n - i + a - j + 1)`.\nWith `a=p` and `n=4`, the expression becomes `Product_{i=1..4, j=1..p} (4 + j - i) / (p + 5 - i - j)`.\nModulo `p`, the denominator is `5 - i - j`. The denominator becomes zero if `i+j=5`. This happens for pairs `(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)`.\nWhen `i+j=5`, the denominator term `p + 5 - i - j` is exactly `p`. So the denominator of the whole expression is a multiple of `p^4`.\nSimilarly, the numerator `4+j-i` becomes a multiple of `p` only when `j-i` is `-4 mod p`. This happens when `(i,j) = (4,p)`, where the term is `p`. So the numerator is a multiple of `p`.\nThe overall expression is of the form `C'p / (C''p^4)`. Calculating this requires careful cancellation, which suggests there might be a simpler method or that the formula simplifies.\n\nAn alternative approach for modular arithmetic is based on Lucas's Theorem. For many combinatorial quantities `Q(a)`, it holds that `Q(p) ≡ Q(1) (mod p)`. Let's test this hypothesis.\n`f(p, p, ..., p) mod p = f(1, 1, ..., 1) mod p`.\nLet's calculate `f(1, 1, 1, 1)`:\n`f(1,1,1,1) = f(0,1,1,1) + f(1,0,1,1) + ...`\nThe only non-zero term is `f(0,1,1,1)` due to the increasing order constraint.\n`f(0,1,1,1) = f(0,0,1,1) = f(0,0,0,1) = f(0,0,0,0) = 1`.\nSo, `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` is likely 1. This is a common pattern for such problems. I will use this result.\n\nNow, I will write the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Memoization cache for the recursive solution\nmemo_f_rec = {}\n\ndef is_increasing(args):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a tuple is non-decreasing.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(args) - 1):\n        if args[i] > args[i+1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef f_recursive(args):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(a1, ..., an) using the recursive definition.\n    This is suitable for small inputs like f(2, 4, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    args = tuple(args)\n    if args in memo_f_rec:\n        return memo_f_rec[args]\n\n    if args[0] < 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    if not is_increasing(args):\n        return 0\n\n    if all(a == 0 for a in args):\n        return 1\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(args)):\n        new_args = list(args)\n        new_args[i] -= 1\n        total += f_recursive(tuple(new_args))\n    \n    memo_f_rec[args] = total\n    return total\n\ndef get_conjugate_partition(partition):\n    \"\"\"Computes the conjugate of a partition.\"\"\"\n    if not partition:\n        return []\n    conjugate = []\n    max_len = partition[0]\n    for j in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        count = 0\n        for part in partition:\n            if part >= j:\n                count += 1\n        conjugate.append(count)\n    return conjugate\n\ndef f_formula(a_seq):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(a1, ..., an) using the hook-content formula for SSYT.\n    This is suitable for large inputs.\n    f(a1, ..., an) = Number of SSYT of shape lambda = (an, ..., a1) on {1,..,n}\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(a_seq)\n    if not is_increasing(a_seq) or a_seq[0] < 0:\n        return 0\n    if all(a == 0 for a in a_seq):\n        return 1\n\n    partition = tuple(sorted(a_seq, reverse=True))\n    conjugate = get_conjugate_partition(partition)\n    \n    num = 1\n    den = 1\n\n    for i in range(len(partition)): # row i (1-indexed in formula)\n        for j in range(partition[i]): # col j (1-indexed in formula)\n            # content = (j+1) - (i+1) = j-i\n            content = j - i\n            # hook_length = lambda_i - j + lambda'_j - i + 1\n            hook_length = (partition[i] - (j+1)) + (conjugate[j] - (i+1)) + 1\n            \n            num *= (n + content)\n            den *= hook_length\n            \n            # Reduce fraction to prevent huge intermediate numbers\n            common = math.gcd(num, den)\n            num //= common\n            den //= common\n\n    return num // den\n\n\ndef main():\n    # --- Part 1: Calculate f(2, 4, 5) ---\n    # The recursive approach is straightforward and efficient enough for this.\n    val1 = f_recursive((2, 4, 5))\n\n    # --- Part 2: Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000) ---\n    # The recursive approach is too slow.
