    "Of course. Here is a plan to find the answer to your question.\n\nFirst, I need to access my knowledge base to find information about the 1997 Italian film \"Ovosodo\".\nThen, I will identify the specific plot point regarding the character Tommaso and his move to the United States.\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_in_ovosodo():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the user's question\n    about the movie 'Ovosodo'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information based on the plot of the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\"\n    movie = \"Ovosodo\"\n    character = \"Tommaso\"\n    us_city = \"Philadelphia\"\n\n    # Print the answer\n    print(f\"In the movie '{movie}', the character {character} moves to the US city of {us_city}.\")\n\nfind_city_in_ovosodo()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
