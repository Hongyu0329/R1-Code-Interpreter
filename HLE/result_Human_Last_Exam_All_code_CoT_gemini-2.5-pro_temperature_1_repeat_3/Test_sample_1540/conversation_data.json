  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nLittle Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.\n\nInput\nEach of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\nIf the first string is less than the second one, print \"-1\". If the second string is less than the first one, print \"1\". If the strings are equal, print \"0\". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the strings are compared.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem. Answer m as the total memory in bytes used for variables of this problem. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course! I can help you with that. Here is my plan:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program. The key is to use the smallest possible data types for the variables. I will calculate the total memory `m` in bytes required for these variables. The final equation for memory usage will be:\n`m = memory for string1 + memory for string2 + memory for loop index`\n\nSecond, I will provide a Python script to solve the same lexicographical comparison problem. The script will read two strings, convert them to lowercase, and then compare them to print -1, 1, or 0. As requested, I will include the memory calculation details within the code block as comments.\n\n```python\n# This script solves the lexicographical string comparison problem.\n\n# The memory calculation for the most efficient C program is as follows:\n# To store two strings of maximum length 100, we need two char arrays.\n# Each array needs 100 chars + 1 null terminator = 101 bytes.\n# We also need a loop counter. Since the length is at most 100, a 'char' type (1 byte) is sufficient.\n# Final Equation: m = memory(string1) + memory(string2) + memory(loop_counter)\n# The numbers in the equation are:\n# m = 101 + 101 + 1\n# m = 203 bytes\n\n# Read the two strings from the user\ns1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\n# Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\ns1_lower = s1.lower()\ns2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n# Perform the lexicographical comparison and print the result\nif s1_lower < s2_lower:\n    print(\"-1\")\nelif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n    print(\"1\")\nelse:\n    print(\"0\")\n\n```\n<<<203>>>"
