def solve_hopf_algebra_problem():
    """
    Solves the given Hopf algebra problem based on the provided formula and conditions.

    The solution is derived as follows:
    1.  For (a), the conditions g.1_R = 0 and g^2.1_R = 1_R lead to a contradiction (1_R = 0),
        implying the ring R is trivial. In a trivial ring, any property like "symmetric" holds.
        So the answer is Yes.
    2.  For (b) and (c), the presence of the unspecified element 'a' makes the problem ambiguous.
        Assuming 'a' is a placeholder for the identity element 1_H allows for a clean simplification
        that uses all the given conditions.
    3.  Under the assumption a=1_H, and using the fact that g.1_R = 0 implies g^k.1_R = 0 for k>=1,
        the summation in the formula simplifies dramatically.
    4.  For (b), we calculate x^2.1_R. Only the k=0 term of the sum survives, which gives w^2.
    5.  For (c), we calculate x^3.1_R. Similarly, only the k=0 term survives, resulting in w^3.
