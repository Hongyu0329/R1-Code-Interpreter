    # The problem asks to count the number of correct statements among A, B, C, D, and E.
    # Let's analyze each statement based on the provided text.

    # Statement A claims the definition of segregation is potentially ill-defined due to its
    # reliance on "order of appearance" within a "set of facts and rules".
    # A mathematical set is inherently unordered. Defining an operation based on order within a set
    # is a contradiction. Thus, statement A correctly points out a flaw in the formalism.
    statement_A_correct = True
    
    # Statement B incorrectly claims that γ[γ⁻¹[P]]=P is part of the claim and that its validity
    # is questionable due to order-dependence. The actual claim is about the results of
    # program execution (P(S₀)). Furthermore, applying γ to any program P' from the set γ⁻¹[P]
    # deterministically results in P, meaning γ[γ⁻¹[P]] = {P}. The reasoning in B is flawed.
    statement_B_correct = False
    
    # Statement C claims that aggregation (γ) loses information and thus segregation (γ⁻¹) is not
    # a true inverse, meaning γ⁻¹[γ[P]] might not be identical to P. This is true. Aggregation is
    # many-to-one. Even under the specific problem assumption where γ[P]=P, the statement becomes
    # "γ⁻¹[P] might not be identical to P". Since γ⁻¹[P] is a set of programs (the result of
    # segregation) and P is a single program, they are not identical in form or in general.
    statement_C_correct = True
    
    # Statement D claims it's unclear whether segregation generates all combinations or just uses a
    # single representative. The recursive formula for segregation uses a large union operator (∪),
    # which explicitly means taking all possibilities from the pre-image set and combining them.
    # This clearly indicates the intent to generate all combinations, not pick a single one.
    # Therefore, the ambiguity described in D is not actually present in that aspect of the formula.
    statement_D_correct = False
    
    # Statement E provides a high-level interpretation of the final claim. It correctly identifies
    # the premises (γ[P]=P, γ[S₀]=S₀) as a "stable level of granularity" and interprets the
    # equation as stating that coarse-grained inference (P(S₀)) is equivalent to a
    # refine-evaluate-coarsen cycle. This correctly implies that no information is lost by performing
    # inference at the coarse-grained level, which is an accurate summary of the claim's meaning.
