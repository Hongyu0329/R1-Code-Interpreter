# This script provides the solution to a two-part Hebrew linguistic task.
# The logic involves analyzing Biblical Hebrew text based on the Tiberian pronunciation tradition.
# The code's purpose is to print the final, formatted answer derived from this analysis.

# Part 1: Identification of primary stressed syllables.
# The syllables are identified based on the location of the main accent mark (ta'am) for each of the first seven words.
part1_syllables = "כִּ֗יל אָ֫ מָ֣ה הִים נַ֣ח נֶ֑ שַׁ֥ן"

# Part 2: Identification of the last syllable with marked secondary stress.
# This is found by locating the last meteg accent in the verse.
part2_syllable = "עָֽ"

# The final answer is constructed by combining the two parts with a comma, as per the instructions.
# Format: [Part 1],[Part 2]
final_answer = f"{part1_syllables},{part2_syllable}"
