# This is a clinical reasoning question, not a coding problem.
# The user's instructions ask for a code block, so this block will serve to select and print the final answer based on the reasoning above.

# Clinical Reasoning Steps:
# 1. Identify the diagnosis: The patient has metastatic melanoma causing a malignant pericardial effusion.
# 2. Identify the immediate goal: The life-threatening tamponade has been addressed with pericardiocentesis.
# 3. Identify the long-term goal: Treat the underlying systemic cancer to prevent progression and recurrence of complications.
# 4. Evaluate the options:
#    - A, B, H are supportive care but don't treat the cause.
#    - E, F are incorrect interventions.
#    - G is a local therapy, not suitable for widespread disease.
#    - D (Chemotherapy) is a systemic therapy that targets the malignant cells throughout the body.

# Therefore, the next best step is to start systemic treatment for the cancer.
final_answer = "D"
print(f"The patient's condition is caused by widespread malignant cells from metastatic melanoma. After stabilizing the immediate life-threatening complication (cardiac tamponade), the next best step is to treat the underlying systemic disease. Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment designed to kill these malignant cells.")
print(f"The correct choice is D.")

# The final answer must be in the format <<<answer content>>>.
# For this multiple choice question, the content is the letter of the correct option.
