    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type**: The given curve is a specific type of parametric curve known as a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. Our curve fits this form with `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and a phase shift `δ = π/2` in the x-component (since `cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2)`).\n\n2.  **Use the Self-Intersection Formula**: There is a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve where the frequency parameters `a` and `b` are integers. For a curve with `x = cos(at)` and `y = sin(bt)`, when `a` and `b` are both odd integers, the number of self-intersection points `N` is given by:\n    `N = (a * b - gcd(a, b)) / 2`\n    where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: In our case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   Both `a` and `b` are odd integers.\n    *   The greatest common divisor, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1.\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula, we can calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n4.  **Code the Calculation**: I will provide a Python script that implements this formula to compute the final answer and prints the equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_self_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the Lissajous curve\n    defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the curve equations x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve\n    # of this type (where a and b are odd) is (a * b - gcd(a, b)) / 2.\n    \n    # First, calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # Check if the conditions for the formula are met (optional, but good practice)\n    # This specific formula works when a and b are odd integers.\n    if a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:\n        # Apply the formula to find the number of self-intersections.\n        num_intersections = (a * b - gcd_val) // 2\n\n        # Print the equation with the specific numbers, as requested.\n        print(f\"The number of self-intersections is calculated using the formula (a * b - gcd(a, b)) / 2.\")\n        print(f\"For a = {a} and b = {b}:\")\n        print(f\"({a} * {b} - {gcd_val}) / 2 = {num_intersections}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The formula used applies to cases where a and b are odd integers.\")\n\nsolve_self_intersections()\n```\n<<<22>>>"
