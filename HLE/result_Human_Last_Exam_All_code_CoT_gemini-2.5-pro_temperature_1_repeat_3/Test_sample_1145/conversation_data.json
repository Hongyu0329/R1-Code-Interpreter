    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region inside a 1D box. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the Formula:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in a 1D box of length `a` between positions `x1` and `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψn(x)|²`, over that interval.\n    `P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψn(x)|² dx`\n\n2.  **Define the Wavefunction and Probability Density:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    The corresponding probability density is:\n    `|ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** For this problem, the quantum state is `n = 2`, the lower bound is `x1 = 0.495a`, and the upper bound is `x2 = 0.505a`. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n    `P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n4.  **Simplify and Solve:** To make the integral easier to handle, we can perform a change of variables. Let `u = x/a`, which means `dx = a du`. The integration limits change from `0.495a` and `0.505a` to `0.495` and `0.505`. The integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[0.495, 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πu) du`\n    This definite integral can be calculated accurately using numerical methods. We will use Python with the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to find the value.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval for a specific quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    n = 2\n    x1_norm = 0.495  # Lower bound of the interval (x/a)\n    x2_norm = 0.505  # Upper bound of the interval (x/a)\n\n    # The equation to solve is the integral of the probability density function.\n    # The probability density as a function of u = x/a is 2 * sin^2(n*pi*u).\n    print(f\"The probability P is the integral of 2 * sin^2({n}*pi*u) du from u={x1_norm} to u={x2_norm}.\")\n\n    # Define the integrand function\n    def probability_density(u):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n * np.pi * u))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # quad returns a tuple: (result, estimated_error)\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, x1_norm, x2_norm)\n\n    # Print the final calculated probability\n    print(f\"The calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n```\n<<<6.579708761214066e-06>>>"
