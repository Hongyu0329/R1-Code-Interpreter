    "This is a classic question in the field of point-set topology. The answer is not derived from a calculation but from a famous classification theorem. A script cannot derive this theorem, but I can use a Python script to present the known result and its components as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the mathematical objects in question: homogeneous planar continua.\n2.  Recall the classification theorem for these objects, primarily due to the work of mathematician R. H. Bing.\n3.  The theorem states that any such continuum is homeomorphic to one of a specific, finite list of topological spaces.\n4.  I will list these unique spaces (homeomorphism classes).\n5.  Finally, I will use a Python script to print this list and the total count, which answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on a known mathematical theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected set in the plane\n    # where every point \"looks\" the same topologically.
