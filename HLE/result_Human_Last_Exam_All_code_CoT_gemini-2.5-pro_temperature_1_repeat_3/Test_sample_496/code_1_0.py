def calculate_total_rank():
    """
    Calculates the total rank of the equivariant cohomology ring A in degrees <= 100.

    The Poincare series for the rank of A is given by P(t) = (t^3 + t^4 + t^6 + t^7) / (1 - t^4)^2.
    We need to sum the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of P(t) for powers up to 100.
    The expansion of 1 / (1 - t^4)^2 is sum_{j=0 to inf} (j+1)*t^(4j).
    Let C(m) be the coefficient of t^m in this expansion. C(m) = m/4 + 1 if m >= 0 and m is a multiple of 4, else 0.
    The coefficient of t^k in P(t) is a_k = C(k-3) + C(k-4) + C(k-6) + C(k-7).
    The total rank is the sum of a_k for k from 0 to 100.
    This can be calculated as S3 + S4 + S6 + S7, where Sd = sum_{k=0 to 100} C(k-d).
