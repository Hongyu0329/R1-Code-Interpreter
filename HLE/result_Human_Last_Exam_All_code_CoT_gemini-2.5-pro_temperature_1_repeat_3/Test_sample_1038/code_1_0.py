# The user wants me to select the best design strategy from a multiple-choice list.
# The problem is conceptual and does not require calculation or code execution to solve.
# The final output should be the letter corresponding to the best choice.
# Based on the detailed analysis above, Option C is the superior engineering solution.

# I will print the final answer in the requested format.
# Note: The prompt asks for code, but the task is a multiple-choice question.
# I will provide a simple python script that prints the rationale and the final answer.
