    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of differential equation:** The given equation $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables:** I will move all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation and all terms involving $t$ to the other. This gives $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate both sides:** I will integrate both sides of the separated equation. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, and the integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$. This yields the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$, where C is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition:** I will use the given initial condition, $x(0) = -8$, to solve for the constant C. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution gives $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$, which simplifies to $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n5.  **Find the particular solution:** With $C = \\frac{1}{8}$, the particular solution is $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$. Solving for $x(t)$ gives $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$. For easier calculation, this can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 8, resulting in $x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}$.\n6.  **Calculate x(1):** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that performs the final calculation and prints out each step of the evaluation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the final calculation:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The target time\nt = 1\n\n# The simplified particular solution is x(t) = 8 / (-4t^2 + 8t - 1)\n# We want to find x(1)\nnumerator = 8\ndenominator_part1 = -4 * (t**2)\ndenominator_part2 = 8 * t\ndenominator_part3 = -1\ndenominator = denominator_part1 + denominator_part2 + denominator_part3\n\n# The requested output format is to show the numbers in the final equation\nprint(f\"To find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the solution x(t) = 8 / (-4t^2 + 8t - 1).\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / (-4*({t})^2 + 8*({t}) - 1)\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / ({denominator_part1} + {denominator_part2} {denominator_part3})\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\n\n# Calculate the final result\nif denominator == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero.\", file=sys.stderr)\nelse:\n    result = numerator / denominator\n    print(f\"The final value is x(1) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
