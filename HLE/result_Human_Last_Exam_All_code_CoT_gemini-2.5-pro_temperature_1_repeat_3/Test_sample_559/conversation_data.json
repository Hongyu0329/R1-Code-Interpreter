    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will look for a special trajectory, also known as an invariant manifold, that connects equilibrium points. A common method is to guess a functional form for this trajectory and solve for its parameters.\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nA separatrix often takes the form of a simple curve. Let's hypothesize that the separatrix is a curve of the form $d = a \\cdot u^k$ for some constants $a$ and $k$. By analyzing the degrees of the polynomials in the equations, a good guess for the power is $k=2$. So, we will test for a solution of the form $d(u) = a u^2$.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1.  We will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to solve for the unknown coefficient `a`.\n2.  We define the system of ODEs and our proposed separatrix form, $d = a u^2$, using `sympy` symbols.\n3.  For this curve to be a trajectory (an invariant manifold), it must satisfy the system's dynamics. This means that if we take a point $(u, d)$ on the curve, the vector of derivatives $(u', d')$ calculated from the system must be tangent to the curve.\n4.  Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as an equation: the time derivative of our guess, $d' = \\frac{d(au^2)}{dt}$, must be equal to the expression for $d'$ from the first ODE.\n5.  Using the chain rule, we can write $\\frac{d(au^2)}{dt} = \\frac{d(au^2)}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dt}$. We can substitute the expression for $u'$ from the second ODE into this.\n6.  This leads to a polynomial equation in the variable `u`, which must hold true for all values of `u`. Therefore, the coefficients of each power of `u` in the polynomial must be zero.\n7.  Solving the equations for these coefficients will give us the value of `a`.\n8.  Finally, we will use the calculated value of `a` to print the equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the separatrix for the given system of differential equations\n    by assuming a polynomial form and solving for its coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbols and the proposed form of the separatrix.\n    # We are working in the (u, d) phase plane.\n    # d is treated as a function of u along the trajectory.\n    u, a, d = sp.symbols('u a d')\n\n    # We hypothesize that the separatrix is a curve of the form d = a * u^k.\n    # Balancing the powers in the ODEs suggests k=2 is a good candidate.\n    # So we look for a separatrix of the form d = a * u**2.\n    d_guess = a * u**2\n    print(\"Searching for a separatrix of the form: d = a * u**2\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Define the system of differential equations from the problem statement.\n    # d'(t) from the first ODE of the system.\n    d_dot_system = 2 * d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    \n    # u'(t) from the second ODE of the system.\n    u_dot_system = u**2 * (u - 1)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the condition for an invariant manifold.\n    # For a curve d(u) to be a trajectory, the flow vector (u', d') must be tangent to it.\n    # This means d'(t) must equal (d(d)/du) * u'(t).\n    \n    # First, calculate d'(t) by substituting our guess d = a*u**2 into the first ODE.\n    d_dot_on_curve = d_dot_system.subs(d, d_guess)\n\n    # Second, calculate d'(t) using the chain rule on our guess d = a*u**2,\n    # and substituting the expression for u'(t) from the second ODE.\n    d_dot_from_chain_rule = sp.diff(d_guess, u) * u_dot_system\n\n    # Step 4: The two expressions for d'(t) must be equal.\n    # Their difference must be zero for all values of u.\n    equation = sp.simplify(d_dot_on_curve - d_dot_from_chain_rule)\n\n    # Step 5: The resulting equation is a polynomial in u.
