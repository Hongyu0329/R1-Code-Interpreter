    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the correct answer, followed by the Python code to execute the logic.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** The core of the question lies in understanding the fundamental techniques of the five standard ballroom dances listed. We need to identify which dance has such a rigid and specific technique for its turns that turning more than the prescribed amount (overturning) would violate the dance's core principles.\n2.  **Analyze Dance Categories:** The five dances can be broadly categorized. The English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are \"swing\" dances. They are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, body swing, and rise and fall. The European Tango is different; it is a \"staccato\" or \"marching\" dance with no swing or rise and fall.\n3.  **Evaluate Overturning in Swing Dances:** In swing dances (options 1, 2, 4, 5 from the logic below), the momentum and continuous flow allow for flexibility in the amount of turn. A dancer can use their body swing to overturn a figure, often as a deliberate variation to change alignment or lead into a different figure. While it might be difficult, it is not considered a violation of the fundamental technique itself.\n4.  **Evaluate Overturning in Tango:** In Tango (option 3), movements are sharp, direct, and precise. Turns are executed with specific foot placements and swivels, and the movement is \"checked\" rather than flowing. A Reverse Turn in Tango has a very defined structure. Attempting to overturn it would require introducing swing and flow, which directly contradicts the staccato nature and \"no swing\" rule of the dance. Therefore, doing so is impossible without disregarding the technique.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will model this logic. It will define the characteristics of each dance and iterate through them to find the one where overturning fundamentally breaks the technique. The code will print out its analysis for each option, referencing them by number, before stating the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_dance_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the technical characteristics of five standard ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible\n    without violating the core principles of the dance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's represent the dances and their key technical properties.\n    # 1=Viennese Waltz, 2=English Waltz, 3=European Tango, 4=Slow Foxtrott, 5=Quickstep\n    dances = [\n        {'option': 'A', 'name': 'Viennese Waltz', 'has_swing': True},\n        {'option': 'B', 'name': 'English Waltz', 'has_swing': True},\n        {'option': 'C', 'name': 'European Tango', 'has_swing': False},\n        {'option': 'D', 'name': 'Slow Foxtrot', 'has_swing': True},\n        {'option': 'E', 'name': 'Quickstep', 'has_swing': True}\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the dance options based on their fundamental technique:\")\n    \n    correct_option = None\n    \n    # We use a 'for' loop and 'enumerate' to get both the index (for numbering) and the item.\n    for i, dance in enumerate(dances):\n        dance_number = i + 1 # Create a number for each option (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n--- Analyzing Option {dance_number} ({dance['option']}) ---\")\n        print(f\"Dance: {dance['name']}\")\n        \n        if dance['has_swing']:\n            print(\"Result: This is a 'swing' dance.
