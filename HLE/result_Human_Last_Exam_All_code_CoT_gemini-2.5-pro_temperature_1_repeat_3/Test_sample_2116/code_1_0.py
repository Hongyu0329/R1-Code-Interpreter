def solve_earthquake_magnitude():
    """
    Calculates the expected maximum earthquake magnitude based on the problem description.

    The derivation involves:
    1.  Defining the distributions for earthquake magnitude (Pareto) and monitoring duration (Logarithmic Series).
    2.  Using the Law of Total Expectation to set up the problem.
    3.  Calculating the expected maximum for a fixed number of years, n, which involves the Beta function.
    4.  Summing these expectations over the distribution of n.
    5.  Simplifying the resulting series by swapping summation and integration to solve a geometric series.
    6.  Evaluating the final integral to arrive at the closed-form solution.
