    # --- Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors? ---
    # The original C code has errors on 3 lines:
    # 1. The line declaring variables with `unsigned long long`, which is not a valid XVM type.
    # 2. The `scanf` line using `%d` for variables that are not of type `digit`.
    # 3. The `printf` line using `%d` for a result that is not of type `digit`.
    answer_1 = 3

    # --- Question 2: What is the total memory (in D) used for variables? ---
    # The most efficient version of the program would use three variables:
    # - n: unsigned long (12D, to hold values up to 4*10^9)
    # - m: unsigned long (12D, to hold values up to 4*10^9)
    # - a: unsigned int (6D, to hold values up to 10^6)
    # Total memory = 12D + 12D + 6D
    mem_n_long = 12
    mem_m_long = 12
    mem_a_int = 6
    answer_2 = mem_n_long + mem_m_long + mem_a_int

    # --- Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements? ---
    # Yes. The ceiling of a division (n/a) can be calculated using integer
    # arithmetic with the formula (n + a - 1) / a, avoiding an `if` statement.
    answer_3 = "Y"

    # --- Question 4: What is the expected output for m = n = 4*10^9 and a = 1? ---
    # Using the ceiling division formula:
    # number of stones = ceil(n/a) * ceil(m/a)
    n = 4 * 10**9
    m = 4 * 10**9
    a = 1
    
    # Python's integer division `//` handles large numbers correctly.
    num_flagstones_n = (n + a - 1) // a
    num_flagstones_m = (m + a - 1) // a
    
    answer_4 = num_flagstones_n * num_flagstones_m

    # --- Final Output ---
    # The problem asks for the answer in the format x:y:z:t
    # Note: The prompt has a typo "t, and z" but the logical order is x,y,z,t for questions 1,2,3,4.
    print(f"{answer_1}:{answer_2}:{answer_3}:{answer_4}")
