    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical context:** The question is about the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a specific number field, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The key is to find the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup.\n2.  **Consult known theorems:** Instead of computing from scratch, we can rely on established theorems that classify all possible torsion subgroup structures for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. Specifically, there are refined lists for the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n3.  **List the possibilities:** Based on the work of mathematicians like S. Kwon, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n4.  **Calculate the orders:** The Python script will generate these possible group structures, calculate the order for each (which is the product of the component orders), and keep track of them.\n5.  **Find the maximum:** Finally, the script will find the maximum value among the calculated orders and print the result, including the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field K = Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The approach is based on the complete classification of possible torsion\n    subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, with specific results\n    for K = Q(sqrt(-3)). According to these theorems (e.g., by S. Kwon),\n    the possible non-cyclic torsion structures are known.
