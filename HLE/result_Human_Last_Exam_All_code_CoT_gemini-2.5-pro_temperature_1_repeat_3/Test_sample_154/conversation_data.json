    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Generate all candidates:** I will generate all unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs with exactly 5 vertices. A reliable way to do this is to use the pre-computed graph atlas available in the `networkx` Python library.\n2.  **Define the property:** A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n3.  **Filter the candidates:** I will iterate through each of the 5-vertex graphs generated in step 1. For each graph, I will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. The `networkx.vertex_connectivity()` function is perfect for this; a graph `G` is 2-vertex-connected if its connectivity value is 2 or greater.\n4.  **Count the results:** I will maintain a counter, incrementing it for each graph that satisfies the 2-vertex-connected property.\n5.  **Output the final count:** The final value of the counter is the answer to the question. The Python code will compute this and print the final number.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with a specific number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    biconnected_count = 0\n\n    # The `networkx.graph_atlas_g()` function provides a list of all\n    # nonisomorphic graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    # We will filter this list to find our graphs.\n    all_small_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Iterate through all graphs in the atlas.\n    for g in all_small_graphs:\n        # We are only interested in graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n        if g.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices:\n            # A graph is k-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is >= k.\n            # We check if the graph is 2-vertex-connected.
