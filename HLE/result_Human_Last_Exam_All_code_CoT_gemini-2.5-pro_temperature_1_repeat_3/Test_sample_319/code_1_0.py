Step 1: Understanding the problem
A point x is 'special' if the direction vectors of all planes passing through x span the entire R^{d} space.
A plane in R^{d} is a 2-dimensional affine subspace. For the direction vectors to span R^{d},
the point x must lie at the intersection of at least k planes, where k*2 >= d.
In our case, d = {d}, so a special point must lie on at least {min_planes_for_span} planes.

Step 2: Finding an upper bound for c
Each plane is an affine subspace of codimension {codim_plane}, defined by {codim_plane} linear equations (hyperplanes).
N planes are thus defined by a collection of N * {codim_plane} = {codim_plane}N hyperplanes.
The special points are a subset of all possible intersection points of these hyperplanes.
The maximum number of intersection points (vertices) of M hyperplanes in R^{d} is given by the binomial coefficient (M choose d).
Here, M = {codim_plane}*N and d = {d}.
So, the number of special points is bounded by C({codim_plane}*N, {d}).

Step 3: Asymptotic behavior of the bound
For large N, the number of special points is O((({codim_plane}*N)^{d}) / d!) = O(N^{d}).
This means the number of special points is O(N^{d}).
Therefore, c must be less than or equal to {d}.

Step 4: Finding a lower bound for c
We can construct a scenario with O(N^{d}) special points.
Consider {codim_plane}*N hyperplanes in general position. Group them into N sets of {codim_plane} to define N planes.
Consider intersection points formed by selecting one hyperplane from {d} different planes.
The number of ways to choose {d} planes is C(N, {d}).
For each choice, there are {codim_plane}^{d} ways to pick one hyperplane from each.
The number of such points is C(N, {d}) * {codim_plane}^{d}, which is O(N^{d}).
These points are created by {d} planes. Since {d} >= {min_planes_for_span}, their direction vectors will generically span R^{d}.
So, these points are special. This construction gives a number of special points that is Omega(N^{d}).
Therefore, c must be greater than or equal to {d}.

Step 5: Conclusion
Since c <= {d} and c >= {d}, the largest possible value for c is {d}.
