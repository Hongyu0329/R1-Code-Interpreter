    "To determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently, we need to consult the established methods for its synthesis.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The most common method for producing XeF₄ is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases. The reaction is: `Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄`.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** The outcome of this reaction is highly dependent on the temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n    *   To produce Xenon difluoride (XeF₂), a large excess of Xenon is used at around 400 °C.\n    *   To produce **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**, a molar ratio of Xenon to Fluorine of about 1:5 is heated to **400 °C**. This temperature provides sufficient activation energy for the reaction to proceed at an efficient rate without favoring the formation of other compounds.\n    *   To produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), a large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio) and higher temperatures (around 600 °C) and pressures are required.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   Temperatures like 200 °C or lower are generally too low for the reaction to be \"efficient,\" meaning the reaction rate would be impractically slow.\n    *   A temperature of 600 °C is too high and, with excess fluorine, would favor the production of XeF₆.\n    *   Therefore, 400 °C is the standard, most widely cited temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄.\n\nThe following Python script will store this chemical knowledge and use it to identify the correct answer from the given choices.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function contains information about the synthesis of xenon fluorides\n    and identifies the correct temperature for producing XeF4 efficiently.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known synthesis conditions for xenon fluorides\n    synthesis_data = {\n        \"XeF2\": \"Formed by reacting excess Xe with F2 at 400 C.\",\n        \"XeF4\": \"Formed by reacting Xe and F2 in a 1:5 molar ratio at 400 C.\",\n        \"XeF6\": \"Formed by reacting Xe with excess F2 (~1:20 ratio) at 600 C and high pressure.\"\n    }\n\n    # The compound in question\n    target_compound = \"XeF4\"\n    \n    # Provided answer choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": 600,\n        \"B\": 400,\n        \"C\": 200,\n        \"D\": 78,\n        \"E\": 0,\n        \"F\": -78\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing synthesis conditions for {target_compound}...\")\n    \n    # Extract the required temperature from the data\n    # In a real scenario, this would involve more complex parsing,\n    # but for this problem, we know the value is 400 C.\n    optimal_temp = 400\n    \n    print(f\"The standard, efficient synthesis of {target_compound} occurs by the direct reaction of Xenon and Fluorine.\")\n    print(\"The equation is: Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\")\n    print(f\"This reaction is typically carried out at {optimal_temp} °C to ensure an efficient rate and yield.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this with the given choices:\")\n    \n    correct_choice = None\n    for key, value in choices.items():\n        print(f\"Choice {key}: {value} C\")\n        if value == optimal_temp:\n            correct_choice = key\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe temperature {optimal_temp} C matches choice {correct_choice}.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
