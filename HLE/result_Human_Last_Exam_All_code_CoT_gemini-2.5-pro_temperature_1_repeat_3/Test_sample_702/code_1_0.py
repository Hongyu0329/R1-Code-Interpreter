# Set the parameters for the sphere dimensions
p = 4

# The connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)
# is a known result in algebraic topology.
#
# Step 1: The map induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups pi_i for i <= p + q - 1.
# This is a classical result by G.W. Whitehead.
#
# Step 2: The map induces an epimorphism on the homotopy group pi_{p+q}.
# This follows from the long exact sequence of the homotopy fiber of the map.
#
# Step 3: By the definition of k-connectivity (isomorphism for i < k, epimorphism for i = k),
# the connectivity k is p + q.

connectivity = p + q
