    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question in algebraic topology, concerning the connectivity of a map related to loop spaces and smash products. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the general problem:** The map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a specific instance of a family of maps $f_{p,q}: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$. The user's case corresponds to $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n2.  **Recall the definition of connectivity:** A map $f: X \\to Y$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (a surjective map) for $i=k$.\n3.  **Analyze the map using known results:**\n    *   First, I'll determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain spaces. This tells us the range where the homotopy groups are trivial.\n    *   Next, I'll use a classical result by G. W. Whitehead about the effect of this map on the first non-trivial homotopy group. This shows that the map is an isomorphism up to dimension $p+q-1$.\n    *   Finally, by examining the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the map's fiber, I can determine if the map is an epimorphism in the next dimension, $p+q$.\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** Based on the analysis, the connectivity is found to be $p+q$. I will substitute $p=4$ and $q=6$ to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\n# Set the parameters for the sphere dimensions\np = 4\nq = 6\n\n# The connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n# is a known result in algebraic topology.\n#\n# Step 1: The map induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups pi_i for i <= p + q - 1.\n# This is a classical result by G.W. Whitehead.\n#\n# Step 2: The map induces an epimorphism on the homotopy group pi_{p+q}.\n# This follows from the long exact sequence of the homotopy fiber of the map.\n#\n# Step 3: By the definition of k-connectivity (isomorphism for i < k, epimorphism for i = k),\n# the connectivity k is p + q.\n\nconnectivity = p + q\n\n# Print the values and the final equation\nprint(f\"The problem concerns the map Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q).\")\nprint(f\"For the given map, the sphere dimensions are:\")\nprint(f\"p = {p}\")\nprint(f\"q = {q}\")\nprint(f\"The connectivity is given by the formula: p + q\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final connectivity is: {p} + {q} = {connectivity}\")\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
