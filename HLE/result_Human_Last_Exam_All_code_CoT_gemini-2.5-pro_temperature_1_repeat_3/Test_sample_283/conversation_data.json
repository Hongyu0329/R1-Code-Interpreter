    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of submatrix operations that occur during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices and then count the total number of matrix operands accessed in these operations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the HSS Multiplication:** We'll model the multiplication of two HSS matrices, `C = A * B`, as a recursive process. For a tree of depth `d`, the matrices `A` and `B` are split into `2x2` blocks. The diagonal blocks are HSS matrices of depth `d-1`, and the off-diagonal blocks are low-rank approximations.\n2.  **Establish a Recurrence Relation:** We will count the number of multiplication operations at each step of the recursion. Let `T(d)` be the total number of submatrix multiplications for a depth `d` tree. The standard block matrix multiplication formula `C_ij = Î£_k A_ik * B_kj` results in 8 products, but in the HSS case, these products are of different types (HSS-HSS, HSS-LowRank, LowRank-LowRank). We'll count them to form a recurrence relation for `T(d)`.\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence:** We'll find a closed-form solution for `T(d)` based on the recurrence and the base case `T(0) = 1` (a single multiplication of two dense matrices at the leaf level).\n4.  **Calculate Total Accesses:** Since each multiplication operation `M1 * M2` accesses two operand submatrices (`M1` and `M2`), the total number of accessed submatrices will be twice the total number of multiplication operations, i.e., `2 * T(d)`.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be created to perform these calculations for a depth of 4, showing the steps and the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices with a depth 4 tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree\n    depth = 4\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the model and recurrence relation.\n    print(\"To find the number of submatrices accessed, we first find the total number of\")\n    print(\"multiplication operations, T(d), for a tree of depth d.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe multiplication of two 2x2 HSS block matrices (A and B) involves:\")\n    print(\"C_11 = A_11*B_11 + A_12*B_21\")\n    print(\"C_12 = A_11*B_12 + A_12*B_22\")\n    print(\"C_21 = A_21*B_11 + A_22*B_21\")\n    print(\"C_22 = A_21*B_12 + A_22*B_22\")\n    print(\"\\nThis expands into the following multiplication types:\")\n    print(\"- 2 HSS-HSS multiplications (A_11*B_11, A_22*B_22), which are recursive calls.\")\n    print(\"- 6 other multiplications involving low-rank matrices (e.g., A_12*B_21).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis gives the recurrence relation: T(d) = 2 * T(d-1) + 6\")\n    print(\"The base case at the leaf level (d=0) is one dense multiplication: T(0) = 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain and use the closed-form solution.\n    print(\"The closed-form solution to this recurrence is T(d) = 7 * 2^d - 6.\")\n    print(f\"For a depth of d = {depth}:\")\n    \n    # Calculate the terms for the equation\n    c1 = 7\n    c2 = 6\n    power_of_2 = int(math.pow(2, depth))\n    \n    # Calculate the number of multiplication operations\n    num_multiplications = c1 * power_of_2 - c2\n    \n    print(f\"Number of multiplications T({depth}) = {c1} * 2^{depth} - {c2} = {c1} * {power_of_2} - {c2} = {num_multiplications}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of submatrices accessed.\n    print(\"Each multiplication operation accesses 2 operand submatrices.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is 2 * T(d).\")\n    \n    num_accesses = 2 * num_multiplications\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Accessed Submatrices = 2 * ({c1} * 2^{depth} - {c2})\")\n    print(f\"                           = 2 * ({c1} * {power_of_2} - {c2})\")\n    print(f\"                           = 2 * ({num_multiplications})\")\n    print(f\"                           = {num_accesses}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<212>>>\n```"
