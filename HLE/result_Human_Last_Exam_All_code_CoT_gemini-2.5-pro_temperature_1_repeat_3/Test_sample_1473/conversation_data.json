    "To determine the value of the integral $I=\\int_0^{\\pi}{(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})}dx$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The expression inside the integral looks complex. I will first simplify the term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ using trigonometric identities.\n2.  **Introduce a Parameter**: After simplification, the integral is still non-trivial. I will use a technique called Differentiation Under the Integral Sign (also known as Feynman's trick). This involves introducing a parameter, say 'a', into the integrand to define a new function $F(a)$.\n3.  **Differentiate and Integrate**: I will differentiate $F(a)$ with respect to 'a'. This should result in a simpler integral that can be evaluated easily.\n4.  **Solve for the Original Function**: I will then integrate the result with respect to 'a' to find the expression for $F(a)$.\n5.  **Determine the Constant of Integration**: A constant of integration 'C' will appear. I will find its value by evaluating $F(a)$ at a convenient point (e.g., a=0).\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**: Once the full expression for $F(a)$ is known, I will substitute a=1 to find the value of the original integral, $I = F(1)$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these steps symbolically and prints out the derivation along with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral I = ∫[0,π] csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)²)) dx\n    symbolically and prints the derivation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    x, a = sp.symbols('x a', real=True)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Simplify the integrand ---\n    # The term is arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2)).\n    # Let theta = arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2)).\n    # Then csc(theta) = sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2).
