    This script solves a historical riddle by identifying a play on words.

    The riddle's clues are:
    1. A shameful condition "X" for a Pope.
    2. "X" was the title of a work "written in the 1960s".

    The logic is as follows:
    - It would be shameful for a Pope, a guardian of knowledge, to be unable to read.
    - The word for this is "illiterate".
    - The riddle plays on the fact that a story titled "The Illiterate" was written by Georgy Semyonov in 1968.
    - Thus, "X" is ILLITERATE.
    """
    answer = "ILLITERATE"
    print("The riddle describes a situation where it would be shameful for the Pope to be 'X'.")
    print("The clue is that 'X' was the title of a work written in the 1960s.")
    print("The solution is the word that describes someone who cannot read, which is the title of a 1968 story.")
    print(f"\nThe word X is: {answer}")
