    "The theologian who first developed a systematic and specialized conceptual framework to account for events that appear to alter the laws of nature is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine argued that miracles, such as the virgin birth, are not \"contrary to nature,\" but rather \"contrary to what is known *of* nature.\" He proposed that God, at creation, embedded \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles\" (*rationes seminales*) into the fabric of the universe. These are latent potentialities that can be activated by God's will at a specific moment in history. Therefore, a miracle is not a violation of the natural order God created, but the unfolding of a potentiality that was part of that order from the very beginning, even if it is outside the usual, observable course of events.\n\nThis same framework can be applied to the Fall. Augustine taught that the Fall introduced corruption and decay into the natural world, altering its operations from its original, perfect state. This represents a change in the functioning of natural laws, moving from an uncorrupted to a corrupted state, a concept accommodated by his understanding of God's overarching providential plan for creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
