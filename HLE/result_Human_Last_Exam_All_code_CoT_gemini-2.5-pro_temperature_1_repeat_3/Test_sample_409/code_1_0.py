    In cohomology theory for semi-abelian categories (generalizing group cohomology):

    - H^0(B, M): This group represents the B-invariants of the module M. It deals with fixed points, not extensions or obstructions.

    - H^1(B, M): This group classifies derivations. It is related to whether an extension is a semi-direct product (a 'split' extension). It can be seen as the obstruction to an extension being split, but it does not classify the non-split extensions.

    - H^2(B, M): This group is the first one that classifies the actual extensions of an object B by a B-module M. Elements of H^2 correspond to equivalence classes of extensions. Non-zero elements represent extensions that are not semi-direct products, hence 'non-trivial extensions'. This group is also fundamentally an obstruction group; for example, the cocycle condition for elements of H^2 ensures associativity in the constructed extension.

    - H^3(B, M): This group and higher ones typically classify obstructions to more complex problems (e.g., the Eilenberg-MacLane obstruction to the group extension problem).

    Conclusion: Degree 2 is the minimal degree where the classification of non-trivial extensions is established and where fundamental obstructions naturally appear.
