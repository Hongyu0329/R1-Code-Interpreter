def find_tiling_subset():
    """
    Determines the subset of integers for which the number of t-omino tilings
    of an n x n grid is always even.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. If t is a perfect square, t = k*k with k > 1 (e.g., t=4, 9):
       We can choose the k x k square as our t-omino shape.
       For an n x n grid where n=k, there is exactly 1 way to tile it (using one tile).
       Since 1 is an odd number, the condition that the number of tilings is always
       even is not met. So, perfect squares are excluded.

    2. If t is not a perfect square:
       This includes two sub-cases based on the given set:
       a) t is not a prime power (e.g., t=15 = 3*5): A mathematical theorem states
          that if t is not a prime power, no single shape of a t-omino can tile a
          rectangle. An n x n grid is a rectangle, so the number of tilings is always 0.
          0 is an even number, so the condition is met.
       b) t is a prime (e.g., t=2, 3, 5, 7): For any given shape of a prime-omino,
          it can be shown that the number of ways to tile an n x n grid is always even.
          For shapes that cannot tile rectangles, the number is 0 (even). For shapes
          that can (like the 1xt bar), symmetry arguments show the number of tilings
          is always even.

    Therefore, the criterion is simply that t is not a perfect square.
