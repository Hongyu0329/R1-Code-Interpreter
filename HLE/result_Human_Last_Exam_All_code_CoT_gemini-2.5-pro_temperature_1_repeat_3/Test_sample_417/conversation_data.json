    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. This core possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry makes the three large substituent \"arms\" chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals for one-third of the molecule: the protons on the central core and the protons on one of the substituent arms.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The central ring has three methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2, 4, and 6. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three methyl groups are equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linker:** Each substituent is connected to the central ring by a methylene (-CH2-) linker. The three linker groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry. However, within a single -CH2- group, the two protons are diastereotopic because the group is attached to a chiral substituent. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals.\n4.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm:** We will analyze one of the `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` groups. This substituent is chiral (as indicated by `4S,7R`) and lacks any internal symmetry. This means that every proton in a unique structural position will give a distinct NMR signal. We will count the signals from:\n    *   The proton on the pyrazole ring (H-3).\n    *   The protons on the bicyclic camphor-derived skeleton: the bridgehead proton (H-4), the two CH2 groups (at C5 and C6), and the three methyl groups.\n5.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the signals from the core, the linker, and one substituent arm.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this plan, calculating the number of signals from each part and summing them to find the total.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule.\n    The calculation is based on the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.
