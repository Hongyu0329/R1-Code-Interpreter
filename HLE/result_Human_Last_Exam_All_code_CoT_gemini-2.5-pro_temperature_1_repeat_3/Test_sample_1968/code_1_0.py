The problem asks whether there exists a function $f : [\\kappa^+]^2 \\rightarrow \\kappa$ such that for every subset $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ with order type $\\kappa+1$, the cardinality of the image, $|f''[x]^2|$, is equal to $\\kappa$.

This is a question of partition calculus in set theory. The answer depends on whether the infinite cardinal $\\kappa$ is regular or singular.

1.  **If $\\kappa$ is a regular cardinal:** A result in combinatorial set theory (due to Hajnal) states that for any function $f: [\\kappa^+]^2 \\rightarrow \\kappa$, there always exists a subset $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ of order type $\\kappa+1$ such that $|f''[x]^2| < \\kappa$. In fact, one can even find such an $x$ where $|f''[x]^2| = 1$. This means that the condition required by the question can never be met for all such sets $x$. Therefore, for regular $\\kappa$, such a function cannot exist.

2.  **If $\\kappa$ is a singular cardinal:** A celebrated theorem by Saharon Shelah, a result of PCF theory, shows that the opposite is true. If $\\kappa$ is singular, then there does exist a function $f: [\\kappa^+]^2 \\rightarrow \\kappa$ such that for every subset $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ of order type $\\kappa+1$, we have $|f''[x]^2| = \\kappa$.

Combining these two points, the function described in the question exists if and only if $\\kappa$ is a singular cardinal.
