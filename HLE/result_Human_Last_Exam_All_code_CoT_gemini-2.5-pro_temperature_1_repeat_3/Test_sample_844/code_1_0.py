    This function analyzes the provided text and identifies the incorrect statement.
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The text establishes that the CA biotype is adapted to a raffinose-rich diet (found in watermelon) and the MA biotype is adapted to a sucrose-rich diet (found in cotton).
    2.  Metabolizing raffinose requires the enzyme galactosidase.
    3.  Statement A is true: CA's adaptation to a raffinose diet implies an enhanced ability to metabolize it compared to MA.
    4.  Statement B is true: The text explicitly states which diet each biotype "did well on".
    5.  Statement C is likely true: When the CA biotype moves to cotton (low raffinose), the enzyme for metabolizing raffinose (galactosidase) would likely decrease due to the lack of its specific substrate.
    6.  Statement E is likely true: Conversely, when the MA biotype moves to watermelon (high raffinose), it would likely increase galactosidase production to handle the new food source.
    7.  Statement D presents an alternative reason for the event in C. It claims the decreased enzyme activity is due to higher glucose levels, not lower raffinose levels. While possible via catabolite repression, the most direct and primary reason for a change in a specific enzyme's activity is the change in its specific substrate (raffinose for galactosidase). The prompt's focus is on the sucrose/raffinose difference, making the raffinose level the key regulator. Therefore, this statement is the least supported and most likely to be untrue.

    print(" - D. This statement suggests the decrease in galactosidase in CA biotypes is due to higher glucose, not lower raffinose. The most direct cause for a change in an enzyme's activity is the availability of its specific substrate (raffinose). Attributing it to glucose is a less direct and unsupported explanation in this context.")
