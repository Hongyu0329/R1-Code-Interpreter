# The final selected answer choice.
# This variable holds the letter corresponding to the best solution.
final_answer = "N"

# The reasoning behind the choice is based on a systematic evaluation
# of each option against the four critical cybersecurity requirements:
# 1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
# 2. An unwilling (coerced) user will NOT authenticate.
# 3. The biometric authentication remains uncompromised even if data is stolen.
# 4. The solution applies to a wide range of biometric modalities.

# Option N, the "FIPS 140-3 Level 5 Maximum Security Biometric Module", is the only
# choice that explicitly and comprehensively addresses all four requirements in its description.

# 1. Anti-Spoofing: It describes features to prevent "biometric spoofing" and "adversarial AI manipulation".
# 2. Anti-Coercion: It explicitly states "safeguarding against all known and potential threats, including coercion".
# 3. Data Security: It details robust protection for stored data through "quantum-resistant cryptography",
#    "hardware security enclaves", and "zeroization protocols", ensuring the system is not compromised
#    even if the device is stolen.
# 4. Modality-Agnostic: The description implies it works with various biometric types by mentioning
#    "revocation and reconfiguration of biometric credentials".

# While other options like Strong MFA (I) are good, option (N) describes a more
# direct, integrated, and fundamentally secure solution that best fits all the stated criteria.
