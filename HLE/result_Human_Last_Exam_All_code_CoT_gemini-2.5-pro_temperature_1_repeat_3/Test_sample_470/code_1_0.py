    Solves the given problem in block theory using established formulas.
    
    Let B be a block of FG with defect group D = (C_2)^5 and inertial quotient E
    of order 5. We compute k(B) - l(B).
    """

    # 1. Define the parameters from the problem statement.
    # The defect group D is (C_2)^5, so its size is 2^5.
    size_D = 2**5
    
    # The inertial quotient E has order 5.
    size_E = 5

    # 2. Determine properties of the E-action on D.
    # D is a 5-dimensional vector space over the field F_2 of 2 elements.
    # E is a cyclic group of order 5 acting on D. This makes D an F_2[E]-module.
    # The simple F_2[E]-modules are of dimension 1 (trivial) and 4.
    # Since D has dimension 5, it must decompose as a direct sum of a 1-dim
    # and a 4-dim simple module.
    # The fixed-point subgroup C_D(E) corresponds to the 1-dim trivial submodule.
    # Thus, the number of fixed points for any non-identity element of E is 2^1 = 2.
    num_fixed_points_for_g_neq_e = 2
    
    # The number of fixed points for the identity element e in E is the size of D.
    num_fixed_points_for_e = size_D

    # 3. Calculate l(B), the number of irreducible Brauer characters.
    # l(B) is the number of orbits of E acting on D.
    # We use Burnside's Lemma: #orbits = (1/|E|) * sum_{g in E} |D^g|.
    # D^g is the set of elements in D fixed by g.
    sum_of_fixed_points = num_fixed_points_for_e + (size_E - 1) * num_fixed_points_for_g_neq_e
    l_B = int(sum_of_fixed_points / size_E)

    # 4. Calculate k(B), the number of irreducible ordinary characters.
    # k(B) is the number of E-orbits on the set of pairs {(u, chi)}, where u is in D
    # and chi is an irreducible character of the stabilizer C_E(u).
    
    # We partition the calculation based on the stabilizer C_E(u).
    # The fixed-point subgroup C_D(E) has size num_fixed_points_for_g_neq_e.
    size_C_D_E = num_fixed_points_for_g_neq_e
    
    # Case 1: u is in C_D(E).
    # There are size_C_D_E such elements (0 and one other). Each forms its own orbit.
    # For these u, the stabilizer C_E(u) is the whole group E.
    # The number of irreducible characters of E is |E| = 5.
    # Since E is abelian, the action of E on these characters is trivial.
    # So for each u in C_D(E), we have |E| orbits of pairs.
    # Total orbits for this case:
    k_B_case1 = size_C_D_E * size_E
    
    # Case 2: u is not in C_D(E).
    # For these u, the stabilizer C_E(u) is the trivial group {1}.
    # The trivial group has only one irreducible character.
    # So for each such u, there is only one pair (u, chi).
    # The orbit of this pair corresponds directly to the orbit of u.
    # The number of orbits of elements in D is l_B.
    # The number of orbits contained within C_D(E) is size_C_D_E (each element is an orbit).
    # So, the number of orbits outside C_D(E) is l_B - size_C_D_E.
    k_B_case2 = l_B - size_C_D_E
    
    # Total k(B) is the sum of orbits from both cases.
    k_B = k_B_case1 + k_B_case2
    
    # 5. Compute the final result.
    result = k_B - l_B
    
    # Print the values and the final equation as requested.
