Thinking Process to determine the correct spectral series:

1.  **Identify the Geometry and Coordinate:** The question specifies "toroidal systems" and "poloidal dependence". In the common toroidal coordinate system (r, θ, φ), the poloidal angle 'θ' represents the short way around the torus.

2.  **Analyze the Nature of the Coordinate:** The key physical property of the poloidal angle 'θ' is that it is periodic. A rotation of 2π radians (360 degrees) in the poloidal direction returns to the same physical point. Therefore, any physical function F(θ) must be periodic, i.e., F(θ) = F(θ + 2π).

3.  **Match the Tool to the Problem:** A spectral series expansion represents a function as a sum of basis functions. The most fundamental and natural choice of basis functions for a periodic variable is the set of sines and cosines, which constitute a Fourier series.

4.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
    *   **Polynomials (Legendre, Chebyshev, etc.):** Best for non-periodic functions on a finite interval.
    *   **Spherical Harmonics:** Best for functions on a spherical surface.
    *   **Fourier Series:** Specifically designed for periodic functions. This is a perfect match for the poloidal angle.

5.  **Conclusion:** The Fourier series is the standard and most direct spectral technique adapted for the periodic dependence on the poloidal angle in toroidal systems.
