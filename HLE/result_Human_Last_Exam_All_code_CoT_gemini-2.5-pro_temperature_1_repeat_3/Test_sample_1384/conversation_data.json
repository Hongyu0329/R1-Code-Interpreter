    "My plan is to determine the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$ by calculating its base-10 representation's mantissa.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. This number is very close to zero. We can express it in scientific notation as $N = A \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le A < 10$ is the mantissa and $k$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are the first two digits of $A$.\n\nTo find the mantissa $A$, we can use the base-10 logarithm.\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(A \\times 10^k) = \\log_{10}(A) + k$.\n\nBy the definition of the mantissa, $1 \\le A < 10$, which implies $0 \\le \\log_{10}(A) < 1$.\nThis shows that $\\log_{10}(A)$ is the fractional part of $\\log_{10}(N)$, and $k$ is its integer part.\nSo, $A = 10^{\\{\\log_{10}(N)\\}}$, where $\\{x\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.\n\nLet's compute $\\log_{10}(N)$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$.\n\nLet $z = 7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$. Then $\\log_{10}(N) = -z$.\nThe fractional part of a negative number is calculated as $\\{-z\\} = 1 - \\{z\\}$, for any non-integer $z$.\nSo, the mantissa is $A = 10^{1 - \\{z\\}}$.\n\nThe value of $7^{13}$ is a large integer, so the calculation must be done with high precision to find the fractional part of $z$ accurately. I will use Python's `decimal` module for this task.\n\nThe steps in the code will be:\n1.  Set a high precision for the `decimal` calculations.\n2.  Calculate $z = 7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$.\n3.  Extract the fractional part of $z$.\n4.  Compute the mantissa $A = 10^{1 - \\{z\\}}$.\n5.  Extract and print the first two digits from the resulting mantissa $A$.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set a high precision for the calculation. 50 digits is sufficient for accuracy.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n# The number we are analyzing is N = e^(-7^13).\n# We want to find the first two non-zero digits of N. These are the first two digits\n# of its mantissa in scientific notation, A, where N = A * 10^k.\n# The mantissa A can be calculated as 10 to the power of the fractional part of log10(N).\n\n# First, we compute the exponent of N for the base e, which is -7^13.\n# The base of the logarithm is 10. The value to compute is log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e).\n# Let's define z = 7^13 * log10(e). Then log10(N) = -z.\n# The fractional part of log10(N) is {-z} = 1 - {z}, where {z} is the fractional part of z.\n\n# Calculate 7^13 using the decimal module.\npower_of_7 = decimal.Decimal(7) ** 13\n\n# Calculate log10(e), which is 1 / ln(10).\nlog10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n\n# Now, compute z = 7^13 * log10(e).\nz = power_of_7 * log10_e\n\n# Extract the fractional part of z.\nfrac_z = z % 1\n\n# The exponent for the mantissa is 1 minus the fractional part of z.\nexponent_for_mantissa = 1 - frac_z\n\n# Calculate the mantissa A = 10 ^ exponent_for_mantissa.\nmantissa = decimal.Decimal(10) ** exponent_for_mantissa\n\n# The first two non-zero digits of N are the first two digits of the mantissa.\n# We convert the mantissa to a string to easily access its digits.\n# For example, a mantissa of 6.1189... will be represented as the string \"6.1189...\".\nmantissa_str = str(mantissa)\n\n# The first digit is the first character of the string.\nfirst_digit = mantissa_str[0]\n\n# The second digit is the character at index 2, since index 1 is the decimal point.\nsecond_digit = mantissa_str[2]\n\n# The final equation for the first two non-zero digits, d1 and d2, is derived from the mantissa.\n# We print the two digits that form the answer.\nprint(f\"The first non-zero digit is: {first_digit}\")\nprint(f\"The second non-zero digit is: {second_digit}\")\n\n```\n<<<61>>>"
