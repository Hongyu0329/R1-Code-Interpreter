    Solves for |α|² based on the properties of the quantum circuit B.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1. Property 3 (B² = I) implies that the input state |ψ⟩ must also satisfy the conditions of an output state.
    2. Property 1 states that for any output state, the probability of measuring |1⟩ is the square of the probability of measuring |0⟩.
    3. For the input state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, let x = |α|². Then the probability of measuring |0⟩ is x, and the probability of measuring |1⟩ is |β|² = 1 - x.
    4. Applying Property 1 to the input state gives the relation: 1 - x = x²
    5. This can be rearranged into the quadratic equation: x² + x - 1 = 0.
    6. This script solves this equation for x, which represents |α|².
