    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will provide a Python script that solves the problem as per the request. The script will read the sum, sort the numbers, and print the rearranged sum.\n\nSecond, as the core of the task is to find the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program, I will detail the logic for such a program. The key idea is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Instead, we can process it character by character, count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4), and then print the result based on these counts.\n\nFinally, I will calculate the total memory `m` in bytes required for the variables in this optimized C program and provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input sum from a single line.\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # The numbers are separated by '+'. We can split the string\n    # to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Python's sort works lexicographically,\n    # which is correct for single-digit numbers.\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted numbers back into a single string,\n    # separated by '+'.\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nNow, let's analyze the most memory-efficient C program to solve this.\n\n**Logic:**\nThe most memory-efficient approach avoids storing the input string. We can read the input one character at a time.\n1.  Initialize four counters to zero, one for each number (1, 2, 3, 4).\n2.  Use a loop with `getchar()` to read characters from the input stream until a newline or `EOF` is encountered.\n3.  Inside the loop, if the character is '1', '2', '3', or '4', increment the corresponding counter. Ignore '+' characters.\n4.  After the loop finishes, all numbers have been counted.\n5.  Print the sorted sum. Iterate from 1 to 4. For each number, print it the number of times it was counted, followed by a '+'. A flag variable can be used to ensure '+' is only printed between numbers, not at the beginning or end.\n\n**Memory Calculation (`m`):**\nTo calculate the memory for variables, we choose the smallest standard data type that can hold the required values. Assume a standard system where `char` is 1 byte, `short` is 2 bytes, and `int` is 4 bytes.\n\n1.  **Counters (`count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`):** The input string is at most 1000 characters long, so the maximum count for any number is 501 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\"). A `short` (range up to 32,767) is sufficient.\n    *   Memory: 4 * `sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n2.  **Input Character (`c`):** The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. So, we must use an `int`.\n    *   Memory: 1 * `sizeof(int)` = 1 * 4 = 4 bytes.\n3.  **Printing Flag (`first`):** To handle the '+' signs correctly, a boolean flag is needed. A `char` can be used for this (0 for false, 1 for true).\n    *   Memory: 1 * `sizeof(char)` = 1 * 1 = 1 byte.\n4.  **Loop Counter (`i`):** A loop is needed to print the numbers. The loop will run up to the value of the counters (max ~501). A `short` is sufficient.\n    *   Memory: 1 * `sizeof(short)` = 1 * 2 = 2 bytes.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory used for variables is the sum of the above:\nm = (memory for counters) + (memory for input char) + (memory for flag) + (memory for loop counter)\nm = 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 15 bytes.\n\n<<<15>>>"
