    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of random English letters we need to draw until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** This is a classic problem in applied probability. A powerful method to solve it involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. The expected waiting time, E, can be calculated using a formula derived from this analysis (often shown with martingales).\n2.  **State the formula:** For a target sequence `S` of length `L` and an alphabet of size `N`, the expected number of trials `E` is:\n    `E = Î£ (N^k)` for all `k` from 1 to `L` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n3.  **Apply to the specific case:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is the English letters, so the size is `N = 26`.\n4.  **Find the overlaps:** I will systematically check for `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" (Yes)\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Yes)\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (Yes, the full string always counts)\n5.  **Calculate the expectation:** Based on the overlaps, the formula for the expected time `E` is:\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n6.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script that identifies these overlaps, calculates the corresponding terms (`26^k`), and sums them up to find the final answer. The script will print the components of the sum and the final result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see the sequence \"TENETENET\"\n    from a random stream of English letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    N = 26  # Size of the alphabet (English letters)\n    L = len(S)\n\n    print(f\"Target sequence: S = \\\"{S}\\\" (Length L = {L})\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size: N = {N}\")\n    print(\"\\nWe use the formula E = sum(N^k) for all k where the prefix of S of length k matches the suffix of S of length k.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinding overlaps (prefix == suffix):\")\n\n    total_expectation = 0\n    term_values = []\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    for k in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = S[:k]\n        suffix = S[L - k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  k = {k}: Prefix '{prefix}' == Suffix '{suffix}'.
