    "To solve this problem, we are looking for the largest constant `c` representing the density of a set `A` of positive integers such that the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares.\n\n### My approach is as follows:\n1.  **Reformulate the Problem:** The condition is that for a set `A ⊆ {1, ..., N}` with size `|A| ≈ cN`, for any two elements `a, a' ∈ A` (possibly `a = a'`), the sum `a + a'` is never a perfect square. We want to find the maximum possible `c`.\n\n2.  **Use Modular Arithmetic:** A powerful way to construct such a set `A` is to use modular arithmetic. We can choose a modulus `m` and a set of residues `R ⊆ {0, 1, ..., m-1}`. We then define our set `A` as all numbers `n` up to `N` such that `n mod m` is in `R`.\n    *   `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n mod m ∈ R}`\n    *   The density of this set `A` is `|A|/N ≈ |R|/m`.\n\n3.  **The Condition on `R`:** If we choose `A` this way, any sum `a + a'` will be congruent to `r_1 + r_2 (mod m)` for some `r_1, r_2 ∈ R`. To ensure `a + a'` is never a square, we can enforce a stronger condition: that `r_1 + r_2 (mod m)` is never a quadratic residue modulo `m`. Let `S_m` be the set of squares modulo `m`. The condition on `R` is:\n    *   `R + R = {r_1 + r_2 mod m | r_1, r_2 ∈ R}`\n    *   `(R + R) ∩ S_m = ∅`\n\n4.  **The Goal:** Our goal is to find the value of `c = max_{m, R} (|R|/m)` that satisfies this condition. The true value of `c` in the problem is known to be the supremum of these values.\n\n5.  **Computational Search:** I will write a Python script to search for the best modulus `m` and residue set `R`. The script will:\n    *   Iterate through different moduli `m`.\n    *   For each `m`, calculate the set of squares `S_m`.\n    *   Find the largest possible set `R` such that `(R+R) ∩ S_m = ∅`. This subproblem is equivalent to finding the maximum clique in a related graph, which I will solve with a backtracking algorithm.\n    *   Keep track of the largest ratio `|R|/m` found. This ratio represents the largest density `c` we can achieve with this method.\n\nThe script will demonstrate this process and output the best value of `c` it can find.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for the largest density c = |R|/m by testing\n    different moduli m and finding the largest possible residue set R.\n    \"\"\"\n    m_max = 40  # Search moduli up to this value\n    best_c = Fraction(0)\n    best_m = 0\n    best_R = []\n\n    print(f\"Searching for the best density c = |R|/m for m from 2 to {m_max}...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    for m in range(2, m_max + 1):\n        # 1.
