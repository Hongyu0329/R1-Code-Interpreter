    # The problem describes a compact topological space X with two main properties
    # related to the long ray R = [0, omega_1).

    # Property 1: X contains a dense copy of R.
    # This means X is a compactification of R.
    
    # Property 2: Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely
    # to a continuous function on X.
    # This is a universal mapping property.

    # These two properties together uniquely define the Stone-Čech compactification
    # of the long ray R, denoted as βR.

    # A key theorem in general topology states that for any Tychonoff space Y
    # (the long ray R is a Tychonoff space), its Stone-Čech compactification
    # is unique up to a homeomorphism that fixes Y.

    # Therefore, any space X that satisfies the given conditions must be
    # homeomorphic to the Stone-Čech compactification of R (βR).

    # Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to each other, they all belong to
    # the same homeomorphism class.

    # The question is: How many distinct homeomorphism classes are there?
    # Based on the uniqueness, there is only one.
