    Solves the mathematical problem by providing the numbers of the identities that necessarily follow from the given assumption.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Some identities are always true given the algebraic properties, regardless of the specific assumption Psi(k;l;m)=0. These are 4, 7, 8, 11, 12.
    2.  Other identities can be proven to be true by using the assumption Psi(k;l;m)=0 and its symmetries. These are 6 and 10.
    3.  The remaining identities (1, 2, 3, 5, 9) are not necessarily true, and counterexamples can be constructed.
    
    Therefore, the list of true identities is 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
