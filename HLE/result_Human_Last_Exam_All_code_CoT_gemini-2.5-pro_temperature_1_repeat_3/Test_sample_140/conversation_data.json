    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can be physically packed into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes will give an upper limit, but it doesn't guarantee the blocks will fit. A more accurate method is to use a greedy packing strategy.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We will treat this as a 3D packing problem. The strategy is to partition the 15x15x15 cube into smaller sections, fill each section as densely as possible, and sum the results.\n2.  **First Partition:** We will take a slice of the cube with dimensions 9x15x15. We can perfectly fill this section by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit edge of the slice. We'll calculate the number of blocks in this partition.\n3.  **Second Partition:** After filling the first partition, a remaining space of 6x15x15 is left. We cannot fit the 9-unit length of the block along the 6-unit edge, so we must align it with one of the 15-unit edges. We will fill a 6x9x15 section of this space and calculate the number of blocks.\n4.  **Third Partition:** This leaves a smaller 6x6x15 space. Again, we align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 15-unit edge, filling a 6x6x9 section.\n5.  **Final Step:** The remaining space will be a 6x6x6 cube, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit. The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from the three partitions.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define cube and block dimensions\n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_long = 9\n    block_short = 1\n\n    # This problem is a 3D packing problem. We use a greedy partitioning strategy.\n\n    # Step 1: Fill a 9x15x15 section of the 15x15x15 cube.\n    # The number of blocks is calculated by dividing each dimension of the section\n    # by the corresponding dimension of the block.\n    # We align the block's 9-unit length with the 9-unit edge of this section.\n    blocks_part1 = (9 // block_long) * (15 // block_short) * (15 // block_short)\n    # The remaining space is a (15-9)x15x15 = 6x15x15 cuboid.\n\n    # Step 2: Fill the remaining 6x15x15 space.\n    # We must align the block's 9-unit length with a 15-unit edge.\n    # We fill a 6x9x15 section of the remaining space.\n    blocks_part2 = (6 // block_short) * (9 // block_long) * (15 // block_short)\n    # The remaining space is now 6x(15-9)x15 = 6x6x15.\n\n    # Step 3: Fill the remaining 6x6x15 space.\n    # We align the block's 9-unit length with the 15-unit edge.\n    # We fill a 6x6x9 section.\n    blocks_part3 = (6 // block_short) * (6 // block_short) * (9 // block_long)\n    # The final remaining space is 6x6x(15-9) = 6x6x6, where no more blocks fit.\n\n    # Calculate the total number of blocks\n    total_blocks = blocks_part1 + blocks_part2 + blocks_part3\n\n    # Print the final equation showing how the total is calculated\n    print(f\"The largest number of blocks is the sum from three partitions.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {blocks_part1} + {blocks_part2} + {blocks_part3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
