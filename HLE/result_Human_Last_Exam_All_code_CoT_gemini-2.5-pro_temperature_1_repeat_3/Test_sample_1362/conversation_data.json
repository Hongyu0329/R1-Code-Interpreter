    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for all primes greater than 2, we need to analyze the discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side of each equation. A curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)` has \"good reduction\" at a prime `p` if the curve remains non-singular when its coefficients are reduced modulo `p`. This is equivalent to `p` not being a factor of the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`.\n\nTherefore, a curve has good reduction for all primes `p > 2` if the prime factors of its discriminant consist only of 2.\n\nMy plan is to use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the following steps for each option:\n1.  Define the polynomial `f(x)` from the equation `z^2 = f(x)`.\n2.  Calculate the discriminant of `f(x)`.\n3.  Find the prime factors of the absolute value of the discriminant.\n4.  Identify which discriminant has no odd prime factors.\n\nThe curve that satisfies this condition is the one with good reduction above 2. The term \"ordinary\" is a further condition, but a curve must first have good reduction. We will start by checking for good reduction.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve_reduction(label, poly_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reduction properties of a curve y^2 = f(x) by factoring its discriminant.\n    A curve has good reduction above 2 if its discriminant has no odd prime factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    try:\n        # Parse the polynomial string\n        poly = sympy.sympify(poly_str)\n\n        # The discriminant is 0 if the polynomial has repeated roots,\n        # which means the curve is singular and has bad reduction everywhere.\n        if sympy.discriminant(poly, x) == 0:\n            disc = 0\n            factors = {}\n            odd_prime_factors = \"Singular curve\"\n        else:\n            # For a non-monic polynomial p(x) = a_n*x^n + ..., the full discriminant is\n            # disc(p) = a_n^(2n-2) * disc(p/a_n).\n            # sympy.discriminant(poly) calculates disc(p/a_n).\n            n = sympy.degree(poly, x)\n            lead_coeff = poly.LC(x)\n            disc = lead_coeff**(2*n - 2) * sympy.discriminant(poly, x)\n            \n            # Find the prime factors of the discriminant\n            factors = sympy.factorint(abs(disc))\n            odd_prime_factors = sorted([p for p in factors.keys() if p != 2])\n\n        print(f\"Curve {label}: z^2 = {poly}\")\n        print(f\"  Discriminant: {disc}\")\n        if odd_prime_factors == \"Singular curve\":\n            print(f\"  Result: The curve is singular and does not have good reduction.\")\n        elif not odd_prime_factors:\n            print(f\"  Result: Good reduction above 2.
