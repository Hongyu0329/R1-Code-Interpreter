    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** First, I need to determine the product of the chemical reaction. The Favorskii rearrangement of a cyclic α-halo ketone, such as 2-chlorocyclohexanone, typically involves a ring contraction. In this case, the six-membered cyclohexanone ring rearranges to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:** The chemical formula for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is C6H10O2.\n\n3.  **Calculate Parameters for Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** The formula for Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC) is:\n    `BMC = (N_A * N_B) / (N_T - 1)`\n    I will calculate the necessary parameters from the product's formula (C6H10O2):\n    *   `N_A`: The number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `N_B`: The number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms, counting the bond order (e.g., a double bond counts as 2).\n    *   `N_T`: The total number of atoms in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   `N_A` = 6 (Carbon) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8\n    *   `N_T` = 6 (Carbon) + 10 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 18\n    *   `N_B`: We sum the bond orders between non-hydrogen atoms. The structure has a 5-membered carbon ring (5 C-C single bonds), one C-C single bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group, one C=O double bond, and one C-O single bond. So, `N_B` = 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will substitute these values into the BMC formula and compute the result using a Python script. The script will also print the final equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2).\n    \n    # N_A: Number of non-hydrogen atoms\n    num_carbon = 6\n    num_oxygen = 2\n    N_A = num_carbon + num_oxygen\n\n    # N_T: Total number of atoms\n    num_hydrogen = 10\n    N_T = num_carbon + num_oxygen + num_hydrogen\n\n    # N_B: Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (sum of bond orders).\n    # The structure has:\n    # - 5 C-C single bonds in the cyclopentane ring\n    # - 1 C-C single bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group\n    # - 1 C=O double bond\n    # - 1 C-O single bond\n    N_B = 5 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1\n\n    # Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC)\n    # BMC = (N_A * N_B) / (N_T - 1)\n    if (N_T - 1) == 0:\n        bmc_value = float('inf')\n    else:\n        bmc_value = (N_A * N_B) / (N_T - 1)\n\n    # Print the explanation, the final equation with its components, and the result.\n    print(\"The product of the reaction is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2).\")\n    print(\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC) is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"BMC = (N_A * N_B) / (N_T - 1)\\n\")\n    print(\"Where for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid:\")\n    print(f\"  N_A (non-hydrogen atoms) = {N_A}\")\n    print(f\"  N_B (bonds between non-hydrogen atoms) = {N_B}\")\n    print(f\"  N_T (total atoms) = {N_T}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"BMC = ({N_A} * {N_B}) / ({N_T} - 1)\")\n    print(f\"BMC = {N_A * N_B} / {N_T - 1}\")\n    print(f\"BMC = {bmc_value}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bottcher_complexity()\n```\n<<<4.235294117647059>>>"
