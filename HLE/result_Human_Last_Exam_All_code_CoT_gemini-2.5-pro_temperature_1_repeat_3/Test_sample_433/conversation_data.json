    "Based on pharmaceutical compounding guidelines, specifically USP Chapter <797>, the rules for handling single-dose containers vary based on the container type and the environment in which it is opened. My plan is to provide a Python script that clarifies these rules.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the user's specified container: a single-dose ampule.\n2.  Define the environment: a sterile environment (i.e., ISO Class 5 or better).\n3.  Apply the specific USP <797> guideline for an opened ampule, which states it cannot be stored and must be used immediately.\n4.  Print a clear explanation of the rule, emphasizing that an ampule cannot be resealed and any unused portion must be discarded right away. For context, the script will also show the different rule that applies to single-dose *vials*.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_container(container_type, environment):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container\n    based on USP <797> guidelines.\n\n    Args:\n        container_type (str): The type of container, e.g., \"ampule\" or \"vial\".\n        environment (str): The environment where the container is opened, e.g., \"sterile\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating BUD for a single-dose '{container_type}' opened in a '{environment}' environment.\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    if container_type.lower() == \"ampule\":\n        # An ampule is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\n        # It is considered an open system once the top is snapped off.\n        storage_time_hours = 0\n        recommendation = \"Immediate Use Only\"\n        \n        print(f\"Rule: An opened ampule cannot be stored.\")\n        print(f\"Explanation: Once an ampule is opened, it is exposed to the environment and cannot be resealed.\")\n        print(f\"Calculated Storage Time: {storage_time_hours} hours.\")\n        print(f\"Final BUD Guideline: {recommendation}.
