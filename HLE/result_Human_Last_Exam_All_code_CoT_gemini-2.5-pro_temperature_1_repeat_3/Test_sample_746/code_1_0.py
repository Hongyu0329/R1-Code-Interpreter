# The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points
# for a compact connected metric space X.
# Let D be the set of dispersion points.

# Based on the logical derivation:
# 1. It was proven by contradiction that the number of dispersion points cannot exceed 1.
# 2. An example space (the singleton space {p}) was shown to have exactly one dispersion point.

# Therefore, the maximum cardinality is 1.
# This result can be expressed with the following equation, where |D| is the
# cardinality of the set of dispersion points.

max_cardinality = 1

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
