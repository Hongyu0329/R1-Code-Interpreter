    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to jam all-in.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation**: We are in an early position (UTG+1) with a 16 big blind stack. This stack size is typically considered a \"shove or fold\" stack. The crucial factor is that we are near the money bubble, which means opponents with medium-to-large stacks will play tighter and be less willing to risk busting. This increases our \"fold equity\" (the chance our opponents fold to our all-in).\n\n2.  **Consult a Standard Shoving Range**: We will use a standard 9-handed No-Limit Hold'em shoving chart as a baseline. For 16 big blinds from UTG+1, a typical shoving range is approximately `77+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+`.\n    *   `77+` means pocket pairs of sevens or higher (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA).\n    *   `AJs+` means suited Ace-Jack or better (AJs, AQs, AKs).\n    *   `KQs` means suited King-Queen.\n    *   `AQo+` means offsuit Ace-Queen or better (AQo, AKo).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices Against the Range**:\n    *   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited)**: This hand is not in the baseline range (`KQs` is the typical cutoff for suited connectors). This is a fold.\n    *   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines)**: This hand is included in `77+`. This is a clear shove.\n    *   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit)**: This hand is not in the baseline range (`AQo+` is the cutoff). This is a fold.\n    *   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit)**: This hand is included in `AQo+`. This is a clear shove.\n\n4.  **Resolve the Ambiguity**: Both **99** and **AKo** are standard, profitable shoves in this situation. The money bubble dynamic makes them even more profitable. However, since we must choose the single best answer, we need a tie-breaker.\n    *   **Blockers**: AKo contains an Ace and a King. These cards \"block\" or reduce the number of combinations of premium hands (like AA, KK, AK, AQ) that our opponents can have, making it more likely they will fold. 99 does not have this powerful blocker effect against the top of a calling range.\n    *   **Equity When Called**: If we are called, it will likely be by a tight range of strong hands. Against a typical calling range like `TT+, AQs+, AKo`, AKo has about 43% equity, while 99 only has about 35% equity. AKo performs better when called.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: While both 99 and AKo are correct shoves, AKo is the superior hand in this spot due to its better blocker effects and higher equity against a typical calling range. It is the strongest and most robust shove among the options provided.\n\n```python\ndef find_best_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the best all-in shove.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the scenario\n    stack_bb = 16\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stage = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    print(f\"Scenario: You have {stack_bb}bb in position {position} {stage}.\")\n    print(\"This is a 'shove-or-fold' situation where we want to identify the correct hands to go all-in with.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Define a standard shoving range and evaluate the hands\n    # A standard 9-handed shoving range for 16bb from UTG+1 is roughly: 77+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+\n    print(\"Step 1: Evaluating hands based on a standard UTG+1 shoving range (77+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+):\")\n    hands = {\"A.
