    print("Step 1: Understanding Burke's distinction between Motion and Action.")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("According to Kenneth Burke:")
    print("- Motion: Refers to the non-symbolic, biological, and physical realm. It is the world of things, devoid of choice or purpose. A rock falls, cells divide; these are instances of motion.")
    print("- Action: Refers to the symbolic realm, which is uniquely human. Action involves symbols, language, choice, motive, and purpose. To act is to make a choice, which is only possible through symbols.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Understanding Burke's concept of the Negative.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The crucial bridge from motion to action is the 'Negative.'")
    print("- The Negative (the idea of 'not', 'no', prohibitions) does not exist in nature. Nature is purely positive; it only consists of what 'is'.")
    print("- The Negative is a function of language, a symbolic invention. Commandments like 'Thou shalt not...' introduce the possibility of choice (to obey or not to obey).")
    print("- Therefore, the Negative is the basis of morality, law, and purpose, making it the very essence of Action.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyzing the 'Tribal No'.")
    print("-------------------------------------")
    print("The 'Tribal No' is the set of foundational prohibitions that structure a society. It is the quintessential example of Burke's Negative.")
    print("- Since the 'Tribal No' is a system of 'nots' and 'thou-shalt-nots,' it is fundamentally a linguistic and symbolic construct.")
    print("- It does not describe a process of mere motion. Instead, it creates the conditions for moral action by defining what one *should not* do, thereby creating choice.")
    print("Conclusion: The 'Tribal No' is definitively in the realm of Action.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluating the Answer Choices.")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("Now we evaluate the 'Action' options:")
    print("A. Action; it is imaginal.")
    print("E. Action; it is rational.")
    print("\n- The justification 'it is rational' is too limited. While prohibitions can be reasoned, their power often stems from tradition, myth, or faithâ€”realms that are not purely rational.")
    print("- The justification 'it is imaginal' is a perfect fit. The 'No' has no physical counterpart in the world of motion. It must be created and sustained in the collective imagination of the culture through symbols. It is a concept that is imagined and then imposed upon reality to guide action.")
    print("\n")

    print("Final Answer Derivation:")
    print("========================")
    print("The 'Tribal No' is in the realm of Action because it is a symbolic construction based on the Negative.")
    print("The best justification is that it is imaginal, as the Negative does not exist in the physical world and must be created by the human mind.")
