# The user wants the SMILES string for the designed molecule.
# The step-by-step derivation has led to a single, unique chemical structure.
# The structure is a tricyclic cage molecule based on a Tricyclo[6.5.5]octadecane skeleton.
# The molecular formula is C12H18O6.
# It contains 1 ketone, 5 ethers, and has 0 rotatable bonds.
# The SMILES string representing this molecule has been constructed.

# The final answer is the SMILES string itself.
smiles_string = "C1COCOC2COCOC1CC(=O)COCC2"

# The user asked for the output to be printed.
# I will print the final SMILES string.
# The user also asked to show the numbers in the final equation. 
# In this case, the 'equation' is the SMILES string, which is a chemical representation, not a mathematical one.
# So I will just print the final string as requested.
