    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this task:\n1.  First, I need the full text of Anton Chekov's short story, \"The Chameleon\". I will embed this text into a Python script.\n2.  The key to this task is understanding that \"description\" refers not just to the coat's appearance but also to the actions of Otchumyelov taking it off and putting it on. These actions symbolize his shifting opinions and mentality.\n3.  I will identify the distinct phrases Chekov uses to describe these moments. There are five key phrases, with one being repeated.\n4.  The Python script will count the occurrences of each of these specific phrases within the story's text.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the counts for each phrase, show them being added together in an equation, and output the total sum, which represents the number of times the coat was described or used symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is\n    described or used symbolically in Anton Chekov's \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov\n    text = \"\"\"\n    The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new\n    greatcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him with\n    a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul\n    in the square.... The greedy maws of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world\n    disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there are not even any beggars near them.\n    \"So you're to bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go!\n    Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! Ah... ah!\"\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees\n    a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man\n    in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her,\n    and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of\n    a dog yelping and the shout \"Don't let go!\" are heard once more. Sleepy countenances are\n    protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth,\n    is gathered round the timber-yard.\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour...\" says the policeman.\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the\n    timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On\n    his half-drunken face there is a look of terror, as though he were saying: \"I'll pay you out!\"\n    and the finger itself has the look of a flag of victory. In this man Otchumyelov recognises\n    Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy, with\n    a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws\n    outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery\n    and terror in her tearful eyes.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you\n    here for? Why are you waving your finger... ? Who was it that shouted?\"\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour...\" Hryukin begins,\n    coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood with Mistry, when this low brute, for no\n    rhyme or reason, bit my finger.... You must excuse me, I am a working man.... Mine is a fine\n    business. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, maybe....\n    It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast.... If everyone\n    is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living....\"\n    \"H'm. Very good,\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. \"Very good.\n    Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place!\n    It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined,\n    the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a\n    lesson! Yeldyrin,\" cries the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this\n    is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad....\n    Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm. Take my coat off, Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's frightfully hot!\n    It must be a sign of rain.... There is one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\"\n    Otchumyelov turns to Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you\n    are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea\n    struck you to get damages for it. I know you people! Devils!\"\n    \"He put a cigarette in her face, your honour, for a joke, and she snapped at him.... He is a\n    senseless fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"That's a lie! I didn't see him. You are lying!\"\n    \"It's not a lie, your honour, it is the truth....\"\n    \"Hold your tongue!\"\n    \"The general's cook, I hear, is in the crowd.\"\n    \"Prohor,\" shouts the superintendent, \"come here, my dear man. Look at this dog. Is it one of\n    yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We have never had a dog like that in our yard.\"\n    \"Are you sure?\" says Otchumyelov.\n    \"I am sure.\"\n    \"I know it myself. The general's dogs are expensive, thoroughbred animals; and this is goodness\n    knows what! No coat, no shape.... A low creature. And to keep a dog like that!... where's your\n    sense? If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would\n    happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You've\n    been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop.... We must give them a lesson! It is\n    high time....\"\n    \"Yet maybe it is the general's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its\n    face.... I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the general's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm.... Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov. \"There's a wind getting up....\n    I am cold.... You take it to the general's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And\n    tell them not to let it out into the street.... It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine\n    goes sticking a cigarette in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal....\n    And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own stupid fault!...\"\n    \"Here comes the general's cook. Let's ask him.... Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear fellow!\"\n    \"Is that the general's dog?\"\n    \"I wonder! We've never had one like that.\"\n    \"There's no need to ask,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time\n    talking about it.... Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is.... It must be destroyed,\n    that's all about it.\"\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It belongs to the general's brother, who came the other\n    day. Our master does not care for borzoys. His brother does.\"\n    \"Do you mean to say the general's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" cries Otchumyelov,\n    and his whole face is lighted up with a smile of ecstatic tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I\n    didn't know! Has he come on a visit?\"\n    \"Yes.\"\n    \"Well, I never.... He couldn't stay away from his brother.... And there I didn't know! So this is\n    his dog? Delighted to hear it.... Take it. It's not a bad pup.... A lively creature... . Snapped at\n    this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha.... Come, why are you shivering? Rrr... Rrr.... The rogue's angry....\n    a nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you smart yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat,\n    he goes on his way across the square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phrases to search for.
