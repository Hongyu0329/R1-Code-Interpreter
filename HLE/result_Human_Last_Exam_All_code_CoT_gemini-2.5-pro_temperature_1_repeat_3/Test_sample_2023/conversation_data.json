    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a,b,c)`:** The recursive definition `f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)` with the base case `f(0,0,0)=1` implies that `f(a,b,c)` counts the number of ways to reach `(0,0,0)` from `(a,b,c)` using steps of `(-1,0,0)`, `(0,-2,0)`, and `(0,0,-3)`. This is a path-counting problem, and its solution is given by the multinomial coefficient `(n1+n2+n3)! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)`, where `n1`, `n2`, `n3` are the number of steps of each type. For this to be well-defined, we must have `a = n1`, `b = 2*n2`, and `c = 3*n3`. This means `f(a,b,c)` is non-zero only if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3. In that case, `f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the arguments `alpha_p`, `beta_p`, `gamma_p`:** We need to evaluate `f` at these large values, modulo `p`. First, we check the conditions for `f` to be non-zero. `beta_p` is a sum of terms which are all multiples of 4, so it's even. `gamma_p` is a sum of terms which are all multiples of 3, so it's a multiple of 3. The conditions hold.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem:** To compute the multinomial coefficient modulo a prime `p`, we use Lucas's Theorem. This requires representing the arguments `K1 = alpha_p`, `K2 = beta_p/2`, `K3 = gamma_p/3` and their sum `N = K1+K2+K3` in base `p`. The given sums for `alpha_p`, `beta_p`, `gamma_p` are essentially their base-`p` expansions.\n\n4.  **Determine the Base-`p` Digits:**\n    *   The digits of `K1 = alpha_p` are `(1, 3, 4)` repeating for powers `p^j` where `j mod 3` is `0, 1, 2` respectively.\n    *   The digits of `K2 = beta_p/2` are `(4, 2, 2)` repeating.\n    *   The digits of `K3 = gamma_p/3` are `(1, 3, 4)` repeating.\n    *   The digits of `N = K1+K2+K3` are the sum of the digits of `K1, K2, K3` (since there are no carries as `p` is very large): `(1+4+1, 3+2+3, 4+2+4) = (6, 8, 10)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Product of Local Coefficients:** According to Lucas's Theorem, `f(...) mod p` is the product of local multinomial coefficients `C(N_j; d_{1,j}, d_{2,j}, d_{3,j})` over all powers `j`.\n    *   For `j mod 3 = 0`: `C(6; 1, 4, 1) = 30`.\n    *   For `j mod 3 = 1`: `C(8; 3, 2, 3) = 560`.\n    *   For `j mod 3 = 2`: `C(10; 4, 2, 4) = 3150`.\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** The number of times each of these coefficients appears in the product is `(3p+1)/2`. So the result is `(30 * 560 * 3150)^((3p+1)/2) mod p`.\n\n7.  **Use Fermat's Little Theorem:** Let `X = 30 * 560 * 3150`. The exponent is `(3p+1)/2 = 3(p-1)/2 + 2`. The expression becomes `X^(3(p-1)/2 + 2) = (X^((p-1)/2))^3 * X^2 mod p`. The term `X^((p-1)/2)` is the Legendre symbol `(X/p)`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Legendre Symbol:** We find that `X` can be written as `(some integer)^2 * 3`. Thus, `(X/p) = (3/p)`. For the Mersenne prime `p = 2^127 - 1`, we have `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)` and `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)`. By the law of quadratic reciprocity, `(3/p) = -1`.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The expression simplifies to `(-1)^3 * X^2 = -X^2 mod p`. The final step is to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p\n    based on the step-by-step plan.\n    \"\"\"\n    # p is the Mersenne prime 2^127 - 1\n    p = 2**127 - 1\n\n    # As derived from Lucas's Theorem, the result depends on the product of\n    # three multinomial coefficients.\n\n    # C0 = C(6; 1, 4, 1) = 6! / (1! * 4! * 1!)\n    C0 = 30\n\n    # C1 = C(8; 3, 2, 3) = 8! / (3! * 2! * 3!)\n    C1 = math.factorial(8) // (math.factorial(3) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(3))\n\n    # C2 = C(10; 4, 2, 4) = 10! / (4! * 2! * 4!)\n    C2 = math.factorial(10) // (math.factorial(4) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(4))\n\n    # The base of the exponentiation is the product of these coefficients\n    X = C0 * C1 * C2\n\n    # The final result is -X^2 mod p\n    # pow(X, 2, p) computes (X^2) % p efficiently.\n    # The outer % p ensures the result is a positive integer in [0, p-1].\n    final_result = (-pow(X, 2, p)) % p\n\n    # Per the instruction, output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final computation is f(...) mod p = - (C0 * C1 * C2)^2 mod p\n    print(f\"The calculation simplifies to -(C0 * C1 * C2)^2 mod p\")\n    print(f\"C0 = {C0}\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {C1}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {C2}\")\n    print(f\"p = {p}\")\n    print(f\"f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p = -({C0} * {C1} * {C2})^2 mod {p}\")\n    print(f\"f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p = {final_result}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<170141183460469231731687303435831465727>>>"
