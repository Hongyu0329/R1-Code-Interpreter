    "I will first research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda to identify a significant feature that was removed around the year 1950 by the city administration. My findings point to the removal of the tram line. For decades, a tram line with its tracks and overhead electrical cables ran directly through the historic square, which was a significant and visually disruptive element. Its removal in the post-war period was part of a broader effort to modernize the city's transport and preserve the aesthetic integrity of its historical landmarks.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_history_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the historical puzzle about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n  \"\"\"\n  location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n  year_removed = 1950\n  removed_feature = \"the tram line, including its tracks and overhead electrical wires\"\n\n  print(f\"The unique feature removed from the {location} around the year {year_removed} was {removed_feature}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  solve_history_puzzle()\n```\n<<<The tram line>>>"
