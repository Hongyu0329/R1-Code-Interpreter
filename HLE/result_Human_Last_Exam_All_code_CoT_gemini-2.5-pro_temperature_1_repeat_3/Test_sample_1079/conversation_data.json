    "To solve this problem, we will use the theory of regular elements in finite reflection groups. The question asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify Group Parameters**: The reflection group is of type H3. Its order, denoted as `|W|`, is 120. The problem specifies an eigenvalue of order `d = 10`, which is the Coxeter number for H3.\n2.  **Identify Relevant Eigenvalues**: An eigenvalue of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity. The number of such roots is given by Euler's totient function, `phi(10)`.\n3.  **Apply Springer's Theorem**: According to a theorem by T. A. Springer, for any primitive `d`-th root of unity `λ`, the number of elements in the group `W` that have `λ` as a regular eigenvalue is given by `|W| / d`.\n4.  **Group Eigenvalues by Conjugate Pairs**: Since the group elements represent real linear transformations, any non-real eigenvalues must occur in complex conjugate pairs. An element `w` having eigenvalue `λ` will also have `λ_bar` as an eigenvalue. The primitive 10th roots of unity can be grouped into `phi(10) / 2` such pairs.\n5.  **Ensure Disjoint Sets**: The sets of elements corresponding to different conjugate pairs are disjoint. This is because a 3x3 matrix (for the 3-dimensional representation of H3) cannot have eigenvalues from two different pairs simultaneously, as it would require more than 3 distinct eigenvalues.\n6.  **Calculate the Total Count**: The total number of elements is found by multiplying the number of disjoint sets (the number of conjugate pairs) by the number of elements associated with each set (as calculated from Springer's theorem).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n), which counts the positive integers\n    up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for the reflection group H3.\n    # The order of the group, |W|.\n    W_order = 120\n    # The required order of the eigenvalue, d.\n    d = 10\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group\")\n    print(\"that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step solution based on group theory:\")\n    print(f\"1.
