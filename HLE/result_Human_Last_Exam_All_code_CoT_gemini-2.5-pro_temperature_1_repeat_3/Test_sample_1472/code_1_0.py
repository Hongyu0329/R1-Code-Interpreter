def get_point_group():
    """
    Determines and prints the most likely symmetry point group for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper.

    The molecule is assumed to be square planar, which is common for Cu(II) complexes
    of this type. The two bidentate ligands (2,5-dithiahexane) form five-membered
    chelate rings (Cu-S-C-C-S). These rings are puckered.

    The most stable isomer is typically the 'meso' form, where one ring has a
    delta (δ) pucker and the other has a lambda (λ) pucker. This arrangement
    results in a center of symmetry (inversion center, i) at the Cu atom.

    A molecule possessing only the identity (E) and an inversion center (i)
    belongs to the Ci point group.
