# Step 1: Determine the incremental change in the chromatic number (delta_soviet).
# The graph of Asian countries is a planar graph. By the Four-Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# Before the dissolution, the complex map of Asia is assumed to have a chromatic number of 4.
chromatic_number_before = 4
# After the dissolution, the graph remained planar and its complexity did not decrease, so the chromatic number remains 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
# The incremental change is the difference between the chromatic number after and before.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before

# Step 2: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed (beta).
# A political map is an inherently planar graph. Splitting one country (node) into several preserves planarity.
# Since the planarity of the graph did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
# The final result is beta multiplied by delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet

# Output the components of the final equation as requested.
