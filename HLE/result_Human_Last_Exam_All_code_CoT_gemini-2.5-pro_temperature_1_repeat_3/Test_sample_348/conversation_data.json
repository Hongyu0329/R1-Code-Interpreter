    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Market Equilibrium:** The first step is to find the equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. This is achieved by setting the supply function equal to the demand function: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Since this equation is complex to solve analytically, a numerical method will be used to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`). The corresponding equilibrium price (`P_E`) is then found by substituting `Q_E` back into either function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus represents the total benefit to consumers. It is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line, from Q=0 to Q=`Q_E`. The formula is:\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus represents the total benefit to producers. It is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integration for producer surplus starts from this minimum quantity. The formula is:\n    `PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus (`Total Welfare = CS + PS`). This represents the total economic surplus generated in the market.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan using the `scipy` library for numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    It first finds the market equilibrium, then calculates consumer and producer surplus,\n    and finally sums them to find the total welfare.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
