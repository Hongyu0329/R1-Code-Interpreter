# Step 1: Define the properties of the object in question.
# The "outer-hull" of a great icosahedron is its convex hull.
# The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as a regular icosahedron.
# Therefore, the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.

# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.
# Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle.

# Step 3: The question asks for the number of triangles required to triangulate
# this outer-hull. Since the hull's faces are already triangles, the minimal
# number is simply the number of faces.
number_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20

# Step 4: Print the final equation, which is the number of triangles.
print("The minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.")
print(f"Number of visible triangles = {number_of_faces_on_icosahedron}")
