    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the great icosahedron and its \"outer-hull\".\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its \"outer-hull\" (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that encloses all its vertices. The vertices of the great icosahedron are arranged identically to those of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the faces of the outer-hull:** A regular icosahedron is a platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n3.  **Determine the triangulation:** The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\". Since the faces of the regular icosahedron are already triangles, no further triangulation is needed. The triangulation is simply the set of its 20 faces.\n4.  **Count the visible triangles:** The \"visible triangles from the outside\" are the faces of this outer-hull.\n5.  **Final Count:** The number of faces on a regular icosahedron is 20. Therefore, the minimal number of visible triangles is 20.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this fact and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the object in question.\n# The \"outer-hull\" of a great icosahedron is its convex hull.\n# The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as a regular icosahedron.\n# Therefore, the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\n# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n# Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle.\n\n# Step 3: The question asks for the number of triangles required to triangulate\n# this outer-hull. Since the hull's faces are already triangles, the minimal\n# number is simply the number of faces.\nnumber_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation, which is the number of triangles.\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"Number of visible triangles = {number_of_faces_on_icosahedron}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
