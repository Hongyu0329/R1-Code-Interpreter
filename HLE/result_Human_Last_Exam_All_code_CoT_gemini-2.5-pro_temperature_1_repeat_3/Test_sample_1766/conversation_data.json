    "In this quantum mechanics problem, we are tasked with finding the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and its z-component, $J_z$, for a p-electron.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** A \"p-electron\" has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1` and a spin quantum number `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number `j` results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps. For `l=1` and `s=1/2`, `j` can be `1/2` or `3/2`.\n3.  **Find Eigenvalues of J²:** The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula `j(j + 1)ħ²`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We will calculate this for each possible `j` value.\n4.  **Find Eigenvalues of Jz:** For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take `2j + 1` values, from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by `m_j ħ`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to perform these calculations and print the results clearly. The `fractions` module will be used to handle the fractional quantum numbers accurately and display the final eigenvalues as fractions.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints the final eigenvalue equations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The eigenvalues are expressed in terms of ħ (hbar).\n    \"\"\"\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for a p-electron\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, the quantum numbers are l={l} and s={s}.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum J is the sum of orbital (L) and spin (S) angular momentum.\")\n    print(\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, range from |l-s| to l+s.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Calculate the possible values for j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = [Fraction(j) for j in np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)]\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n\n        # Calculate and display the eigenvalue of J^2\n        j_plus_1 = j + 1\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * j_plus_1\n        print(f\"  - The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ² = {j} * ({j} + 1)ħ² = {j} * {j_plus_1}ħ² = {j_squared_eigenvalue}ħ²\")\n\n        # Calculate the possible values for m_j\n        m_j_values = [Fraction(m) for m in np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)]\n\n        print(f\"  - The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z, given by m_j*ħ, are:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # Display the eigenvalue of J_z\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {m_j:>4}, the eigenvalue is {m_j}ħ\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n<<<For j = 3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is 15/4*ħ² and the J_z eigenvalues are 3/2*ħ, 1/2*ħ, -1/2*ħ, -3/2*ħ.
