    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we need to analyze the packing of its hydrophobic core residues. Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, called a heptad, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. The size and shape of these core residues dictate the number of helices that can pack together efficiently.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Register:** First, I will determine the most likely heptad `(abcdefg)` register by identifying the repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues in the sequence.\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** Once the register is set, I will extract the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' core positions.\n3.  **Analyze Packing Efficiency:** I will analyze the extracted core residues based on established principles of coiled-coil stability:\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices):** Tolerate a mix of residue sizes at 'a' and 'd' positions. A classic motif is Leucine (L) at 'a' and Isoleucine (I) at 'd'.\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices):** The core is tighter. They typically require small residues (like Alanine, A) at the more buried 'd' positions and can accommodate larger residues (like L or I) at the 'a' positions.\n    *   **Tetramers (4 helices):** The core is even tighter, also favoring small residues at 'd' and larger ones at 'a'.\n4.  **Evaluate the Impact of Specific Residues:** I will pay special attention to the very bulky Tryptophan (W) residue, as its location in the core is a strong determinant of the oligomeric state. A bulky residue at a 'd' position is highly destabilizing for trimers and tetramers.\n5.  **Conclude the Oligomeric State:** Based on the analysis, I will conclude the most likely number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the Heptad Register\n    # The key to coiled-coils is the (abcdefg)n heptad repeat.\n    # We must find the register that places hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    # A visual inspection of the sequence G-E-I-A-Q-S-L-K-E-I-A-K-S-L-K-E-I-A-W-S-L-K-E-I-A-Q-S-L-K-G\n    # reveals a repeating pattern of large hydrophobic residues (I, L, W).\n    # A register starting with L at the first 'a' position (index 6) and I at the first 'd' position (index 2)\n    # aligns the hydrophobic residues correctly.\n    # Register:  b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a\n    # Sequence: G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G\n\n    a_indices = [6, 13, 20, 27]\n    d_indices = [2, 9, 16, 23]\n\n    a_residues = [sequence[i] for i in a_indices]\n    d_residues = [sequence[i] for i in d_indices]\n\n    print(\"Step 1 & 2: Identify Heptad Register and Extract Core Residues\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The most likely heptad register places L/I/W residues in the core.\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'a' positions: {a_residues}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'd' positions: {d_residues}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze Packing Efficiency and Impact of Specific Residues\n    print(\"Step 3 & 4: Analyze Packing Efficiency\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We will evaluate the likely oligomeric state based on the size of the core residues.\")\n    \n    # Dimer Analysis\n    print(\"\\n*   Analysis for Dimer (2 helices):\")\n    print(\"    - Dimer cores are flexible and can accommodate various hydrophobic residues.\")\n    print(\"    - The pattern of Leucine (L) at 'a' and Isoleucine (I) at 'd' is a hallmark of dimeric coiled-coils.\")\n    print(f\"    - Our sequence predominantly features L at 'a' ({a_residues}) and I at 'd' ({d_residues}).
