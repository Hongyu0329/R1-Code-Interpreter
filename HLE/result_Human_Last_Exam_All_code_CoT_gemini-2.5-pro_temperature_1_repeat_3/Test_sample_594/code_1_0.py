    print("\n[A] Higher heating rates to isothermal holds resulting in lower sintered densities.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY. A faster heating rate provides less time for gas to escape before surface pores close, trapping the gas. This trapped gas then expands and opposes densification, leading to lower final density.")

    print("\n[B] De-densification when sintering under some atmospheres, but not others.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY. The composition of the sintering atmosphere can influence the chemical reaction that produces the gas and also affect the gas's ability to diffuse out of the part.")

    print("\n[C] Large, randomly distributed voids in the sintered part.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY. This is a classic effect known as 'bloating.' Trapped gas pressure resists pore shrinkage and can cause pores to grow, resulting in large voids.")

    print("\n[D] Larger grain sizes in the interior of the part than near the part's surface.")
    print("Analysis: UNLIKELY. Gas trapped in the interior creates stable pores. Pores act as physical barriers that pin grain boundaries and *inhibit* grain growth. Near the surface, gas can escape, pores can shrink, and grains can grow more freely. Therefore, one would expect *smaller* grains in the interior and larger grains near the surface. This statement describes the opposite.")

    print("\n[E] Cracking.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY. If the internal gas pressure becomes extremely high, it can exceed the mechanical strength of the partially sintered part, leading to cracking.")

    print("\n[F] Higher green densities resulting in lower sintered densities when parts are sintered under the same heating schedules.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY. Higher initial (green) density means smaller, more tortuous pore channels. These channels can close off earlier in the heating process, trapping gas more effectively and leading to a lower final sintered density compared to a part with a lower green density where gas could escape.")

    print("\nConclusion: The effect described in option D is contrary to the established phenomenon of pore pinning of grain boundaries.")
