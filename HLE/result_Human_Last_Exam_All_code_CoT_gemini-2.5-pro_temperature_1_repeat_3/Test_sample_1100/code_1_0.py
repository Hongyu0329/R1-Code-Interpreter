    # Step 1: Initial Diagnosis and Treatment
    print("1. Initial Condition: The patient's symptoms (progressing false beliefs, visions, poverty of speech) for 8 years are characteristic of Schizophrenia. The monthly injection is likely a long-acting antipsychotic medication.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: The Second Drug
    print("2. The Second Drug: Antipsychotics often block dopamine receptors. A key side effect is elevated prolactin levels. The compound for 'novelty-seeking' is dopamine. Therefore, the second drug was likely a dopamine agonist, given to lower prolactin levels and counter side effects.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Postpartum Symptoms and New Diagnosis
    print("3. Postpartum Complications: The combination of intense headaches during delivery, fatigue, chills (cold intolerance), and loss of pubic hair after giving birth are classic signs of Hypopituitarism (an underactive pituitary gland). This was likely caused by Sheehan's Syndrome (pituitary damage from blood loss during childbirth) or bleeding into a pre-existing pituitary tumor.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: The Underlying Hormonal Problem
    print("4. The Hormonal Imbalance: The damaged pituitary gland cannot produce enough hormones. The patient's symptoms are caused by:")
    print("   - Low TSH -> Hypothyroidism (causing fatigue and chills).")
    print("   - Low LH/FSH -> Hypogonadism (causing loss of pubic hair).")
    print("   - Low ACTH -> Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency (causing severe fatigue and salt wasting).")
    print("\n")
    
    # Step 5: The Importance of the "Bean Salad" Diet
    print("5. The Importance of the New Food:")
    print("The most critical consequence of the pituitary damage is adrenal insufficiency. This condition causes the body to lose sodium through the urine, leading to a life-threatening drop in blood sodium levels.")
    print("A classic sign of adrenal insufficiency is an intense craving for SALT.")
    print("A bean salad is a savory dish that is typically high in salt.")
    print("\n")

    print("Therefore, the importance of the new food is that the craving for something that 'tastes like bean salad' is actually a desperate physiological craving for salt. This salt craving is a key clinical symptom pointing directly to the patient's underlying diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, a component of her newly acquired hypopituitarism.")
