    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the shape of the curve and then determine its bounding box.\n\n**1. Analyzing the Curve:**\nThe curve is defined parametrically by `x = cos(t)` and `y = b * sin(t)`. The value of `b` depends on the interval of `t`.\n\n*   **For `t` in `[0, π]`:**\n    *   `b = 1`, so the equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`.\n    *   This is the standard parameterization for the upper half of a unit circle (radius 1, centered at the origin).\n    *   In this interval, `x` ranges from `cos(0) = 1` to `cos(π) = -1`. So, `x ∈ [-1, 1]`.\n    *   `y` ranges from `sin(0) = 0` to `sin(π/2) = 1` and back to `sin(π) = 0`. So, `y ∈ [0, 1]`.\n\n*   **For `t` in `(π, 2π)`:**\n    *   `b = 5`, so the equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5 * sin(t)`.\n    *   This corresponds to the equation `x² + (y/5)² = 1`, which is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 and a semi-major axis of 5. Since `t` is in `(π, 2π)`, `sin(t)` is negative, so this describes the lower half of the ellipse.\n    *   In this interval, `x` ranges from `cos(π) = -1` to `cos(2π) = 1`. So, `x ∈ (-1, 1)`.\n    *   `y` ranges from `5 * sin(π)` (approaching 0) down to `5 * sin(3π/2) = -5` and back to `5 * sin(2π)` (approaching 0). So, `y ∈ [-5, 0)`.\n\n**2. Determining the Bounding Box:**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y`.\n\n*   **x-range:** Combining both intervals, the range of `x` is `[-1, 1]`. The width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   **y-range:** Combining both intervals, the range of `y` is `[-5, 1]`. The height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**3. Finding the Smallest Enclosing Square:**\nThe figure fits within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   Side length `s = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area:**\nThe area of this square is `side * side`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this area.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# For t in [0, 2*pi], x = cos(t) ranges from -1 to 1.\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For t in [0, pi], y = 1*sin(t) ranges from 0 to 1.\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t) ranges from -5 to 0.\n# The total range for y is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# The side of the smallest outcircling square is the maximum of the width and height\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length * side_length\n\nprint(f\"The range of x is [{x_min}, {x_max}], so the width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The range of y is [{y_min}, {y_max}], so the height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side of the smallest square is the maximum of the width and height: max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\nprint(\"The area of the square is side * side.\")\nprint(f\"Final calculation: {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
