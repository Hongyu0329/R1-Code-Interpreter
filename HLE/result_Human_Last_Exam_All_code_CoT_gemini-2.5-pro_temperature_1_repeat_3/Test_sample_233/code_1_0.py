# The user wants to find the smallest positive integer g, which is the genus of a closed surface Sigma'
# that contains any given surface Sigma.
#
# Let's break down the problem based on the properties of surfaces.

# 1. Define the given quantities.
# The surface Sigma has a genus of 10.
genus_Sigma = 10
# The surface Sigma has 1 boundary component.

# 2. Relate the genera of the surfaces.
# The final closed surface Sigma' is formed by taking Sigma and attaching another surface, F,
# along their common boundary. F "caps off" the hole in Sigma.
# The formula for the genus of such a combined surface is:
# g(Sigma') = g(Sigma) + g(F)
# Here g(Sigma) is the genus of our surface, and g(F) is the genus of the capping surface.
# This g(F) is also known as the "capping genus" or "exterior genus" of Sigma.

# 3. Find the constraint on the answer.
# The question asks for the smallest integer g that works for ALL possible surfaces Sigma
# (with genus 10 and 1 unknotted boundary). This means we need to find the maximum possible
# value that g(F) can take, for any given Sigma. Let's call this max_g_F.
# The answer 'g' will then be: g = genus_Sigma + max_g_F

# 4. Determine the maximum capping genus (max_g_F).
# A theorem in low-dimensional topology (by C. Livingston) states that the capping genus of an
# embedded surface S is less than or equal to the genus of the surface S itself.
# So, for our surface Sigma: g(F) <= g(Sigma).
# This means the maximum possible capping genus is bounded by the genus of Sigma.
max_g_F_upper_bound = genus_Sigma

# It is also known that this bound is tight. We can construct a surface Sigma of genus 10
# for which the minimum capping genus is exactly 10.
# This can be visualized by imagining the 10 handles of Sigma are embedded in such a way
# that each one "links" the boundary. Each such link forces any capping surface to have at
# least one handle to go around the obstruction. By making the 10 handles create 10
# independent obstructions, we force the capping genus to be 10.
#
# Therefore, the maximum possible capping genus is 10.
max_g_F = 10

# 5. Calculate the final answer.
# The smallest integer g that will work for any surface Sigma is the one that can accommodate the
# worst-case scenario (the one with the largest capping genus).
g = genus_Sigma + max_g_F

# Print the final calculation as requested.
print("The final genus g is the sum of the genus of the surface Σ and the maximum possible genus of the capping surface F.")
print(f"g = g(Σ) + g_max(F)")
print(f"g = {genus_Sigma} + {max_g_F} = {g}")
