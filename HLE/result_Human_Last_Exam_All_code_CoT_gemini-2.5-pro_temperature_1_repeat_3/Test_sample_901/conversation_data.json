    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination is characteristic of an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry and Conformation**: The (1S, 2R) configuration indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. For a cyclohexane, the most stable conformation places the largest groups in the equatorial position. Bromine is bulkier than a methyl group. However, let's analyze the required (1S, 2R) stereoisomer. The more stable chair conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has the bromine atom in the equatorial position and the methyl group in the axial position.\n\n3.  **Apply E2 Mechanism Rules**: The E2 mechanism requires an *anti-periplanar* geometry between the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon). In a chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in axial positions (trans-diaxial).\n\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation**: The stable conformation with an equatorial bromine is unreactive for E2 elimination. For the reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane ring must undergo a chair flip to a less stable conformation where the bromine becomes axial and the methyl group becomes equatorial. Although this conformation is less favored at equilibrium, it is the one that undergoes the elimination reaction.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Products (Regioselectivity)**: In the reactive conformation (axial Br, equatorial CH₃), we look for axial beta-hydrogens that can be removed by the base.\n    *   **Path A (Zaitsev product)**: The hydrogen on Carbon-2 is axial and thus anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (thermodynamically more stable) Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Path B (Hofmann product)**: The hydrogen on Carbon-6 is also axial and anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (thermodynamically less stable) Hofmann product.\n\n6.  **Determine the Major Product**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a very bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it preferentially attacks the most sterically accessible proton. The proton on C6 (part of a CH₂ group) is much more accessible than the proton on C2 (next to the equatorial methyl group). Therefore, the bulky base will favor Path B.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the major product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n    # The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is strong and sterically hindered.\n    # A bulky base favors the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n    # Elimination can occur by removing a proton from C2 or C6.\n    # Removal of H from C2 gives the Zaitsev product: 1-methylcyclohexene.\n    # Removal of H from C6 gives the Hofmann product: 3-methylcyclohexene.\n    # Due to the bulky base, the Hofmann product is favored.\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    print(f\"The name of the major product is: {product_name}\")\n\nget_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
