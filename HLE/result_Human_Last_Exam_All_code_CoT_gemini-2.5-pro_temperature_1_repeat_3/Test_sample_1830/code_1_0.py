    This script solves a mathematical problem about the order type of the set of

    The solution is a logical proof, presented through print statements.

    print("--- The Problem ---")
    print("Let X be the set of possible cardinalities of maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families of infinite subsets of ω.")
    print("We are given the assumption 2^ω = ω_1 (the Continuum Hypothesis, CH).")
    print("The goal is to find the order type of X.\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Understanding the Definitions ---")
    print(" - ω is the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...}. Its cardinality is |ω| = ℵ₀.")
    print(" - An 'almost disjoint' (a.d.) family is a set of infinite subsets of ω where the intersection of any two distinct sets is finite.")
    print(" - A 'maximal almost disjoint' (MAD) family is an a.d. family that cannot be extended with another infinite subset of ω.")
    print(" - Let κ be the cardinality of a MAD family A. So, κ = |A|.")
    print(" - X is the set of all possible values of κ.")
    print(" - The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states that 2^ℵ₀ = ℵ₁, where ℵ₁ is the first uncountable cardinal.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Finding the Lower Bound for the Cardinality κ ---")
    print("A key theorem in set theory states that any MAD family must be uncountable.")
    print("Proof by contradiction:")
    print("  1. Assume a MAD family A is countable, so A = {A₀, A₁, A₂, ...}.")
    print("  2. We can construct a new infinite set B ⊂ ω that is almost disjoint from every set in A.")
    print("  3. The construction of B = {b₀, b₁, b₂, ...} proceeds by diagonalization:")
    print("     For each n, choose bₙ such that bₙ > bₙ₋₁ and bₙ ∉ (A₀ ∪ A₁ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ).")
    print("     This is always possible because the union of a finite number of countable sets is countable, so its complement in ω is infinite.")
    print("  4. The resulting set B is infinite by construction.")
    print("  5. For any Aₖ in A, the intersection B ∩ Aₖ is contained in {b₀, b₁, ..., bₖ₋₁}, because for all n ≥ k, bₙ was chosen to be outside Aₖ.")
    print("  6. This means B ∩ Aₖ is finite for every k.")
    print("  7. So, B is an infinite set almost disjoint from every member of A. This contradicts the maximality of A.")
    print("The assumption that A is countable must be false. Therefore, A is uncountable.")
    print("The smallest uncountable cardinality is ℵ₁. So, we must have κ ≥ ℵ₁.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Finding the Upper Bound for the Cardinality κ ---")
    print("A MAD family A is a collection of subsets of ω. This means A is a subset of the power set of ω, P(ω).")
    print("The cardinality of any subset is at most the cardinality of the whole set.")
    print("So, κ = |A| ≤ |P(ω)|.")
    print("The cardinality of the power set of ω is |P(ω)| = 2^|ω| = 2^ℵ₀.")
    print("Therefore, we have κ ≤ 2^ℵ₀.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Applying the Continuum Hypothesis ---")
    print("We have established the bounds for κ: ℵ₁ ≤ κ ≤ 2^ℵ₀.")
    print("The problem assumes the Continuum Hypothesis: 2^ℵ₀ = ℵ₁.")
    print("Substituting CH into our inequality gives: ℵ₁ ≤ κ ≤ ℵ₁.")
    print("This forces the conclusion that κ = ℵ₁.")
    print("This means that under CH, every MAD family has the same cardinality, ℵ₁.\n")

    print("--- Step 5: Determining the Set X and its Order Type ---")
    print("The set X is the set of all possible cardinalities of MAD families.")
    print("Since we have shown that the only possible cardinality is ℵ₁, the set X is a singleton set:")
    print("X = {ℵ₁}")
    print("The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal number that is order-isomorphic to it.")
    print("A singleton set has a trivial ordering. It is order-isomorphic to the first non-zero ordinal, which is 1.")
    print("The order topology on a single-point space is also trivial and doesn't change this fact.")
    print("Thus, the order type of X is 1.\n")
    
    print("--- Final Answer ---")
    # The final equation is "Order type of X = 1".
    # As requested, here is the number from that equation.
    final_answer = 1
    print("The final equation is OrderType(X) = 1")
