    "When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together to form a combined system with negligible interaction or tunneling between them, the topological invariant of the new system is the sum of the individual topological invariants. In this case, the Chern number is the relevant topological invariant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator.\n3.  Calculate the sum of these two numbers to find the Chern number of the junction.\n4.  Print the full equation showing the addition.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the resulting equation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"{chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
