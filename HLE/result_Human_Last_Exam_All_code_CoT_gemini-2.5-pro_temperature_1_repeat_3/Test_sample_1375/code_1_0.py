# The derived symbolic formula for the average area in terms of k is:
# A_avg = sqrt(2*k + 1) / (k * k! * (k-1)!)
# In terms of n, where k = (n-1)/2:
# A_avg = sqrt(n) / ( ((n-1)/2) * ((n-1)/2)! * ((n-3)/2)! )

# The final answer is the symbolic formula itself.
# Since the prompt asks for a single answer, this is the most general solution.
# For n=3 (k=1), A_avg = sqrt(3).
# For n=5 (k=2), A_avg = sqrt(5)/4.
# For n=7 (k=3), A_avg = sqrt(7)/36.
# The general expression is the answer.
