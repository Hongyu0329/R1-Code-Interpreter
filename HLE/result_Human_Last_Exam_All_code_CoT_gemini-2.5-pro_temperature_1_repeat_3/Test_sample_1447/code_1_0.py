# The mystery in both stories relies on a pun or phonetic ambiguity in the English language.
# The task is to identify which translation practices can successfully handle this.

# Option I (Transcreation) allows the translator to create a new, analogous pun in the
# target language, preserving the story's structure. This is a valid solution.
# Option VI (Footnotes) allows the translator to explain the original English pun to the
# reader, making the plot comprehensible. This is also a valid and common solution.

# The other options are not effective:
# II (Audio links) breaks immersion and relies on the reader knowing English.
# III (Changing the setting) is irrelevant to a linguistic problem.
# IV (Foreigner accent) is not a general solution and doesn't fit the Asimov story.
# V (Pictures) cannot convey phonetic wordplay.

# The valid options are I and VI.
# The final answer should be expressed as Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by a hyphen.

numeral_one = "I"
numeral_six = "VI"

# Combine the numerals into the final formatted string.
final_answer = f"{numeral_one}-{numeral_six}"
