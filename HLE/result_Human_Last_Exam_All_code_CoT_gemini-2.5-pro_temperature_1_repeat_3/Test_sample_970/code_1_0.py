# The following code prints the derived logical formula in Conjunctive Normal Form.
# The analysis concluded that the necessary assumption is that either the prior has finite entropy (a)
# OR the limit of the state occupancy distribution exists (c).
# This is represented as a single clause in CNF.

# Define the literals involved
a = "a"
c = "c"

# The logical condition is (a OR c)
# Format as a clause
clause1 = f"({a} OR {c})"

# Format as a conjunction of clauses
final_formula = f"[{clause1}]"
