    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), we need to analyze their structural properties in the context of nonlinear optics. Here is the step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Requirement for SPDC:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect. A fundamental requirement for any material to exhibit second-order effects is that its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric (lacking a center of inversion). Materials with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric) have a second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero, which forbids processes like SPDC.\n2.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheet Structure:** Boron nanosheets, or borophene, can exist in various structural polymorphs. We need to check the symmetry of the most stable, commonly studied free-standing forms. Research shows that the primary stable phases of free-standing borophene (like the β₁₂ and χ₃ sheets) are centrosymmetric.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Because the common structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_potential(material_name, crystal_symmetry):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if a material is a candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    based on its crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the potential for {material_name} to exhibit SPDC...\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the physical requirement for SPDC.\n    print(\"Step 1: Requirement for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(\"SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.
