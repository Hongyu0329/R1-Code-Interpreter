# This script calculates the value of (z1(pi/8) / y(pi/8))^2 based on the analytical solution.

# As derived from the problem description:
# z1(t) = cos(t)
# y(t) = sin(2*t) / (cos(2*t))**(3/2)

# Set the time value
t_val = np.pi / 8

# Calculate z1(pi/8)
z1_at_t = np.cos(t_val)

# Calculate y(pi/8)
# y(pi/8) = sin(pi/4) / (cos(pi/4))**(3/2)
# Since sin(pi/4) = cos(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2), this simplifies to:
# y(pi/8) = (1/sqrt(2)) / (1/sqrt(2))**(1.5) = (1/sqrt(2))**(-0.5) = (2**(-0.5))**(-0.5) = 2**0.25
y_at_t = 2**0.25

# Calculate the final expression (z1/y)^2
# This is (cos(pi/8) / 2**(1/4))^2 = cos(pi/8)**2 / sqrt(2)
result = (z1_at_t / y_at_t)**2

# Using the half-angle identity, cos(x)^2 = (1 + cos(2x))/2
# cos(pi/8)^2 = (1 + cos(pi/4))/2 = (1 + sqrt(2)/2)/2 = (2 + sqrt(2))/4
cos_sq_pi_8 = (2 + np.sqrt(2)) / 4
sqrt_2 = np.sqrt(2)

print("The final equation is given by cos^2(pi/8) / sqrt(2).")
print(f"The value of cos^2(pi/8) is (2 + sqrt(2))/4 = {cos_sq_pi_8}")
print(f"The value of sqrt(2) is {sqrt_2}")
print(f"Therefore, the final result is ({cos_sq_pi_8}) / ({sqrt_2}) = {result}")
