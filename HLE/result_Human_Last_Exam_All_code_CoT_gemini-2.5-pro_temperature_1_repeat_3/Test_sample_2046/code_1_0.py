    print("Step 1: Identify the location of the stroke.")
    print("   - The stroke is in the left paracentral artery, a branch of the Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA).")
    print("   - The ACA supplies the medial (middle) surface of the brain's hemispheres.")

    print("\nStep 2: Relate the brain region to its function using the homunculus.")
    print("   - The medial part of the motor and sensory cortex, supplied by the ACA, controls the contralateral (opposite side) leg and foot.")
    print("   - The lateral part of the cortex, supplied by the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), controls the contralateral arm and face.")

    print("\nStep 3: Determine the side and location of the symptoms.")
    print("   - A stroke on the left side of the brain causes symptoms on the right side of the body.")
    print("   - Because the ACA territory is affected, symptoms will be primarily in the leg/foot, not the arm.")

    print("\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer choices.")
    print("   - Choices C and D are incorrect because they describe left-sided symptoms.")
    print("   - Choice A is incorrect because it states more loss in the arm than the foot, which is the opposite of an ACA stroke.")
    print("   - Choices B and E correctly identify that the right foot will be affected more than the right arm.")

    print("\nStep 5: Choose the most likely outcome.")
    print("   - A stroke in this location causes both sensory loss and motor weakness.")
    print("   - However, the most classic and prominent clinical sign of an ACA stroke is contralateral motor weakness.")
    print("   - Therefore, more weakness of the right foot than the arm is the most likely result.")
