    "This is a question about the physical properties of the 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes). To solve this, we need to understand three key properties: chirality, polarity, and optical activity, and how they relate to a crystal's symmetry.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Define the criteria:** The question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active**.\n2.  **Explain the concepts:**\n    *   **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means it lacks any roto-inversion axes (including mirror planes `m` and inversion centers `-1`).\n    *   **Polarity:** A crystal is polar if it has a unique direction, meaning a vector pointing in that direction is not mapped onto its opposite by any symmetry operation. This allows for properties like pyroelectricity.\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. Generally, all chiral classes are optically active. However, optical activity is forbidden in any class with an inversion center. The key to this question is that a few *achiral*, non-centrosymmetric classes can also exhibit optical activity, although sometimes only for specific directions of light propagation.\n3.  **Identify the candidates:** The classes that fit all three criteria (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are rare exceptions. The primary examples are the point groups `-4` and `-42m`. The class `-43m` also fits this description.\n4.  **Evaluate the answer choices:** I will write a Python script to programmatically check each class in the given answer choices against these three properties and identify the choice where all listed classes match the criteria.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress the __pycache__ directory\nsys.dont_write_bytecode = True\n\ndef analyze_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program analyzes crystal classes to find the set that is\n    achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of relevant crystal classes.\n    # A class is:\n    # - Achiral: if it has a roto-inversion axis (like a mirror plane 'm' or inversion center '-1').\n    # - Non-polar: if it does not have a unique directional vector.\n    # - Optically Active: if its gyration tensor is non-zero.
