    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  First, I will create two lists: one containing the names of the American League (AL) Triple Crown winners and another for the National League (NL) winners. Note that players who won multiple times, like Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby, will be listed for each win to represent all occurrences.\n2.  Next, I will convert each list into a set to count the number of *unique* players in each league.\n3.  Finally, I will sum the counts of unique winners from both leagues to get the total number of individual players who have achieved this feat. The code will then print out this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# A list of all batting Triple Crown wins in the American League and National League.\n# Note: A player's name appears for each time they won.\nal_wins = [\n    \"Nap Lajoie\",\n    \"Ty Cobb\",\n    \"Jimmie Foxx\",\n    \"Lou Gehrig\",\n    \"Ted Williams\",\n    \"Ted Williams\", # Won a second time\n    \"Mickey Mantle\",\n    \"Frank Robinson\",\n    \"Carl Yastrzemski\",\n    \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n]\n\nnl_wins = [\n    \"Paul Hines\",\n    \"Tip O'Neill\",\n    \"Hugh Duffy\",\n    \"Heinie Zimmerman\",\n    \"Rogers Hornsby\",\n    \"Rogers Hornsby\", # Won a second time\n    \"Chuck Klein\",\n    \"Joe Medwick\"\n]\n\n# Get the number of unique winners from each league by converting lists to sets\nnum_unique_al_winners = len(set(al_wins))\nnum_unique_nl_winners = len(set(nl_wins))\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique winners\ntotal_unique_winners = num_unique_al_winners + num_unique_nl_winners\n\n# Print the final equation\nprint(f\"Number of unique AL winners: {num_unique_al_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Number of unique NL winners: {num_unique_nl_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Total Triple Crown Winners: {num_unique_al_winners} + {num_unique_nl_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
