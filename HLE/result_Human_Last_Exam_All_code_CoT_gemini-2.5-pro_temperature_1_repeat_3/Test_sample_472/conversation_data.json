    "When scanning a line of Latin poetry, we must first identify the length of each syllable, either long (L) or short (S). A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short. We also must account for elision, where a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word starting with a vowel, causing the first vowel to be dropped.\n\nThe requested meter is likely dactylic hexameter, which consists of six metrical feet. The first five feet can be either a dactyl (L S S) or a spondee (L L), and the sixth foot is a spondee (L L) or a trochee (L S).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan for the Python code to perform this scansion:\n1.  Define the rules for syllable quantity (long by nature, long by position, short). We'll add a dictionary for vowels that are long by nature, like in `sōlī`.\n2.  Implement a function to handle elision. For this line, the key elision is `bene esse`, which becomes `ben' esse`.\n3.  Process the line word by word, breaking it into syllables and determining the quantity of each.\n4.  Attempt to group the resulting sequence of long and short syllables into the six feet of a dactylic hexameter line.\n5.  Print the final scansion, foot by foot. If the line cannot be scanned into a perfect hexameter, the code will scan as much as possible and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef get_vowel_quantity(vowel, word, syllable_index):\n    \"\"\"Determines if a vowel is long by nature.\"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of known long vowels for specific words/syllables\n    # sōlī -> o and i are long\n    long_by_nature = {\n        'soli': [True, True]\n    }\n    if word in long_by_nature:\n        return long_by_nature[word][syllable_index]\n    # Diphthongs are long\n    diphthongs = ['ae', 'au', 'oe', 'ei', 'eu', 'ui']\n    if vowel in diphthongs:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef scan_line(line):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a Latin line for dactylic hexameter.\n    L = Long, S = Short.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle specific elisions manually for clarity\n    line = line.replace(\"bene esse\", \"benesse\")\n    words = line.lower().split()\n\n    syllables = []\n    quantities = []\n    \n    # This is a simplified syllabifier and scanner\n    # A full-featured one is a major NLP task.\n    vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n    \n    full_text = \"\".join(words)\n\n    # 1.
