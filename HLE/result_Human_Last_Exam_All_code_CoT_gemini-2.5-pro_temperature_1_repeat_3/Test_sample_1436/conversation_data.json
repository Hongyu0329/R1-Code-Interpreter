    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Feynman Diagram:** The user describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (which I'll interpret as propagators or internal lines). The simplest and most common diagram with these properties is a vacuum bubble diagram where two vertices are connected to each other by four distinct propagators. This type of diagram appears, for example, at the second order of perturbation theory in a `λφ⁴` theory.\n\n2.  **Define the Symmetry Factor (S):** The symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting identical topologies in the perturbative expansion. It is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which means it's the number of ways you can permute the elements of the diagram (vertices and lines) without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:** The calculation can be broken down into two parts:\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** Since the two vertices are identical (they are connected to the same set of four lines), we can swap them without changing the diagram. This gives a factor of `2!` (or 2).\n    *   **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also identical. We can permute them amongst themselves in `4!` ways. This gives a factor of `4!` (or 24).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the permutation factors for all sets of identical components. So, `S = (Vertex Permutations) * (Propagator Permutations)`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will define the number of vertices and propagators, calculate their respective permutation factors using `math.factorial`, multiply them to get the final symmetry factor, and print out each step of the calculation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the Feynman diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the symmetry factor 'S' for a Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"The diagram in question has two identical vertices and four identical propagators connecting them.\\n\")\n    print(\"The formula for the symmetry factor is the product of the permutations of identical components:\")\n    print(\"S = (permutations of identical vertices) * (permutations of identical propagators)\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate permutations for vertices ---\n    # The two vertices are identical and can be swapped.\n    vertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the vertex permutation factor.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_vertices} identical vertices, so the factor is {num_vertices}! = {vertex_permutations}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate permutations for propagators ---\n    # The four propagators are identical and can be permuted.\n    propagator_permutations = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the propagator permutation factor.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_propagators} identical propagators connecting the vertices, so the factor is {num_propagators}! = {propagator_permutations}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the total symmetry factor ---\n    symmetry_factor = vertex_permutations * propagator_permutations\n    print(\"Step 3: Multiply the factors to get the total symmetry factor 'S'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"S = {num_vertices}! * {num_propagators}!\")\n    print(f\"S = {vertex_permutations} * {propagator_permutations}\")\n    print(f\"S = {symmetry_factor}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
