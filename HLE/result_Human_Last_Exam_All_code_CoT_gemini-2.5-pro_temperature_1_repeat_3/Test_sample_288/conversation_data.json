    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Access the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite chemical synapse connectome data.\n2.  Filter this data to isolate all connections originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Group the filtered connections by the target (postsynaptic) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  Identify the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n5.  Display the individual synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR to this main target, along with the total sum.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ntry:\n    # Use the cenelegans library to fetch the data\n    from cenelegans.data import get_data\n    # Load the chemical synapse data for the adult hermaphrodite\n    chem_df = get_data('herm_chem')\nexcept (ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError):\n    print(\"cenelegans library not found.
