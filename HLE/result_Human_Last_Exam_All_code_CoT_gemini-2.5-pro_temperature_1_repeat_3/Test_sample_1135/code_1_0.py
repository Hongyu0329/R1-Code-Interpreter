    # Step 1: Define the properties of the operators and the theory.
    # In quantum chemistry, the electronic Hamiltonian (H) is a two-body operator.
    # This means it involves interactions between at most two electrons at a time,
    # and thus, acting on the reference determinant, it can create at most two excitations.
    rank_H = 2

    # In CCSD, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is H_bar = exp(-T) * H * exp(T).
    # Its Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is:
    # H_bar = H + [H,T] + 1/2 ![[H,T],T] + ...
    # A crucial result is that because H is a two-body operator, this series
    # terminates exactly at the fourth-order commutator. This means any term in H_bar
    # is composed of one H operator and at most four T operators.
    max_T_operators_in_BCH = 4

    # Step 2: Derive the maximum producible excitation level.
    # Any term in H_bar corresponds to a connected diagram. The excitation level 'k'
    # of such a term is the number of particle-hole pairs it creates.
    # This level is limited by the rank of H and the number of T2 operators (m2)  in the term.
    # The formula is: k_max <= rank(H) + m2
    
    # To find the absolute maximum k, we need the maximum possible value for m2.
    # Since any term has at most 4 T operators in total (T1 or T2), the
    # maximum number of T2 operators (m2) is also 4.
    max_m2 = max_T_operators_in_BCH

    # Now, we calculate the maximum producible excitation level.
    max_producible_excitation = rank_H + max_m2

    # Step 3: Print the reasoning and the result.
