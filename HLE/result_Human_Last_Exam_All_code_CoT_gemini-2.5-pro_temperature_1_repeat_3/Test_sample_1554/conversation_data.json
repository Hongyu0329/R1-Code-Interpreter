    "The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. In his work on the methodology of the sciences and semantics, he analyzed how we come to know things. He differentiated between signs that are natural indicators and those that are based on convention.\n\n*   **Symptoms** (or natural signs) have a causal or natural connection to what they indicate. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n*   **Signals** (or conventional signs) have a meaning established by rules or agreement. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\nHe considered both to be types of \"hallmarks\" or indicators that allow us to infer something.\n\nSince this is a factual question and not a computational one, I will provide the answer directly.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
