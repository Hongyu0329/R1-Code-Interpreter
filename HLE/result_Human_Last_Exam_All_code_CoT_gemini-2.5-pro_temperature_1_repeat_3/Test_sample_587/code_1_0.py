    # Let's analyze the options:
    # A. FPT for every H. False. Fails for H=cliques.
    # B. If H is cliques, problem is #W[1]-complete. True, this is #k-CLIQUE.
    # C. Hard for some H with degree <= 2. False. Such H have bounded treewidth, so the problem is FPT.
    # E. FPT iff H has bounded vertex-cover. False. Paths are a counterexample for the 'only if' part.
    # D. FPT iff H has bounded treewidth. This is a major dichotomy theorem in parameterized complexity.

    # Both B and D seem correct. However, D provides a complete characterization
    # of the complexity, identifying treewidth as the key property.
    # The properties of G (somewhere dense, closed under subgraphs) are precisely
    # the conditions under which this dichotomy holds.
    # Statement D implies B, as cliques have unbounded treewidth.
    # In such cases, the more general and powerful statement is the best answer.
