    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions. When transformed into the frequency-momentum domain, its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is a simple inverse relationship.\n\nThe Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is a function of both momentum (or wavevector) $k$ and frequency $\\omega$. The energy $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy of a particle with momentum $k$. The relationship is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency (often representing the energy of the propagating particle).\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum $k$.\n*   $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal positive imaginary term ($ \\delta \\to 0^+ $) that ensures causality by correctly positioning the pole in the complex frequency plane. It dictates how the particle propagates in time.\n\nThis equation shows that the bare Green's function has a pole whenever the frequency $\\omega$ is equal to the energy of the particle, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters, demonstrating this functional dependence.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        delta (float): A small positive constant for causality.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + 1j * delta)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Example values\n    omega = 2.5  # Example frequency in some energy units\n    epsilon_k = 2.0  # Example single-particle energy in some energy units\n    delta = 0.1  # Small positive constant\n\n    # The functional dependence\n    print(\"In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function G_0 has the following dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ε_k:\")\n    print(\"G_0(ω, ε_k) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)\\n\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation\n    result = calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta)\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"Let's calculate G_0 for the following values:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency ω = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Energy Eigenvalue ε_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal term δ = {delta}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Substituting the values into the equation:\")\n    # Using f-string formatting to display the equation with numbers\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i * {delta})\")\n    \n    # Show the intermediate step\n    real_part = omega - epsilon_k\n    imag_part_str = f\"+ i * {delta}\"\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({real_part} {imag_part_str})\")\n\n    # Show the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe final value of the bare Green's function is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}>>>"
