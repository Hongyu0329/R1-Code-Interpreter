    1.  Analyze the Scenario: The patient is actively violent and has failed an initial intervention of 5mg IM olanzapine. Staff and patient safety are the top priorities.

    2.  Evaluate the Routes: The IV route (Option A) is dangerous in a combative patient. The IM route is preferred for safety.

    3.  Evaluate the Strategy: Verbal de-escalation (Option C) is no longer appropriate as the patient has escalated to physical violence.

    4.  Evaluate Dosages for the "Next Step": We must consider the initial 5mg of olanzapine already given.
        -   Option D (10mg IM olanzapine): This would result in a total of 15mg olanzapine. This is a high dose for a patient with an unknown history.
        -   Option E (10mg IM olanzapine + 2mg IM lorazepam): This would result in a total of 15mg olanzapine + 2mg lorazepam. This is an excessive and high-risk dose.
        -   Option B (2mg IM lorazepam + 5mg olanzapine IM): This results in a total of 10mg olanzapine and 2mg lorazepam. This is a standard, effective, and evidence-based combination for severe agitation that failed initial monotherapy. It provides synergistic effects while keeping the total dose of each medication within a safer range compared to options D and E.

    5.  Conclusion: Combination therapy with olanzapine and lorazepam is a well-established and effective treatment for severe agitation. Option B represents the most balanced and appropriate escalation of care.
