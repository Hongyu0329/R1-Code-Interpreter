    This function solves for the smallest possible value of k based on a theorem in spectral geometry.

    The problem is: For a smooth Riemannian metric on S^2, if the total area is 4*pi,
    and the second nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (lambda_2) is always < k,
    what is the smallest possible k?
    """

    # Step 1 & 2: State the relevant theorem.
    # A key result in spectral geometry for the sphere S^2, established by Girouard, Nadirashvili,
    # and Polterovich, states that for any integer k >= 1:
    #
    #   sup_g [lambda_k(g) * Area(g)] = 8 * pi
    #
    # where the supremum is over all smooth Riemannian metrics g on S^2, and lambda_k(g) is the
    # k-th nonzero eigenvalue. For k >= 2, this supremum is *not attained*.

    # For k=2, this means for any metric g, the following strict inequality holds:
    #   lambda_2(g) * Area(g) < 8 * pi
    
    supremum_lambda_times_area = 8 * math.pi

    # Step 3: Use the given area.
    # The problem specifies that Area(g) = 4*pi.
    area = 4 * math.pi
    
    # Substituting this into the inequality:
    #   lambda_2(g) * (4 * pi) < 8 * pi

    # Step 4: Solve for the upper bound on lambda_2(g).
    # This gives:
    #   lambda_2(g) < (8 * pi) / (4 * pi)

    # Step 5: Calculate the bound and determine the smallest k.
    # The value of the bound is the supremum of all possible lambda_2 values for metrics
    # with area 4*pi. Let's call this value `sup_lambda_2`.
    # sup_lambda_2 = (8 * pi) / (4 * pi) = 2.
    
    # The condition is that lambda_2(g) < k for all applicable metrics g.
    # This means k must be a strict upper bound for the set of all possible lambda_2 values.
    # Since sup_lambda_2 = 2 and this supremum is not attained, we have lambda_2(g) < 2 for all g.
    # Therefore, we can choose k = 2.
    # We cannot choose a smaller k, because we can find a sequence of metrics for which
    # lambda_2 approaches 2. Any k < 2 would be violated by some metric in that sequence.
    # Thus, the smallest possible value for k is 2.

    # Now, we print the calculation as requested.
