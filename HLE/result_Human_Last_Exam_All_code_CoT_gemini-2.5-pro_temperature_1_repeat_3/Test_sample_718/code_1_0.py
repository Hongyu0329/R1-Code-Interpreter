# The problem asks for the value of n for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.
# Based on the analysis of the properties of such functors and their underlying posets,
# the maximum projective dimension for any such functor is determined to be 2.
# An n-resolvable functor is one with projective dimension less than or equal to n.
# Therefore, n must be 2.

n = 2
print("The functor is n-resolvable for n =", n)
print("This means the projective dimension of the functor is at most", n)
