    "This is a problem in the representation theory of partially ordered sets (posets). To find the value of $n$, we need to understand the concepts of an upper semilattice, a tame functor, and what it means for a functor to be $n$-resolvable.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **n-resolvable functor**: A functor (or more generally, a module) $f$ is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution\n    $$ \\dots \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0 $$\n    such that the $n$-th syzygy module, which is the kernel of the map $P_{n-1} \\to P_{n-2}$ (or $P_0 \\to f$ for $n=1$), is a projective module. This property is equivalent to stating that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $pd(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\n2.  **The question in terms of projective dimension**: The problem asks for a single integer $n$ such that *any* tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable. This means we are looking for an upper bound on the projective dimension $pd(f)$ that holds for any functor $f$ on any upper semilattice $J$ of tame representation type.\n\n3.  **Connection to Global Dimension**: The smallest such $n$ would be the supremum of the projective dimensions over all such functors. This is related to the global dimension of the category of functors (or representations) on $J$, denoted $\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Rep}_K(J))$. The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category. So, the question is equivalent to finding the maximum possible global dimension for the category of representations of a tame upper semilattice $J$.\n\n4.  **Global Dimension of a Poset Representation**: For the category of representations of a finite poset $J$, the global dimension is a well-known quantity: it is equal to the length of the longest chain of elements in $J$. A chain $x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_d$ has length $d$. So, $\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Rep}_K(J)) = \\max \\{d \\mid \\exists x_0 < \\dots < x_d \\in J\\}$.\n\n5.  **Main Problem**: The task now simplifies to a purely poset-theoretic question: What is the maximum possible length of a chain in a poset $J$ that is both an upper semilattice and of tame representation type?\n\n6.  **Tame and Upper Semilattice Constraints**:\n    *   An **upper semilattice** is a poset where any two elements have a least upper bound (a join).\n    *   A poset is of **tame representation type** if its indecomposable representations can be classified and fall into a finite number of discrete series or one-parameter families. A poset is tame if and only if it does not contain any of a small number of \"minimal wild\" posets as subposets.\n    *   A crucial result in representation theory, although subtle, is that the combination of these two properties (being an upper semilattice and being tame) puts a strong restriction on the structure of the poset, specifically on the possible length of its chains. While a tame poset can have arbitrarily long chains (e.g., a simple chain of any length is of finite, hence tame, type), and an upper semilattice can have arbitrarily long chains, a poset that has both properties cannot. It can be shown that if an upper semilattice contains a chain of length 3 or more, it is forced to be of wild representation type.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, for a poset $J$ to be a tame upper semilattice, the longest chain in $J$ can have a length of at most 2. This implies that $\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Rep}_K(J)) \\le 2$. Consequently, the projective dimension of any functor $f$ on $J$ is at most 2, i.e., $pd(f) \\le 2$. This means any such functor is 2-resolvable. The bound is sharp, as there exist tame upper semilattices with a longest chain of length 2 (e.g., the poset formed by taking the tame poset `{a₁<a₂, b₁<b₂, c₁<c₂}` and adding a global maximum element).\n\nThus, the value of $n$ is 2.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the value of n for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n# Based on the analysis of the properties of such functors and their underlying posets,\n# the maximum projective dimension for any such functor is determined to be 2.\n# An n-resolvable functor is one with projective dimension less than or equal to n.\n# Therefore, n must be 2.\n\nn = 2\nprint(\"The functor is n-resolvable for n =\", n)\nprint(\"This means the projective dimension of the functor is at most\", n)\n```\n<<<2>>>"
