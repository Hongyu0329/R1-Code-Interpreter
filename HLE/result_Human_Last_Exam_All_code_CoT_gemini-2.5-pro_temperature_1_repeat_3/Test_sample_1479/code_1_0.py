    print("   - A Type-1 MF maps a single input variable (from the universe of discourse) to a single membership value between 0 and 1.")
    print("   - This is a 2D relationship: (Variable, Membership Grade).")
    print("   - It models vagueness, but not uncertainty about the membership grade itself.")

    print("Step 2: Type-2 Fuzzy MF (3-Dimensional Structure)")
    print("   - A Type-2 MF addresses uncertainty about the membership grade.")
    print("   - For each input variable, the membership grade is not a single number but a fuzzy set itself (a range of possible values, each with its own weight).")
    print("   - This adds a dimension, resulting in a 3D structure: (Variable, Primary Membership, Secondary Membership).")
    print("   - The uncertainty is represented by a 2D area called the 'Footprint of Uncertainty' (FOU).")

    # Step 3: Explain Type-3 as the next level of uncertainty
    print("Step 3: Type-3 Fuzzy MF (4-Dimensional Structure)")
    print("   - A Type-3 MF extends this concept by modeling uncertainty about the secondary membership grades of a Type-2 set.")
    print("   - This requires another dimension, resulting in a 4D structure.")
    print("   - The crucial difference from Type-2 is how the uncertainty is modeled. The 2D 'Footprint of Uncertainty' is extended into a 3D 'Volume of Uncertainty'.")
