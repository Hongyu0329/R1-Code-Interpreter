    "This problem requires us to evaluate a definite integral.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to be evaluated is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard form integral, `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, whose antiderivative is `ln(|f(x)|)`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The value of the definite integral from 0 to 1, let's call it `V`, is given by `[ln(F₃(x))]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n    *   We can remove the absolute value signs because `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive for real x.\n3.  **Calculate the Boundary Values:**\n    *   At x = 0: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   At x = 1: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n4.  **Compute the Result:**\n    *   Substitute the boundary values back into the expression for `V`:\n        `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   The final task is to calculate the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** We will use a Python script with the `math` library to compute these values accurately and find the final answer.\n\nThe final equation for the integral's value `V` is:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\nWe will now calculate the values for `F₃(1)`, `F₃(0)`, and `V`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) from 0 to 1 is ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\n\n# Calculate F3(1)\n# F3(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\nsin_1 = math.sin(1)\nexp_sin_1 = math.exp(sin_1)\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + exp_sin_1)\n\n# Calculate F3(0)\n# F3(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\nprint(f\"The final equation for the integral V is: ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"The value of F3(1) is: {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of F3(0) is: {f3_at_0}\")\n\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\n# Note: ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Calculate the final result as requested\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{closest_integer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
