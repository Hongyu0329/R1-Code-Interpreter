The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a central tool in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics for describing two-particle systems, such as bound states (e.g., positronium, excitons) or scattering processes.

The equation provides a non-perturbative way to calculate the full two-particle correlation function (or Green's function) by summing an infinite set of Feynman diagrams. It establishes a direct relationship between two fundamental quantities:

1.  **The Scattering Amplitude (or full four-point Green's function):** This quantity describes the complete interaction between the two particles, incorporating all possible intermediate processes. It's the "output" or the quantity one typically aims to solve for.

2.  **The Interaction Kernel (or Bethe-Salpeter kernel):** This serves as the "input" for the equation. It is defined as the sum of all two-particle irreducible (2PI) diagrams. A diagram is 2PI if it cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing only two internal particle lines. This kernel represents the fundamental, elementary interaction from which the full scattering process is built.

Schematically, the BSE can be written as:
T = K + K * G₀ * T

Where 'T' is the full scattering amplitude, 'K' is the interaction kernel, and 'G₀' represents the propagation of two non-interacting particles.

Based on this, the Bethe-Salpeter equation facilitates a correspondence between the **scattering amplitude** and the **interaction kernel**. Option (G) is the most accurate and standard description of this relationship.
