    This script illustrates the inconsistency that arises from combining
    a general fixed-point combinator (which the problem's recursion rule
    provides) with functional extensionality.

    The core of the paradox is finding a fixed point for a function that
    logically cannot have one.

    # A fixed-point combinator Y can find a fixed point for any function g,
    # such that Y(g) is behaviorally equivalent to g(Y(g)).
    # We can implement its behavior in Python to demonstrate the concept.
    def Y(g):
      # The Y-combinator for applicative-order (strict) evaluation.
      # It computes f such that f = g(f).
      return (lambda f: f(f))(lambda f: g(lambda x: f(f)(x)))

    # Let's consider functions from Bool to Bool.
    # We define a function 'g' which takes a function `f` (Bool -> Bool)
    # and returns a new function which is the negation of `f`.
    def g(f):
      return lambda x: not f(x)

    # With the powerful recursion rule, we can construct a fixed point for 'g'.
    # Let's call this fixed point 'h'. So, h = Y(g).
    # By the property of a fixed point, h must be equal to g(h).
    # Functional Extensionality lets us assert this equality from observing
    # their behavior.
    h = Y(g)

    # Now, we show the contradiction.
    # If h = g(h), then for any boolean 'b', h(b) must equal g(h)(b).
    # From the definition of g, we have g(h)(b) = not h(b).
    # Therefore, the paradoxical equation is h(b) = not h(b).
    # Let's check this for b = True.
    
    # In a logical system, we can state this equality. In a programming
    # language with strict evaluation like Python, calling h(True) results
    # in an infinite loop, which is the computational symptom of the paradox.
    # We'll use a try-except block to catch this and explain it.
