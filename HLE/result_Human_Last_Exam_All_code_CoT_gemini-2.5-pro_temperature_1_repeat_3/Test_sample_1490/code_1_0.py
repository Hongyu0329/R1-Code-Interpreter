# Step 1: Determine the original total number of curves (T) based on the poem's riddle.
# Let T be the original total.
# The fraction of curves that remained is 1 - (fraction lost) - (fraction for new paths).
# Fraction remaining = 1 - 3/8 - 1/4 = 8/8 - 3/8 - 2/8 = 3/8.
# This remaining fraction (3/8 of T) is equal to 90 curves.
maintained_curves = 90
remaining_fraction = 3/8
original_curves = int(maintained_curves / remaining_fraction)

# Step 2: Calculate the number of curves in each category.
lost_curves = int(original_curves * (3/8))
new_pathway_curves = int(original_curves * (1/4))

# Step 3: Verify the internal logic with the curve breakdown.
# The poem says "Of those that left their plotted way...". This refers to the 'lost_curves'.
# Let's check if the fractions work with this number.
parabolic_curves = lost_curves * (1/5)
elliptical_curves = lost_curves * (2/9)
# The results (18 and 20) are integers, so our interpretation is consistent.

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of curves in the restored pattern before the final proportion is applied.
# The final pattern consists of the maintained curves, the replaced 'lost' curves, and the added 'new pathway' curves.
total_before_ratio = maintained_curves + lost_curves + new_pathway_curves

# Step 5: Apply the "Golden Ratio" proportion.
# The problem gives a base of 360 curves in the preamble, which contradicts the poem's implied total of 240.
# The final twist, "When golden ratio claims its space", likely resolves this.
# The ratio that connects the poem's number (240) to the preamble's number (360) is 360/240 = 1.5.
# This ratio, 3/2, is a Fibonacci ratio, making it a plausible interpretation of the "golden ratio proportion" for this specific puzzle.
golden_proportion = 360 / 240
final_curves = int(total_before_ratio * golden_proportion)

# Print the final equation showing how the total number of curves is calculated.
