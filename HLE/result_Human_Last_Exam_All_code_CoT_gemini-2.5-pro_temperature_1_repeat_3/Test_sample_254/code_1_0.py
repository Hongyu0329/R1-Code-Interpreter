    print("If we only have homogeneity, it means studies comparing the same two treatments (e.g., A vs B) have similar results.")
    print("However, the studies comparing A vs B could be in a different population (e.g., older patients) than studies comparing B vs C (e.g., younger patients).")
    print("This would make the indirect comparison of A vs C invalid due to a lack of transitivity.")
    print("Conclusion: Homogeneity is necessary, but NOT sufficient.\n")

    # Explain why Transitivity/Similarity alone is not sufficient
    print("Is Transitivity / Similarity of Effect Modifiers sufficient? (Choices A & D)")
    print("If we only have transitivity, it means it is plausible to compare treatments indirectly (e.g., patient characteristics are similar across all studies).")
    print("However, within a single comparison (e.g., all A vs B studies), there could be high unexplained variation (heterogeneity) due to other factors like study quality.")
    print("This would make the estimate for the A vs B effect unreliable.")
    print("Conclusion: Transitivity is necessary, but NOT sufficient.\n")

    # Explain the role of Consistency
    print("Is Consistency sufficient? (Choice B)")
    print("Consistency is the agreement between direct evidence (from A vs C studies) and indirect evidence (from A vs B and B vs C studies).")
    print("It is not a starting assumption, but rather a property that we check for. If the network is inconsistent, the NMA results are invalid.")
    print("Finding consistency provides confidence that the underlying assumptions (like transitivity and homogeneity) hold, but it is not a standalone sufficient condition.")

    # Explain Exchangeability
    print("Is Exchangeability sufficient? (Choice F)")
    print("Exchangeability is a statistical assumption, particularly in Bayesian NMA, that allows us to 'borrow strength' across the network.")
    print("This assumption itself relies on the underlying clinical and statistical plausibility of the network (i.e., on homogeneity and transitivity).")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The validity of an NMA relies on several assumptions holding true simultaneously. Key assumptions include homogeneity and transitivity.")
    print("No single assumption on its own is sufficient to ensure the entire analysis is valid.")
