    Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.

    Step 1: Basic properties of the function f
    First, we establish some fundamental properties of any function f in the set S.
    1.  Injectivity: The function f must be one-to-one.
        If f(x_1) = f(x_2), then applying f to both sides gives f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2)).
        This implies exp(x_1) = exp(x_2), which means x_1 = x_2.
        So, f is injective.
    2.  Monotonicity: Since f is a continuous and injective function on the real line, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).

    Step 2: The Commutation Relation
    Any solution f must commute with the exponential function, i.e., f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).
    Proof:
    - Start with the original equation: f(f(x)) = exp(x).
    - Apply f to both sides: f(f(f(x))) = f(exp(x)).
    - Let y = f(x). The original equation is f(y) = exp(x) if y=f(x). No, that's not right.
    - Let y = f(x). Then f(f(y)) = exp(y).
    - So, f(f(f(x))) = exp(f(x)).
    - Comparing the two expressions for f(f(f(x))), we get: f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).

    Step 3: Ruling out strictly decreasing solutions
    Let's assume f is a strictly decreasing function.
    - As x approaches infinity, a decreasing function f(x) must approach a limit L, which can be a finite number or -infinity. So, L = lim_{x->inf} f(x).
    - Now, we take the limit of the commutation relation as x -> infinity:
      - Left-hand side: lim_{x->inf} f(exp(x)). As x -> inf, exp(x) -> inf. So, this limit is lim_{z->inf} f(z) = L.
      - Right-hand side: lim_{x->inf} exp(f(x)) = exp(lim_{x->inf} f(x)) = exp(L).
    - Equating the limits, we must have L = exp(L).
    - The equation L = exp(L) has no real solutions. To see this, consider the function g(L) = exp(L) - L. Its derivative is g'(L) = exp(L) - 1, which is zero only at L=0. The minimum value is g(0) = exp(0) - 0 = 1. Since the minimum value is 1, g(L) is never zero.
    - This contradiction proves that no strictly decreasing continuous solutions exist.

    Step 4: Counting the strictly increasing solutions
    - All solutions must be strictly increasing. It can be shown through a constructive proof that such solutions exist.
    - The family of solutions can be constructed and parameterized as follows:
      1. Choose a value for f(0). Let c = f(0). For an increasing solution f, it can be shown that we must have x < f(x) < exp(x) for all x. For x=0, this means 0 < f(0) < exp(0), so 0 < c < 1. The number of choices for c is the same as the number of points in the interval (0, 1), which is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
      2. From f(f(x)) = exp(x), we have f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, so f(c) = 1.
      3. Define f on the interval [0, c] as any strictly increasing continuous function h(x) such that h(0) = c and h(c) = 1. The number of ways to choose such a function h is also the cardinality of the continuum, c.
    - Once c and the function h are chosen, the entire function f is uniquely determined for all real numbers.
    - The total number of solutions is the number of ways to choose c times the number of ways to choose h, which is c * c = c.

    Step 5: Conclusion
    The set of solutions contains only strictly increasing functions. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum.
    The equation in question is f(f(x)) = exp(x).
