    "Answering this question requires mathematical reasoning rather than direct computation. I will provide a Python script that prints the step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Analyze the properties of any continuous function `f` that satisfies the given equation. This will show that `f` must be strictly monotonic.\n2.  Consider the two possible cases: `f` is strictly increasing or `f` is strictly decreasing.\n3.  Prove that no strictly decreasing solutions exist by analyzing the function's behavior at infinity.\n4.  Show that strictly increasing solutions exist and that there are infinitely many of them. The number of these solutions will be determined by counting the degrees of freedom in their construction.\n5.  Conclude the cardinality of the set of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cardinality_explanation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step derivation for the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.\n\n    Step 1: Basic properties of the function f\n    First, we establish some fundamental properties of any function f in the set S.\n    1.  Injectivity: The function f must be one-to-one.\n        If f(x_1) = f(x_2), then applying f to both sides gives f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2)).\n        This implies exp(x_1) = exp(x_2), which means x_1 = x_2.\n        So, f is injective.\n    2.  Monotonicity: Since f is a continuous and injective function on the real line, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n    Step 2: The Commutation Relation\n    Any solution f must commute with the exponential function, i.e., f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).\n    Proof:\n    - Start with the original equation: f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    - Apply f to both sides: f(f(f(x))) = f(exp(x)).\n    - Let y = f(x). The original equation is f(y) = exp(x) if y=f(x). No, that's not right.\n    - Let y = f(x). Then f(f(y)) = exp(y).\n    - So, f(f(f(x))) = exp(f(x)).\n    - Comparing the two expressions for f(f(f(x))), we get: f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)).\n\n    Step 3: Ruling out strictly decreasing solutions\n    Let's assume f is a strictly decreasing function.\n    - As x approaches infinity, a decreasing function f(x) must approach a limit L, which can be a finite number or -infinity. So, L = lim_{x->inf} f(x).\n    - Now, we take the limit of the commutation relation as x -> infinity:\n      - Left-hand side: lim_{x->inf} f(exp(x)). As x -> inf, exp(x) -> inf. So, this limit is lim_{z->inf} f(z) = L.\n      - Right-hand side: lim_{x->inf} exp(f(x)) = exp(lim_{x->inf} f(x)) = exp(L).\n    - Equating the limits, we must have L = exp(L).\n    - The equation L = exp(L) has no real solutions. To see this, consider the function g(L) = exp(L) - L. Its derivative is g'(L) = exp(L) - 1, which is zero only at L=0. The minimum value is g(0) = exp(0) - 0 = 1. Since the minimum value is 1, g(L) is never zero.\n    - This contradiction proves that no strictly decreasing continuous solutions exist.\n\n    Step 4: Counting the strictly increasing solutions\n    - All solutions must be strictly increasing. It can be shown through a constructive proof that such solutions exist.\n    - The family of solutions can be constructed and parameterized as follows:\n      1. Choose a value for f(0). Let c = f(0). For an increasing solution f, it can be shown that we must have x < f(x) < exp(x) for all x. For x=0, this means 0 < f(0) < exp(0), so 0 < c < 1. The number of choices for c is the same as the number of points in the interval (0, 1), which is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n      2. From f(f(x)) = exp(x), we have f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, so f(c) = 1.\n      3. Define f on the interval [0, c] as any strictly increasing continuous function h(x) such that h(0) = c and h(c) = 1. The number of ways to choose such a function h is also the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n    - Once c and the function h are chosen, the entire function f is uniquely determined for all real numbers.\n    - The total number of solutions is the number of ways to choose c times the number of ways to choose h, which is c * c = c.\n\n    Step 5: Conclusion\n    The set of solutions contains only strictly increasing functions. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    The equation in question is f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n    \n    final_answer = \"The cardinality of the set is the cardinality of the continuum.\"\n    print(\"--- FINAL ANSWER ---\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nget_cardinality_explanation()\n```\n<<<'c' (the cardinality of the continuum)>>>"
