    The synthesis of a controlled-controlled-controlled-Z (CCCZ) gate from
    controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gates and arbitrary single-qubit rotations
    is equivalent in gate count to synthesizing a 4-qubit Toffoli gate (C^3 X)
    from 3-qubit Toffoli gates (C^2 X). This is because these gates are convertible
    using single-qubit Hadamard gates, which are allowed by the problem statement.
    
    The minimal number of C^2 X gates to build a C^3 X gate without ancillas is a
    known result in the field of reversible logic synthesis, established to be 6.
