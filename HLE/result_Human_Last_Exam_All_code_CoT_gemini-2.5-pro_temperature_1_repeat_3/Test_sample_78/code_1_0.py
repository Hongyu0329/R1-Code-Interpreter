    print("\n[CONCLUSION]: The Rust code will NOT compile.\n")

    print("--- Primary Reason: Borrow Checker Error ---")
    print("The code violates Rust's fundamental memory safety rule regarding borrowing.")
    print("Rule: You cannot have a mutable borrow (`&mut`) while an immutable borrow (`&`) of the same data exists.\n")

    print("The following code pattern, found in multiple places, causes the error:")
    print("`variable.set(..., variable.get(...) + other_value);`\n")

    print("Explanation:")
    print("1. To evaluate the arguments for `.set()`, the `variable.get(...)` part is executed first.")
    print("2. This creates an IMMUTABLE borrow on `variable` to read its value.")
    print("3. Then, the `.set()` method is called, which requires a MUTABLE borrow on `variable` to write a new value.")
    print("4. The compiler detects this conflict (an active immutable borrow and a new mutable borrow) and throws a compilation error.\n")

    print("Specific error locations include:")
    print(" - `Matrix::dot` on the `result` variable.")
    print(" - `FeedForward::forward` on the `hidden` and `output` variables.")
    print(" - `FeedForward::backward` on the `self.w1` and `self.w2` variables.\n")
    
    print("--- Secondary Issue: Compiler Warnings ---")
    print("The code defines helper functions `exp` and `ln` which are never used.")
    print("The Rust compiler will issue `dead_code` warnings for these unused functions.\n")

    print("--- Final Answer ---")
    print("The code will not compile due to one or more errors, and there will also be warnings.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice C.")
