def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    by a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1) Apis: Immatures are in a hive. Unlikely.
    2) Melipotini: Larvae are external foliage feeders. Likely.
    3) Eupholini: Larvae are internal wood-borers. Unlikely.
    4) Acritini: Larvae are predators in decaying matter, not on plants. Unlikely.
    5) Oxyptilini: Larvae are external plant feeders. Likely.
    6) Dictyophorini: Nymphs are external plant feeders. Likely.
    7) Acanthocerini: Larvae (grubs) live in soil or rotting wood. Unlikely.

    The function will print the indices of the unlikely tribes.
