    "To find an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot using Vogel's algorithm, we will follow a step-by-step plan.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot and its Diagram:** The three-twist knot is also known as the stevedore knot or the $6_1$ knot. We will use its standard, minimal 6-crossing diagram, which is an alternating diagram.\n2.  **Apply Vogel's Algorithm:** This algorithm provides an upper bound for the braid index based on a specific diagram of the knot. The formula is:\n    `Braid Index <= n - m_max + 1`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number of Seifert circles in the diagram.\n    *   `m_max` is the number of local maxima in the diagram with respect to a chosen direction.\n3.  **Calculate `n` (Seifert Circles):** For an alternating knot diagram with `c` crossings, the number of Seifert circles `n` can be calculated with the formula `n = (c + 2) / 2`. The $6_1$ knot's standard diagram is alternating and has `c = 6` crossings.\n4.  **Calculate `m_max` (Maxima):** We will orient the standard diagram vertically. In this orientation, the diagram has a single highest point, meaning it has only one local maximum. So, `m_max = 1`.\n5.  **Compute the Upper Bound:** We will substitute the values of `n` and `m_max` into Vogel's formula to calculate the upper bound.\n6.  **Code the Calculation:** A Python script will be provided to perform and display these calculations clearly.\n\n```python\ndef vogel_algorithm_for_three_twist_knot():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (6_1)\n    using Vogel's algorithm on its standard diagram.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This program calculates an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (6_1) using Vogel's algorithm.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the number of crossings for the standard diagram.\n    crossings = 6\n    print(f\"1.
