    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces in the specific red-blue Hackenbush stalk that represents the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. A standard method for constructing such a stalk for a given dyadic rational value (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator) involves a recursive formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Value of a Hackenbush Stalk:** The value of a simple stalk of red and blue pieces can be calculated recursively. Let $v_k$ be the value of a stalk with $k$ pieces. The value is determined by the value of the stalk underneath ($v_{k-1}$) and the color of the top piece ($c_k$).\n    *   If the top piece is **Red**, the new value is $v_k = \\frac{v_{k-1} + 1}{2}$.\n    *   If the top piece is **Blue**, the new value is $v_k = \\frac{v_{k-1}}{2}$.\n    *   The base case is a stalk with 0 pieces, which has a value of $v_0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Work Backwards:** We are given the final value $v = \\frac{13}{16}$ and need to find the number of pieces, $k$. We can reverse the process: starting from $v_k = \\frac{13}{16}$, we can determine the color of the top piece and the value of the stalk beneath it ($v_{k-1}$). We repeat this process until we reach the base case value of $v_0 = 0$. The number of steps taken will be the number of pieces in the stalk.\n\n3.  **Implement the Reverse Logic:**\n    *   Start with the current value $v = \\frac{13}{16}$ and a piece count of 0.\n    *   In a loop, as long as $v > 0$:\n        *   Increment the piece count.\n        *   To find the previous value $v_{prev}$, we rearrange the formulas:\n            *   If the piece was Red: $v_{prev} = 2v - 1$.\n            *   If the piece was Blue: $v_{prev} = 2v$.\n        *   We can determine the color by checking the current value $v$. For a stalk representing a number between 0 and 1, the value of any sub-stalk will also be between 0 and 1.\n            *   If $v > 1/2$, the only way to get a $v_{prev}$ in the range $[0, 1]$ is if the piece was Red.\n            *   If $v < 1/2$, the only way is if the piece was Blue.\n            *   If $v = 1/2$, the standard construction terminates by choosing the Red piece option, as this leads to $v_{prev} = 0$.\n        *   Update $v$ to be $v_{prev}$ and continue the loop.\n\n4.  **Write the Code:** A Python script will be created to perform this calculation using fractions to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. The script will output the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent a dyadic rational\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush using a recursive value-based method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user wants to represent the number 13/16.\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    current_n = numerator\n    current_d = denominator\n    piece_count = 0\n\n    # We will work backwards from the final value to the base value of 0.\n    # The number of steps in this process is the number of pieces.\n    while current_n > 0:\n        piece_count += 1\n        \n        # The recursive formulas for the value 'v' of a stalk are:\n        # v = (v_prev + 1) / 2  (for a Red top piece)\n        # v = v_prev / 2        (for a Blue top piece)\n        \n        # We reverse these to find v_prev based on the current value v = current_n / current_d.\n        # v_prev_red = 2*v - 1\n        # v_prev_blue = 2*v\n\n        # For a value v between 0 and 1, we can determine the color of the top piece.\n        # If v > 1/2, the top piece must have been Red.\n        # If v < 1/2, the top piece must have been Blue.\n        # If v = 1/2, the standard construction assumes a Red piece to terminate (v_prev = 0).\n        \n        if current_n * 2 > current_d:  # This is equivalent to v > 1/2\n            # The top piece was Red.
