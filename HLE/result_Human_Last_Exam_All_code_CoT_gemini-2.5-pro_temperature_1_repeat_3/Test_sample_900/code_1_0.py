    This function addresses the user's question about counting "pas de Balanchine" steps.
    Since a precise, objective count is not feasible for the reasons outlined below,
    this function will print a detailed explanation.
    """

    # The "pas de Balanchine" is a stylistic term, not a formally defined, countable step.
    # It generally refers to a lunge with an off-balance, jutting hip.
    # William Forsythe's choreography is an extension of this style, making a count subjective.
    # A definitive count would require frame-by-frame analysis by a dance expert, and even then, opinions would differ.
    # There is no database for a script to query this information.
    # Therefore, we will output an explanation instead of a number.

    explanation = """It is not possible to provide a definitive count of "pas de Balanchines" for the following reasons:

1.  **Definition is Stylistic, Not Formal:** The "pas de Balanchine" is not a single, universally defined ballet step like a 'plié' or 'grand jeté'. It is a stylistic term for a characteristic off-balance lunge with a jutting hip. What one person counts as a "pas de Balanchine," another might classify as a simple lunge or a different variation, especially within William Forsythe's deconstructed choreographic style.

2.  **Choreographic Complexity:** William Forsythe's choreography in "In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated" is known for pushing the boundaries of classical technique. The solo contains numerous lunges, off-balance positions, and hip-driven movements that are direct descendants of the Balanchine style. To count them would be a subjective exercise in dance analysis.

3.  **No Data Source for Code:** There is no public API or database that contains a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of this specific performance. A script cannot access information that has not been cataloged in a machine-readable format.

Due to this subjectivity and lack of data, no equation or numerical answer can be programmatically generated.
