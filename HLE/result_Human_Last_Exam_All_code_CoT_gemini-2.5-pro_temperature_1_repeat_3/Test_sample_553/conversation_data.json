    "This is an interesting music theory question! The chord progression you're describing is quite unique. My analysis points to one specific song.\n\nHere is my plan to identify the song:\n1.  I will analyze the user's request for a Beatles song that opens with a progression from the tonic (I) chord to the minor fifth (v) chord.\n2.  I will search my knowledge of The Beatles' discography and common harmonic analyses of their songs.\n3.  The most famous example of a progression of this type, although slightly different from the literal description, is in the song \"Michelle\".\n4.  The verse of \"Michelle\" is in the key of F minor. The opening vocal line is harmonized with a C major chord followed by a C minor chord.\n5.  In the key of F minor, C is the fifth degree of the scale. Therefore, the progression is from a major fifth (V) to a minor fifth (v). While C is not the tonic (I) of the song's key, this V -> v progression is the famous \"jump\" that fits the spirit of your question.\n6.  I will write a Python script to present this finding, clearly stating the song name, the key, and the specific harmonic progression, including the Roman numerals as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song based on a specific harmonic progression\n    and explains the music theory behind it.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    first_chord = \"C major\"\n    second_chord = \"C minor\"\n    \n    # In music theory, Roman numerals are used to denote chords within a key.\n    # 'V' represents the major chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (the dominant).\n    # 'v' represents the minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n    first_chord_function = \"V\"\n    second_chord_function = \"v\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that features this distinctive chord movement is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's the music theory breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"1.

The famous opening vocal line ('Michelle, ma belle...') begins over a {first_chord} chord, which then 'jumps' to a {second_chord} chord.\")\n    print(f\"3.
