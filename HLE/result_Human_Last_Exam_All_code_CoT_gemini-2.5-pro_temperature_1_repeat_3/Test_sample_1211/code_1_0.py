    # Analysis of each statement:
    # I. Supported: While the goal of naloxone is to increase safety by deterring misuse,
    #    the precipitated withdrawal it causes upon injection is a negative health event.
    #    From that narrow perspective, one could argue it's "less safe" for the person misusing it at that moment.
    #    The underlying facts in the statement are correct.
    #
    # II. Supported: It is a clinical fact that buprenorphine monotherapy (Subutex) is the preferred
    #     and safer option for specific populations, most notably pregnant women, to avoid
    #     exposing the fetus to naloxone.
    #
    # III. Supported: When taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone in Suboxone has very poor
    #      bioavailability and has little to no effect. Therefore, the therapeutic effects and safety
    #      profiles of both medications are dictated by the buprenorphine and are considered very similar.
    #
    # IV. Not Supported: The relative safety profiles are well-established through extensive research and
    #     clinical practice. The claim that "largely we don't know" is false.
    #
    # V. Not Supported: This statement contains a critical factual error. It claims Suboxone's abuse
    #    deterrence is due to the "lack of naloxone," which is the opposite of the truth. It is the
    #    *presence* of naloxone that deters injection.
    
    # Conclusion: The supported statements are I, II, and III.
    correct_statements = ["I", "II", "III"]
    
    # The corresponding answer choice is B.
    answer = "B"
