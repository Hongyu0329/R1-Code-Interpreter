    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers perfect immunity to a fraction of recipients while offering no protection to the rest. The per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) for such a vaccine is equal to the fraction of recipients who are fully protected.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to demonstrate the mathematical relationship between the `VE_p` and the vaccine efficacy calculated from the incidence rate ratio (`VE_IRR = 1 - IRR`).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan that the script will follow:\n1.  **Define Terms**: We will assign a variable `p` to represent the true `VE_p` (the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully immune). We will also define a symbolic variable `λ` for the force of infection, which is the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected.\n2.  **Define Incidence Rates**: We will express the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`) and the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) in terms of `p` and `λ`.\n3.  **Calculate IRR**: We will compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`).\n4.  **Calculate VE from IRR**: We will use the standard formula `VE = 1 - IRR` to find the estimated vaccine efficacy.\n5.  **Compare**: Finally, we will compare the calculated `VE` with the true `VE_p` (`p`) to determine if the method overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the efficacy.\n\nThis process will show, with example values, how the final calculation relates to the initial true efficacy.\n\n```python\n# --- Define Variables ---\n# Let 'p' be the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n# This means a proportion 'p' of the vaccinated population is fully protected.\np = 0.90 # Example: 90% efficacy, meaning 90% of recipients are fully immune.\n\n# Let 'lambda_force' represent the force of infection (the hazard rate of infection\n# for susceptible individuals). We can use a placeholder value, as it will cancel out.\nlambda_force = 0.01 # Example: 1% chance of infection per unit of time for a susceptible person.\n\n# --- Step-by-step Derivation ---\nprint(\"This script demonstrates whether 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) correctly estimates\")\nprint(\"the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define terms for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\")\nprint(f\"Let 'p' be the true per-exposure VE.
