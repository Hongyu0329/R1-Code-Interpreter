# --- Define Variables ---
# Let 'p' be the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for an all-or-nothing vaccine.
# This means a proportion 'p' of the vaccinated population is fully protected.
p = 0.90 # Example: 90% efficacy, meaning 90% of recipients are fully immune.

# Let 'lambda_force' represent the force of infection (the hazard rate of infection
# for susceptible individuals). We can use a placeholder value, as it will cancel out.
lambda_force = 0.01 # Example: 1% chance of infection per unit of time for a susceptible person.

# The remaining proportion of the vaccinated group is not protected.

# In the vaccinated group, only the proportion (1-p) is susceptible to infection.
# The number of cases is proportional to 位 * (1-p).
# The person-time denominator for the rate calculation includes the entire group (both protected and unprotected).
# Therefore, the overall incidence rate for the vaccinated group is the force of infection scaled by the susceptible proportion.
ir_v = lambda_force * proportion_susceptible

# IRR is the ratio of the two incidence rates.
irr = ir_v / ir_u
