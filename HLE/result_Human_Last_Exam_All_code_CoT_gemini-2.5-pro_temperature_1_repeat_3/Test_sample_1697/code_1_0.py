    This function determines and prints the product of a two-step organic synthesis.

    Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide is treated with sec-BuLi/TMEDA.
            This is a directed ortho-metalation reaction where the strong amide directing group
            causes lithiation at the C2 position, which is ortho to the amide and stabilized
            by both the amide and the adjacent amino group.

    Step 2: The resulting organolithium intermediate is quenched with methyl iodide.
            The lithiated carbon attacks the methyl group, replacing the lithium with a methyl group.
