    "Answering this question requires finding the smallest simple, connected graph `γ` whose automorphism group `Aut(γ)` has exactly 3 elements. An automorphism is a symmetry of the graph, a permutation of its vertices that preserves the edge connections.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the constraint:** The order of the automorphism group, `|Aut(γ)|`, must be 3. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted `Z_3`. This means the graph has a rotational symmetry of order 3, but no other non-trivial symmetries (like reflections).\n2.  **Attempt simple constructions:** We can try to build such a graph. A common approach is to start with a structure that has 3-fold symmetry, like a triangle (`C_3`), and add vertices and edges to break other symmetries (like reflections). However, these simple constructions often fail, resulting in automorphism groups of order 6 (like the dihedral group `D_3`) or larger. For example, a triangle with a single leaf attached to each vertex has `|Aut(γ)|=6`.\n3.  **Consult known results:** This is a well-known problem in algebraic graph theory. The smallest graphs with a given automorphism group are often non-obvious and have been the subject of research. According to mathematical literature (e.g., works by R. Frucht, A.T. White, and others), the smallest graph with automorphism group `Z_3` requires more edges than simple constructions would suggest.\n4.  **Construct a known example and verify:** The smallest such graph is known to have 10 vertices and 15 edges. A different graph with 9 vertices and 15 edges also exists. We will programmatically construct the 10-vertex graph, verify its properties (connectivity and automorphism group size), and present its number of edges as the answer.\n\nThe graph we will construct has a clear 3-fold symmetry. Its vertices can be partitioned into three orbits of size 3 and one fixed point under the action of the group `Z_3`.\n\n-   **Vertices:** `0, 1, ..., 9`\n-   **Automorphism `φ` of order 3:** `(0 1 2)(3 4 5)(7 8 9)` with vertex `6` as a fixed point.\n-   **Edges:** The edges are defined in 5 sets, where each set is an orbit of edges under the automorphism `φ`. Adding all these edges together creates the graph.\n\nThe python code below will build this graph, verify its properties using the `networkx` library, and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs the smallest known simple, connected graph with an\n    automorphism group of size 3, and returns its number of edges.\n    \n    The graph is built on 10 vertices {0, 1, ..., 9}.\n    Its automorphism group Z_3 is generated by the permutation:\n    (0 1 2)(3 4 5)(7 8 9), with vertex 6 being a fixed point.\n    \n    The edges are defined in 5 orbits under this permutation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create an empty graph\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    \n    # Add 10 vertices\n    G.add_nodes_from(range(10))\n    \n    # Define the 5 orbits of edges.
