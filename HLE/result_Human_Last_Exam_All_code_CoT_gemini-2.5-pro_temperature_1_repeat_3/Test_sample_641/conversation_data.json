    "An involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse, i.e., an element `g` such that `g^2` is the identity. To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The group is PSU(n, q) with n=4 and q=997. The involutions in PSU(n, q) arise from elements `g` in the special unitary group SU(n, q) whose square `g^2` lies in the center of SU(n, q). For n=4 and q=997, the center of SU(4, 997) has two elements, `I` and `-I` (the identity matrix and its negative).\n\n2.  **Classify Pre-images:** This means we need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) where `g^2 = I` (these are the true involutions of SU) and where `g^2 = -I` (these are called skew-involutions). These elements project to two distinct conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Size of the First Class (N1):** This class corresponds to the involutions in SU(4, 997) whose members have eigenvalues {1, 1, -1, -1}. The size of this conjugacy class is given by the formula:\n    `N1 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Size of the Second Class (N2):** This class corresponds to the skew-involutions in SU(4, 997). For q=997, these elements have eigenvalues {j, j, -j, -j}, where `j` is a root of `x^2 = -1` in the underlying field. The size of this conjugacy class is given by the formula:\n    `N2 = q^4 * (q + 1) * (q^3 + 1)`\n\n5.  **Sum the Class Sizes:** The total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum `N1 + N2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in the group PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Calculate the size of the first class of involutions (N1)\n    # These arise from elements g in SU(4,q) with g^2 = I.\n    # Formula: N1 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)\n    q2 = q * q\n    q4 = q2 * q2\n    \n    n1_factor1 = q2 - q + 1\n    n1_factor2 = q2 + 1\n    N1 = q4 * n1_factor1 * n1_factor2\n\n    # Calculate the size of the second class of involutions (N2)\n    # These arise from elements g in SU(4,q) with g^2 = -I.\n    # Formula: N2 = q^4 * (q + 1) * (q^3 + 1)\n    q3 = q2 * q\n    \n    n2_factor1 = q + 1\n    n2_factor2 = q3 + 1\n    N2 = q4 * n2_factor1 * n2_factor2\n    \n    # The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n    total_involutions = N1 + N2\n    \n    # Print the full equation with all numbers\n    print(f\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum of the sizes of two classes, N1 and N2.\")\n    print(f\"N1 = {q}^4 * ({q}^2 - {q} + 1) * ({q}^2 + 1) = {q4} * {n1_factor1} * {n1_factor2} = {N1}\")\n    print(f\"N2 = {q}^4 * ({q} + 1) * ({q}^3 + 1) = {q4} * {n2_factor1} * {n2_factor2} = {N2}\")\n    print(f\"Total = N1 + N2 = {N1} + {N2} = {total_involutions}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1952697850849938063862122>>>"
