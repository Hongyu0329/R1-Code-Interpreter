# This script uses logical steps to determine the effect of hypermutator strains on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

# Step 1: Define the core characteristics from the problem description.

# Step 2: Define the consequences of being a hypermutator strain.

# Step 3: Connect the mutation rate to the frequency of the mucoid phenotype.
# A higher mutation rate will increase the chance of mutations occurring in any gene, including mucA.

print(f"Because mucA mutations are the most common cause of the mucoid phenotype, a high mutation rate leads to an '{frequency_of_mucoid_variants}' frequency of mucoid variants.")
