    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this chemoinformatics problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The starting material is \"di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide\". A reduction reaction cleaves the disulfide bond (-S-S-), and the major product is formed by adding a hydrogen atom to each sulfur atom, resulting in two thiol (-SH) groups. Therefore, the molecule of interest is a single **perylene-3-thiol** (C₂₀H₁₁SH).\n\n2.  **Represent the Molecule as a Graph**: The perylene-3-thiol molecule, including all its hydrogen atoms, will be represented as a mathematical graph. The atoms are the vertices (nodes), and the chemical bonds are the edges. We will use the `rdkit` library to generate this molecular structure. The task specifies including hydrogen atoms, so we will ensure they are explicitly added to the graph.\n\n3.  **Define Graph Indices**:\n    *   **Wiener Index (W)**: This is the sum of the shortest path distances between all possible unordered pairs of atoms in the molecular graph.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz)**: This index is calculated by examining each bond (edge) in the graph. For an edge connecting atoms `u` and `v`, we count the number of atoms that are closer to `u` (`n_u`) and the number of atoms that are closer to `v` (`n_v`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products `n_u * n_v` over all bonds in the graph.\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation**: A Python script will be used to perform the calculation using the `rdkit` and `networkx` libraries.\n    *   The script will first define the molecule (perylene-3-thiol) using its SMILES representation and add hydrogen atoms.\n    *   It will then convert this structure into a `networkx` graph.\n    *   Using this graph, it will compute the shortest path distances between all pairs of atoms.\n    *   Finally, it will use these distances to calculate the Wiener and Szeged indices and compute their ratio, printing the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_molecular_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecule (perylene-3-thiol) using its SMILES string\n    # and add explicit hydrogen atoms.\n    smiles = \"SC1=CC2=C3C=CC4=CC=CC5=C4C3=C(C=C2)C2=C(C=C1)C=CC5=C2\"\n    try:\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol is None:\n            print(\"Error: Could not create molecule from SMILES string.\")\n            return\n        mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Error: RDKit is not installed.
