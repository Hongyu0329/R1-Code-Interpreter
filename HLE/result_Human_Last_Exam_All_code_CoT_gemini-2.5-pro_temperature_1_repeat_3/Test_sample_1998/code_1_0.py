    print(f"The dimension of Q' is N + 1 = {N} + 1 = {N+1}.")
    print(f"Since the dimension of Q' ({N+1}) is greater than u(K) = {u_K}, Q' must be isotropic, i.e., it must have a non-trivial zero (x, z).")

    print("If z were 0, then Q(x) = 0. Since Q is anisotropic, this would mean x=0, making the solution (x,z) trivial, which is a contradiction.")
