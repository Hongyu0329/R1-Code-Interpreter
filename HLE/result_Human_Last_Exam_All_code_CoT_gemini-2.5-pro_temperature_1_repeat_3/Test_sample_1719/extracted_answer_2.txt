The homotopy-theoretic obstructions for the two paths to be homotopic are classified by the group $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$. This group is constructed from the following list of groups:
1.  The homotopy groups of the special orthogonal group: $\pi_q(SO(2k))$ for $q \ge 1$.
2.  The cohomology groups of the homology sphere $X$: $H^{n-1}(X; \pi_q(SO(2k)))$ for $q \ge 1$.
