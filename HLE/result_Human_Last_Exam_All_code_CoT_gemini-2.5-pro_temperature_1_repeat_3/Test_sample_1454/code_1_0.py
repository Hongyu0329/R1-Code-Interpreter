# The problem is a mathematical question about the properties of a fractal set F.
# The set F is defined by the equation F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4.
#
# We identified two possible closed sets F satisfying this equation:
# 1. The non-empty attractor, F_A, which is a product of a Cantor set and the unit interval.
#    This set has uncountably many components, each being a vertical line segment.
#    These components are all non-degenerate and locally connected.
#    The number of such components is infinite.
#
# 2. The empty set, F = {}.
#    The empty set trivially satisfies the equation.
#    The empty set has no connected components (as components must be non-empty).
#    Therefore, the number of components that are non-degenerate and locally connected is 0.
#
# The question asks for the "smallest possible number" of such components.
# Comparing the two cases, 0 is smaller than infinity.
# Therefore, the smallest possible number is 0.
