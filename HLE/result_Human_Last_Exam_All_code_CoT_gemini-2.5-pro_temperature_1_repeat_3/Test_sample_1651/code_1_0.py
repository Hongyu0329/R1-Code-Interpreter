        "Both L and R are homeomorphic to N*, the Stone-Cech remainder of the natural numbers.",

        "A fixed point p in R* must satisfy F(p) = p, where F is the lift of a continuous function f: R -> R.",
        "This requires F to map a part of R* to itself. For instance, if lim_{x->+inf} f(x) = +inf, then the lift F maps the set R to itself (F(R) subset R).",
        "If f were to map R to a disjoint set (e.g., lim_{x->+inf} f(x) = -inf implies F(R) subset L), no fixed points could exist in R.",

        "All fixed points must therefore lie in R. The map F restricted to R is a map from R to R, so it must have at least 2 fixed points.",
        "Thus, if the number of fixed points is non-zero, it must be at least 2.",
        "",
        "Step 5: Confirm that 2 is achievable.",
        "It is known that continuous maps on N* with exactly two fixed points exist. For example, a retraction of N* onto a two-point subset {p, q}.",
        "It is possible to construct a continuous function f: R -> R whose lift F, when restricted to R, behaves like such a map.",
        "By choosing the behavior of f for x -> -infinity appropriately (e.g., f(x) -> +inf), one can ensure no fixed points exist in L.",
