def explain_identifiability_strategies():
    """
    Explains why certain strategies do or do not help mitigate the identifiability
    issue in birth-death models on extant phylogenies.
    """
    explanation = """
The core identifiability problem with time-varying birth-death models on phylogenies of only extant species is that an infinite number of speciation (λ(t)) and extinction (μ(t)) rate histories can produce the exact same likelihood. We need to find the strategy that does NOT help solve this.

Let's analyze the options:

B, D, F - Adding New Information:
- (B) Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework adds constraints to the model based on external knowledge, helping to narrow down the possible solutions.
- (D, F) Incorporating fossils adds direct data about past extinction events, which is the key information missing from extant-only phylogenies.
These strategies HELP by providing additional information to the model.

E, G - Reparametrizing the Model:
- Research (e.g., Louca & Pennell, 2020) shows that while λ(t) and μ(t) are not identifiable, specific combinations like the "pulled diversification rate" are. By reformulating the model to estimate these identifiable parameters directly, we sidestep the problem.
These strategies HELP by changing the question to one that the data can answer.

A, C - Choosing a Functional Form for Rates:
- (A) Fitting a model with piecewise constant rates is a specific, simple parameterization. It doesn't solve the underlying identifiability issue but is a standard approach.
- (C) Fitting a model with piecewise high-degree polynomials is an extremely complex parameterization. For a problem defined by having too many possible solutions (non-identifiability), adding enormous flexibility and a vast number of parameters will only make the problem worse. It increases the number of potential solutions rather than constraining them.

Conclusion:
Making the model vastly more complex and flexible, as proposed in option C, is counter-productive for an identifiability problem. It is the only strategy that definitively does NOT help and will likely worsen the issue.
