Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **The Origin of Tunneling:** The tunneling phenomenon in ammonia is known as inversion. It occurs because the molecule's potential energy surface has a 'double-well' shape. The two wells correspond to the nitrogen atom being on either side of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms. The molecule can quantum mechanically 'tunnel' through the energy barrier that separates these two wells.

2.  **Determinants of the Potential Energy Surface:** This potential energy surface is determined entirely by the electrostatic interactions between the nuclei and electrons. Therefore, it depends on the masses and charges of the constituent particles, but it is independent of their intrinsic nuclear spin.

3.  **Impact of Using Exotic Hydrogen:** The exotic hydrogen atoms are described as having nuclear spin 0 but being otherwise identical to ordinary hydrogen (which has spin 1/2). This means they have the same mass and charge as protons. Consequently, the potential energy surface of the exotic NH3 molecule is identical to that of ordinary NH3.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since the double-well potential landscape that gives rise to tunneling remains unchanged, the exotic ammonia molecule will still exhibit tunneling. The rate of tunneling would be the same.

While tunneling itself would still occur, the change in nuclear spin (from fermion to boson) would alter the symmetry requirements for the total wavefunction. This would change the populations of the available rotational-vibrational states and modify the appearance of the molecule's microwave spectrum, but the fundamental tunneling process would persist.
