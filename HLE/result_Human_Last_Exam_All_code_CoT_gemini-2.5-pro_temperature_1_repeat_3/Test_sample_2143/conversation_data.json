    "Based on the clues provided, I will identify the historical figure you are asking about.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Analyze the key phrases in your request: \"another's material possessions,\" \"prohibition against representation,\" and the interpretation by \"Veronika Campan.\"\n2.  The \"prohibition against representation\" is a direct reference to the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (Ten Commandments), which forbids the making of graven images.\n3.  The issue of \"another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment, which forbids coveting a neighbor's property.\n4.  The text states that \"HE\" addressed the Tenth Commandment at the end of \"HIS work.\" This points to an analysis of the Ten Commandments themselves.\n5.  Veronika Campan is a scholar whose work often engages with psychoanalytic theory, particularly in relation to Jewish thought and law. Her interpretations frequently reference the person who famously applied psychoanalysis to religious texts.\n6.  Connecting these points, the figure who famously provided a deep psychological analysis of the Ten Commandments, particularly in his work *Moses and Monotheism*, is Sigmund Freud. He treated the commandments not just as divine laws but as expressions of deep-seated psychological principles.\n\nTherefore, \"HE\" is Sigmund Freud. I will now provide the Python code to print his full name.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the full name of the historical figure identified from the provided clues.\n# The clues point to the person who analyzed the Ten Commandments through a psychological lens,\n# connecting the prohibition against representation (the 2nd commandment) with the prohibition\n# against coveting material possessions (the 10th commandment).\n# This analysis is famously associated with the founder of psychoanalysis.\n\nfull_name = \"Sigmund Freud\"\nprint(full_name)\n```\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
