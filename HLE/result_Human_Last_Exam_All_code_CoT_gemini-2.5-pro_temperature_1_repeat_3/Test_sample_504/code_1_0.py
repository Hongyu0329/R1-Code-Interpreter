    This problem asks for the largest number of pairwise linearly independent vectors
    in C^6 such that the angle between any two is pi/2 or pi/3, and at least one
    orthogonal pair exists.

    Let the set of vectors be S = {v_1, ..., v_k}. We can normalize them to be unit
    vectors without changing the angles. Let |v_i| = 1 for all i.

    The angle alpha is defined by cos(alpha) = |(v,w)| / (|v||w|).
    For unit vectors, cos(alpha) = |(v,w)|.
    - Angle is pi/2: cos(pi/2) = 0, so |(v,w)| = 0. This means v and w are orthogonal.
    - Angle is pi/3: cos(pi/3) = 1/2, so |(v,w)| = 1/2.

    The problem asks for the maximum size k of a set of unit vectors where for any
    distinct v, w in S, |(v,w)| is in {0, 1/2}. The set must contain at least one
    orthogonal pair.

    Let's try to construct such a set.
    A simple example is the standard orthonormal basis of C^6, B_1 = {e_1, ..., e_6}.
    - Any two vectors are orthogonal, so their angle is pi/2.
    - The size is 6.

    Can we add more vectors? Let's try to add a vector v_7.
    v_7 must be a unit vector. Let v_7 = c_1*e_1 + ... + c_6*e_6.
    We need |(v_7, e_i)| in {0, 1/2} for i=1..6.
    |(v_7, e_i)| = |c_i|. So |c_i| must be 0 or 1/2.
    Also, |v_7|^2 = sum(|c_i|^2) = 1.
    If m is the number of non-zero components c_i, then m * (1/2)^2 = 1, so m/4 = 1, m=4.
    So, any new vector must have exactly 4 non-zero components, each of magnitude 1/2.

    We have constructed a set of 12 vectors that satisfy the conditions.
    The first set is the standard basis B_1 = {e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6}.
    The second set is another orthonormal basis B_2 = {v_7, ..., v_12}, where:
    v_7  = 1/2 * (e_1 + e_2 + e_3 + e_4)
    v_8  = 1/2 * (e_1 - e_2 + e_5 + e_6)
    v_9  = 1/2 * (e_3 - e_4 + e_5 - e_6)
    v_10 = 1/2 * (e_1 + e_2 - e_3 - e_4)
    v_11 = 1/2 * (e_3 - e_4 - e_5 + e_6)
    v_12 = 1/2 * (e_1 - e_2 - e_5 - e_6)

    The set S = B_1 U B_2 has size 6 + 6 = 12.
    - Inner products within B_1 are 0 (angle pi/2).
    - Inner products within B_2 are 0 (angle pi/2).
    - Inner products between a vector from B_1 and a vector from B_2 are either 0 or +-1/2,
      so the magnitude is 0 or 1/2 (angle pi/2 or pi/3).
    - The vectors are pairwise linearly independent.
    - An orthogonal pair exists, for example (e_1, e_2).

    This construction of 12 vectors works. Proving it is the maximum can be done using
    the Welch bound inequality from signal processing and coding theory. For a set of
    k vectors in C^d, the sum of squared magnitudes of all pairwise inner products
    is at least k^2/d. For our set of 12 vectors in C^6, this bound is met with
    equality, which suggests that this construction is optimal.
