    Calculates the minimum number of particles N to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. A pseudo-tensor in 3D is constructed using the rank-3 Levi-Civita symbol.
    2. The target rank is 7. The difference in rank (7 - 3 = 4) must be supplied
       by true tensors, i.e., vectors from relative particle positions.
    3. Each vector has rank 1, so we need 4 independent vectors.
    4. To get K independent relative position vectors from N particles, we need N = K + 1.
    5. Therefore, N = 4 + 1 = 5.
