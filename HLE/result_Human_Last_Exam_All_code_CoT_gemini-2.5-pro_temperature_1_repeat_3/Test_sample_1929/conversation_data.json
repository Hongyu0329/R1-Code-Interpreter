    "This is a chemical reaction question that can be solved by identifying the reactants and the type of reaction they undergo.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: The first reactant is butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂), a conjugated diene. The second is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂), an alkene that can act as a dienophile.\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction where the 4 π-electrons of the diene and the 2 π-electrons of the dienophile rearrange in a concerted step to form a new six-membered ring.\n3.  **Determine the Product**: The reaction forms a cyclohexene derivative. The two reactants join to form a ring, with a new double bond located between the central carbons of the original diene. The chlorine and fluorine atoms from the dienophile remain attached to their respective carbons in the new ring.\n4.  **Name the Product**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, the product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n5.  **Construct the Script**: The Python script will present the reaction equation and its product. To meet the user's specific request, the script will also explicitly print all the numbers found in the chemical formulas of the final balanced equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the product of the reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactant and product information\n    reactant1 = {\"name\": \"Butadiene\", \"formula\": \"C4H6\"}\n    reactant2 = {\"name\": \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\", \"formula\": \"C2Cl2F2\"}\n    product = {\"name\": \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\", \"formula\": \"C6H6Cl2F2\"}\n    reaction_type = \"Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition\"\n\n    # Explain the reaction\n    print(f\"The reaction between {reactant1['name']} and {reactant2['name']} is a {reaction_type}.\")\n    print(\"This reaction forms a six-membered ring, resulting in a single product.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Print the final reaction equation\n    print(\"The final reaction equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{reactant1['name']} + {reactant2['name']} -> {product['name']}\")\n    print(f\"{reactant1['formula']} + {reactant2['formula']} -> {product['formula']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Fulfill the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement\n    # The stoichiometric coefficients are all 1.
