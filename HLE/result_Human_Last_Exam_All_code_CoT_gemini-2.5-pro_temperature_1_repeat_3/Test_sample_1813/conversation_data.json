    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the corresponding quadratic equation:** The continued fraction associated with a generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is the continued fraction of the larger root of the quadratic equation $qx^2 - (3q - 2p)x + p = 0$. For the given case, $p=4$ and $q=7$.\n2.  **Determine the specific equation:** By substituting $p=4$ and $q=7$ into the general formula, I get the equation $7x^2 - (3 \\cdot 7 - 2 \\cdot 4)x + 4 = 0$, which simplifies to $7x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0$.\n3.  **Find the root to expand:** I will solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to find its larger root, $\\alpha$. The solution is of the form $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, which for this equation is $\\alpha = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{169 - 112}}{14} = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{57}}{14}$.\n4.  **Implement the continued fraction algorithm:** I will write a Python script that implements the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number like $\\alpha$. This algorithm iteratively finds the integer part of the number and then takes the reciprocal of the fractional part, repeating the process. To avoid floating-point precision issues, the calculation will be performed using integer arithmetic on the components of the number, which is of the form $\\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q}$.\n5.  **Detect the repeating cycle:** The continued fraction of a quadratic irrational is always periodic. The script will detect the start of the repeating block of coefficients by keeping track of the states $(P_i, Q_i)$ in the algorithm. When a state repeats, the cycle is found.\n6.  **Format and print the result:** The final output will present the quadratic equation and its root, and then display the computed continued fraction in the standard notation $[a_0; a_1, a_2, ..., \\overline{a_k, ..., a_{k+l-1}}]$, explicitly showing each coefficient as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n\n    This corresponds to the larger root of the quadratic equation:\n    q*x^2 - (3*q - 2*p)*x + p = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
