    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To determine what the word \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we must first look at the native Old English word and trace its likely evolution.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** Our modern word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which replaced the original Old English word due to the influence of Viking settlers.\n2.  **Find the Native Word:** The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was \"sweostor.\"\n3.  **Trace Hypothetical Evolution:** We will trace how \"sweostor\" might have evolved by comparing it to words that followed a native evolutionary path, such as \"brōþor\" (brother) and \"mōdor\" (mother).\n4.  **Simulate the Sound Changes:** We'll apply common English sound changes, such as the simplification of the initial \"sw-\" cluster (as seen in \"sword\" or \"answer\") and the vowel shifts that affected words like \"brother,\" to predict the modern form.\n5.  **Present the Result:** The final Python code will walk through this logic and print the resulting hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    without the historical influence of the Old Norse language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the modern word and its actual origin.\n    modern_word = \"sister\"\n    origin_word = \"systir\"\n    origin_language = \"Old Norse\"\n\n    print(f\"The modern English word '{modern_word}' is derived from the {origin_language} word '{origin_word}'.\")\n    print(\"This is a result of the Viking invasions and settlement in England.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original, native Old English word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"Without that influence, the native Old English word '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Show a parallel evolution with a similar word.\n    old_english_brother = \"brōþor\"\n    modern_english_brother = \"brother\"\n    print(\"To predict its evolution, we can compare it to a word with a similar structure that did evolve natively:\")\n    print(f\"'{old_english_brother}' (Old English) -> '{modern_english_brother}' (Modern English)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Apply likely sound changes to \"sweostor\".\n    # Change 1: The 'sweo-' prefix often simplified to 'su-'. The 'w' sound was lost after an 's',\n    # similar to how 'andswaru' became 'answer'.\n    # Change 2: The '-stor' ending would likely soften to '-ster', just as 'brōþor' became 'brother'.\n    print(\"Applying similar phonetic changes to 'sweostor':\")\n    print(\"1. The initial 'sweo-' sound likely simplifies to 'su-' over time.\")\n    print(\"2. The ending '-stor' likely softens to '-ster'.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Construct the final word.\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the Old English '{old_english_word}' would most likely have become:\")\n    print(f\"-> {hypothetical_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n<<<suster>>>"
