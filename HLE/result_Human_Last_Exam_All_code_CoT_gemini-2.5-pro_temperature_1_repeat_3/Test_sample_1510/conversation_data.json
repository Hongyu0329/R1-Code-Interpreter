    "To solve this, we first need to understand the problem. Wallpaper groups are the 17 possible repeating patterns on a 2D plane. Each wallpaper group has an associated point group, which describes the symmetries (like rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. The \"order\" of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe task is to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2. A point group of order 2 has exactly two symmetry operations: the identity (doing nothing) and one other operation. In 2D, there are two such point groups:\n1.  **C2 (or just '2')**: Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n2.  **D1 (or 'm')**: Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store a complete list of the 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their respective point groups.\n2.  Iterate through this list to find the groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n3.  Print the names of the wallpaper groups that match the condition.\n4.  Display the final count as a sum, showing a \"1\" for each group found, to meet the output requirement.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups.\n    # The dictionary maps the group name to the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        # Oblique lattice\n        'p1': 1, 'p2': 2,\n        # Rectangular lattice\n        'pm': 2, 'pg': 2, 'cm': 2, 'p2mm': 4, 'p2mg': 4, 'p2gg': 4, 'c2mm': 4,\n        # Hexagonal lattice\n        'p3': 3, 'p3m1': 6, 'p31m': 6, 'p6': 6, 'p6mm': 12,\n        # Square lattice\n        'p4': 4, 'p4mm': 8, 'p4gm': 8\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n\n    # Find groups with the target point group order\n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group_name)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group in found_groups:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n\n    # Calculate and display the total count as an equation\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    if count > 0:\n        # Creates a string like \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1\"\n        equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"\\nThe total count is calculated as: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nNo groups found with the specified point group order.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {count} wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
