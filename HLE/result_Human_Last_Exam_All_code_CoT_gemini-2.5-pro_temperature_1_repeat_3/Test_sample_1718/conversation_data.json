    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor is determined by its symmetries, which are enhanced on a Kähler manifold compared to a general Riemannian manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **General Case (for context):** I'll first state the formula for the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n2.  **Kähler Manifold Case:** I will then explain how the additional structure of a Kähler manifold (a parallel complex structure) imposes further symmetries on the Riemann tensor.\n3.  **The Formula:** I will provide the resulting, much simpler, formula for a Kähler manifold in terms of its complex dimension ($m$) and its real dimension ($n=2m$).\n4.  **Python Code:** Finally, I'll provide a Python script that takes the real dimension `n` of a Kähler manifold as input, calculates the number of independent components, and prints out the full calculation step-by-step.\n\n### Derivation:\n\nFor a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the symmetries of the Riemann tensor reduce the number of independent components to $\\frac{n^2(n^2 - 1)}{12}$.\n\nA Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with complex dimension $m$, which means its real dimension is $n=2m$. The existence of a compatible, parallel complex structure adds significant constraints. These new symmetries dramatically reduce the number of independent components. The Riemann tensor is entirely determined by components of the form $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$ (in a complex coordinate basis), and the number of independent real components is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{Kähler} = \\left( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\right)^2$\n\nSince $m = n/2$, we can express this in terms of the real dimension $n$:\n\n$N_{Kähler} = \\left( \\frac{(n/2)(n/2 + 1)}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{n(n+2)}{8} \\right)^2$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate this for you.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_kahler_riemann_components():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        n_str = input(\"Enter the real dimension of the Kähler manifold (must be an even positive integer): \")\n        n = int(n_str)\n        if n <= 0 or n % 2 != 0:\n            print(\"Error: The real dimension of a Kähler manifold must be a positive even integer.\")\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Please enter a valid integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Complex dimension\n    m = n // 2\n\n    # Number of ways to choose a symmetric pair of indices from m dimensions\n    intermediate_numerator = m * (m + 1)\n    intermediate_base = intermediate_numerator // 2\n    \n    # Final result is the square of the above\n    result = intermediate_base ** 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"\\nFor a Kähler manifold of real dimension n = {n}:\")\n    print(f\"The complex dimension is m = n / 2 = {m}.\")\n    print(\"The number of independent components is given by the formula: (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"(({m} * ({m} + 1)) / 2)^2 = (({m} * {m + 1}) / 2)^2 = ({intermediate_numerator} / 2)^2 = {intermediate_base}^2 = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_kahler_riemann_components()\n```\n<<<(m * (m + 1) / 2)**2, where m is the complex dimension>>>"
