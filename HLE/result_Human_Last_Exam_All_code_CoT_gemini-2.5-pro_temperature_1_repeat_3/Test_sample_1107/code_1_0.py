    # The main target is 'all'. Its prerequisites are ['T', 'Z', 'X', 'Opps'].

    # Step 1: Process prerequisite 'T', which depends on 'Opps' and 'X'.
    # 1a. Handle 'T's dependency 'Opps'.
    # 'Opps' (lowercase) does not exist and its rule 'Opps: T Z' has a circular dependency.
    # `make` breaks the circle and checks 'Z', which is up-to-date ('Z' > 'Y').
    # Since 'Opps' does not exist, its command 'touch T' is run.
    touch('T')    # File 'T' is created.
    touch('Opps') # Target 'Opps' is created.

    # 1b. Handle 'T's dependency 'X'.
    # Rule 'X: Y'. 'X' (1051) is older than 'Y' (1052), so the rule runs.
    touch('B') # File 'B' is created.
    touch('X') # Target 'X' is updated.
    
    # 1c. Build 'T'.
    # `T` is now older than its just-updated dependencies ('Opps', 'X'), so its rule runs.
    touch('A') # File 'A' is created.
    touch('T') # Target 'T' is updated.

    # Step 2: Process prerequisite 'Z'.
    # Rule 'Z: Y'. 'Z' is up-to-date, so nothing happens.

    # Step 3: Process prerequisite 'X'.
    # 'X' was already rebuilt and is up-to-date. Nothing happens.
    
    # Step 4: Process prerequisite 'Opps'.
    # Rule 'Opps: T Z'. 'T' was just updated and is newer than 'Opps'.
    # The rule for 'Opps' runs again.
    touch('T')    # File 'T' is updated.
    touch('Opps') # Target 'Opps' is updated.

    # Step 5: Process target 'all'.
    # All prerequisites are met. The command 'ls' runs but doesn't change files.
