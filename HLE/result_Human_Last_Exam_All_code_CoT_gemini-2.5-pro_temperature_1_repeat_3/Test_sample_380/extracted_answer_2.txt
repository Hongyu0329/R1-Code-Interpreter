The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. Therefore, for a physically meaningful calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves, one must perform a coordinate transformation and use the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local average magnetic field, not the radial direction.
