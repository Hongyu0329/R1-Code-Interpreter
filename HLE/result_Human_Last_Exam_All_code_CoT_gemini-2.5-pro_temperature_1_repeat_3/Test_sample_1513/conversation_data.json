    "Based on the clues provided, I will deduce the name of the island town. Here is my step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Extreme Isolation:** The key clue is \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\" This immediately narrows the possibilities to some of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, such as Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n    *   **Volcanic Geography:** The town \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\" This points to a location with specific volcanic features.\n    *   **Shared Name:** The bay and the town share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's extremely isolated but is not located in a bay that shares its name, nor is it situated within a caldera.\n    *   **Nuku Hiva (Marquesas Islands):** The town of Taioha'e sits in Taioha'e Bay, which is a volcanic caldera. This is a perfect fit for clues 2 and 3. However, it fails the isolation test, as other inhabited islands in the Marquesas are less than 100 km away.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is one of the most isolated islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (Pitcairn Islands) is over 2,000 km away, satisfying the first clue perfectly.\n        *   The main town is **Hanga Roa**.\n        *   The town sits on a bay named **Hanga Roa Bay**. This satisfies the shared name clue.\n        *   Easter Island is entirely of volcanic origin, with several notable volcanic calderas (like Rano Kau). The bay's coastline is a direct result of the island's volcanic formation. While the bay itself is not a simple, self-contained caldera, it fits the description of being \"formed by a volcanic caldera\" in the broader geological sense of the island's creation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Hanga Roa on Easter Island is the only location that strongly satisfies all the given conditions, especially the critical clue about extreme isolation.\n\nThe following Python code will print the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function holds the answer to the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.\n    Clue 1: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island -> Points to extreme isolation (e.g., Easter Island).\n    Clue 2: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera -> Points to a volcanic island.\n    Clue 3: Bay shares the town's name -> Narrows down the specific location on the island.\n    The town matching all clues is Hanga Roa on Easter Island.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_town = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(island_town)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
