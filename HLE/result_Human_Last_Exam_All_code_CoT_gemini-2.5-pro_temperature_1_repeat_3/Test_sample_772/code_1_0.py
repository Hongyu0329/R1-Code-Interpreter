    # manifold are key to solving the problem.

    # The problem is to find alpha where n(N) is closest to N^alpha.
    # We will establish this by finding lower and upper bounds for n(N).

    # Step 2: Lower Bound for n(N)
    # To find a lower bound, we consider a "worst-case" set X, which expands
    # as slowly as possible. A small geodesic ball around the identity is the
    # canonical example.
    # Let X be a ball of radius r. Its measure mu(X) in a d-dimensional space
    # scales with its radius as mu(X) ~ r^d for small r.
    # We are given mu(X) = 1/N. So, 1/N ~ r^d, which means r ~ (1/N)^(1/d).
    # The product set X^n (n products of X) for a ball X of radius r is
    # approximately a ball of radius n*r. To cover the entire group G, the
    # radius n*r must be on the order of the diameter of G, which is a constant.
    # So, n * r >= Constant  =>  n * (1/N)^(1/d) >= Constant
    # This implies that n must scale at least as fast as N^(1/d).

    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Upper Bound for n(N)
    # To find an upper bound, we need a result that holds for ANY set X
    # with mu(X) = 1/N. The Brunn-Minkowski inequality for groups provides this.
    # It states that for any two compact sets A and B in G:
    # mu(A*B)^(1/d) >= mu(A)^(1/d) + mu(B)^(1/d)
    # Applying this iteratively for X^n = X^(n-1) * X, we get:
    # mu(X^n)^(1/d) >= n * mu(X)^(1/d)
    # We need X^n = G, which is guaranteed if mu(X^n) = mu(G) = 1.
    # So we require: n * mu(X)^(1/d) >= 1
    # n * (1/N)^(1/d) >= 1  =>  n >= N^(1/d)
    # This means choosing n of the order N^(1/d) is sufficient for ANY set X.
    # n(N) <= C2 * N^(1/d)

    print(f"To ensure mu(X^n)=1, we need n^d * (1/N) >= 1, so n must scale as N^(1/d) = N^(1/{int(d)}).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    # Both the lower and upper bounds show that n(N) scales as N^(1/d).
    # Therefore, the exponent alpha is 1/d.
