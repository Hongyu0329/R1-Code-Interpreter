    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n approaches infinity.

    Based on the analysis, the problem simplifies to calculating the probability
    that for 8 independent events, none of them land on a specific forbidden outcome.
    Each event corresponds to a base type x (from 0 to 7).
    The number of occurrences of base x, modulo 8, must not equal x.
    For each base, there are 8 possible outcomes for its count modulo 8,
    so the probability of avoiding the one forbidden outcome is 7/8.
    Since there are 8 bases, the total probability is (7/8)^8.
