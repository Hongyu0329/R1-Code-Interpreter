    # The problem asks for the cardinality (count) of the set of colors
    # used to construct an x,y plane, while using the minimum number of colors possible *in that plane*.

    # The rules are:
    # - A Blue cube can attach to an Orange or a White cube in the same x,y plane.
    # - A White cube can be attached if it's adjacent to two cubes of different colors,
    #   OR if it's adjacent to an Orange cube in the z-direction.
    # - An Orange cube can be attached if it's adjacent to a White cube in the z-direction.

    # Step 1: Can the plane be made with 1 color?
    # No. A second cube of any single color cannot be placed.
    # - A blue cube needs a white or orange cube to attach to.
    # - An orange cube needs a white cube to attach to.
    # - A white cube needs two neighbors of different colors.
    # Therefore, the minimum number of colors is at least 2.

    # Step 2: Can the plane be made with 2 colors (White and Blue)?
    # If we only use White and Blue, we can't use the rules involving Orange.
    # - Let's start with a White cube (W). We can attach a Blue cube (B): W B
    # - Can we add another cube to the line? The new position is adjacent to B.
    #   - We can't place a White cube, as it needs two *different* colored neighbors. It only has one (B).
    #   - We can't place a Blue cube, as it must attach to a White cube.
    # This shows that without using the z-axis rules (which introduce the Orange color),
    # we get stuck and cannot tile a full plane.

    # Step 3: Use a 3-color "scaffolding" construction.
    # The key is to use an adjacent plane (e.g., at z=1) as a scaffold to help build our target plane (at z=0).
    # This allows us to use all the rules, including those involving the Orange color.

    # A valid, tileable pattern is as follows:
    # - Target Plane (at z=0): A checkerboard of White and Blue cubes.
    # - Scaffolding Plane (at z=1): A checkerboard of Orange and White cubes.

    # This construction is valid:
    # - A Blue cube in the z=0 plane is always next to a White cube in the same plane. (Rule met).
    # - A White cube in the z=0 plane is adjacent to Blue cubes in its plane and an Orange cube in the scaffolding plane above.
    #   Having a Blue neighbor and an Orange neighbor satisfies the "two different colors" rule. (Rule met).
    # - The scaffolding plane is also valid by similar logic.

    # Step 4: Determine the cardinality for the plane.
    # The question asks for the number of colors used *for the plane*, not the whole 3D structure.
    # Our constructed plane at z=0 is made of a checkerboard pattern using only White and Blue cubes.
    # The set of colors used in the plane is {White, Blue}.
