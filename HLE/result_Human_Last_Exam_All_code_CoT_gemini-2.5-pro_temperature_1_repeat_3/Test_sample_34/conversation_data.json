    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered by consulting a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening chart for the specified game conditions.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the answer:\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The game is a 100 big blind (BB) deep, rake-free, No-Limit Hold'em cash game. The action is an open-raise from the button (BTN). This is the most profitable position, allowing for the widest opening range. The lack of rake further incentivizes opening a wider range of hands, as there's no penalty for winning small pots.\n2.  **Evaluate Suited Jack Hands (JXs):** The value of a suited Jack hand is primarily determined by its kicker.\n    *   High kickers (A, K, Q, T) create very strong hands (JTs+).\n    *   Medium kickers (9, 8, 7) create strong suited connectors and gappers with good straight and flush potential.\n    *   Low kickers (6, 5, 4, 3, 2) have weaker flush potential (a Jack-high flush is vulnerable) and more limited straight potential.\n3.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** In a GTO strategy, the \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still profitable to raise rather than fold. For the JXs category, the profitability decreases as the kicker gets lower. GTO solvers show that in a rake-free 100BB game, the button's opening range is very wide and includes all suited Jacks. The hand with the lowest kicker, J2s, is the marginal hand in this category. It is the least profitable but still considered a standard open.\n\nThe following Python code will define all the suited Jack hands and identify the worst one based on this logic.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n    In poker, the value of a suited hand is strongly influenced by its kicker.\n    A standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) opening range from the button is very wide,\n    especially in a rake-free environment. This range includes all suited Jack hands.\n\n    The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest profitability, which is typically\n    the one with the lowest kicker. A lower kicker means weaker flush potential (a J-high flush\n    is more likely to be beaten) and weaker straight potential.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the card ranks in descending order of strength (Ace is high)\n    # The kicker is the second card in a JXs hand.\n    ranks = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'T', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2']\n\n    # Create a list of all suited Jack hands\n    suited_jacks = [f\"J{rank}s\" for rank in ranks]\n\n    print(\"List of all suited Jack hands, from best to worst:\")\n    print(suited_jacks)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The worst hand is the one with the lowest kicker, which is the last in the ordered list.\n    worst_hand = suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    # Deconstruct the hand name as requested by the prompt to show the \"equation\"\n    card1 = worst_hand[0]\n    card2 = worst_hand[1]\n    hand_type = worst_hand[2]\n\n    print(f\"The 'equation' for the hand is combining its components:\")\n    print(f\"High Card: {card1}\")\n    print(f\"Kicker: {card2}\")\n    print(f\"Type: {hand_type} (suited)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Based on poker theory, the worst suited Jack that is still a standard open from the button is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
