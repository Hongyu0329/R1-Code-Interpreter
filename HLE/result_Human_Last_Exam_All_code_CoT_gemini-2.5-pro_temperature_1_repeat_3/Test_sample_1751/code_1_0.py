    print("Step 1: Analyze the chemical structures of the two lipids.")
    print(" - C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0): This lipid is composed of two long, fully SATURATED hydrocarbon chains (an 18-carbon and a 16-carbon chain).")
    print(" - C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0): This lipid has one saturated 16-carbon chain and one MONOUNSATURATED 18-carbon chain, which contains a trans double bond.\n")

    print("Step 2: Relate structure to molecular packing in a monolayer.")
    print(" - The two straight, saturated chains of C16-dihydroceramide can align perfectly parallel to each other. This allows for strong van der Waals forces between chains, leading to very tight, efficient, and ordered packing.")
    print(" - The trans double bond in C16-ceramide introduces a small, rigid 'kink' into one of its chains. This kink disrupts the ability of the chains to align perfectly, reducing packing efficiency and leading to less ordered domains compared to its saturated counterpart.\n")

    print("Step 3: Connect molecular packing to surface area.")
    print(" - When a monolayer is compressed, the minimum surface area a lipid can occupy is determined by its cross-sectional area, which depends on how tightly it can pack.")
    print(" - Tighter packing results in a smaller cross-sectional area per molecule.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print(" - Because C16-dihydroceramide has a structure that allows for tighter and more ordered packing, its molecules will occupy less space.")
    print(" - Therefore, C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower surface area when compressed in a monolayer at an air-water interface.\n")

    final_answer = "C16-dihydroceramide"
    print(f"Final Answer: The lipid with the lower surface area is {final_answer}.")
