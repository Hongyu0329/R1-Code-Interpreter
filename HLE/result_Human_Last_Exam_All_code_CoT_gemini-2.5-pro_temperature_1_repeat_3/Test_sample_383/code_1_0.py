    # at long bond distances. This is a known artifact in quantum chemistry.
    # Let's analyze the provided statements.

    # Statement 1 Analysis:
    # It is true that different quantum chemistry software packages may have
    # different default settings for handling wavefunction stability and symmetry.
    # A package that defaults to strict symmetry enforcement will likely show this error.
    # Another package, or the same one with different keywords (e.g., to perform
    # a stability analysis), might automatically find the correct broken-symmetry
    # solution and produce a physically reasonable curve. So, statement 1 is a valid
    # practical observation.
    statement_1_is_correct = True
    
    # Statement 2 Analysis:
    # This statement is misleading. A standard Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculation
    # does not exhibit a pathological dip; it simply converges to the wrong, too-high
    # dissociation energy. The dip is characteristic of post-HF methods (like MP2)
    # when the underlying RHF reference is poor. Therefore, "using HF" is not the fix.
    statement_2_is_correct = False

    # Statement 3 Analysis:
    # This statement correctly identifies the fundamental issue. H2+ has high symmetry
    # and an odd number of electrons. At dissociation, a symmetry-constrained
    # wavefunction incorrectly delocalizes the single electron over both nuclei.
    # The true, lower-energy state requires the wavefunction to "break symmetry" and
    # localize the electron on one nucleus. This failure of the symmetric description
    # is the root cause of the problem.
