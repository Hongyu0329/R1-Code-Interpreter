    "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of the largest subset of integers in `[1, 823564528378596]` that can be represented as the union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** An antichain in the divisor poset is a set of integers where no element divides another. A union of `k` antichains is a set that can be partitioned into `k` such antichains. A key result from poset theory (the dual of Dilworth's theorem) states that a set is a union of `k` antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length `k+1`. In our case, `k=20`, so we are looking for the largest subset of `S = [1, 823564528378596]` that does not contain a divisibility chain of length 21 (e.g., `x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_{21}`).\n\n2.  **Apply the Known Result:** This is a classic problem in combinatorial number theory. A result by Erdős, Sárközy, and Szemerédi states that the largest such set is formed by all integers `m` in `S` for which the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is less than `k`. This exponent is often denoted as `v_2(m)`. So, we need to find the size of the set `{m ∈ S | v_2(m) < 20}`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The integers `m` where `v_2(m) < 20` are those that can be written as `m = i * 2^j`, where `i` is an odd integer and `j` is an integer from 0 to 19.\n    To find the total count, we can sum over the possible values of `j`:\n    *   For `j=0`, we count all odd numbers up to `n`.\n    *   For `j=1`, we count all numbers of the form `i * 2` (where `i` is odd) up to `n`, which is the same as counting all odd numbers `i` up to `n/2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   For `j=19`, we count all odd numbers `i` up to `n / 2^{19}`.\n\n    The total size is the sum of these counts:\n    Size = Σ_{j=0}^{19} (Number of odd integers `i` such that `i ≤ n / 2^j`)\n\n    The number of odd integers up to a limit `L` is `(L + 1) // 2`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will loop `j` from 0 to 19, calculate the number of odd integers for each `j`, and sum them up. We will print the full summation equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_antichain_union():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in\n    [1, 823564528378596] in the divisor poset.\n\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of integers m in the range\n    such that the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of m is less than 20.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 823564528378596\n    k = 20\n\n    total_size = 0\n    terms = []\n    \n    # We sum the number of odd integers up to n / 2^j for j from 0 to k-1.\n    for j in range(k):\n        power_of_2 = 1 << j  # Efficient way to compute 2**j\n        \n        limit = n // power_of_2\n        \n        # The number of odd integers in [1, limit] is (limit + 1) // 2\n        num_odds = (limit + 1) // 2\n        \n        terms.append(num_odds)\n        total_size += num_odds\n        \n    # Format the equation string with each term\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, terms))\n    \n    print(\"The size is calculated by the following sum:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_size}\")\n\nsolve_antichain_union()\n```\n<<<823563742966258>>>"
