    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Group and the Problem:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of order 512, denoted `SD_512`. The order is `2^9`, so we can use the general form `SD_{2^k}` with `k=9`. The standard presentation is `G = <r, s | r^(2^(k-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(k-2)-1)>`. For `k=9`, this becomes `G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>`.\n\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A \"power subgroup\" `H` of a group `G` is a subgroup that can be expressed as the set `H = G^n = {g^n | g in G}` for some integer `n`. Our goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze `G^n` based on `n`:** We'll analyze the structure of the set `G^n` based on the properties of the integer `n`. The key insight is to see how `n`'s divisibility by 2 affects the result. We can write any integer `n` as `n = 2^m * d`, where `d` is odd and `m >= 0`.\n\n4.  **Case 1: `n` is odd (`m=0`)**: When `n` is odd, it is coprime to the exponent of the group `G` (which is 256). In this situation, the mapping `g -> g^n` is a permutation of `G`, meaning every element of `G` is reached exactly once. Therefore, `G^n = G`. This gives us one unique power subgroup: `G` itself.\n\n5.  **Case 2: `n` is even (`m >= 1`)**:\n    *   **Subcase 2a: `n` is a multiple of 2 but not 4 (`m=1`)**: For any `n` of the form `2 * odd`, the set `G^n` is always the same: the cyclic subgroup `<r^2>`. This gives us a second unique power subgroup.\n    *   **Subcase 2b: `n` is a multiple of 4 (`m >= 2`)**: For any `n` of the form `2^m * odd` where `m >= 2`, the resulting set `G^n` is the cyclic subgroup `<r^(2^m)>`. We get a new, distinct subgroup for each value of `m` from 2 up to 8 (since `r^256 = r^(2^8)` is the identity). This gives us subgroups `<r^4>`, `<r^8>`, `<r^16>`, `<r^32>`, `<r^64>`, `<r^128>`, and `<r^256> = {1}`.\n\n6.  **Count the Subgroups:** By summing the counts from each case, we can find the total number of distinct power subgroups.\n\n```python\ndef solve_semidihedral_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n    A power subgroup H of a group G is a subgroup of the form H = G^n = {g^n | g in G}\n    for some integer n.
