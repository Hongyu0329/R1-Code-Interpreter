    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to calculate the left coprime factorization:\n\nFirst, we want to find a factorization of the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices that are left coprime. This is equivalent to finding a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is also a polynomial matrix, with the added condition that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nLet a row of $D(s)$ be the polynomial vector $v(s) = [v_1(s), v_2(s)]$. The product $v(s)H(s)$ must result in a vector of polynomials.\nThe first column of $H(s)$ is $[\\frac{s-1}{s+1}, \\frac{2}{s^2-1}]^T$. The product $v_1(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + v_2(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. Writing this over a common denominator gives $\\frac{v_1(s)(s-1)^2 + 2v_2(s)}{s^2-1}$. For this expression to be a polynomial, the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. This gives us two conditions:\n1.  At $s=1$: $v_1(1)(0) + 2v_2(1) = 0 \\implies v_2(1) = 0$.\n2.  At $s=-1$: $v_1(-1)(-2)^2 + 2v_2(-1) = 0 \\implies 4v_1(-1) + 2v_2(-1) = 0 \\implies 2v_1(-1) + v_2(-1) = 0$.\n\nThe second column of $H(s)$ is $[1, 0]^T$. The product $v_1(s) \\cdot 1 + v_2(s) \\cdot 0 = v_1(s)$ is already a polynomial, so this imposes no additional constraints.\n\nWe now need to find a basis of polynomial vectors that satisfy these two conditions. By searching for low-degree polynomial solutions, we can find a minimal basis. A suitable basis is found to be $\\{[s+1, 0], [1, s-1]\\}$. We use these two vectors as the rows of our matrix $D(s)$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to construct the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ based on this logic and prints the final factorization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    for the given transfer function matrix H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # As derived in the explanation, a polynomial basis for the rows of D(s)\n    # that clears the denominators in H(s) is {[s+1, 0], [1, s-1]}.\n    # We construct D(s) using these basis vectors as its rows.\n    row1 = sympy.Matrix([[s + 1, 0]])\n    row2 = sympy.Matrix([[1, s - 1]])\n    D = sympy.Matrix.vstack(row1, row2)\n\n    # Calculate N(s) = D(s) * H(s).\n    # The simplify() function is used to resolve the expressions and show\n    # that the result is indeed a polynomial matrix.\n    N = sympy.simplify(D * H)\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"The given transfer function H(s) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(H, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\nA left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is found.\")\n    print(\"The matrices D(s) and N(s) are:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N, use_unicode=True)\n\n    print(\"\\nSo, the final equation is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) where:\")\n    \n    # Printing each matrix element as requested.\n    d11, d12 = D.row(0)\n    d21, d22 = D.row(1)\n    n11, n12 = N.row(0)\n    n21, n22 = N.row(1)\n\n    print(f\"\\nD(s) = [[{d11}, {d12}], [{d21}, {d22}]]\")\n    print(f\"N(s) = [[{n11}, {n12}], [{n21}, {n22}]]\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_left_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<\nD(s) = [[s + 1, 0], [1, s - 1]]\nN(s) = [[s - 1, s + 1], [1, 1]]\n>>>"
