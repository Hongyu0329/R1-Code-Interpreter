    print("\nIn supersymmetric theories, the gauge kinetic function is a 'holomorphic' function of the complexified gauge coupling. Holomorphy is a powerful constraint from complex analysis that severely restricts the possible form of quantum corrections.")
    print("\nNon-renormalization theorems in supersymmetry are a direct consequence of this holomorphy, protecting certain quantities from receiving corrections.")
    print("\nHowever, to actually calculate quantum corrections (like the beta function or anomalous dimensions), we must use a 'regularization scheme' to handle infinities in loop integrals.")
    print("\nMany common schemes, like standard dimensional regularization (DREG), break supersymmetry and, crucially, the property of holomorphy. If holomorphy is broken by the calculation method, the foundation for the NSVZ formula is lost.")
    print("\nThe NSVZ formula is only valid in specific 'NSVZ schemes,' such as dimensional reduction (DRED), which are designed to be compatible with supersymmetry.")
