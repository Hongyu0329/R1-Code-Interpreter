    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of side stickers (non-top-facing) on the last layer that must be observed to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases you have.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** We will first determine if a small number of stickers, like 3, is sufficient. We can do this by finding a \"worst-case scenario\" - two different PLL cases that can look identical if you only observe 3 stickers.\n2.  **Test the Next Number:** If 3 stickers are not enough, the minimum must be at least 4. We will then check if 4 stickers are sufficient to distinguish the worst-case scenario found in the previous step.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the lower bound and sufficiency test, we can conclude the minimum number of stickers required.\n\nThis logical deduction can be demonstrated in a Python script that prints the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine if 3 stickers are enough.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Let's consider a worst-case scenario: distinguishing the Ga and Gb PLL cases.\")\n    print(\"Both of these cases can be oriented to show a 1x2 'block' of solved pieces on one side.\")\n    print(\"\\nIf we view the cube from the front and the block is on the left, we might see:\")\n    print(\" - Sticker 1 (Front-left corner, front face): Matches front face color.\")\n    print(\" - Sticker 2 (Front edge, front face): Matches front face color.\")\n    print(\" - Sticker 3 (Front-right corner, front face): Matches the RIGHT face color.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis 3-sticker pattern can be identical for both Ga and Gb permutations.\")\n    print(\"Because at least two different PLLs can produce the same 3-sticker view, 3 stickers are NOT sufficient to guarantee identification.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimum number must be more than 3.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Check if 4 stickers are sufficient.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Since 3 is not enough, the minimum must be at least 4.
