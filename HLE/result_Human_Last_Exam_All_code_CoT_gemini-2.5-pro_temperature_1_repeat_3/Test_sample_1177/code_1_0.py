        This case involves a contract for specific goods that were not in a deliverable state at the time of the agreement on {agreement_date}.
        Under the Sale of Goods Act, for the ownership (and thus risk of loss) to pass to the buyer, two conditions must be met:
        1. The seller must do what is necessary to put the goods into a deliverable state.
        2. The buyer must receive notice that the work has been completed.

        Condition 1 (Deliverable State): The text states, 'As promised, Jake replaced the screen'. This means the work was completed before the flood, and the MacBook Pro was put into a deliverable state.

        Condition 2 (Notice): On {notice_date}, Jake sent Luke a text stating the laptop would be ready for pickup on {pickup_date}. This constitutes notice to the buyer that the laptop was ready.

        Because both conditions were met before the flood occurred, the risk of loss for the ${purchase_price} laptop had legally passed from the seller, Jake, to the buyer, Luke.
        Therefore, Jake is not required to return the money. This corresponds to answer choice B.
