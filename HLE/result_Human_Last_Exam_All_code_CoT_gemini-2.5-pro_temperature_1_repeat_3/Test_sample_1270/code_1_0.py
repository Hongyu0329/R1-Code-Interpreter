# This script calculates the number of carbon atoms in the fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene".

# The structure is interpreted as a central benzene ring with three other benzene rings attached,
# reflecting the three-pointed star of the Mercedes-Benz logo.

# Number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
carbons_in_central_ring = 6

# The Mercedes logo has 3 points, so we attach 3 rings.
num_attached_rings = 3

# Each attached ring is a benzene ring, which has 6 carbons.
carbons_per_attached_ring = 6

# Calculate the total number of carbons.
# This is the sum of carbons from the central ring and all attached rings.
total_carbons = carbons_in_central_ring + (num_attached_rings * carbons_per_attached_ring)

print("The structure of 'mercedesbenzene' is interpreted as a central benzene ring with 3 attached benzene rings.")

print("") # for a newline

# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
