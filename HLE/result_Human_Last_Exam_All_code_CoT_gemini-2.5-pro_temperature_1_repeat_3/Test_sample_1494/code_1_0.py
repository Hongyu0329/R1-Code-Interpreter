    This function calculates the algebraic decay rate for ||dx rho(t)||_L2.

    The decay of the squared norm is dominated by the low-frequency (k -> 0)
    behavior of the system, which is diffusive. The decay rate for each mode k
    is proportional to k^2. The squared L2 norm of the x-derivative involves
    an integral of the form:

        integral(k^2 * exp(-c*t*k^2) dk) from 0 to infinity.

    This function calculates this integral symbolically to determine its
    dependence on t, which gives the decay rate of the squared norm. The
    decay rate of the norm is half the decay rate of the squared norm.
