    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark and then find African national flags with the same rank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:**\n    The problem states we should assume values are chosen to maximize the rank. Let's represent the flag as a matrix.\n    *   A flag with a pattern that only varies in one direction (like simple horizontal or vertical stripes) will have a rank of 1. For a flag with horizontal stripes, all columns are linearly dependent. For a flag with vertical stripes, all rows are linearly dependent.\n    *   The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. This pattern varies in both the horizontal and vertical directions. A row that intersects the horizontal part of the cross is different from a row that doesn't. Similarly, a column that intersects the vertical part of the cross is different from a column that doesn't.\n    *   Because the pattern has variation in two dimensions (horizontal and vertical), its matrix representation will have linearly independent rows and columns, giving it a rank greater than 1. Since the design is composed of these two fundamental directions, its maximal rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify African Flags with Rank 2:**\n    We need to find African flags whose designs also vary in both horizontal and vertical directions. These are flags that are not simple horizontal or vertical stripes. This category includes:\n    *   Flags with a canton (a distinct rectangle in the corner), like Liberia or Togo.\n    *   Flags with a triangle at the hoist, like Djibouti or Mozambique.\n    *   Flags with a central charge or emblem that spans across different stripes, like Kenya or Uganda.\n    *   Flags with diagonal elements (stripes, saltires, palls), like Tanzania, Burundi, or South Africa.\n    *   Flags with a vertical stripe next to horizontal stripes, like Madagascar.\n\n3.  **Generate the List and Code:**\n    Based on the criteria above, I will compile a list of all African nations whose flags have a rank of 2. The Python script below will then print this list.\n\n```python\ndef find_african_flags_with_rank_two():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of African nations whose flags,\n    when viewed as matrices, have a linear algebraic rank of 2.\n\n    The rank of the Danish flag is 2, as its Nordic cross pattern creates\n    variation in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n    A flag has a rank of 2 if its design is not composed solely of simple\n    horizontal or vertical stripes. This includes flags with cantons, hoist\n    triangles, central emblems spanning stripes, or diagonal elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of African nations with flags of rank 2\n    rank_two_flags = [\n        \"Algeria\",              # Vertical bicolor with central emblem\n        \"Angola\",               # Horizontal bicolor with central emblem\n        \"Burundi\",              # Saltire (diagonal cross) with central circle\n        \"Central African Republic\", # Horizontal stripes with an overlapping vertical stripe\n        \"Comoros\",              # Horizontal stripes with a hoist triangle\n        \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\", # Diagonal stripe\n        \"Djibouti\",             # Horizontal bicolor with a hoist triangle\n        \"Equatorial Guinea\",    # Horizontal tricolor with a hoist triangle\n        \"Eritrea\",              # Large hoist triangle extending to the fly\n        \"Eswatini\",             # Horizontal stripes with a central shield emblem\n        \"Kenya\",                # Horizontal tricolor with a central shield emblem\n        \"Liberia\",              # Horizontal stripes with a canton (square in the corner)\n        \"Madagascar\",           # Vertical stripe alongside horizontal stripes\n        \"Mozambique\",           # Horizontal tricolor with a hoist triangle\n        \"Namibia\",              # Diagonal stripe\n        \"Republic of the Congo\",# Diagonal stripe\n        \"Sao Tome and Principe\",# Horizontal tricolor with a hoist triangle\n        \"Seychelles\",           # Oblique (diagonal) bands\n        \"Somalia\",              # Solid field with a central star\n        \"South Africa\",         # A 'Y' shape (pall) creating diagonal and horizontal elements\n        \"South Sudan\",          # Horizontal tricolor with a hoist triangle\n        \"Tanzania\",             # Diagonal stripe\n        \"Togo\",                 # Horizontal stripes with a canton\n        \"Tunisia\",              # Solid field with a central disc and emblem\n        \"Uganda\",               # Horizontal stripes with a central disc emblem\n        \"Zambia\",               # Solid field with vertical stripes at the fly\n        \"Zimbabwe\"              # Horizontal stripes with a hoist triangle\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\")\n    print(\"The following African national flags also have a rank of 2:\")\n    for country in rank_two_flags:\n        print(country)\n\nfind_african_flags_with_rank_two()\n```\n<<<['Algeria', 'Angola', 'Burundi', 'Central African Republic', 'Comoros', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Djibouti', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Eswatini', 'Kenya', 'Liberia', 'Madagascar', 'Mozambique', 'Namibia', 'Republic of the Congo', 'Sao Tome and Principe', 'Seychelles', 'Somalia', 'South Africa', 'South Sudan', 'Tanzania', 'Togo', 'Tunisia', 'Uganda', 'Zambia', 'Zimbabwe']>>>"
