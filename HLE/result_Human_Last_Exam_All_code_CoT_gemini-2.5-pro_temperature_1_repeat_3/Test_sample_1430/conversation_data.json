    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to C**: First, we will use a known formula that connects the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, $\\rho(J(C))$. The formula is $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$. The degree $d=15$ is not essential to the formula itself, only that it is a positive integer.\n2.  **Find the Bounds for $\\rho(J(C))$**: The Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus $g=3$ curve is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. The value of $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the specific curve $C$.\n    *   **Smallest Rank**: For a generic curve $C$, its Jacobian has the minimal number of endomorphisms (just multiplication by integers). This leads to the smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group, which is $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    *   **Largest Rank**: For very special curves (those with complex multiplication), the Jacobian has a much larger endomorphism ring. The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by $g^2$. For $g=3$, the maximum possible rank is $3^2 = 9$. This maximum is known to be achievable by Jacobians of certain genus 3 curves (e.g., the Fermat quartic curve).\n3.  **Calculate the Final Ranks**: Using the formula from step 1 and the bounds from step 2, we will calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n    *   Smallest $\\rho(X) = (\\text{smallest } \\rho(J(C))) + 1$\n    *   Largest $\\rho(X) = (\\text{largest } \\rho(J(C))) + 1$\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus of the Riemann surface C\n    g = 3\n    \n    # The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n    d = 15\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the min/max rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({d}) for a curve C of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"The rank is given by the formula: rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1, where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Smallest possible rank of NS(J(C)) for a generic curve of genus g\n    # This corresponds to End(J(C)) = Z.\n    min_rho_J = 1\n    \n    # Largest possible rank of NS(J(C)) for a special curve of genus g\n    # This corresponds to a Jacobian with maximal complex multiplication.
