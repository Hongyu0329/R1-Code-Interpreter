    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the relationship between lambda and mu.
    # lambda is the minimal size of a family of functions F_L such that for any
    # function g, there is an f in F_L where f equals g on a set of size kappa^+.
    # mu is the minimal size of a family of functions F_M such that for any
    # function g, there is an f in F_M where f is greater than or equal to g
    # on a set of size kappa^+.

    # If f(alpha) = g(alpha), it immediately follows that f(alpha) >= g(alpha).
    # This means that any set of functions that satisfies the condition for lambda
    # also satisfies the condition for mu.
    # Since mu is the minimal cardinality for its condition, it must be less than or
    # equal to lambda.
    print("Step 1: We prove that mu <= lambda.")
    print("Let F be a family of functions witnessing lambda, so |F| = lambda.")
    print("For any function g, there exists f in F such that |{alpha : f(alpha) = g(alpha)}| = kappa^+.")
    print("On this set, it is also true that f(alpha) >= g(alpha).")

    # Step 3: Simplify the expression to be maximized.
    # The expression is Card(max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu})).
    # Since mu <= lambda, this simplifies to Card(lambda \ mu).
    # For infinite cardinals, if mu < lambda, Card(lambda \ mu) = lambda.
    # If mu = lambda, Card(lambda \ mu) = 0.
    print("Step 2: Simplify the expression Card(max({lambda, mu}) \\ min({lambda, mu})).")
    print("Since mu <= lambda, this is Card(lambda \\ mu).")
    print("To maximize this, we need to find the maximum possible value of lambda in a model of ZFC where mu < lambda.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 4: Use consistency results to find the maximum value.
    # The maximum possible value for any cardinal characteristic on the space
    # of functions from kappa^+ to kappa^+ is the total number of such functions,
    # which is (kappa^+)^(kappa^+) = 2^(kappa^+).
    # It is a known result in advanced set theory (provable by forcing) that it is
    # consistent to have the strict inequality mu < lambda.
    # Furthermore, it is consistent to have mu < lambda while lambda achieves its
    # maximum possible value, 2^(kappa^+). This can happen in a model where mu
    # is a relatively small cardinal (e.g., kappa^{++}) while 2^(kappa^+) is a
    # much larger cardinal.
    print("Step 3: Determine the maximum possible value of lambda.")
    print("The maximum possible value for lambda is 2^(kappa^+).")
    print("It is consistent with ZFC that mu < lambda and lambda = 2^(kappa^+).")
    print("Therefore, the maximum possible value for Card(lambda \\ mu) is 2^(kappa^+).")
