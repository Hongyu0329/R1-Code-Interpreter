    "To solve this problem, we need to decipher the SKI combinator expression, understand what Church integer it represents, and then calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the SKI Expression:** Break down the complex expression into smaller, recognizable parts.\n2.  **Identify Known Combinators:** Look for standard combinators like the successor function (`SUCC`) and Church numerals (e.g., `I` for 1).\n3.  **Reduce the Expression:** Apply the reduction rules of SKI logic symbolically to simplify the expression into a more understandable form, likely an application of Church numerals.\n4.  **Evaluate Church Numeral Arithmetic:** Determine the numerical value represented by the simplified expression. The application of one Church numeral to another, `n_c(n_b)`, corresponds to the operation `b^c`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Once we have the integer `n`, calculate `log_2(n)`.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** Write a simple Python script to perform the final arithmetic calculation and display the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **The full expression is:**\n    `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\n2.  **Identify sub-expressions:**\n    *   `I` is the identity combinator and represents the Church numeral for **1** (`n_1`).\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard combinator for the **successor function (`SUCC`)**. It takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` applies `I` to `I`. Let's see what it does to arguments `f` and `x`: `S(I)(I) f x` -> `I f (I f) x` -> `f (f x)`. This is the definition of the Church numeral for **2** (`n_2`).\n\n3.  **Substitute these parts back into the expression:**\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` becomes `SUCC(I)` or `SUCC(n_1)`, which is `n_2`.\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` becomes `SUCC(S(I)(I))` or `SUCC(n_2)`, which is `n_3`.\n    *   The expression simplifies to: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(n_2)))))(n_3)`\n\n4.  **Reduce the simplified expression:**\n    The expression has the form `S(I)(A)(B)` which reduces as `I B (A B)` -> `B (A B)`. We can apply this rule repeatedly from the outside in.\n    *   Let `E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(n_2)))) (n_3)`\n    *   This reduces to: `n_3 ( S(I)(S(I)(K(n_2))) (n_3) )`\n    *   Applying the rule again: `n_3 ( n_3 ( S(I)(K(n_2)) (n_3) ) )`\n    *   And again: `n_3 ( n_3 ( n_3 ( K(n_2) (n_3) ) ) )`\n    *   The innermost part `K(n_2)(n_3)` uses the `K` combinator rule `K x y` -> `x`. So, `K(n_2)(n_3)` reduces to `n_2`.\n    *   The fully reduced expression for our integer `n` is: `n_3(n_3(n_3(n_2)))`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Church Numeral Application:**\n    In Church encoding, applying numeral `n_c` to numeral `n_b` (written `n_c(n_b)`) is equivalent to calculating `b^c`. We evaluate our expression from the inside out:\n    *   `n_3(n_2)`: This corresponds to `2^3`, so it evaluates to `n_8`.\n    *   `n_3(n_8)`: This corresponds to `8^3`, so it evaluates to `n_512`.\n    *   `n_3(n_512)`: This corresponds to `512^3`.\n\n    So, the Church integer `n` is `512^3`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    We need to find `log_2(n)`.\n    *   `n = 512^3`\n    *   Since `512 = 2^9`, we have `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9*3) = 2^27`.\n    *   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# After reducing the SKI combinator expression, we found that the Church integer n\n# is equivalent to the value 512 raised to the power of 3.\n\nbase = 512\nexponent = 3\n\n# Calculate the value of n\nn = base ** exponent\n\n# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n).\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# We output the numbers involved in the final calculation to show our work.\nprint(f\"The integer n is calculated from the expression: {base}^{exponent}\")\nprint(f\"The value of n is: {n}\")\nprint(f\"The final question is to find log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<27>>>"
