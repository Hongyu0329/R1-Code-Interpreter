# Plan:
# 1. The problem requires finding the radius R of a sphere defined by the set of initial conditions
#    (x0(0), y0(0), z0(0)) for which the nonlinear boundary-value problem has a solution.
# 2. Applying the Fredholm alternative (a solvability condition) to the first-order approximation
#    of the system leads to the condition:
#    c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 = (1/2) * e^T * (e^T + 1)
#    where c1=x0(0), c2=y0(0), c3=z0(0).
# 3. The left side is the squared radius of the sphere of initial values in 3D space.
#    So, R^2 = (1/2) * e^T * (e^T + 1).
# 4. We are given T = ln(10^34), which means e^T = 10^34.
# 5. We will substitute this value and calculate R = sqrt((1/2) * 10^34 * (10^34 + 1)).
# 6. The script will print the components of the final equation and then the numerical result for R.

# The final equation for R^2 involves several numerical components.
# R^2 = factor_1 * factor_2 * (factor_3 + factor_4)
factor_1 = 0.5
base = 10
exponent = 34
factor_2 = f"{base}^{exponent}"
factor_3 = f"{base}^{exponent}"
factor_4 = 1

# Print the equation for R and its components.
print("The radius R is determined by the equation:")
print(f"R = sqrt({factor_1} * ({factor_2}) * ({factor_3} + {factor_4}))")

# For the calculation, we use Python's arbitrary-precision integers to handle the large numbers
# before the final conversion to a float and square root, ensuring high precision.
e_T_int = base**exponent

# Calculate R^2 = 0.5 * e_T_int * (e_T_int + 1)
R_squared_numerator = e_T_int * (e_T_int + 1)
R_squared_denominator = 2

# Perform the final calculation using floating-point arithmetic.
# Note that for numbers of this magnitude, the `+ 1` term has a negligible effect on the final float result,
# but we include it for formal correctness.
R_squared = float(R_squared_numerator) / float(R_squared_denominator)
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)
