    "To identify the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character 謄, we first need to analyze its structure.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji:** The character 謄 can be broken down into two parts: a left component and a right component.\n2.  **Identify the Radical:** The radical is the classifying component, which in this case is the left part: 月.\n3.  **Determine the Radical's Name:** The radical 月 has two origins: \"moon\" (月, tsuki) and \"flesh\" (肉, niku). When it appears on the left side of a character as a variant of 肉, it is called にくづき (nikuzuki). Given the context of many characters using this radical (like  Bauch 腹, Arm 腕, Lunge 肺), it refers to the body/flesh.\n4.  **Transcribe the Name:** We will convert the hiragana name にくづき into its Hepburn romanization, which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n\nThe following Python code will print the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n```python\n# The radical for the kanji 謄 is the left-hand component, 月.\n# This specific form of the radical is a variant of 肉 (niku), meaning \"flesh\".\n# When used as a radical on the left side of a character, its name is にくづき (nikuzuki).\n# The Hepburn romanization for にくづき is \"Nikuzuki\".\n# This script will print the final answer.\nprint(\"Nikuzuki\")\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
