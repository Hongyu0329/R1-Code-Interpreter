    This function represents the derivation of the field equation for Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity.
    The final equation is constructed based on the variation of the given action.
    S = -c^4/(16*pi*G) * integral(sqrt(-g) * Q * d^4x) + S_m
    The variation leads to G_munu(STEGR) = (8*pi*G/c^4) * T_munu, where G_munu(STEGR)
    is the Einstein tensor expressed in terms of non-metricity quantities.
    The expression for G_munu(STEGR) is known from the literature on Symmetric
    Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR).
