    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is known as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $Gr(3, 5)$.\n2.  **Identify the algebraic structure:** We are interested in the integral cohomology ring of this space, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  **Recall a key property:** A fundamental result in algebraic topology states that the integral cohomology ring of any real Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ is a free abelian group. This means it has no torsion elements other than the identity.\n4.  **Define the torsion subgroup and its rank:** The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. Since $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is free, its torsion subgroup is the trivial group, $\\{0\\}$. The rank of any finite group, including the trivial group, is 0.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final result. To satisfy the prompt's requirement to show numbers in an equation, the script will print a descriptive equation stating the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cohomology_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the parameters of the Grassmannian\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the space and the object of study.\n    print(f\"The problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of {k}-subspaces of R^{n}.\")\n    print(f\"This space is the real Grassmannian manifold Gr({k}, {n}).\")\n    print(f\"We are interested in the group G = H*(Gr({k}, {n}); Z).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: State the key mathematical fact.\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem in algebraic topology states that the integral cohomology ring of a real Grassmannian, H*(Gr(k, n); Z), is a free abelian group.\")\n    print(\"This is because the Grassmannian has a cell decomposition (the Schubert cells) which leads to a cellular chain complex with free homology groups.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Deduce the structure of the torsion subgroup.\n    print(\"A free abelian group, by definition, has no non-zero elements of finite order.\")\n    print(\"The torsion subgroup of a group consists of all its elements of finite order.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the torsion subgroup of H*(Gr(3, 5); Z) is the trivial group, {0}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the rank.\n    print(\"The rank of an abelian group is the number of Z summands in its free part.\")\n    print(\"The torsion subgroup is {0}, which is a finite group.
