    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj.\n2.  Then, I will recall the plot points related to this character's relationships.\n3.  The central relationship the main character, Adam Zamoyski, has is with a character named Angelina. Their union at the end of the book is the closest equivalent to a marriage in the story's context.\n4.  I will create a simple Python script to store this name and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The main character of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# The question asks for the name of the character he marries.\n# In the novel, his relationship with a Post-Human Angel (PNA) named Angelina\n# culminates in a unique form of union or integration.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(f\"The character that the main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries is named: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
