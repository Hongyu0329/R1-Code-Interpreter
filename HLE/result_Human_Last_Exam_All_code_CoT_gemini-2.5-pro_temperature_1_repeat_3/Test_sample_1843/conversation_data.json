    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: We first find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo the prime power factors $p_i^{a_i}$ of $N$.\n2.  **Primitivity Condition**: The character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Order Condition**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots)$. We require this to be $6$.\n4.  **Counting for Each Factor**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we determine the possible orders of primitive characters modulo $p^a$. A character modulo $p^a$ (for odd $p$, or $p^a=4$) is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. We then count how many of these characters have an order that divides $6$. The number of characters of a specific order $d$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n5.  **Combining Results**: We multiply the counts of valid characters for each prime power factor. We must also verify that any combination of such characters results in a total order of exactly $6$. This is confirmed because the constraints imposed by the factors $4$ and $9$ ensure the lcm is divisible by $2$ and $3$, and all component orders must divide $6$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of divisors of a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\n# Set the conductor N and the desired order\nN = 36036\nORDER = 6\n\nprint(f\"To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {ORDER}, we first factor N into prime powers.\")\nprime_factors = get_prime_factorization(N)\n# Sort factors for consistent output order, e.g., by p\nsorted_factors = sorted(prime_factors.items())\nfactor_str = ' * '.join([f'{p}^{a}' for p, a in sorted_factors])\nprint(f\"The factorization is N = {factor_str}.\")\nprint(\"A character is primitive modulo N if and only if its component characters are primitive modulo each prime power factor.\")\nprint(f\"We count the number of valid primitive characters for each factor whose order divides {ORDER}.\\n\")\n\ntotal_count = 1\ncounts_per_factor = []\nfactor_strings = []\n\nfor p, a in sorted_factors:\n    pa = p**a\n    \n    # Determine possible orders of primitive characters for p^a\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 2: # Conductor is 4\n            # Primitive character mod 4 has order 2.\n            primitive_orders = [2]\n        else: # Other powers of 2 (not relevant for N=36036)\n            primitive_orders = []\n    else: # p is an odd prime\n        phi_pa = phi(pa)\n        divisors_phi_pa = get_divisors(phi_pa)\n        if a > 1:\n            phi_prev = phi(p**(a-1))\n        else:\n            phi_prev = phi(1)\n        \n        divisors_phi_prev = get_divisors(phi_prev)\n        # A character is primitive if its order does not divide phi of the next lower power of p.\n        primitive_orders = [d for d in divisors_phi_pa if d not in divisors_phi_prev]\n\n    # Filter primitive orders to those dividing the required ORDER\n    valid_orders = [d for d in primitive_orders if ORDER % d == 0]\n    \n    count_for_factor = 0\n    for d in valid_orders:\n        count_for_factor += phi(d)\n        \n    counts_per_factor.append(count_for_factor)\n    \n    # Prepare explanation string for this factor\n    calc_str = \" + \".join([f\"phi({d})\" for d in valid_orders]) if valid_orders else \"0\"\n    val_str = \" + \".join([str(phi(d)) for d in valid_orders]) if valid_orders else \"0\"\n    \n    factor_strings.append(f\"For the factor {pa}: The number of primitive characters with order dividing {ORDER} is {calc_str} = {val_str} = {count_for_factor}.\")\n\nfor s in factor_strings:\n    print(s)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe lcm of the orders is guaranteed to be {ORDER} because the character choices for factors 4 and 9 ensure divisibility by 2 and 3 respectively.\")\nprint(\"The total number of such characters is the product of the counts for each factor.\")\nfinal_calc_str = \" * \".join(map(str, counts_per_factor))\nprint(f\"Total number = {final_calc_str} = {math.prod(counts_per_factor)}\")\n```\n<<<100>>>"
