    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to find the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` (which corresponds to `n` loops) in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n2.  **Address Ambiguity:** The request mentions \"for the electron or the photon propagators\". This is an important detail, as the number of diagrams is different for each.\n    *   For the electron self-energy, the sequence of diagram counts per loop (`n`) is: 1, 2, 10, 74, ...\n    *   For the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization), the sequence is: 1, 2, 8, 54, ...\n    For `n=3` (order 6), the value is 10 for the electron and 8 for the photon. The sequence for the electron self-energy is more commonly cited in general physics contexts, so I will proceed with that one.\n3.  **Determine the Calculation Method:** These sequences are the result of complex calculations in QED and do not follow a simple linear recurrence relation. The most reliable way to find `a(3)` is to use the known, published values from the physics literature.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the known sequence of diagram counts for the electron propagator in a dictionary.\n    *   Defines a function to look up the value for a given `n`.\n    *   Calls this function with `n=3`.\n    *   Prints the result in the format `a(3) = 10` to satisfy the output requirement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\n    of order 2n for propagators in quantum electrodynamics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for a(n), where n is the number of loops.\n    # The phrase \"for the electron or the photon propagators\" is ambiguous\n    # because the number of diagrams is different for each beyond 2 loops.\n    #\n    # Number of diagrams for electron self-energy vs. n (loops):\n    # n=1: 1\n    # n=2: 2\n    # n=3: 10\n    # n=4: 74\n    #\n    # Number of diagrams for photon self-energy vs. n (loops):\n    # n=1: 1\n    # n=2: 2\n    # n=3: 8\n    # n=4: 54\n    #\n    # We will assume the question refers to the more commonly cited electron\n    # propagator sequence.
