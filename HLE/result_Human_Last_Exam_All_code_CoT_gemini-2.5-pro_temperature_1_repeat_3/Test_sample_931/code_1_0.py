    # Step 1: Evaluate predatory habits.
    # Snakeflies are known predators, both as larvae and adults.
    # Their diet consists of small, soft-bodied arthropods.
    print("\n[Analysis of Predatory Diet]")
    print("- Totara Aphids (E): Aphids are a classic example of small, soft-bodied insects. Adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids. Therefore, E is a correct food source.")

    # Step 2: Evaluate supplementary diet.
    # Many predatory insects supplement their diet with sugars from plants.
    print("\n[Analysis of Supplementary Diet]")
    print("- Nectar (A): Scientific literature confirms that adult snakeflies supplement their diet with nectar and honeydew for energy. Therefore, A is also a correct food source.")
    print("- Māhoe pollen (B): Some sources also mention pollen as a supplementary food. However, Nectar is more commonly cited.")
    print("- Fungus (C): There is no significant evidence that snakeflies are fungivores.")
    print("- Karamū leaf tissue (D): Snakeflies are not herbivores and do not feed on leaf tissue.")

    # Step 3: Conclude based on the available options.
    # The evidence strongly supports that snakeflies eat both aphids (predation) and nectar (supplement).
