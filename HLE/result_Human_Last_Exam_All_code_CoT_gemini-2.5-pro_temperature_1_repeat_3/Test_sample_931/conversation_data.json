    "My plan is to analyze the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) based on established entomological knowledge.\n\n1.  **Research**: I will access my knowledge base regarding the feeding habits of the order Raphidioptera.\n2.  **Evaluate Food Types**: I'll consider each option provided:\n    *   **Predatory Diet**: Snakeflies are well-known predators. I will check if aphids are a typical prey item.\n    *   **Supplementary Diet**: I will check if they supplement their diet with non-prey items like nectar, pollen, fungus, or plant tissue.\n3.  **Synthesize Findings**: Based on the research, I will determine which of the listed food sources are consumed by adult snakeflies.\n4.  **Select the Best Answer**: I will compare my findings with the given choices (A-G) to find the most comprehensive and accurate answer.\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will create a Python script that prints this step-by-step analysis and outputs the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Evaluate predatory habits.\n    # Snakeflies are known predators, both as larvae and adults.\n    # Their diet consists of small, soft-bodied arthropods.\n    print(\"\\n[Analysis of Predatory Diet]\")\n    print(\"- Totara Aphids (E): Aphids are a classic example of small, soft-bodied insects. Adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids. Therefore, E is a correct food source.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate supplementary diet.\n    # Many predatory insects supplement their diet with sugars from plants.\n    print(\"\\n[Analysis of Supplementary Diet]\")\n    print(\"- Nectar (A): Scientific literature confirms that adult snakeflies supplement their diet with nectar and honeydew for energy. Therefore, A is also a correct food source.\")\n    print(\"- Māhoe pollen (B): Some sources also mention pollen as a supplementary food. However, Nectar is more commonly cited.\")\n    print(\"- Fungus (C): There is no significant evidence that snakeflies are fungivores.\")\n    print(\"- Karamū leaf tissue (D): Snakeflies are not herbivores and do not feed on leaf tissue.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the available options.\n    # The evidence strongly supports that snakeflies eat both aphids (predation) and nectar (supplement).\n    print(\"\\n[Conclusion]\")\n    print(\"The most complete answer must include both the predatory and supplementary food sources identified.\")\n    print(\"The diet includes Nectar (A) and Aphids (E).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct choice is F, which combines A and E.\")\n    \n    # Final equation format as requested\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation: Recorded Food = Nectar (from A) + Totara Aphids (from E)\")\n    print(\"Resulting Choice = F\")\n\n\n# Execute the analysis\nsolve_raphidioptera_diet()\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<F>>>\")\n```"
