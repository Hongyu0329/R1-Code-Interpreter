    Explains the solution to the Maxwell's demon thought experiment.

    The problem describes a physical apparatus attempting to realize the "Maxwell's demon"
    thought experiment. A one-way door separates two compartments of gas. The goal is to
    determine which experimental parameter is necessary for all the gas to end up on one side.

    1.  **Initial State & The Second Law:** The system starts at thermal equilibrium, with
        equal amounts of gas in equal compartments. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states
        that the total entropy (disorder) of an isolated system cannot decrease. Moving all
        gas to one side would be a massive decrease in the gas's entropy, which is forbidden
        for a system at thermal equilibrium.

    2.  **The "Demon" (One-Way Door):** For the device to work, the one-way door must
        reliably sort molecules. However, if the entire apparatus is at a single, uniform
        temperature, the door itself will experience random thermal motion (Brownian motion),
        just like the gas molecules.

    3.  **The Problem at a Single Temperature:** Because of its own thermal jiggling, the door
        will be knocked open by molecules from the "wrong" side just as often as it is from the
        "right" side. At thermal equilibrium, there is no net flow of gas. The door cannot
        function as a true one-way gate.

    4.  **The Solution - Breaking Equilibrium:** To make the door work, it needs energy to
        operate in a controlled manner and overcome its own thermal noise. This requires a
        temperature difference. If the door mechanism is at a different temperature than the
        gas (e.g., colder), it can use the flow of heat to power its sorting function. This
        allows the local entropy of the gas to decrease, but the total entropy of the
        entire system (gas + door + heat reservoirs) increases, satisfying the Second Law.

    5.  **Conclusion:** The fundamental parameter required for the demon to operate is a
        temperature difference.
