Yes, the theory can fail. The Python script above demonstrates this breakdown. The core reason is that the birefringent medium adds a new, polarization-dependent transformation to the system. The original theory's reversal procedure, which only accounts for the inverse of the random medium (`T_inv`), is no longer a correct inverse for the new, combined system. This mismatch between the actual system and the mathematical model used for the reversal causes the theory to no longer hold. As shown in the output, the calculated result `LHS` does not match the expected output `RHS`.
