    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Law of Sines and consider its ambiguous case (SSA). In a triangle ABC, let the side lengths opposite to angles A, B, and C be `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   `a = BC = S = SNYWR = 65294`.\n    *   `b = AC`.\n    *   Angle `B = 30°`.\n\n2.  **Apply the condition for the ambiguous case:**\n    For there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible values for the side `AB`), the length of the side opposite the given angle (`b = AC`) must be greater than the triangle's altitude from vertex A (`a * sin(B)`) but less than the other given side (`a = BC`).\n    The condition is: `a * sin(B) < b < a`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the values:**\n    *   `a = 65294`\n    *   `sin(B) = sin(30°) = 0.5`\n    *   `b = AC`\n    This gives the inequality: `65294 * 0.5 < AC < 65294`, which simplifies to `32647 < AC < 65294`.\n\n4.  **Count the integer values:**\n    We need to find the number of integers `AC` that satisfy this inequality. The smallest integer greater than 32647 is 32648. The largest integer less than 65294 is 65293. The total number of integers is `(65293 - 32648) + 1`.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate this for you.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values.\n# S corresponds to SNYWR on a phone keypad.\nS = 65294\nangle_B_degrees = 30\n\n# The side BC is 'a' in the standard a, b, c notation.\na = S\n# The side AC is 'b'.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the bounds for AC based on the ambiguous case condition.\n# The condition for two possible triangles is a * sin(B) < b < a.\n# sin(30 degrees) is exactly 0.5.\nlower_bound = a * 0.5\nupper_bound = a\n\nprint(f\"The given side BC = {a}.\")\nprint(f\"The given angle B = {angle_B_degrees} degrees.\")\nprint(\"For two possible triangles to exist, the length of side AC must be in the range (BC * sin(B), BC).\")\nprint(f\"This gives the inequality: {lower_bound} < AC < {upper_bound}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Count the number of integers in this range.\n# The first integer value for AC is the integer part of the lower bound + 1.\nfirst_integer_AC = int(lower_bound) + 1\n\n# The last integer value for AC is the upper bound - 1.\nlast_integer_AC = upper_bound - 1\n\nprint(f\"The smallest possible integer value for AC is {first_integer_AC}.\")\nprint(f\"The largest possible integer value for AC is {last_integer_AC}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total count.\n# The number of integers is (last - first + 1).\n# The final equation to calculate the count is:\nprint(f\"Final count equation: {last_integer_AC} - {first_integer_AC} + 1\")\nnumber_of_values = last_integer_AC - first_integer_AC + 1\n\nprint(f\"The number of integer values of AC is: {number_of_values}\")\n```\n<<<32646>>>"
