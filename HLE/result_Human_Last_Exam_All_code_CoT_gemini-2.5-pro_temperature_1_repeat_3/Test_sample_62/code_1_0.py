# The riddle uses wordplay to point towards a specific chemical molecule.
# "THEM" refers to molecules.
# The "peculiar shape" is the complex 3D molecular structure.
# "Cafi" is the phonetic start of the molecule's name.
# The "equation" with numbers is its chemical formula.

name = "Caffeine"
element_c = "C"
number_c = 8
element_h = "H"
number_h = 10
element_n = "N"
number_n = 4
element_o = "O"
number_o = 2

# Printing the name and the "equation" (chemical formula)
print(f"The correct name is: {name}")
print(f"Its chemical formula is: {element_c}{number_c} {element_h}{number_h} {element_n}{number_n} {element_o}{number_o}")
print(f"The numbers in the equation are: {number_c}, {number_h}, {number_n}, {number_o}")
