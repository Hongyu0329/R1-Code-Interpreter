    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the topological nature of the space P(X).")
    print("The space X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point.")
    print("The hyperspace 2^X of closed subsets of X is a compact metric space, hence a complete metric space (a Polish space).")
    print("P(X) is the subspace of sets corresponding to non-trivially convergent sequences.")
    print("An element K in P(X) is an infinite closed set whose derived set K' is a singleton.")

    print("P(X) can be shown to be a G_delta subset (a countable intersection of open sets) of the complete space 2^X.")
    print("A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is topologically complete, meaning it is a Baire space.")
    print("Therefore, the Baire Category Theorem applies to P(X).")

    print("\nStep 3: Show that P(X) is a perfect space (has no isolated points).")
    print("Since X is a connected metric space with more than one point, X itself has no isolated points.")
    print("This property allows us to slightly perturb any element K in P(X) to create a distinct element L in P(X) that is arbitrarily close to K.")
    print("This means P(X) contains no isolated points and is a perfect space.")

    print("\nStep 4: Combine the properties of P(X).")
    print("P(X) is a completely metrizable, perfect space. This makes it a perfect Polish space.")
    print("Any non-empty perfect Polish space is known to have the cardinality of the continuum.")

    print("\nStep 5: Analyze the intersection of open dense subsets.")
    print("Let G be the intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X).")
    print("By the Baire Category Theorem, G is a dense subset of P(X).")
    print("Furthermore, as a countable intersection of open sets, G is a G_delta subset of P(X).")
    
    print("\nStep 6: Determine the cardinality of the intersection G.")
    print("A key theorem of descriptive set theory states that any dense G_delta subset of a perfect Polish space is itself a perfect Polish space.")
    print("Therefore, G is a non-empty perfect Polish space.")
    print("Every non-empty perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.")
    
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The cardinality of the intersection is unequivocally the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print("This result does not change with different valid choices for X or the open dense sets.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is this value.")
