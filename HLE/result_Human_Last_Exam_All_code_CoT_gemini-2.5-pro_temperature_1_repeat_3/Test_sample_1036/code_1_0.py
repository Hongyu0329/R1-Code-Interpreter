    Calculates the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
    that have the property that n gives different remainders when divided by
    each of 2, 3, ..., 100.

    Let n be such an integer. Let r_k be the remainder of n when divided by k.
    So, n % k = r_k for k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.
    The problem states that the remainders r_2, r_3, ..., r_100 are all distinct.
    Also, by definition of a remainder, 0 <= r_k < k.

    The system of congruences n = r_k (mod k) for k in {2, ..., 100} has a
    solution if and only if r_i = r_j (mod gcd(i, j)) for all i, j.

    Consider j = m*i where m*i <= 100. The condition becomes r_{m*i} = r_i (mod i).
    Since 0 <= r_i < i, this implies r_{m*i} = r_i + q*i for some integer q.
    As all remainders are distinct, r_{m*i} != r_i, so q != 0.
    Also, r_{m*i} < m*i, so r_i + q*i < m*i, which implies q < m.
    So q must be in {1, 2, ..., m-1}.

    Let's analyze this for small m:
    - If m=2 (for k <= 50), q must be 1. So r_{2k} = r_k + k.
    - If m=3 (for k <= 33), q can be 1 or 2. But r_{3k} must be different from r_{2k} = r_k + k.
      So r_k + q*k != r_k + k, which means q != 1. So q must be 2. Thus, r_{3k} = r_k + 2k.
    - By induction, it can be shown that r_{mk} = r_k + (m-1)k for prime m.

    This leads to a general relationship. For any two coprime numbers a, b with ab <= 100:
    r_{ab} = r_a + (b-1)a = r_a + ab - a
    r_{ab} = r_b + (a-1)b = r_b + ab - b
    Equating them gives: r_a - a = r_b - b.

    This means the value C = r_k - k is a constant for all k that are pairwise coprime.
    By chaining this relationship (e.g., C(6)=C(5) and C(5)=C(7) implies C(6)=C(7), etc.),
    it can be shown that C must be constant for all k from 2 to 100.

    So, r_k = k + C for some constant integer C.
    From the condition 0 <= r_k < k:
    1. k + C < k  => C < 0
    2. k + C >= 0 => C >= -k for all k in {2, ..., 100}. This means C >= -2.

    The only possible integer values for C are -1 and -2.

    Case 1: C = -1
    r_k = k - 1. The remainders are {1, 2, ..., 99}. They are all distinct.
    This corresponds to a solution n = -1 (mod k) for all k.
    By CRT, there's a unique solution n <= lcm(1,..,100), which is L-1.

    Case 2: C = -2
    r_k = k - 2. The remainders are {0, 1, ..., 98}. They are all distinct.
    This corresponds to a solution n = -2 (mod k) for all k.
    The unique solution is L-2.

    So there are exactly two such integers.
