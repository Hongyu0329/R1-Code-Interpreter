    Question: By which mechanism can magnesium supplementation help lower blood pressure?

    Options:
    A. Through direct vasodilation
    B. By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition
    C. By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain
    D. By stimulating an inflammatory response
    E. It raises systemic blood calcium levels

    Reasoning:
    Magnesium acts as a natural physiological calcium channel blocker. Calcium ions are required for the contraction of smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels. By competing with calcium and inhibiting its entry into these cells, magnesium promotes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. This relaxation leads to the widening of blood vessels (vasodilation), which reduces resistance to blood flow and consequently lowers blood pressure. The other options are either incorrect or not the primary mechanism.
