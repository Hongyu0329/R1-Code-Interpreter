    Reasoning:
    A quotient dessin D_N is unicellular if and only if its automorphism group, G_N = G/N,
    is generated by the face permutation z_N. This implies G/N must be cyclic.
    However, if G/N is cyclic but the subgroup generated by z_N is a proper subgroup,
    D_N will have more than one face. For example, if G/N is Z_6 and <z_N> is Z_2,
    the number of faces is |Z_6|/|Z_2| = 3.
    Therefore, G/N being cyclic is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

    Solves part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the

    Reasoning:
    This requires two conditions:
    1. G is a "smooth quotient" of its socle N.
    2. G/N is cyclic (so that D_N can be unicellular).

    - Type HA (Holomorph of Abelian): G = N x| A. G/N = A. G is always a smooth
      quotient of N. We can choose A to be cyclic. So, HA is possible.
    - Type AS (Almost Simple): N <= G <= Aut(N). G/N <= Out(N). G is always a
      smooth quotient of N. G/N can be cyclic (e.g., for N=PSL(2,p^k), Out(N) can be
      cyclic). So, AS is possible.
    - Type TW (Twisted Wreath): G = T wr Z_l. G/N = Z_l, which is cyclic. G is a
      smooth quotient of N if and only if l >= 6 and l is not prime.
      Since there exist such values of l (e.g., l=6, 8, 9), the type TW is generally possible.
    
    All three types can satisfy the conditions.

    Reasoning:
    A smooth covering requires G to be a smooth quotient of its socle N.
    For type TW (G = T wr Z_l), a theorem states this is possible if and only if
    l >= 6 and l is not a prime number.
    We check this condition for all l in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
