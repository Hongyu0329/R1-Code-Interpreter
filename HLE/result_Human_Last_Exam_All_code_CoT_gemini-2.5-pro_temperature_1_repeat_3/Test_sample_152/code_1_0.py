# This script calculates the properties of Cell 9 based on the observed patterns.

# --- Step 1: Define known values and patterns ---

# Shape pattern: Groups of 3. Cell 9 is the third in the Triangle group.
shape_9 = "Triangle"

# Angle pattern: Arithmetic progression (0, d, 2d) for each group.
# We need to find the common difference 'd' for the Triangle group.
# Angle of Cell 7 (1st in group) is 0 rad.
# Angle of Cell 8 (2nd in group) is pi rad.
angle_cell_8 = math.pi
d_triangle = angle_cell_8  # Since Angle(j=2) = d

# --- Step 2: Calculate the angle for Cell 9 ---

# Cell 9 is the 3rd in its group, so its angle is 2*d.
# The final angle for description is taken modulo 2*pi.
angle_9_raw = 2 * d_triangle
angle_9_final = angle_9_raw % (2 * math.pi)

print(f"Angle Calculation: The common difference for the Triangle group is \u03C0.")
print(f"The raw angle for the 3rd item in the sequence is 2 * \u03C0 = {angle_9_raw:.4f} radians.")
print(f"The final angle is ({angle_9_raw:.4f} mod 2\u03C0) = {angle_9_final:.4f} radians.")

# --- Step 3: Calculate the number of dots for Cell 9 ---

# The number of dots is derived from the final angle using the rule: Dots = Angle / (pi/3)
pi_div_3 = math.pi / 3
dots_9 = angle_9_final / pi_div_3

print(f"Dots Calculation: {angle_9_final:.1f} / (\u03C0/3) = {dots_9:.1f}")

# --- Step 4: Format the final description ---

# Per the rules, an angle of 0 is described as "straight up".
arrow_description = "Arrow is straight up"

# Combine all parts into the final string.
# The number of dots should be an integer.
