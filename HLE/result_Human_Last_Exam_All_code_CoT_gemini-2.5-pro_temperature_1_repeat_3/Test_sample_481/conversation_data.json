    "Based on publicly available drug identification information, I will provide the numerical imprints for the two specified medications.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the unique numerical code imprinted on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n2.  Identify the unique numerical code imprinted on Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n3.  Write a Python script that declares these numbers as variables.\n4.  The script will then print a descriptive sentence for each, clearly stating the capsule's strength and its corresponding numerical imprint.\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint for Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsules.\nimprint_10mg = 3108\n\n# The numerical imprint for Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsules.\nimprint_20mg = 3109\n\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<The numbers are 3108 and 3109.>>>"
