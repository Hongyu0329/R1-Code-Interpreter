    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\) and then find its maximum possible value.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph G:** The graph \\(G\\) is defined as the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\), which we can write as \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\).\n2.  **Use the Property of Graph Sums:** The sum of graphs (also known as the disjunctive product) has a very useful property regarding its chromatic number. The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the product of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\n    For our graph \\(G\\), this means:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n + C_n + C_n) = \\chi(C_n) \\times \\chi(C_n) \\times \\chi(C_n) = (\\chi(C_n))^3 \\]\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(\\chi(C_n)\\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\(C_n\\) depends on whether its length \\(n\\) is even or odd.\n    *   **Case 1: \\(n\\) is even** (and \\(n \\ge 4\\)). The cycle is a bipartite graph, which means it can be colored with just two colors. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\).\n    *   **Case 2: \\(n\\) is odd** (and \\(n \\ge 3\\)). The cycle is not bipartite and requires a third color. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n4.  **Find the Maximal Chromatic Number of G:** To find the maximal value of \\(\\chi(G) = (\\chi(C_n))^3\\), we must choose the value of \\(n\\) that maximizes \\(\\chi(C_n)\\).\n    *   If \\(n\\) is even, \\(\\chi(G) = 2^3 = 8\\).\n    *   If \\(n\\) is odd, \\(\\chi(G) = 3^3 = 27\\).\n    Comparing these two results, the maximal chromatic number for \\(G\\) is 27, which occurs when \\(n\\) is any odd integer.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this maximal value based on the logic described.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chromatic number of a graph G = G1 + G2 + ... + Gk is chi(G) = chi(G1) * chi(G2) * ... * chi(Gk).\n    # In our case, G = C_n + C_n + C_n, so chi(G) = chi(C_n)^3.\n\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on n:\n    # chi(C_n) = 2 if n is even.\n    # chi(C_n) = 3 if n is odd.\n\n    # To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we must use the maximal\n    # possible value for chi(C_n).\n    chi_cn_even = 2\n    chi_cn_odd = 3\n    max_chi_cn = max(chi_cn_even, chi_cn_odd)\n\n    # The number of cycles being summed.\n    num_cycles = 3\n\n    # The maximal chromatic number of G is (max_chi_cn) ^ num_cycles.\n    maximal_chi_g = math.pow(max_chi_cn, num_cycles)\n\n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number of G is found by maximizing chi(C_n).\")\n    print(f\"The maximum chromatic number for a single cycle C_n is {max_chi_cn} (when n is odd).\")\n    print(f\"The graph G is the sum of {num_cycles} such cycles.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the maximal chromatic number of G is:\")\n    # Print each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cn} ^ {num_cycles} = {int(maximal_chi_g)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<27>>>"
