# Based on the derived formula for the probability P(A wins) when F=1/2,
# P(1/2) = 19/96 + (4 - 3*sqrt(3))/(12*pi).
# We calculate this value and then find the floor of its reciprocal.

# The numbers in the equation for P(1/2)
num1 = 19
den1 = 96
num2_val1 = 4
num2_val2 = 3
num2_val3 = 3  # inside the square root
den2_val = 12

# Calculate the first term
term1 = num1 / den1

# Calculate the second term
term2 = (num2_val1 - num2_val2 * math.sqrt(num2_val3)) / (den2_val * math.pi)

# Calculate the probability P(A wins)
p_A_wins = term1 + term2

# Calculate the reciprocal of the probability
reciprocal_p = 1 / p_A_wins

# Find the floor of the reciprocal
final_answer = math.floor(reciprocal_p)

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# Here is the final equation we are solving: floor(1 / P)
# where P = 19/96 + (4 - 3*sqrt(3))/(12*pi)
