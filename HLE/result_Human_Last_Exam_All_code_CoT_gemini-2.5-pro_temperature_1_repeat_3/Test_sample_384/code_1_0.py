# The user wants to identify the least plausible explanation for the missing kanji
# in the Bansenshukai, based on the evidence provided.

# The key evidence is that all known transcriptions have the *exact same* pattern of missing characters.
# This points to a systematic cause (e.g., censorship, a feature of the original design)
# rather than a random one.

# Let's analyze the options:
# A, B, C, D, E, F, H all describe systematic causes that could lead to a uniform result across all copies.
# - A: Author's own removal.
# - B, C, D: Censorship/redaction by various groups.
# - E, F: Original design features (invisible ink, mnemonic).
# - H: A consistent misinterpretation of original symbols.

# G: Physical deterioration from overhandling. This is a random, gradual process.
# It is extremely unlikely that random wear-and-tear would produce the exact same
# pattern of missing characters in every single copy made over time.
# Therefore, this is the least plausible explanation.

least_plausible_option = 'G'

print(f"The least plausible explanation is option: {least_plausible_option}")
print("This theory suggests physical deterioration from overhandling, which is a random process.")
print("Such a random process cannot explain why all surviving transcriptions show the exact same uniform pattern of missing kanji.")
