    This function estimates the measure of the set Omega by performing a
    Monte Carlo simulation based on a prior qualitative analysis.

    The system of ODEs is:
    a'(t) = -b(t) * a(t)
    b'(t) = -b(t)^2 / 2 - a(t)^2 + 6*(a(t) - 1)

    Our analysis suggests that no trajectory starting in [-1, 1] x [2, 3]
    will lead to a(t) -> +inf and b(t) -> -inf. We expect the measure
    of Omega to be 0. This simulation serves as a numerical verification.
