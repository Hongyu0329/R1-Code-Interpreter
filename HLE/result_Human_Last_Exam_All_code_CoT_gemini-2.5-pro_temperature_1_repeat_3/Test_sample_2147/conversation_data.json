    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian, was a staunch advocate for rationalism and classical liberalism. He was highly critical of the Modernist art movements that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which he viewed as decadent, irrational, and lacking social purpose. His famous phrase, \"stagnant swamp,\" was directed at the artists and writers of these movements.\n\nThe term \"X-Y\" you're looking for refers to the practitioners of Decadence and Symbolism, two closely related artistic and literary movements that Milyukov often grouped together in his criticism.\n\nHere is a Python script to reveal the answer.\n\n```python\n# Pavel Milyukov's criticism was aimed at contemporary art movements.\n# He was a rationalist who found these movements to be a sign of cultural decay.\n\nX = \"Decadent\"\nY = \"Symbolists\"\n\n# He denounced the Decadent-Symbolists as a \"stagnant swamp\".\nprint(\"The term X-Y Milyukov denounced is:\")\nprint(f\"{X}-{Y}\")\n```\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
