    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological properties of Feynman diagrams. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key relationships for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   The formula for the number of loops (L): `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators) and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   The relationship connecting the number of lines and vertices: `Î£ (n * V_n) = 2*I + E`, where `V_n` is the number of vertices with `n` lines, `I` is the number of internal lines, and `E` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Apply the problem's constraints:**\n    *   We are given `L = 2`.\n    *   To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we should consider the simplest possible diagrams, which are vacuum diagrams with no external lines (`E = 0`).\n    *   We will also assume all vertices are of the same type `n` (e.g., all are 3-point vertices in a `phi^3` theory, or all are 4-point vertices in a `phi^4` theory). So the second formula simplifies to `n * V = 2 * I`.\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:**\n    *   From `L = 2`, the first formula becomes `2 = I - V + 1`, which we can rearrange to `I = V + 1`.\n    *   Substitute this into the second formula: `n * V = 2 * (V + 1)`.\n    *   Solve this equation for `V`: `n*V = 2V + 2` -> `V*(n - 2) = 2` -> `V = 2 / (n - 2)`.\n\n4.  **Find the minimum integer solution:**\n    *   Since `V` must be a positive integer, `(n - 2)` must be a positive integer divisor of 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n    *   Interaction vertices require `n >= 3`.\n    *   We will check the cases for `n=3` and `n=4` to find which one gives the minimum `V`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # L = number of loops\n    # V = number of vertices\n    # I = number of internal lines\n    # n = number of lines at each vertex (interaction type)\n    \n    L = 2\n    print(f\"The problem states the diagram has L = {L} loops.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # From the topological formula L = I - V + 1, we get I = V + L - 1.\n    # For L=2, this is I = V + 1.\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the loop formula L = I - V + 1.\")\n    print(f\"For L={L}, we have 2 = I - V + 1, which rearranges to: I = V + 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # For a vacuum diagram (no external lines), n * V = 2 * I.\n    # Substituting I = V + 1 gives: n * V = 2 * (V + 1)\n    # This simplifies to V * (n - 2) = 2.\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the vertex-line formula n * V = 2 * I (for vacuum diagrams).\")\n    print(\"Substituting 'I' from Step 1, we get n * V = 2 * (V + 1).\")\n    print(\"Solving for V gives the final equation: V * (n - 2) = 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the minimum integer V by testing valid interaction types 'n'.\")\n    print(\"An interaction vertex must have at least n=3 lines.\")\n    \n    min_V = float('inf')\n    result_details = {}\n\n    # We need V to be a positive integer.\n    # From V = 2 / (n - 2), this means (n - 2) must be a positive divisor of 2.\n    # The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n    for divisor in [1, 2]:\n        n_minus_2 = divisor\n        n = n_minus_2 + 2\n        V = 2 // n_minus_2\n        \n        print(f\"\\nTesting case where (n - 2) = {n_minus_2}:\")\n        print(f\"This corresponds to an interaction type n = {n}.\")\n        print(f\"Number of vertices V = 2 / {n_minus_2} = {V}.\")\n        \n        if V < min_V:\n            min_V = V\n            result_details = {'V': V, 'n': n, 'n_minus_2': n_minus_2}\n\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices found is {min_V}.\")\n    print(f\"This is achievable in a phi^{result_details['n']} theory.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal equation for the minimal case:\")\n    V_final = result_details['V']\n    n_final = result_details['n']\n    n_minus_2_final = result_details['n_minus_2']\n    \n    # Printing each number in the final equation: V * (n - 2) = 2\n    print(f\"{V_final} * ({n_final} - 2) = 2\")\n    print(f\"{V_final} * {n_minus_2_final} = 2\")\n\nsolve_feynman_vertices()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
