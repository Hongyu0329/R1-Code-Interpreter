    This function analyzes the network transformation problem and determines the correct statement.

    The core of the problem is the transformation from a small-world network (L ~ log(n))
    to an ultra-small-world network (L ~ log(log(n))). This drastic reduction in average path length
    is not possible with simple random connections.

    Analysis of key properties and constraints:
    1.  Ultra-small-world property (L ~ log(log(n))): This is the defining feature of the target graph.
        In network science, this property is strongly associated with hierarchical or recursive structures.
        In such a structure, nodes are organized in clusters, which are part of super-clusters, and so on.
        This multi-level organization allows for extremely efficient long-distance navigation.

    2.  Hierarchical Structure: A hierarchy is fundamentally "tree-like". The connections between different
        clusters and super-clusters form a macroscopic structure that resembles a tree, ensuring that there
        is a structured path between any two points without excessive redundancy.

    3.  High-Degree Vertices: The vertices that act as "gateways" or "portals" between different levels
        of the hierarchy will naturally have a higher degree than average, as they handle long-range traffic.
        The rewired edges are precisely the ones used to build this hierarchical backbone connecting these
        high-degree vertices.

    Evaluation of the most plausible options:
    -   Option B (m(n) in Theta(n)): This is highly likely to be true. Building a new global topology requires
        rewiring a number of edges proportional to the size of the graph, i.e., Theta(n).
    -   Option C (The rewired edges must form a tree-like structure among high-degree vertices): This statement
        describes the qualitative nature of the structure that must be built to achieve the L ~ log(log(n))
        property. It is the reason *why* the transformation works. The necessity of this structure implies
        that Theta(n) rewirings are needed (C implies B). Therefore, C is a more fundamental and descriptive answer.
    -   Option J (Densely connected core): This structure leads to an average path length of O(1), which is
        not log(log(n)).
    -   Other options related to degree distribution or specific numerical bounds (like H) are either incorrect
        or much harder to justify as strictly necessary without knowing the exact optimal transformation algorithm.

    Conclusion: The most accurate and essential statement is C, as it describes the necessary topology for an
    ultra-small-world network.
