    explanation = """
    The question asks for the property equivalent to a function f being continuous,
    expressed in the language of nonstandard analysis.

    Let's analyze the options:
    - A states that for any two *standard* points, if they are infinitesimally close, their images are.
      For standard points in a T1 space, 'infinitesimally close' means 'identical'. This makes the
      statement trivial and true for any function.

    - B states that for any *standard* point x0 and any point x1 (standard or nonstandard),
      if x1 is infinitesimally close to x0, then f(x1) is infinitesimally close to f(x0).
      This is the textbook nonstandard definition of continuity. It means that the function maps
      the monad of any standard point into the monad of its image. This is equivalent to the
      standard epsilon-delta (or neighborhood) definition of continuity.

    - C is a stronger statement where both x0 and x1 can be nonstandard points. This property
      is equivalent to *uniform continuity*, not just continuity.

    - D, E, and F are converses or relate to other properties like injectivity.
      - D is the definition of injectivity for standard points.
      - E is the converse of B and fails for functions like sin(x).
      - F is the converse of C and fails for functions like x^2.

    Therefore, the correct equivalent property for continuity is B.
