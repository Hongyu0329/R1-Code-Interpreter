    Analyzes statements about St. Augustine's philosophy to find the incorrect one.

    # Statement A: Augustine's approach seen as Calvinist in nature due to predestination.
    # Analysis A: This is a common and credible scholarly argument. Augustine's later anti-Pelagian writings
    # heavily emphasize grace and predestination, which were foundational for John Calvin's theology.
    # Thus, this statement is considered correct.

    # Statement B: R. A. Markus argued Augustine's view of freedom was asymmetrical, while ignoring
    # his thoughts on predestination and grace.
    # Analysis B: R. A. Markus is a major scholar of Augustine. While he did offer nuanced interpretations
    # of Augustine's views on freedom and society, the claim that he would *ignore* central concepts like
    # predestination and grace is extremely unlikely and misrepresents scholarly practice. A scholar of his
    # stature would engage with, not ignore, such fundamental doctrines. This makes the statement highly suspect.

    # Statement C: Augustine, echoing Seneca, determined that the "voluntas" (will) was a part of the human psyche.
    # Analysis C: This is correct. The "voluntas" is a central faculty in Augustine's psychology.
    # As a classically educated figure, he was familiar with Stoic (e.g., Seneca) and other philosophical
    # traditions that also emphasized the will's role in human action.

    # Statement D: For Augustine, it's impossible to separate philosophy and theology.
    # Analysis D: This is a cornerstone of Augustinian thought. He famously practiced "faith seeking understanding"
    # (fides quaerens intellectum), using philosophical tools to explore and explain theological truths.
    # This statement is correct.

    # Statement E: Etiene Gilson argued Augustine's idea of grace was "irresistible" but not in the Jansenist form.
    # Analysis E: This is a plausible and nuanced scholarly position. Ã‰tienne Gilson, a prominent historian of
    # medieval philosophy, would likely make such a distinction, affirming the Augustinian root of "irresistible grace"
    # while differentiating it from the later, condemned Jansenist interpretation. This statement is correct.

    # Statement F: Augustine argued against Evodius that man "wills" his own acts and is responsible for them.
    # Analysis F: This accurately summarizes a key argument from Augustine's early work "On Free Choice of the Will"
    # ("De libero arbitrio"), where Evodius is his interlocutor. He argues that evil stems from the misuse of the will,
    # for which the individual is responsible. This statement is correct.

    # Conclusion: Statement B makes a false claim about the work of a renowned historian. It is not credible
    # that a scholar like R.A. Markus would simply ignore the core doctrines of predestination and grace
    # in his analysis of Augustine's view of freedom.

    print("The incorrect statement is B.")
    print("Reasoning: R. A. Markus is a prominent scholar of Augustine. It is a mischaracterization of his work to claim that he ignored Augustine's thoughts on predestination and grace. Scholarly work on Augustine's concept of freedom must, by necessity, engage with these central themes, even if to interpret them in a new light. Therefore, the assertion that he ignored them is not correct.")
