def solve_graph_process_bounds():
    """
    This function determines the asymptotic bounds for the number of steps in a graph process.

    The reasoning is based on a theoretical analysis of the game's rules:
    1.  It can be shown that the number of steps (T) is tightly bound by the initial maximum degree (Δ) of the forest, such that T = Θ(Δ).
        - The upper bound T = O(Δ) is proven by considering the minimum life loss of any vertex per step.
        - The lower bound T = Ω(Δ) is demonstrated by constructing a "bamboo-like" tree that is "peeled" one vertex at a time, taking Θ(Δ) steps.

    2.  Based on T = Θ(Δ), we analyze the three cases:
        - Case 1: Max degree Δ <= sqrt(log n).
          The max steps f1(n) = Θ(sqrt(log n)) = Θ((log n)^0.5).
          This falls into category 6: f(n) = 2^ω(sqrt(log(log(n)))) but O((log n)^0.9).

        - Case 2: Max degree Δ <= log n.
          The max steps f2(n) = Θ(log n).
          This falls into category 8: f(n) = Θ(log n).

        - Case 3: Any forest.
          The construction that maximizes T for a given n yields T = Θ(sqrt(n)).
          This falls into category 9: f(n) = ω(log n).
