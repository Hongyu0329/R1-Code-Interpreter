    "Of all the noble gases, Radon (Rn) is the rarest on Earth. This is because it is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust and has a very short half-life (its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days). Consequently, its concentration in the atmosphere and crust is extremely low at any given moment.\n\nThe abundance of Radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be about 4 x 10⁻¹⁹ by mass fraction. The following Python code calculates what this abundance is as a percentage.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas and calculates its\n    abundance as a percentage of terrestrial matter.\n\n    The rarest noble gas is Radon (Rn). Its rarity is due to its\n    radioactivity and short half-life. Its abundance is best estimated\n    from its concentration in the Earth's crust.\n\n    - Rarest Noble Gas: Radon (Rn)\n    - Estimated abundance in Earth's crust (mass fraction): 4.0 x 10^-19\n    \"\"\"\n\n    gas_name = \"Radon (Rn)\"\n    # The abundance of Radon in the Earth's crust by mass fraction.\n    abundance_mass_fraction = 4.0e-19\n\n    # Convert the mass fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n    percentage = abundance_mass_fraction * 100\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth as of 2002 is {gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its abundance as a mass fraction in the Earth's crust is extremely low.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the abundance as a percentage, we perform the following calculation:\")\n    \n    # Using '{:e}' to format the numbers in scientific notation for clarity.\n    print(f\"{abundance_mass_fraction:e} (mass fraction) * 100 = {percentage:e}%\")\n\ncalculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage()\n```\n<<<Radon (Rn)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
