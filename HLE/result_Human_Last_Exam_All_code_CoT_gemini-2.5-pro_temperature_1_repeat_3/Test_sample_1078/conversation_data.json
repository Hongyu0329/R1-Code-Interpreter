    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type, which are Aₙ, Bₙ, Cₙ, Dₙ, E₆, E₇, E₈, F₄, and G₂.\n2.  **Identify by Rank:** The rank of the Weyl group corresponds to the number of vertices in its associated Dynkin diagram (the subscript `n` for the classical types A, B, C, D). We need to find all such diagrams with 4 vertices.\n    *   **A₄**: This is a valid type of rank 4.\n    *   **B₄** and **C₄**: These are valid types of rank 4.\n    *   **D₄**: This is a valid type of rank 4.\n    *   **F₄**: This is a valid type of rank 4.\n    *   The exceptional types E₆, E₇, E₈, and G₂ do not have rank 4.\n3.  **Check for Isomorphisms:** We need to see if any of the groups from the identified types are isomorphic.\n    *   It's a standard result that the Weyl groups W(Bₙ) and W(Cₙ) are isomorphic for n ≥ 2. Therefore, W(B₄) and W(C₄) represent the same isomorphism class.\n    *   To check if the remaining candidates (W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄)) are distinct, we can compare their orders (number of elements).\n        *   Order of W(A₄) = (4+1)! = 120\n        *   Order of W(B₄) = 2⁴ × 4! = 16 × 24 = 384\n        *   Order of W(D₄) = 2⁴⁻¹ × 4! = 8 × 24 = 192\n        *   Order of W(F₄) = 1152\n    *   Since all four groups have different orders, they cannot be isomorphic.\n4.  **Count the Groups:** We have found four distinct, non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4: W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), and W(F₄).\n\nThe following Python code lists these groups and calculates the total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are determined by the\n    # finite-type Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices.\n    # These are A_4, B_4, C_4, D_4, and F_4.\n    # The Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so they count as one type.\n    # The other types (A_4, D_4, F_4) are non-isomorphic to each other or to B_4.\n    # We can confirm they are non-isomorphic by checking their orders.\n\n    groups = {\n        \"A_4\": {\n            \"count\": 1,\n            \"order_formula\": \"5!\",\n            \"order_value\": math.factorial(5)\n        },\n        \"B_4 / C_4\": {\n            \"count\": 1,\n            \"order_formula\": \"2^4 * 4!\",\n            \"order_value\": (2**4) * math.factorial(4)\n        },\n        \"D_4\": {\n            \"count\": 1,\n            \"order_formula\": \"2^(4-1) * 4!\",\n            \"order_value\": (2**(4-1)) * math.factorial(4)\n        },\n        \"F_4\": {\n            \"count\": 1,\n            \"order_formula\": \"1152\",\n            \"order_value\": 1152\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"The non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 and their orders are:\")\n    for name, data in groups.items():\n        print(f\"- Type {name}: Order = {data['order_value']}\")\n\n    # Create and print the equation for the total count.\n    counts = [str(data['count']) for data in groups.values()]\n    total_count = sum([data['count'] for data in groups.values()])\n\n    equation = \" + \".join(counts) + f\" = {total_count}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nEach type contributes 1 to the total count of non-isomorphic groups.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(equation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
