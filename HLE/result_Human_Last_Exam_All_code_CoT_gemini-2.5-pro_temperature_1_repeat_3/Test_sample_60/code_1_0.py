def solve_turing_machine_problem():
    """
    This script simulates three Turing Machines to find which one halts after the most steps.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. Parse the rule strings for each machine into a usable data structure.
    2. Simulate each Turing Machine on an empty tape, starting in state 'A'.
    3. Count the number of steps each machine takes to reach the 'H' (Halt) state.
    4. Compare the step counts and identify the machine with the maximum count.
    5. Print the results for each machine and the final conclusion.
