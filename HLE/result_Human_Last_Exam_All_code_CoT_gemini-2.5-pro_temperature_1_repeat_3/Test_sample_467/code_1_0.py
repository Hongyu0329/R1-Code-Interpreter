# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the Gauss map g(z) = z/(z^3+2).

# d is the degree of the Gauss map, which is the maximum of the degrees
# of the numerator (deg=1) and the denominator (deg=3).
d = 3

# k is the number of ends, which is the number of poles of the Gauss map.
# The poles are the roots of the denominator (z^3 + 2 = 0), which are 3.
# There is no pole at infinity as deg(numerator) < deg(denominator).
k = 3

# Step 2: Apply the Jorge-Meeks formula: Index = 2*d - k - 1.
index = 2 * d - k - 1

# Step 3: Print the calculation and the final result.
# The prompt requires printing the equation with the numbers.
