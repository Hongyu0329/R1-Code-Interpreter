    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem asks for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the $\\phi^4$ theory. This is a central concept in the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis of critical phenomena.\n2.  **State the Beta Function:** The behavior of the coupling constant under RG transformations is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u)$. For the $\\phi^4$ theory in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, the one-loop beta function is a standard result.\n3.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant. This occurs when the beta function is zero, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n4.  **Solve the Equation:** We will solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ for the non-trivial fixed point ($u^* \\neq 0$). This will give the expression for $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will print an explanation of the steps and then display the final expression, making sure to output the specific numbers involved in the equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the derivation and prints the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*, we analyze the renormalization group (RG) flow of the φ⁴ theory near d=4 dimensions.\")\n    print(\"The RG flow is governed by the beta function, β(u), which describes how the coupling constant 'u' changes with the energy scale.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The one-loop beta function\")\n    print(\"In d = 4 - ε dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling u in a single-component φ⁴ theory (with a (1/4!)uφ⁴ interaction term) is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ε*u + (3 * u²) / (16 * π²)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Finding the fixed point\")\n    print(\"A fixed point u* is a point where the beta function is zero, i.e., β(u*) = 0. This indicates scale invariance.\")\n    print(\"We solve the equation: -ε*u* + (3 * (u*)²) / (16 * π²) = 0\")\n    print(\"This equation has a trivial solution u* = 0 (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Solving for the non-trivial fixed point\")\n    print(\"Assuming u* ≠ 0, we can divide by u*:\")\n    print(\"-ε + (3 * u*) / (16 * π²) = 0\")\n    print(\"Rearranging the terms to solve for u* gives:\")\n    print(\"(3 * u*) / (16 * π²) = ε\")\n\n    # Define the numbers in the final equation\n    numerator = 16\n    denominator = 3\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Expression:\")\n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\")\n    # The final line prints the equation, highlighting the numbers involved as requested.\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator} * π² / {denominator}) * ε\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
