    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find `a(10)`, which represents the total number of self-avoiding walks of 10 steps on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice). A walk is \"self-avoiding\" if it never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: A closed-form formula for `a(n)` is unknown. For a relatively small number of steps like `n=10`, we can enumerate all possible walks and count the valid ones. A backtracking (recursive) algorithm is an excellent choice for this.\n\n3.  **Develop the Backtracking Algorithm**:\n    *   We'll start a walk at a fixed origin, say `(0, 0)`.\n    *   We'll write a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(x, y, steps_left)`, which calculates the number of valid walks starting from the current point `(x, y)` with a given number of `steps_left`.\n    *   To ensure the walk is self-avoiding, we must keep track of all points visited so far. A `set` is ideal for this, as it provides fast O(1) average time complexity for checking if a point has been visited.\n    *   **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `steps_left` is 0. This means we have successfully completed a 10-step walk. We return `1` to count this valid walk.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: For the current point `(x, y)`, we try to move to each of its four neighbors: `(x+1, y)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x, y-1)`.\n    *   For each potential neighbor, we first check if it's already in our set of visited points.\n    *   If it's not visited, we add it to the visited set, make a recursive call to `count_walks` from this new point with `steps_left - 1`, and add the result to our total count.\n    *   After the recursive call returns, we must \"backtrack\" by removing the point from the visited set. This is crucial because it allows other paths to visit that point.\n    *   The initial call to the function will be from `(0, 0)` with `10` steps.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to implement this logic. The script will calculate the value of `a(10)` and print the result in a clear format as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_self_avoiding_walks(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D lattice.\n    \n    This function uses a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible paths\n    starting from the origin (0,0).\n    \"\"\"\n    # A set to store the coordinates of visited points for efficient lookup.\n    # The walk starts at (0,0), so it's the first visited point.\n    visited = set([(0, 0)])\n\n    def backtrack(x, y, steps_remaining):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of valid walks from the current position.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_remaining (int): The number of steps left to take.\n            \n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from this point.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_remaining == 0:\n            return 1\n        \n        # Initialize a counter for the number of valid walks from this point.\n        walk_count = 0\n        \n        # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice (up, down, left, right).\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n        \n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the next point has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # 'Choose' this move: add the new point to the visited set.\n                visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n                \n                # 'Explore': Recursively call the function for the next step.\n                walk_count += backtrack(next_x, next_y, steps_remaining - 1)\n                \n                # 'Unchoose' (backtrack): Remove the point to allow other paths to use it.\n                visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n                \n        return walk_count\n\n    # Start the backtracking process from the origin (0,0) with n steps.\n    return backtrack(0, 0, n)\n\n# The number of steps for the walk.\nn = 10\n\n# Calculate the result.\nresult = count_self_avoiding_walks(n)\n\n# Print the final result in the format \"a(n) = result\".\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
