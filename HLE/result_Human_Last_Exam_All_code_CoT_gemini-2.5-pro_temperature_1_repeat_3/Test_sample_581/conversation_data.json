    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Cap Set Problem:** I will briefly explain what a cap set is and the notation r₃(n) for the maximum size of a cap set in the vector space (ℤ/3ℤ)ⁿ.\n2.  **Explain Lower Bound Constructions:** The exact values for r₃(n) are unknown for n > 6. I will explain a common method for finding lower bounds: the product construction, which states that r₃(n+m) ≥ r₃(n) * r₃(m).\n3.  **Implement the Calculation:** I will write a Python script that uses the known exact values of r₃(n) for n from 1 to 6 to calculate lower bounds for r₃(8) by checking all possible partitions of 8 (e.g., 2+6, 3+5, 4+4).\n4.  **State the Best Known Bound:** The product construction provides a good, but not the best, lower bound. After the script calculates the result from this method, I will state the current record for the lower bound of r₃(8), which was found using a more advanced construction.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and provide the answer:\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8\n    using the product construction and known values, then states the\n    best-known lower bound from the literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The size of the largest cap set in the vector space (Z/3Z)^n is denoted by r_3(n).\")\n    print(\"The exact values of r_3(n) are only known for n <= 6.\")\n    print(\"We can find a lower bound for r_3(8) using the product construction rule: r_3(n+m) >= r_3(n) * r_3(m).\\n\")\n\n    # Known exact values for r_3(n) for n=1 to 6\n    r3_known = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Known values:\")\n    for n_val, size in r3_known.items():\n        print(f\"r_3({n_val}) = {size}\")\n\n    n_target = 8\n    best_product_bound = 0\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating lower bounds for r_3({n_target}) using partitions of {n_target}:\")\n\n    # Iterate through partitions of n_target (e.g., 8 = 2+6, 3+5, 4+4)\n    for i in range(1, n_target // 2 + 1):\n        j = n_target - i\n        if i in r3_known and j in r3_known:\n            bound = r3_known[i] * r3_known[j]\n            # Output each number in the final equation as requested\n            print(f\"For partition {i}+{j}: r_3({i}) * r_3({j}) = {r3_known[i]} * {r3_known[j]} = {bound}\")\n            if bound > best_product_bound:\n                best_product_bound = bound\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe best lower bound from this simple product construction is {best_product_bound}.\")\n\n    # State the actual best-known lower bound from research\n    best_known_bound = 496\n    print(\"\\nHowever, more advanced constructions have produced a better result.\")\n    print(f\"The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is {best_known_bound}.\")\n\nsolve_cap_set_bound()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
