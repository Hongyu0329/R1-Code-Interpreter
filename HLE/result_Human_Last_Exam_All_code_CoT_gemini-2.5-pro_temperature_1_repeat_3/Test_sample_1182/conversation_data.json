    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the initial curve model.** The given curve is $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. We will first check its reduction modulo 2. The reduction is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, or $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This is a \"double line,\" which is a singular and non-reduced scheme. This indicates that the given model is not stable, and we need to find a better one.\n\n2.  **Find a better model via transformation.** To find a better model of the curve, we can apply a coordinate transformation of the form $x = 2^k X, y = 2^m Y$. The goal is to find integers $k$ and $m$ such that the new equation over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ has a \"good\" or \"semistable\" reduction modulo 2. A semistable reduction can have ordinary double points but no more complicated singularities. We will find that the transformation $x=8X, y=8Y$ yields a useful model.\n\n3.  **Analyze the new model's branch points.** The new model will be of the form $Y^2 = g(X)$. The behavior of the curve is determined by the branch points of the map to the $X$-axis, which are the roots of the polynomial $g(X)$. The stable reduction is determined by how these roots \"cluster\" together under the 2-adic valuation $v_2$.\n\n4.  **Use Newton Polygons to find root valuations.** We will use the Newton polygon of $g(X)$ with respect to the prime $p=2$ to determine the 2-adic valuations of its roots.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure of the stable reduction.** The clustering of the roots determines the structure of the stable reduction. Specifically, it tells us the number of components ($V$) and the genus of each component ($g_i$) in the special fiber of the stable model.\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of double points.** Finally, we use the formula for the conservation of arithmetic genus, which relates the genus of the original curve ($g$), the number of components ($V$), the genera of the components ($\\sum g_i$), and the number of double points ($\\delta$):\n    $g = (\\sum g_i) + \\delta - V + 1$.\n    By plugging in the known values, we can solve for $\\delta$.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, discriminant\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function carries out the step-by-step plan to find the number of double points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The original curve is y^2 = f(x)\n    # f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x\n    # The degree of f(x) is 5, so the genus g of the curve is (5-1)/2 = 2.\n    g = 2\n    print(f\"Step 1: The curve is y^2 = 8*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of this curve is g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"Reducing the equation modulo 2 gives y^2 = x^2, which is a singular 'double line'.\")\n    print(\"This means the initial model is not stable, and a transformation is needed.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: We apply the transformation x = 8*X and y = 8*Y.\")\n    print(\"Original equation: y^2 = 8*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\")\n    # (8*Y)^2 = 8*(8*X) + (8*X)^2 + 4*(8*X)^3 + 4*(8*X)^4 + 8*(8*X)^5\n    # 64*Y^2 = 64*X + 64*X^2 + 4*512*X^3 + 4*4096*X^4 + 8*32768*X^5\n    # 64*Y^2 = 64*X + 64*X^2 + 2048*X^3 + 16384*X^4 + 262144*X^5\n    print(\"Substituting and dividing by 64 gives the new model:\")\n    # Y^2 = X + X^2 + 32*X^3 + 256*X^4 + 4096*X^5\n    print(\"Y^2 = X + X^2 + 32*X^3 + 256*X^4 + 4096*X^5\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3 & 4: Analyze the roots of the new polynomial g(X) using Newton Polygons.\")\n    print(\"g(X) = 4096*X^5 + 256*X^4 + 32*X^3 + X^2 + X\")\n    print(\"g(X) = X * (4096*X^4 + 256*X^3 + 32*X^2 + X + 1)\")\n    print(\"One root is X_1 = 0.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze g1(X) = 4096*X^4 + 256*X^3 + 32*X^2 + X + 1.\")\n    print(\"The 2-adic valuations of the coefficients (from X^0 to X^4) are:\")\n    # v2(1)=0, v2(1)=0, v2(32)=5, v2(256)=8, v2(4096)=12\n    print(\"v2(a0)=0, v2(a1)=0, v2(a2)=5, v2(a3)=8, v2(a4)=12\")\n    print(\"The Newton polygon for g1(X) has two segments:\")\n    print(\"1.
