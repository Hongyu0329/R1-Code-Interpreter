    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. The structure of this factorization is key to understanding the Dirichlet characters.\n2.  **Decompose the Character**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Condition for Primitive Characters**: For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$. When the conductor is a prime $p$, this simply means that $\\chi_i$ must not be the principal character (the character that is always 1).\n4.  **Condition on the Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n5.  **Counting the Characters**: The number of characters of a specific order modulo a prime power is related to Euler's totient function, $\\phi$. We can count the number of valid tuples $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ that satisfy the conditions.\n    *   Let $g_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(g_1, \\dots, g_k) = 6$. This implies each $g_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    *   Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order $g_i$ must be greater than 1. Thus, $g_i$ can only be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   We can calculate the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6, and then subtract those whose order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3) to find the number of characters with order exactly 6.\n\nThis step-by-step process allows us to systematically count the required characters. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_g = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Find the prime factorization of the conductor d.\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(prime_factors.keys())\n    num_primes = len(primes)\n    \n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}\\n\")\n    \n    # For a character to be primitive with a square-free conductor d, its component\n    # characters must be non-principal.
