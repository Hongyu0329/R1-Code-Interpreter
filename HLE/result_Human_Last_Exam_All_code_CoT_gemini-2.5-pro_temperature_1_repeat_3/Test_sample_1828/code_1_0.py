# Based on the set-theoretic analysis:
# The maximal possible cardinality for the set X occurs in models of set theory
# where the spectrum of MAD families is as large as possible under the given
# constraints. This leads to X = {omega_1, omega_2}.
max_card_X = 2

# The minimal possible cardinality for the set X occurs in models where the
# spectrum is as small as possible. This leads to X = {omega_2}.
min_card_X = 1

# Calculate the difference between the maximal and minimal possible cardinalities.
difference = max_card_X - min_card_X

# Output the results of the analysis and the final calculation.
