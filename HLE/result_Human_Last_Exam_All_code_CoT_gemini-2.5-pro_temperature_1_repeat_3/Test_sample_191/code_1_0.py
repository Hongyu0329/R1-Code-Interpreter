      "1. Amyloid plaques can activate the complement system, a part of the immune response.\n"
      "2. This activation leads to the cleavage (breakdown) of the protein C3 into smaller fragments, primarily C3b.\n"
      "3. The C3b fragment covalently binds to the surface of the amyloid plaque, tagging it for removal. This process is called opsonization.\n"
      "4. Macrophages (and microglia in the brain) have complement receptors that recognize and bind to the C3b fragment on the plaque.\n"
      "5. This binding triggers the macrophage to engulf and break down the amyloid plaque."
