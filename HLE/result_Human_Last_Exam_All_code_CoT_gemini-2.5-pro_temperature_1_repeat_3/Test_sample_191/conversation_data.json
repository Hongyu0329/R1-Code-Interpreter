    "The user is asking a biology question about the specific protein that, upon being broken down, facilitates the engulfment of amyloid deposits by macrophages. This process is known as opsonization.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the biological pathway involved. This is the complement system, a part of the innate immune system.\n2.  Pinpoint the specific protein in this pathway that attaches to targets like amyloid. This protein is Complement component 3 (C3).\n3.  Explain that C3 is cleaved (broken down) into fragments, such as C3b and iC3b. These fragments coat the amyloid plaques.\n4.  Explain that macrophages have receptors for these C3 fragments, and binding to them triggers phagocytosis (engulfment).\n5.  Provide a Python script that prints this answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and explains the role of the protein involved in\n  the opsonization and macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The key protein is part of the complement system.\n  protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n\n  # Explanation of the process\n  explanation = (\n      f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name}.\\n\\n\"\n      \"Here is the process:\\n\"\n      \"1. Amyloid plaques can activate the complement system, a part of the immune response.\\n\"\n      \"2. This activation leads to the cleavage (breakdown) of the protein C3 into smaller fragments, primarily C3b.\\n\"\n      \"3. The C3b fragment covalently binds to the surface of the amyloid plaque, tagging it for removal. This process is called opsonization.\\n\"\n      \"4. Macrophages (and microglia in the brain) have complement receptors that recognize and bind to the C3b fragment on the plaque.\\n\"\n      \"5. This binding triggers the macrophage to engulf and break down the amyloid plaque.\"\n  )\n  print(explanation)\n\nfind_protein()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
