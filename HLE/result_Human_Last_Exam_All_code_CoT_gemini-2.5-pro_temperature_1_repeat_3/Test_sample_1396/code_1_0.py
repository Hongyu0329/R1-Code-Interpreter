    Calculates and explains the upper bound for 4-agent connected envy-free cake cutting.

    The problem of finding an envy-free allocation for n=4 agents can be analyzed
    by building upon the solution for n=3 agents. The most realistic upper bound
    is derived from the query complexity of established protocols.

    The work by Brânzei and Nisan (2022) provides an explicit protocol and bound.
    We use their findings to determine the upper bound O.
