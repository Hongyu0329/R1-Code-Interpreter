# Plan:
# 1. Calculate Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) using the simplified formula: Rs = (8 * pi^2 * a^3) / (c^2 * T^2)
# 2. Calculate the time dilation factor (f) using: f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d))
# 3. Determine memory usage (z) for a memory-efficient Bagua C program.

# --- Step 1: Define constants and inputs in SI units ---

# Constants
PI = math.pi
C = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s

# Pandora's orbital data
# Average orbital radius: 100,000,000 km -> meters
a = 100000000 * 1000
# Orbital period: 800 Earth days -> seconds
T = 800 * 24 * 60 * 60

# Pioneer's distance from event horizon: 13 km -> meters
d = 13 * 1000

# --- Step 2: Perform the physics calculations ---

# Calculate the numerator of the Rs formula: 8 * pi^2 * a^3
rs_numerator = 8 * (PI**2) * (a**3)

# Calculate the denominator of the Rs formula: c^2 * T^2
rs_denominator = (C**2) * (T**2)

# Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs)
Rs = rs_numerator / rs_denominator

# Calculate the time dilation factor (f)
# f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d))
f = math.sqrt(d / (Rs + d))

# --- Step 3: Determine memory usage ---

# A memory-efficient program requires a minimum of 7 variables:
# pi, c, T, a, d, Rs, f
# In the Bagua architecture, `int` and `frac` types are both 8 trits.
# Total memory usage z = 7 variables * 8 trits/variable
z = 56

# --- Step 4: Format and print the final answer ---

# The final answer format is f:z, with f rounded to 3 decimal places.
# The problem statement requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
# Final equation: f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d))
print(f"Based on the calculation f = sqrt({d:.1f} / ({Rs:.3f} + {d:.1f}))")
print("The resulting time dilation factor 'f' and memory usage 'z' are:")
print(f"{f:.3f}:{z}")

# The final result in the requested format is printed above.
# The following is just to conform to the problem's specific output wrapper if needed.
# Final Answer: <<<0.993:56>>>
