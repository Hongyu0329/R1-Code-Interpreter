    "My plan is to identify the specific verses (bayts) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', that list the names of the prophets. I will then write a Python script to display this information.\n\n1.  **Locate the Verses**: I will find the text of the poem and pinpoint the exact start and end verses that contain the names of the 25 prophets mentioned.\n2.  **Determine the Bayt Numbers**: Based on standard editions of the poem, I will assign the correct bayt numbers to these verses.\n3.  **Create a Python Script**: The script will:\n    *   Store the bayt numbers and their corresponding Arabic text and English transliteration.\n    *   Print a clear introductory statement indicating the range of the verses.\n    *   Loop through the stored verses and print each one with its number, fulfilling the requirement to output each number.\n    *   Provide the final answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses (bayts) from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets in Islam.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 40\n    end_bayt = 43\n\n    # The verses are stored in a dictionary with the bayt number as the key.\n    verses = {\n        40: {\n            \"arabic\": \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Hum Ādamun, Idrīsu, Nūḥun, Hūdu maʿ, * Ṣāliḥu wa Ibrāhīmu, kullun muttabaʿ\",\n            \"translation\": \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with * Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\"\n        },\n        41: {\n            \"arabic\": \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Lūṭun wa Ismāʿīlu, Isḥāqu kadhā, * Yaʿqūbu, Yūsufu, wa Ayyūbu-ḥtadhā\",\n            \"translation\": \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, * Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed suit.\"\n        },\n        42: {\n            \"arabic\": \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Shuʿaybu, Hārūnu, wa Mūsā w-al-Yasaʿ, * Dhu-l-Kifli, Dāwūdu, Sulaymānu-ttabaʿ\",\n            \"translation\": \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and al-Yasa', * Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n        },\n        43: {\n            \"arabic\": \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Ilyāsu, Yūnus, Zakariyyā, Yaḥyā, * ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun, daʿ ghayyā\",\n            \"translation\": \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, * 'Isa and Taha (Muhammad), the seal, so leave misguidance.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The names of the prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"Here are the specific verses:\\n\")\n\n    for number in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        if number in verses:\n            verse = verses[number]\n            print(f\"Bayt {number}:\")\n            print(f\"  Arabic:          {verse['arabic']}\")\n            print(f\"  Transliteration: {verse['transliteration']}\")\n            print(f\"  Translation:     {verse['translation']}\")\n            print(\"-\" * 20)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophet_verses()\n<<<40 to 43>>>\n```"
