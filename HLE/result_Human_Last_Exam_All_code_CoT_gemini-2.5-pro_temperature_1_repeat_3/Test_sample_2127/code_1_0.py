def find_maclaurin_coefficient():
    """
    This function finds the 4th Maclaurin series coefficient of the given function.
    
    The function f(x) is composed of two parts: f(x) = A(x) + B(x), where
    A(x) = (9 * x**4) / (16 * e)
    B(x) is the complex fractional part.
    
    A detailed analysis reveals that the function as written has a singularity at x=0,
    meaning it does not have a Maclaurin series. This points to a likely typo in the problem.
    A common problem-solving pattern suggests that a complex term is designed to have a
    high-order Taylor expansion, rendering it irrelevant for lower-order coefficients.
    
    This occurs if the term (cos(sin(pi*cosh(x**6))) - 1/e) is corrected to
    (cos(sin(pi*cosh(x**6))) - 1), making it zero at x=0.
    
    With this correction, the Taylor series for the B(x) part starts with a term of order x**19.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    - Order of Numerator: O(x**4) * O(x**3) * O(x**24) = O(x**31)
    - Order of Denominator: O(x**6) * O(1) * O(x**6) = O(x**12)
    - Total order of B(x): O(x**31 / x**12) = O(x**19)
    
    Since the series for B(x) starts with x**19, it does not have an x**4 term.
    Thus, the 4th Maclaurin coefficient of f(x) is simply the coefficient of x**4 from A(x).
