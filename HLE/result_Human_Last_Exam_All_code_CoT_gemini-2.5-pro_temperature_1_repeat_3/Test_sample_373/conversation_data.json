    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Graph:** I will first determine the structure of a 10-node barbell graph. A standard barbell graph is formed by connecting two identical complete graphs with a single edge. For a 10-node graph, this means we have two 5-node complete graphs (K₅), and a single \"bottleneck\" edge connects one node from each K₅.\n\n2.  **Define the Gossiping Process:** I'll assume \"randomized uniform gossiping\" means a two-step process:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes in the graph.\n    b. This selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to gossip with.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:** The \"bottleneck edge\" is sampled if one of its two endpoint nodes is selected in step (a) and chooses the other endpoint in step (b). I will calculate the probability of this event by:\n    a. Finding the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    b. Calculating the probability of the two mutually exclusive scenarios (one for each endpoint of the bottleneck being the initial choice).\n    c. Summing the probabilities of these two scenarios to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints out the calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define graph parameters\n    total_nodes = 10\n    \n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K_n cliques connected by a bridge.\n    # 2 * n = 10, so each clique is a K_5.\n    n_clique = 5\n\n    # 2. Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bridge.\n    # Let these nodes be U and V.\n    # Degree = (connections within its own clique) + (the bridge connection)\n    degree_bridge_node = (n_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # 3. Calculate the probability of the two-step gossiping process.\n    # The probability of selecting any specific node from the graph.\n    prob_select_any_node = Fraction(1, total_nodes)\n\n    # The probability that a selected bridge node chooses its partner across the bridge.\n    prob_bridge_node_chooses_neighbor = Fraction(1, degree_bridge_node)\n\n    # 4. Calculate the probability of the two scenarios for sampling the bottleneck.\n    # Scenario A: Node U is selected and it chooses V.\n    prob_scenario_A = prob_select_any_node * prob_bridge_node_chooses_neighbor\n\n    # Scenario B: Node V is selected and it chooses U. This is symmetric to A.\n    prob_scenario_B = prob_select_any_node * prob_bridge_node_chooses_neighbor\n    \n    # The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive scenarios.\n    total_probability = prob_scenario_A + prob_scenario_B\n\n    # 5.
