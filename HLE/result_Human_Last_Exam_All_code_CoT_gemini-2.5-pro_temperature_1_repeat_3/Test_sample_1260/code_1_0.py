    Simulates a financial market to demonstrate the effect of information asymmetry
    on short-term returns for buyers and sellers.

    The core idea is that trades initiated by informed traders carry information
    that predicts the future price movement.
    - A buy-initiated trade suggests the price will rise.
    - A sell-initiated trade suggests the price will fall.

    This simulation will show that, on average, the return for the buy-side initiator
    is higher than the return for the sell-side initiator.
