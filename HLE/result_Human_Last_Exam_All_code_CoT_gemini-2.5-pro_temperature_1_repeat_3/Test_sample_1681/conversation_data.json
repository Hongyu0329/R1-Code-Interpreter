    "When analyzing the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum context, we use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard model for such games.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Game:** Set up the payoff matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n2.  **Quantum Setup (EWL):**\n    *   The game starts with two qubits in a maximally entangled state, created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|00>`.\n    *   Each player chooses a quantum strategy, which is a unitary operator `U` applied to their respective qubit. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are specific unitary operators, but a broader set of quantum strategies is available. A particularly effective quantum strategy is often denoted as 'Q'.\n    *   After the players apply their strategies, a disentangling operator `Jâ€ ` is applied.\n    *   The final state is measured in the computational basis (`|00>`, `|01>`, `|10>`, `|11>`), which correspond to the classical outcomes (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D).\n3.  **Calculate Equilibrium:**\n    *   The expected payoff for each player is calculated based on the probabilities of the final measurement outcomes.\n    *   An equilibrium is a pair of strategies where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n    *   It has been shown that for the Prisoner's Dilemma, a new Nash Equilibrium `(Q, Q)` emerges in the quantum version, resolving the dilemma. When both players choose the 'miracle' quantum strategy `Q`, the outcome is mutual cooperation.\n4.  **Implementation:**\n    *   I will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the necessary symbolic quantum mechanical calculations.\n    *   The code will define all the required quantum states and operators (`J`, `U`, etc.).\n    *   It will then calculate the final state probabilities when both players adopt the quantum strategy `Q`.\n    *   Finally, it will compute the expected payoff for a player at this `(Q, Q)` equilibrium and print the full equation.\n\nThe equilibrium point corresponds to the payoff received by each player when both adopt the optimal quantum strategy `Q`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the equilibrium payoff in the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define imaginary unit\n    i = sp.I\n\n    # 1.
