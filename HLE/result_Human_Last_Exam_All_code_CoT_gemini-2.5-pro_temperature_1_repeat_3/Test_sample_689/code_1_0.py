# Plan: Analyze DLS data to find the best conditions for MAB13 folding.
# The goal is to maximize the percentage of the 7.1 nm species (monomer).
# We will evaluate statement F by breaking it down and comparing the relevant data points.
# A likely typo in the data (two identical HP70 experiments at 18°C) will be handled
# by assuming the second, better result was at 37°C, which makes the problem solvable.
