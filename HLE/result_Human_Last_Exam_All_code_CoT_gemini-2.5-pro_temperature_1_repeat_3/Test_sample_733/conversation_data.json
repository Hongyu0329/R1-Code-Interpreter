    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a special type of subset: a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a=b`), their product `a*b` is not in `S`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended. This means if you add any element `g` from outside `S` to it, the new set `S U {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions for `S = {a, b}`:**\n    *   **Product-free:** The products `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b` must not be in `{a, b}`.\n    *   **Maximal:** For any other element `g` in the group, the set `{a, b, g}` must *not* be product-free. This implies that for every `g`, some product of two elements from `{a, b, g}` must result in an element within that same set.\n\n3.  **Computational Approach:**\n    These conditions are very restrictive and imply that only a few small finite groups can satisfy them. I will write a Python script to systematically check a list of candidate small groups (`Z_3`, `Z_4`, `Z_2 x Z_2`, `Z_5`, `Z_6`, `S_3`, `Z_7`). The script will:\n    a. Represent each group with its elements and multiplication operation.\n    b. Iterate through all possible subsets of size 2 for each group.\n    c. For each subset, check if it's product-free.\n    d. If it is, check if it's maximal.\n    e. Count how many of these non-isomorphic groups have such a set.\n\nThe following Python code implements this verification process.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef get_group_op(mult_table, elements):\n    \"\"\"Creates a group operation function from a Cayley (multiplication) table.\"\"\"\n    element_map = {el: i for i, el in enumerate(elements)}\n    def op(a, b):\n        i = element_map[a]\n        j = element_map[b]\n        return mult_table[i][j]\n    return op\n\ndef is_product_free(s, op):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset S is product-free.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s)\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if op(x, y) in s_set:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_maximal(s, op, elements):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a product-free set S is maximal by inclusion.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s)\n    # Get all elements of the group not in the set s\n    g_minus_s = [el for el in elements if el not in s_set]\n    \n    # For s to be maximal, adding any element g from outside s should make it NOT product-free\n    for g in g_minus_s:\n        s_union_g = s + [g]\n        # is_product_free is True if NO product falls back into the set.\n        # If we find even one g for which s_union_g is still product-free, then s is not maximal.\n        if is_product_free(s_union_g, op):\n            return False\n            \n    # If all extensions are not product-free, then s is maximal\n    return True\n\ndef find_groups_with_property():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds which non-isomorphic finite groups from a candidate list\n    contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    found_groups = []\n    \n    # Define candidate groups structures (elements and Cayley tables/operations)\n    groups = {\n        \"Z_3 (Cyclic group of order 3)\": {\n            \"elements\": [0, 1, 2],\n            \"op\": lambda a, b: (a + b) % 3\n        },\n        \"Z_4 (Cyclic group of order 4)\": {\n            \"elements\": [0, 1, 2, 3],\n            \"op\": lambda a, b: (a + b) % 4\n        },\n        \"V_4 (Klein four-group, Z_2 x Z_2)\": {\n            \"elements\": ['e', 'a', 'b', 'c'],\n            \"op\": get_group_op([\n                ['e', 'a', 'b', 'c'],\n                ['a', 'e', 'c', 'b'],\n                ['b', 'c', 'e', 'a'],\n                ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e']\n            ], ['e', 'a', 'b', 'c'])\n        },\n        \"Z_5 (Cyclic group of order 5)\": {\n            \"elements\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n            \"op\": lambda a, b: (a + b) % 5\n        },\n        \"Z_6 (Cyclic group of order 6)\": {\n            \"elements\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n            \"op\": lambda a, b: (a + b) % 6\n        },\n        \"S_3 (Symmetric group of order 6)\": {\n            \"elements\": ['e', 'r', 'r2', 's', 'sr', 'sr2'],\n            \"op\": get_group_op([\n                ['e', 'r', 'r2', 's', 'sr', 'sr2'], # e\n                ['r', 'r2', 'e', 'sr', 'sr2', 's'], # r\n                ['r2', 'e', 'r', 'sr2', 's', 'sr'], # r2\n                ['s', 'sr2', 'sr', 'e', 'r2', 'r'], # s\n                ['sr', 's', 'sr2', 'r', 'e', 'r2'], # sr\n                ['sr2', 'sr', 's', 'r2', 'r', 'e']  # sr2\n            ], ['e', 'r', 'r2', 's', 'sr', 'sr2'])\n        },\n        \"Z_7 (Cyclic group of order 7)\": {\n            \"elements\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n            \"op\": lambda a, b: (a + b) % 7\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Checking candidate groups...\\n\")\n    for name, group_data in groups.items():\n        elements = group_data[\"elements\"]\n        op = group_data[\"op\"]\n        \n        has_property = False\n        \n        # Generate all subsets of size 2\n        subsets_size_2 = itertools.combinations(elements, 2)\n        \n        for s_tuple in subsets_size_2:\n            s = list(s_tuple)\n            # Check if the set is product-free first\n            if is_product_free(s, op):\n                # If it is, check if it's maximal\n                if is_maximal(s, op, elements):\n                    has_property = True\n                    break # Found one for this group, can move to the next group\n        \n        if has_property:\n            found_groups.append(name)\n\n    print(\"The finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2 are:\")\n    for name in sorted(found_groups):\n        print(f\"- {name}\")\n    \n    count = len(found_groups)\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of such finite groups is {count}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_groups_with_property()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
