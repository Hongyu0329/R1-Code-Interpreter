def solve_permutation_avoidance():
    """
    This function determines the value of av_n^k(p), which denotes the number of
    p-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions, for the specific case where
    n = 333, k = 3, and the pattern p = 1324.

    Method:
    A known combinatorial result states that for any fixed number of inversions k
    and a given pattern p, the number of p-avoiding permutations of length n
    with k inversions, av_n^k(p), is constant for all sufficiently large n (n >= 2k).

    In this problem, n = 333 and k = 3. Since 333 >= 2 * 3 = 6, the condition is met.
    This means the result is independent of the length 333 and is a constant value
    for any n >= 6.

    This constant value can be determined by enumerating the fundamental structures of
    permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern. These permutations
    consist of a "local disturbance" at the beginning or end of an otherwise
    identity permutation.

    There are 7 such fundamental structures that can appear at the beginning of the
    permutation. By symmetry (the reverse-complement operation), there are 7
    corresponding structures that can appear at the end. These two sets are disjoint.
    This gives a total of 7 + 7 = 14 such permutations.
