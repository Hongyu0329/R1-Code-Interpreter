    "The user's question is based on a misunderstanding of the former Nigerian president's name. My plan is to provide a Python script that clarifies this.\n\n1.  Acknowledge the user's query about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n2.  State the correct full name, which is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n3.  Clarify that \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name and he has never publicly identified as such.\n4.  Suggest that the name might be confused with Nnamdi Azikiwe, another prominent Nigerian leader.\n5.  The Python script will use the `print()` function to output this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    The question is based on a factual inaccuracy, so this function prints an explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    president_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    other_figure_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    print(f\"The full name of the former Nigerian president is {president_name}.\")\n    print(\"There is no public record of him ever using the name 'Azikiwe' or identifying himself as such.\")\n    print(f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is famously associated with {other_figure_name}, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, since the event never occurred, there is no year to provide.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_name_and_year()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
