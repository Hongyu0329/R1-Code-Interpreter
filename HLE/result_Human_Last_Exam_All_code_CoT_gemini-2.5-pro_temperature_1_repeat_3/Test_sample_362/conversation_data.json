    "Of course, I can help with that. The Wittig reaction is a powerful method in organic chemistry for synthesizing alkenes. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: The reaction involves an aldehyde and a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   **Ylide**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, which has the structure `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Transformation**: The core of the Wittig reaction is the exchange of the oxygen atom from the aldehyde's carbonyl group (`C=O`) with the carbon group from the ylide (`=CR₂`). This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) and triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`) as a byproduct.\n\n3.  **Combine the Fragments**:\n    *   From the aldehyde, we take the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n    *   From the ylide, we take the `=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)` fragment.\n    *   Combining these at the double bond gives the product's carbon skeleton: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering it to give the double bond the lowest locant (position 2) and identifying the substituents leads to the name **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. Since the ylide is non-stabilized, the major stereoisomer formed is the Z-isomer.\n\nThe following Python code will print the full reaction equation and the name of the final product, along with the numbers used in its IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the Wittig reaction and prints the final product's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the reactants and products by name for the final equation\n    aldehyde = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n    ylide = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    # The major product is the Z-isomer\n    product_alkene = \"(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    byproduct = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n    # The full reaction equation\n    reaction_equation = f\"{aldehyde} + {ylide} -> {product_alkene} + {byproduct}\"\n\n    print(\"The final reaction equation is:\")\n    print(reaction_equation)\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The name of the main organic product is:\")\n    print(product_alkene)\n\n    # As requested, output each number present in the final product's IUPAC name.\n    # We use regex to find all numbers in the product name string.\n    numbers_in_name = re.findall(r'\\d', product_alkene)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final product's IUPAC name are:\")\n    # The numbers specify the positions of substituents and the double bond.\n    # 1: position of the (2-chlorophenyl) group\n    # 2: position of the chloro group on the phenyl ring\n    # 4,4: positions of the two methyl groups\n    # 2: position of the pentene double bond\n    print(', '.join(numbers_in_name))\n\nsolve_wittig_reaction()\n```\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
