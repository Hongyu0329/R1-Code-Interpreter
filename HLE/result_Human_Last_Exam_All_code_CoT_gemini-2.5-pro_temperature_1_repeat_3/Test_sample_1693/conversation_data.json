    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines and presents the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I have compiled a list of notable large French ships that were sunk by German U-boats between the start of the war in September 1939 and the French armistice on June 22, 1940.\n2.  The data for each ship includes its name and Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a standard measure of a ship's internal volume and a reliable proxy for its overall size.\n3.  The script will programmatically compare these ships based on their tonnage to identify the largest one.\n4.  Finally, it will print the details of the largest ship and show the comparison of tonnage values to clearly justify the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat\n    before the 1940 armistice based on pre-compiled data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on major French ships sunk by U-boats (or their mines)\n    # before the armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    # Tonnage is in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    ships = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Emile Miguet\",\n            \"type\": \"Tanker\",\n            \"tonnage_grt\": 14115,\n            \"cause\": \"Sunk by torpedo from U-48 on Oct 12, 1939\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Champlain\",\n            \"type\": \"Passenger Liner\",\n            \"tonnage_grt\": 28124,\n            \"cause\": \"Sunk by a mine laid by U-65 on June 17, 1940\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Bretagne\",\n            \"type\": \"Auxiliary Cruiser\",\n            \"tonnage_grt\": 10170,\n            \"cause\": \"Sunk by torpedo from U-45 on Oct 14, 1939\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # Initialize variables to find the largest ship\n    largest_ship = None\n    max_tonnage = 0\n\n    # Loop through the list to find the ship with the maximum tonnage\n    for ship in ships:\n        if ship[\"tonnage_grt\"] > max_tonnage:\n            max_tonnage = ship[\"tonnage_grt\"]\n            largest_ship = ship\n\n    # Print the conclusion and the supporting data\n    if largest_ship:\n        print(\"To determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, we compare the tonnage of the main candidates:\")\n        \n        # Displaying the comparison as a pseudo-equation\n        champlain_tonnage = 28124\n        emile_miguet_tonnage = 14115\n        \n        print(f\"\\nComparing the two largest contenders:\")\n        print(f\"1.
