    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can follow a computational approach.\n\nLet the set be $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. A binary operation is a function $f: S \\times S \\to S$. This can be represented by a $3 \\times 3$ Cayley table.\n\n1.  **Commutativity**: The property $f(x, y) = f(y, x)$ for all $x, y \\in S$ means the Cayley table must be symmetric. For a set of size $n=3$, a symmetric table is determined by the entries on and above the main diagonal. The number of such entries is $n(n+1)/2 = 3(3+1)/2 = 6$. Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements in $S$, the total number of commutative operations is $3^6 = 729$.\n\n2.  **Associativity**: The property $f(f(x, y), z) = f(x, f(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in S$ must also be satisfied. There is no simple formula for this, so we must test each of the 729 commutative operations.\n\n**Plan:**\nWe will write a Python script to perform a brute-force check.\n1.  Iterate through all $3^6 = 729$ possible commutative operations. An operation can be represented by the 6 independent values in its Cayley table.\n2.  For each operation, construct the full $3 \\times 3$ Cayley table.\n3.  Test the associativity property for all $3^3 = 27$ combinations of $(x, y, z)$.\n4.  Count the number of operations that satisfy the associativity test.\n\nThe following script implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of commutative operations\n    # A commutative operation is defined by the upper triangle of its Cayley table.\n    num_commutative_params = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    total_commutative_ops = n ** num_commutative_params\n    \n    print(f\"Let the set be S = {{0, 1, 2}}.
