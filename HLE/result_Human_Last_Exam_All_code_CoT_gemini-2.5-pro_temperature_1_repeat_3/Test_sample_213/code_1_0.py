# The bug is in the definition of the Z-axis rotation matrix, Rz.
# For a matrix to perform a pure rotation, it must be orthogonal with a determinant of +1.
# The provided line for Rz is:
# mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));
# This matrix is not a valid rotation matrix. It would shear and scale the texture.
# The standard definition for a Z-axis rotation matrix requires a negative sign in the second column vector.
# By reinserting the single missing '-' character, the line is corrected.

original_line = "mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(-sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));"

# The following line is for the platform to capture the answer.
