    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of a piecewise function `p(x)` over the range `x = 0` to `x = 4`. Since the definition of the function `p(x)` changes at `x = 3`, we must split the integral into two separate parts:\n\n1.  The integral of `p(x) = 2x^3 / 8` from `x = 0` to `x = 3`.\n2.  The integral of `p(x) = e^x(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)` from `x = 3` to `x = 4`.\n\nThe total integral will be the sum of the results from these two parts. I will use Python with the `scipy` library, which provides a standard function (`quad`) for numerical integration.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the two pieces of the function `p(x)` in Python.\n2.  Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to calculate the definite integral for the first piece over the interval `[0, 3]`.\n3.  Use `scipy.integrate.quad` again to calculate the definite integral for the second piece over the interval `[3, 4]`.\n4.  Sum the two results to get the total integral.\n5.  The final code will print the value of each integral part and the final calculation, showing how they are summed up.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import integrate\n\ndef p1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the first part of the function p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef p2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the second part of the function p(x) for 3 < x <= 5.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# The integration range is from 0 to 4. We split this at x = 3.\n# The split point where the function definition changes.\nsplit_point = 3\n# The overall integration bounds.\nlower_bound = 0\nupper_bound = 4\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part: from lower_bound to split_point.\nintegral1, error1 = integrate.quad(p1, lower_bound, split_point)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part: from split_point to upper_bound.\nintegral2, error2 = integrate.quad(p2, split_point, upper_bound)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the results in a clear, step-by-step manner.\nprint(f\"The integral is split at x = {split_point} due to the piecewise nature of the function.\")\nprint(f\"First integral (from x={lower_bound} to x={split_point}): {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Second integral (from x={split_point} to x={upper_bound}): {integral2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final result is the sum of these two integrals.\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n# Print the final numerical answer in the specified format\n# print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4634103135503>>>"
