    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking two things:\n1.  If the mathematics of quantum mechanics can be used to prove Gödel's ontological proof.\n2.  To provide code that demonstrates this.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Address the Premise:** I will first clarify the relationship between quantum mechanics (QM) and Gödel's ontological proof. QM mathematics (Hilbert spaces, linear algebra, probability) describes physical phenomena. Gödel's proof is an exercise in formal modal logic. They operate in different domains, and one is not used to prove the other. The proof's validity rests on its axioms and logical system (S5 modal logic), not on physical principles.\n2.  **Fulfill the Code Request:** While QM math can't prove it, I can use Python to *represent* the logical steps of Gödel's proof. The code will not perform a formal logical deduction but will print out the axioms, definitions, and theorems in sequence to illustrate how the argument is constructed. This will satisfy the user's request for a coded solution and demonstrate the proof's structure.\n3.  **Structure the Code:** The Python script will be a series of `print` statements. Each statement will represent a step in the proof, such as an axiom, a definition, or a derived theorem. I will use numbers for each step to satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" constraint by analogy.\n4.  **Final Answer:** I will provide a definitive answer to the user's core question in the specified `<<<...>>>` format.\n\nHere is the Python code that illustrates the steps of the proof.\n\n```python\ndef showcase_goedels_ontological_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script illustrates the steps of Kurt Gödel's ontological proof.\n    It does not use quantum mechanics, as the proof is an exercise in\n    modal logic, not physics.
