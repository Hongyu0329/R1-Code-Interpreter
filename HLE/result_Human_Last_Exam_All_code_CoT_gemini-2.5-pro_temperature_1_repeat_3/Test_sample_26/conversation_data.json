    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use tools from algebraic topology, specifically the long exact sequence of homotopy groups and the rational Hurewicz theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Establish an isomorphism between $\\pi_3(X)$ and the relative homotopy group $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ using the long exact sequence of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n2.  Relate the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to the dimension of the rational homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ using the relative rational Hurewicz theorem.\n3.  Compute the dimension of $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ using the long exact sequence of homology for the pair.\n4.  Combine these results to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n**Step 1: Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to a relative homotopy group.**\n\nConsider the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(Y, A) = (\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(Y) \\to \\pi_k(Y,A) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(A) \\to \\dots $$\nLet's look at the portion of the sequence involving $\\pi_3(X)$:\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\nTo simplify this, we need the homotopy groups of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ can be described by the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^{2n+1} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$. The long exact sequence of this fibration implies that $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\cong \\pi_k(S^{2n+1})$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nFor our case, $n=3$, so $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_k(S^7)$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nThe homotopy groups of spheres $\\pi_k(S^m)$ are zero for $k < m$. Therefore:\n*   $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$\n*   $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these into our sequence gives:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis short exact sequence implies that the map between $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ and $\\pi_3(X)$ is an isomorphism:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) $$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Rational Hurewicz Theorem.**\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) $$\nUsing the isomorphism from Step 1:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) $$\nThe relative rational Hurewicz theorem states that for a pair of simply-connected spaces $(Y, A)$, the relative Hurewicz map $\\pi_k(Y, A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_k(Y, A; \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for all $k \\ge 2$. Both $X$ (by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem) and $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ are simply-connected. Thus, the theorem applies.\nFor $k=4$, we get:\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) $$\nTherefore, the rank we are looking for is the dimension of this rational homology group:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) $$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the rational homology group.**\n\nWe use the long exact sequence of homology for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ with rational coefficients:\n$$ \\dots \\to H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\dots $$\nLet's determine the dimensions of these vector spaces:\n*   $X$ is a smooth complex surface, so it is a real 4-manifold. Its top homology group $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is one-dimensional, generated by the fundamental class $[X]$. So, $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a real 6-manifold. Its fourth homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q})$ is one-dimensional, generated by the class of a hyperplane $[\\mathbb{CP}^2]$. So, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The homology group $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is zero. This can be seen from PoincarÃ© duality ($H_3(X) \\cong H^1(X)$) and the fact that $H_1(X)=0$ implies $H^1(X)=0$. So, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the cokernel of the map $i_*$. The map $i_*$ sends the fundamental class $[X]$ to its class in the ambient space. The homology class of a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is $d$ times the class of a hyperplane. Here, $X$ is a quintic hypersurface, so its degree is $d=5$.\nThe map $i_*: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is multiplication by 5.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation.**\n\nThe cokernel of the map $\\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{\\times 5} \\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{Q} / (5\\mathbb{Q})$. Since multiplication by any non-zero rational number is an automorphism of $\\mathbb{Q}$, the image $5\\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, the cokernel is the zero vector space.\n$$ H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0 $$\nTherefore, its dimension is 0. From Step 2, this is the rank we are looking for:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0 $$\n\nThe following Python code summarizes the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface (quintic)\n    n_ambient = 3 # Dimension of the ambient projective space CP^3\n    dim_X = n_ambient - 1 # Complex dimension of the hypersurface X\n\n    print(\"Goal: Find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\")\n    print(\"Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
