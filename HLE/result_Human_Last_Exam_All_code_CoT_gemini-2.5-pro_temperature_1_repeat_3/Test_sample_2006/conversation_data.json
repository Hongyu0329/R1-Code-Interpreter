    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating riddle that combines poetry with mathematics. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Decode the Haiku:** The poem's title and lines are clues that describe a mathematical equation.\n    *   **Title \"The Bays\":** This is a homophone for \"The Base,\" indicating the puzzle is about finding an unknown number base, let's call it `b`.\n    *   **Line 2 \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\":** \"Twice fifteen\" is 30. \"Brings winds of change\" suggests a subtraction operation.\n    *   **Line 3 \"A divine one yields\":** \"A divine one\" is the number 1. \"Yields\" suggests the equals sign (`=`).\n    *   **Line 1 \"An August tempest\":** \"August\" is the 8th month, giving us the number 8.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** Following the poetic structure, the clues assemble into an equation. The \"change\" happens to 30, and it \"yields\" a result after considering the \"divine one.\" The most natural reading is:\n    `30 - 1 = 8`\n    This is obviously false in our normal base-10 system. The puzzle requires us to find the base `b` in which this equation is true.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Base:** We can write the equation in terms of the unknown base `b` and convert it to base 10 to solve.\n    *   `30` in base `b` is `(3 * b¹) + (0 * b⁰)` which is `3b`.\n    *   `1` in base `b` is `1`.\n    *   `8` in base `b` is `8`.\n    *   The equation becomes: `3b - 1 = 8`.\n    *   Solving for `b`: `3b = 9`, which gives `b = 3`.\n\n4.  **Find the Final Answer:** The solution to the equation is base 3. The name for a base-3 number system is **TERNARY**. The riddle asks for this answer with its letters in alphabetical order.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final steps and print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle from the haiku by setting up and solving an algebraic equation\n    to find an unknown number base, then alphabetizing the name of that base.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The numbers are derived from the haiku as per the explained logic.\n    num_from_line_2 = 30\n    num_from_line_3 = 1\n    num_from_line_1 = 8\n\n    # The prompt requires printing the numbers from the final equation.\n    # The equation is interpreted as: 30 (base b) - 1 (base b) = 8 (base b)\n    print(f\"The haiku describes the equation: {num_from_line_2} - {num_from_line_3} = {num_from_line_1}\")\n    print(\"To find the unknown base 'b', we can express this as: (3*b) - 1 = 8\")\n\n    # The equation simplifies to 3*b = 9, so b = 3.\n    # The riddle's answer is the name of the base we found.\n    # A base-3 system is called \"Ternary\".\n    answer_word = \"TERNARY\"\n    print(f\"The solution to the equation gives us base 3, which is called '{answer_word}'.\")\n    \n    # The final step is to present the answer in alphabetical order.\n    alphabetized_answer = \"\".join(sorted(answer_word))\n\n    print(f\"The final answer in alphabetical order is: {alphabetized_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<AENRRTY>>>"
