    "My plan is to identify the specific movie based on the detailed scene description provided by the user. The scene is quite distinctive, involving a teenager on a pink bike confronting an oncoming car. This act of defiance is a memorable moment. I will search my knowledge base for movies matching these key elements: a teenage character, a pink bicycle, and a direct confrontation with a car. Once the film is identified, I will provide its title as the answer, formatted within a Python code block as requested.\n\n```python\n# The film that features this specific scene is the 2011 remake of \"Fright Night\".\n# In the movie, the character Amy Peterson (played by Imogen Poots), after an argument with her boyfriend Charley,\n# defiantly rides her pink bicycle directly into the path of an oncoming car, which swerves to avoid her.\n\nmovie_title = \"Fright Night (2011)\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<Fright Night (2011)>>>"
