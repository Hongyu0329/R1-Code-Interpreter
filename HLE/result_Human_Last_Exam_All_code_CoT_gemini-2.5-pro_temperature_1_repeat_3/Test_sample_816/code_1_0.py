    # The problem describes an inward surface flow in a weld pool.
    # We must identify the force responsible for this.

    # 1. Marangoni Force (A): This force is driven by surface tension gradients.
    #    - Surface tension depends on temperature and composition.
    #    - In steels with surfactants like sulfur (present in 304 SS), the surface
    #      tension INCREASES with temperature.
    #    - The center of the weld pool is hottest, so it has the highest surface tension.
    #    - Fluid flows from low to high surface tension, so it flows INWARD from the
    #      edges to the center. This matches the observation.

    # 2. Arc Drag (B) and Arc Pressure (C): These forces from the plasma arc push the
    #    molten metal outward and downward. This is opposite to the observation.

    # 3. Lorentz Force (D): This electromagnetic force creates a pinching effect,
    #    driving flow inward and downward. While it contributes to stirring, the
    #    Marangoni force is known to be the dominant mechanism for this specific
    #    INWARD SURFACE FLOW in steels with surfactants.

    # 4. Buoyancy Force (E): This is caused by density differences and is generally
    #    much weaker than the other forces in welding.

    # Conclusion: The Marangoni force is the only mechanism that explains the
    # inward surface flow in this specific material context.
