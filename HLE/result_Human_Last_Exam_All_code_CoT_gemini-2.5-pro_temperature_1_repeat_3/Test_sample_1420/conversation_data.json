    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a `d=3` dimensional system using the epsilon expansion, we follow a well-defined procedure from statistical field theory. The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method calculated around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension (`d_c`)**: For the universality class containing the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, mean-field theory exponents become exact.\n2.  **Calculate `ϵ`**: The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`. Given the spatial dimension `d = 3`, we can calculate `ϵ`.\n3.  **Specify the System (n)**: The exponent value depends on the number of components of the order parameter, denoted by `n`. Since the problem does not specify the system, we will assume the simplest and most common case: the Ising model, which corresponds to a scalar order parameter with `n = 1`.\n4.  **Apply the Epsilon Expansion Formula**: The specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` is given by the formula derived from renormalization group analysis:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Compute the Value**: We will substitute the values of `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula to find the numerical value of `α`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing each step of the calculation and printing the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha (α) using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the epsilon expansion\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension\n    d = 3    # Spatial dimension\n    n = 1    # Number of order parameter components (for the Ising model)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the components of the formula for alpha\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    inner_denominator = n + 8\n    denominator = 2 * inner_denominator\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate alpha to first order in epsilon\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent alpha (α) using the first-order epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"This calculation assumes the Ising model universality class (n=1).\")\n    print(f\"Upper critical dimension (d_c): {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial dimension (d): {d}\")\n    print(f\"Number of components (n): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Epsilon (ε = d_c - d): {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\\nFormula for alpha: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with all numbers substituted\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / (2 * {inner_denominator}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated scaling exponent alpha is: {alpha}\")\n    \n    # Required for the final answer format\n    # Redirect final answer to a specific stream if needed, or just print\n    # For this problem, we will print it at the end to be captured.\n    print(f\"<<<{alpha}>>>\", file=sys.stdout)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n```"
