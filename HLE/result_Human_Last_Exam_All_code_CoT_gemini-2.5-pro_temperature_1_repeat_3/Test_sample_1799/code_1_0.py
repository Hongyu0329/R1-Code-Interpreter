    # we are moving away at the same speed. This symmetry is the essence of Postulate 1.

    # --- Case 1: Postulate 1 + Galilean Relativity ---
    # This framework assumes the Principle of Relativity (Postulate 1) but uses the
    # classical, intuitive rules for adding velocities. This was the pre-Einstein view.
    # If the light source (spaceship) is moving away from you, you would expect its
    # light to appear to travel slower.
    # The formula is: v_measured = v_light - v_source
    # (We use a minus sign because the light is coming towards us from a source moving away).
    # Wait, the prompt is about a source moving away but the beam is emitted *towards* the observer.
    # Let's re-read. "sending a beam of light towards you".
    # Ok, let's re-think the signs.
    # Let my frame be S. The spaceship frame be S'. S' moves with velocity v_spaceship relative to S.
    # The light has velocity u' = -c in the S' frame (negative because it's towards me, the origin of S).
    # Galilean transformation: u = u' + v_spaceship
    # So, u = -c + v_spaceship
    # The speed I measure is the magnitude of u. speed = |u| = |-c + 0.5c| = |-0.5c| = 0.5c.
    # This seems right. If the source moves away at 0.5c and emits light towards me at c (relative to it),
    # the light's net speed in my frame would be c - 0.5c = 0.5c.
