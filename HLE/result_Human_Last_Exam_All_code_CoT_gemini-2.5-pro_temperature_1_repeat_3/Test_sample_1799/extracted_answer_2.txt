No, the 2nd postulate is not superfluous. While applying the 1st postulate to the laws of electromagnetism implies a constant speed of light, the 1st postulate alone is not sufficient. Without the 2nd postulate, one could instead assume the 1st postulate applies to a universe with Galilean relativity, where there is no universal constant speed. The 2nd postulate is the crucial independent statement that selects the correct kinematics for our universe.
