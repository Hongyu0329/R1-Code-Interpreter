        "C": "This is incorrect. The case explicitly states the patient does not have cirrhosis, which is a prerequisite for hepatic encephalopathy.",

        "E": "This is too general. ATP depletion is a cellular-level process, not a clinical diagnosis that describes the patient's specific syndrome."
