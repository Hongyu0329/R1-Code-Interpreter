    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\nFirst, I will break down the riddle into its core components: the location (Vienna), the feature (\"wide boulevards\"), the context (\"in a Russian translation\"), and the target (an \"English poet's surname\"). The key to solving this is a word pun that works when translating between English and Russian.\n\nThe most famous literary association connecting these elements is a pun made by the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky in his essays. He noted that the Russian for \"wide\" (\"широкий\" - shirokiy) reminded him of the German poet Schiller. However, the riddle specifically asks for an *English* poet, making Schiller a likely trap.\n\nTherefore, I will look for a more direct pun that fits all the criteria. The script will simulate this logical deduction, connecting the English word \"wide\" from \"wide boulevards\" to the surname of a famous poet associated with English literature.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a literary riddle by analyzing its clues and finding a word pun.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the clues provided in the riddle.\n    location = \"Vienna\"\n    feature = \"wide boulevards\"\n    context = \"Russian translation\"\n    target_type = \"English poet\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the riddle with the following clues:\")\n    print(f\"- Location: {location}\")\n    print(f\"- Feature: {feature}\")\n    print(f\"- Context: {context}\")\n    print(f\"- Target: Surname of an {target_type}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the most common trap associated with these clues.\n    print(\"A well-known literary pun connects Vienna's boulevards and the Russian language.\")\n    print(\"The Russian poet Joseph Brodsky noted that 'широкий' (shirokiy), the Russian word for 'wide',\")\n    print(\"reminded him of the GERMAN poet Schiller. This is a potential trap as the riddle asks for an ENGLISH poet.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Propose a solution that fits all criteria, including \"English\".\n    print(\"Let's consider a more direct pun based on the English words themselves.\")\n    print(\"The key word is 'wide'.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Form the pun that reveals the answer.\n    pun_word = \"wide\"\n    poet_surname = \"Wilde\"\n    \n    print(\"The pun connects the descriptive word to the poet's surname:\")\n    # This section fulfills the requirement to \"output each part in the final equation\"\n    # by showing the components of the wordplay.\n    print(f\"'{pun_word}' (from wide boulevards) sounds exactly like the surname '{poet_surname}'.\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 5: State the final answer.\n    final_answer = poet_surname\n    print(f\"The surname of the English (technically Irish, but prominent in English literature) poet is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Wilde>>>"
