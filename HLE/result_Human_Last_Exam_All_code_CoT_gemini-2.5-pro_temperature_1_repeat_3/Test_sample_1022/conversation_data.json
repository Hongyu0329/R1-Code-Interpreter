    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **State the Künneth Formula:** The calculation for the cohomology of a product of groups relies on the Künneth formula. For bounded cohomology with real coefficients, the formula for dimensions is:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i+j=n} \\dim H_b^i(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^j(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    In our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ (Thompson's group T) and the degree is $n=4$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounded Cohomology of T:** We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of a single Thompson's group $T$, i.e., $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for various $k$.\n    *   A fundamental result by N. Monod shows that for Thompson's group $T$, its bounded cohomology is isomorphic to its ordinary group cohomology: $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   The ordinary real cohomology of $T$ is known to be an exterior algebra on a single generator of degree 3.\n    *   This implies the following dimensions:\n        *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\geq 4$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula and Calculate:** I will substitute these dimensions into the Künneth formula for $n=4$:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dim H_b^i(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^{4-i}(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    The calculation will expand this sum, substitute the known dimension values, and compute the final result.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\n\n    This is based on two key results:\n    1.
