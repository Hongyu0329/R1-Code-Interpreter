    # - The problem states X is a connected space.
    # - The problem states A is a connected subset of X.
    # - The problem states C is a component of X \ A.
    # The conditions match perfectly. The additional details (T1 space, cardinality c)
    # do not invalidate the theorem.

    # Step 3: Apply the theorem's conclusion.
    # The theorem concludes that X \ C is a connected space.

    # Step 4: Relate connectivity to the number of components.
    # By definition, a space is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component.
