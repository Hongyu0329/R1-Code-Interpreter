    Calculates the temperature of the star Pandora based on its spectral radiance,
    adhering to the computational constraints of the Wuxing architecture.
    
    The Wuxing architecture does not support floating-point numbers or transcendental
    math functions like ln() or exp(). We simulate this by using fraction-based
    arithmetic and a Taylor series approximation for the natural logarithm.
