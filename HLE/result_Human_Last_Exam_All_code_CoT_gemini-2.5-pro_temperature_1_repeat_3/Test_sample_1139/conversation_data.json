    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model for symmetry class D. This target space is a mathematical structure known as a coset supermanifold, and the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables corresponds to the dimension of its bosonic sector.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the Target Space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D with `N_R` replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the coset supermanifold `G/H`, where `G = O(2*N_R | 2*N_R)` and the subgroup `H = O(N_R | N_R) x O(N_R | N_R)`.\n2.  **Determine the Number of Variables:** The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this coset space. This is calculated by subtracting the dimension of the bosonic part of the subgroup `H` from that of the group `G`: `dim_B(G) - dim_B(H)`.\n3.  **Calculate Bosonic Dimensions:** The bosonic part of the supergroup `O(p|q)` is the standard Lie group `O(p) x O(q)`. The dimension of an orthogonal group `O(k)` is given by the formula `k*(k-1)/2`. Therefore, the bosonic dimension of `O(p|q)` is `dim(O(p)) + dim(O(q))`.\n4.  **Substitute Values:** We are given `N_R = 2` replicas.\n    *   For the group `G = O(4|4)`, we will calculate `dim_B(G)`.\n    *   For the subgroup `H = O(2|2) x O(2|2)`, we will calculate `dim_B(H)`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We will compute the difference `dim_B(G) - dim_B(H)` to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_non_grassman_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with a given\n    number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    num_replicas = 2\n\n    def dim_orthogonal_group(k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(k).\"\"\"\n        if k < 1:\n            return 0\n        return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    def dim_bosonic_supergroup(p, q):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimension of the bosonic part of the supergroup O(p|q).\n        The bosonic subgroup of O(p|q) is O(p) x O(q).\n        \"\"\"\n        return dim_orthogonal_group(p) + dim_orthogonal_group(q)\n\n    # For symmetry class D, the target supermanifold is G/H.\n    # G = O(2*N_R | 2*N_R)\n    # H = O(N_R | N_R) x O(N_R | N_R)\n\n    # Parameters for G = O(p_G | q_G)\n    p_G = 2 * num_replicas\n    q_G = 2 * num_replicas\n\n    # Parameters for one component of H = O(p_H | q_H)\n    p_H = num_replicas\n    q_H = num_replicas\n\n    # Calculate the bosonic dimension of the total group G\n    dim_b_g = dim_bosonic_supergroup(p_G, q_G)\n\n    # Calculate the bosonic dimension of the subgroup H\n    # H has two identical components, so its dimension is twice the dimension of one component.\n    dim_b_h = 2 * dim_bosonic_supergroup(p_H, q_H)\n\n    # The number of non-Grassman variables is the difference in the bosonic dimensions.\n    num_variables = dim_b_g - dim_b_h\n\n    # Print the calculation steps\n    print(f\"The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of the coset space G/H.\")\n    print(f\"For symmetry class D with {num_replicas} replicas:\")\n    print(f\"G = O({p_G}|{q_G}) and H = O({p_H}|{q_H}) x O({p_H}|{q_H}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Dimension of the bosonic part of G, dim_B(G):\")\n    dim_o_p_g = dim_orthogonal_group(p_G)\n    dim_o_q_g = dim_orthogonal_group(q_G)\n    print(f\"dim_B(O({p_G}|{q_G})) = dim(O({p_G})) + dim(O({q_G})) = {dim_o_p_g} + {dim_o_q_g} = {dim_b_g}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nDimension of the bosonic part of H, dim_B(H):\")\n    dim_o_p_h = dim_orthogonal_group(p_H)\n    dim_o_q_h = dim_orthogonal_group(q_H)\n    dim_b_h_component = dim_bosonic_supergroup(p_H, q_H)\n    print(f\"dim_B(H) = 2 * (dim(O({p_H})) + dim(O({q_H}))) = 2 * ({dim_o_p_h} + {dim_o_q_h}) = {dim_b_h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of variables = dim_B(G) - dim_B(H) = {dim_b_g} - {dim_b_h} = {num_variables}\")\n\ncalculate_non_grassman_variables()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
