    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Find the maximum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring of a specific type of graph.\n    *   **Graph Properties:**\n        *   Number of vertices, $n = 12345$.\n        *   It is *not* a complete graph ($K_n$).\n        *   It has some maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, but this value is not given and is a property of the graph we might need to consider.\n    *   **Output Format:** A single Python code block that explains the logic and prints the final calculation. The final answer should also be enclosed in `<<<>>>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Graph Theory Concepts:**\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that fits the description.\n    *   **General Bound:** For any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$.\n    *   **Case of Equality:** The only graph that requires exactly $n$ colors is the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   **Problem Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that our graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph.\n    *   **Implication:** Since $G \\neq K_n$, we know for sure that $\\chi(G)$ must be less than $n$. So, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Maximum Value (Worst-Case Scenario):**\n    *   We've established an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n    *   The question is whether this maximum value of $n-1$ can actually be achieved by some graph that is not a complete graph.\n    *   To show that $n-1$ is the maximum, I need to construct an example of a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, where $G \\neq K_{12345}$, and $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n    *   **Construction:** Let's think of a simple way to make a graph that is \"almost\" complete but not quite, and requires many colors.\n        *   A clique (a complete subgraph) is what drives up the chromatic number. A $K_k$ subgraph requires $k$ colors.\n        *   Consider a graph that contains a large clique. Let's make a clique of size $n-1$, which is $K_{n-1}$. This subgraph itself requires $n-1$ colors.\n        *   Now, we need to add the $n$-th vertex to our graph. To ensure the whole graph is not a complete graph $K_n$, this $n$-th vertex must *not* be connected to at least one of the vertices in the $K_{n-1}$.\n        *   The simplest such construction is to have the $K_{n-1}$ and add the $n$-th vertex as an isolated vertex (connected to nothing). Let's call this graph $G_1 = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$.\n    *   **Analyzing the Constructed Graph ($G_1$):**\n        *   Number of vertices: $(n-1) + 1 = n$. Correct.\n        *   Is it a complete graph? No, because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex. Correct.\n        *   What is its chromatic number, $\\chi(G_1)$? The $K_{n-1}$ part requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these $n-1$ colors since it has no adjacent vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed for the whole graph is $n-1$. So, $\\chi(G_1) = n-1$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that for any non-complete graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n    *   We have also constructed a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Code Generation:**\n    *   $n = 12345$.\n    *   Maximum colors = $n - 1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n    *   Now, I will write the Python code to encapsulate this logic, perform the calculation, and print the result clearly as requested. The code will serve as the explanation itself.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G with n=12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
