    "Based on your description, the film you are likely thinking of is *Inglourious Basterds*. While the character doesn't board a bus, there is a very famous scene where a British spy, posing as a German officer in a tavern, seals his fate with a simple, polite gesture. He orders three drinks using a hand gesture that is distinctly non-German, which immediately reveals his identity to a suspicious Gestapo Major. It's a classic example of a small cultural mistake having fatal consequences.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print the name of this film.\n\n```python\ndef find_film():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the film based on the user's description.\n\n    The user describes a scene where a character's small action seals their fate.\n    This strongly points to a pivotal scene in \"Inglourious Basterds\",\n    where a hand gesture, not a phrase on a bus, reveals a spy.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Inglourious Basterds\"\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film where a character's subtle mistake seals his fate is: {film_title}\")\n\nfind_film()\n```\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
