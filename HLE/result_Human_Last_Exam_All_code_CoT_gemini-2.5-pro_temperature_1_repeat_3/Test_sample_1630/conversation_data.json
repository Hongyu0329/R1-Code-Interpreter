    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python code implementation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree:** The function in question is a composition of two degree-3 polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The degree of a composite polynomial is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Therefore, $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Fixed-Point Equation:** A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. This can be rewritten as the root-finding problem $h(x) - x = 0$.\n\n3.  **Find the Upper Bound:** The equation $h(x) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation. Since $h(x)$ has degree 9, the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$ also has degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Thus, $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n4.  **Check if the Upper Bound is Achievable:** The main challenge is to determine if it's possible to have 9 fixed points given the constraints that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. These conditions imply that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    *   The derivative of the composite function is $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. Since both $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive, $h'(x)$ is also always positive, meaning $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n    *   A strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times. For $P(x) = h(x) - x$ to have 9 roots, its graph must cross the x-axis 9 times. This requires the function to have 8 local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima) that alternate in sign (maxima are positive, minima are negative).\n    *   The extrema of $P(x)$ occur when $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = 0$. The function $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. It is possible to choose the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ such that the equation $h'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   By further adjusting the constant term in the definition of $f(x)$ (which shifts the graph of $P(x)$ vertically without changing its derivative), it is possible to arrange for the local maxima to be positive and the local minima to be negative, thus guaranteeing 9 real roots.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The maximum number of fixed points is 9. While constructing a specific example is mathematically non-trivial, it has been demonstrated in mathematical literature.\n\nI will now provide a Python code that uses a known pair of functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ which, with carefully chosen parameters, can have 9 fixed points. The code will define these functions, find a suitable vertical shift, and then numerically find and print the 9 fixed points to demonstrate that this maximum is achievable.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\n\ndef solve_fixed_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that f(g(x)) can have 9 fixed points.\n    It uses specific cubic polynomials f and g with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
