# Plan:
# 1. Determine the number of carbons from compound 11 that end up in compound 1.
#    - Compound 11 (4C) is cleaved into two 2C fragments (compound 12).
#    - The synthesis uses one 2C fragment.
#    - These 2 carbons are retained throughout the synthesis to compound 1.
#    - Result: 2
#
# 2. Determine the number of oxygens from compound 11 that are present in compound 14.
#    - Compound 11 (2O) is cleaved into two fragments, each with 1 oxygen.
#    - The synthesis uses one fragment.
#    - This oxygen is retained in the molecule through the formation of compound 14.
#    - Result: 1
#
# 3. Determine the number of nitrogens from compound 7 that are present in compound 10.
#    - The synthesis proceeds from 10 to 7. The question is chronologically reversed.
#    - The logical interpretation is to find the number of nitrogens in compound 10.
#    - Compound 10 is made using MeNO2, which has one nitrogen atom.
#    - Result: 1
#
# Final answer is the combination of the three results.

carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1
nitrogens_in_10 = 1 # Interpreting the flawed question logically

# The final response should be the three numbers, separated by commas.
