    This function solves for the bounds of t based on the derivation.
    
    Let the interval for a_i be [-1, t].
    The sum S = a_0 + a_2 can range over the interval R = [-2, 2t].
    The problem requires that for any S in R, there exists T in R such that S * T = 1.
    This implies that for any s in R, 1/s must also be in R.
    
    1.  The range R cannot contain 0, otherwise 1/S is undefined.
        This means R = [-2, 2t] must be entirely negative, so 2t < 0, which implies t < 0.
        
    2.  For an interval of negative numbers [a, b], the condition that 1/[a,b] is a subset of [a,b]
        leads to the strict requirement that a * b = 1.
    
    3.  In our case, a = -2 and b = 2t.
        So, the condition simplifies to the equation: (-2) * (2*t) = 1.
