def find_nullifiable_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure.

    Based on the official voter guide, there are two pairs of competing measures:
    1. Proposition E and Proposition F: These are competing measures related to police policies.
       If both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes becomes law, and the other is nullified.
    2. Proposition G and Proposition H: These are competing measures related to public schools.
       If both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes becomes law, and the other is nullified.

    Therefore, propositions E, F, G, and H are all potentially nullifiable.
