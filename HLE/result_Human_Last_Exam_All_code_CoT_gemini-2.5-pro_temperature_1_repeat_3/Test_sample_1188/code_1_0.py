    This problem asks for the smallest integer t for which the lower filtration G_t of the Galois group G=Gal(K/Q_2) is trivial, where K is the splitting field of x^4 - 2 over Q_2.
    
    1.  The Galois group G is the dihedral group D_4 of order 8.
    2.  The extension K/Q_2 is totally ramified, so G_0 = G.
    3.  The residue field is F_2, so G_0/G_1 is trivial, meaning G_1 = G_0 = D_4.
    4.  The different exponent d(K/Q_2) is calculated to be 26.
    5.  The formula for the different exponent is d = sum_{i=0 to infinity} (|G_i| - 1).
    6.  We must find the sequence of ramification groups G_i that satisfies this sum. The G_i must be normal subgroups of D_4.
    
    The sequence of ramification groups is as follows:
    - G_0 = D_4 (|G_0|=8). Contribution to sum: 8-1=7.
    - G_1 = D_4 (|G_1|=8). Contribution to sum: 8-1=7. Total sum = 14.
    - G_2 = V_4, a Klein-4 subgroup (|G_2|=4). Contribution to sum: 4-1=3. Total sum = 17.
    - G_3 = V_4 (|G_3|=4). Contribution to sum: 4-1=3. Total sum = 20.
    - G_4 = C_2, the center of D_4 (|G_4|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 21.
    - G_5 = C_2 (|G_5|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 22.
    - G_6 = C_2 (|G_6|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 23.
    - G_7 = C_2 (|G_7|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 24.
    - G_8 = C_2 (|G_8|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 25.
    - G_9 = C_2 (|G_9|=2). Contribution to sum: 2-1=1. Total sum = 26.
    - G_10 = {e} (|G_10|=1). Contribution to sum: 1-1=0. Total sum = 26.

    The sum matches the calculated different exponent. The filtration becomes trivial at index 10.
