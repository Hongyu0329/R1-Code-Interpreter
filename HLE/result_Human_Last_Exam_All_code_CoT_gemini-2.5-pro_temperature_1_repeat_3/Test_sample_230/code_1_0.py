    Analyzes the properties of the magma and determines for which n
    n-cancellability implies mediality.

    The problem states a magma M is:
    1. Idempotent: x * x = x
    2. Commutative: x * y = y * x
    3. Left Self-Distributive: x * (y * z) = (x * y) * (x * z)

    It asks for which positive integers n does the property of being n-cancellable
    (a^n * b = b implies a = b) guarantee that the magma is also medial
    ((a * b) * (c * d) = (a * c) * (b * d)).

    This is a known result in abstract algebra. The implication holds if and only
    if n is an odd positive integer.

    - For n odd: One can prove that if the magma is n-cancellable, it must be medial.
    - For n even: Counterexamples exist. That is, it's possible to construct a
      non-medial magma that is still n-cancellable for an even n.

    This script will print the conclusion and the set of valid n.
