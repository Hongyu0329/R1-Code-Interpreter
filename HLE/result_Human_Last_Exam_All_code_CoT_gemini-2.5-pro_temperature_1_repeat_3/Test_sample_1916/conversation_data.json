    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with a single object is, by definition, a monoid. The object is the single object of the category, the morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation, and the identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. An isomorphism between such categories corresponds directly to a monoid isomorphism.\n\nSo, the task is to find all non-isomorphic algebraic structures on a set of 3 elements, say `{e, a, b}`, that satisfy the axioms of a monoid. Here, `e` is the identity element.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Represent the 3 elements as `0, 1, 2`, with `0` being the identity element `e`.\n2.  A monoid structure is defined by a `3x3` multiplication table. Since `0` is the identity, the first row and column are fixed (`0*x = x` and `x*0 = x`). We only need to determine the `2x2` sub-table for the non-identity elements `1` and `2` (i.e., `a` and `b`).\n3.  There are `3^4 = 81` possible ways to define this `2x2` sub-table, as each of the 4 entries (`a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, `b*b`) can be any of the 3 elements (`e, a, b`).\n4.  I will programmatically iterate through all 81 possibilities and check each one for associativity, which is the remaining monoid axiom to satisfy: `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` for all `x, y, z`.\n5.  The tables that satisfy associativity represent all possible monoids of order 3.\n6.  The final step is to count how many of these are non-isomorphic. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, with two non-identity elements `a` and `b`, the only non-trivial relabeling is to swap them.\n7.  For each valid monoid table, I will generate its \"swapped\" version. I will then define a \"canonical form\" for each isomorphism class (e.g., the lexicographically smallest representation of the core `2x2` table).\n8.  By storing these canonical forms in a set, I can count the number of unique (i.e., non-isomorphic) monoids.\n9.  The final code will print the total count and the multiplication rules for each unique monoid found.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef check_associativity(table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a given multiplication table is associative.\"\"\"\n    elements = range(3)\n    for x in elements:\n        for y in elements:\n            for z in elements:\n                if table[table[x][y]][z] != table[x][table[y][z]]:\n                    return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_canonical_form(core_tuple):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the canonical form for an isomorphism class.\n    The non-identity elements are {1, 2}.
