    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chess puzzle and generate the code.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to find out how many *edge squares* on a chessboard are left empty after placing the *maximum possible number* of non-attacking bishops on those same edge squares.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:**\n    *   A standard chessboard is 8x8, containing 64 squares in total.\n    *   The \"edge\" consists of the first and last rows, and the first and last columns.\n    *   A simple way to count them is to subtract the inner squares from the total squares. The inner board is a 6x6 grid.\n    *   Total squares = 8 * 8 = 64\n    *   Inner squares = 6 * 6 = 36\n    *   Total edge squares = 64 - 36 = 28.\n\n3.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Bishops:**\n    *   The core of the problem is finding the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these 28 edge squares without any bishop attacking another.\n    *   Bishops attack along diagonals. Bishops in the same column or row do not attack each other (unless they are also on the same diagonal, which is impossible for squares in the same column/row).\n    *   A simple and effective strategy is to fill an entire edge. Let's try filling the first column (column 'a') with bishops. This gives us 8 bishops (on a1, a2, ..., a8). These bishops do not attack each other.\n    *   Now, let's see which other edge squares we can place bishops on. The bishops on column 'a' attack many other squares. However, they do not attack most of the squares on the opposite edge, column 'h'.\n    *   A bishop at `a[i]` (row `i`, column 1) attacks a square at `h[j]` (row `j`, column 8) only if the diagonal distance is the same: `|i - j| = |1 - 8| = 7`.\n    *   This condition is only met for two pairs:\n        *   `a1` (i=1) attacks `h8` (j=8), since `|1 - 8| = 7`.\n        *   `a8` (i=8) attacks `h1` (j=1), since `|8 - 1| = 7`.\n    *   This means that if we place bishops on all squares in column 'a', the only squares in column 'h' that are attacked are `h1` and `h8`.\n    *   Therefore, the 6 other squares in column 'h' (`h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `h7`) are safe. We can place bishops on all 6 of them. These 6 bishops don't attack each other since they are all in the same column.\n    *   Combining these placements, we have 8 bishops on column 'a' and 6 bishops on column 'h'.\n    *   Maximum bishops = 8 + 6 = 14.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   We have the total number of edge squares (28).\n    *   We have the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on them (14).\n    *   The number of squares lacking a bishop is the difference between these two numbers.\n    *   Empty squares = Total edge squares - Maximum bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will replicate this simple calculation.\n    *   It will define the board size `N=8`.\n    *   It will calculate `edge_squares = (N*N) - ((N-2)*(N-2))`.\n    *   It will calculate `max_bishops = N + (N-2)`.\n    *   It will calculate the result `empty_squares = edge_squares - max_bishops`.\n    *   Finally, it will print the full equation as requested, showing each number.\n\nThis plan covers all the requirements and correctly solves the puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # This is the total number of squares minus the inner squares.\n    total_squares = board_size * board_size\n    inner_squares = (board_size - 2) * (board_size - 2)\n    edge_squares = total_squares - inner_squares\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops\n    # that can be placed on the edge squares.\n    # A maximal placement can be achieved by placing bishops on one full edge (e.g., column 'a')\n    # and the opposite edge excluding the corners (e.g., column 'h' except h1 and h8).\n    # This gives N + (N-2) bishops.\n    max_bishops = board_size + (board_size - 2)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares are left without bishops.\n    empty_squares = edge_squares - max_bishops\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"This puzzle asks for the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on them.\")\n    print(f\"\\n1. First, we find the total number of edge squares on an {board_size}x{board_size} board: {edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"2. Next, we find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on those squares: {max_bishops}\")\n    print(\"\\n3. Finally, we find the number of squares that lack bishops by subtracting the number of bishops from the total number of edge squares.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{edge_squares} - {max_bishops} = {empty_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
