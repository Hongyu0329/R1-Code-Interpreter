    "My plan is to answer the user's question by first identifying the correct mushroom genus. The question refers to a common misconception. While no known mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print, the genus *Lactarius* is famous for the species *Lactarius indigo*, which is a vibrant blue mushroom that \"bleeds\" blue latex. This is the most likely answer the user is looking for.\n\nI will write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the name of the genus, \"Lactarius\", in a variable.\n2.  Print the name of the genus.\n3.  Print a clarification that while this genus is famous for its blue color, its spore print is not actually blue, addressing the misconception in the question's premise.\n\n```python\ndef find_blue_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the mushroom genus famously associated\n    with the color blue, which is often mistakenly believed to have a blue\n    spore print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus most famously associated with a blue color is Lactarius.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\n    # Print the answer to the user's question.\n    print(f\"The single genus of mushroom famously known for a distinct blue color is: {genus_name}\")\n\n    # Add a note to clarify the common misconception about the spore print color.\n    print(\"\\nNote: This is based on species like Lactarius indigo, which is a vivid blue mushroom that bleeds blue latex. However, it is a common misconception that its spore print is blue. The actual spore print color for this species is yellowish to cream.\")\n\nfind_blue_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
