    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a photon gas, which obeys Bose-Einstein statistics. We can solve this by using the principle of maximum entropy, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics that is rigorously justified by large deviation theorems like Sanov's theorem. The core idea is that the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macrostate that has the largest number of corresponding microstates, and thus the highest entropy. Deviations from this state are exponentially unlikely.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to derive these values:\n\n1.  **Formulate Entropy:** The first step is to write down the statistical definition of entropy for a Bose gas. The entropy `S` is given by `S = k_B * ln(W)`, where `W` is the total number of ways to arrange the photons in the available energy states.\n\n2.  **Maximize Entropy:** We find the equilibrium distribution of photons across energy levels by maximizing this entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `E`. For a photon gas, the number of particles is not conserved, which simplifies the calculation (the chemical potential is zero). This maximization procedure yields the Planck distribution for the average number of photons `<n_ε>` in a state with energy `ε`:\n    `<n_ε> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n\n3.  **Integrate Over States:** To find the macroscopic values of total energy `E` and entropy `S`, we sum the contributions from all possible energy levels. Since the energy levels form a continuum, this sum becomes an integral. This requires the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume `V`, which is `g(ε) = (8πV / (hc)³) * ε²`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Mean Energy (E):** The total energy `E` is calculated by integrating the energy per state (`ε`) multiplied by the number of photons in that state (`<n_ε>`) and the density of states (`g(ε)`) over all energies:\n    `E = ∫ ε * <n_ε> * g(ε) dε`\n    The evaluation of this integral results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n5.  **Calculate Entropy (S):** The total entropy `S` can be found either by integrating the entropy formula over all states or by using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, `S = 4E / (3T)`. Substituting the result for `E` from the previous step gives the final expression for the equilibrium entropy.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final, derived formulas for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n```python\ndef print_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script presents the derived formulas for the equilibrium mean energy (E)\n    and entropy (S) for a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta).\n    \n    The derivation follows from maximizing the system's entropy subject to a\n    fixed total energy, a principle underpinned by large deviation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The equilibrium values for a photon gas are derived by maximizing entropy.\")\n    print(\"This yields the following formulas for the mean energy (E) and entropy (S).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables for clarity\n    constants_desc = (\n        \"V:   Volume\\n\"\n        \"T:   Temperature\\n\"\n        \"k_B: Boltzmann constant\\n\"\n        \"h:   Planck's constant\\n\"\n        \"c:   Speed of light\\n\"\n        \"pi:  The constant π\"\n    )\n    print(\"Constants used in the equations:\\n\" + constants_desc)\n    \n    # --- Mean Energy (E) ---\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):\")\n    \n    equation_E = \"E = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 * V * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\"\n    print(f\"\\n  {equation_E}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The integer numbers appearing in the energy equation are:\")\n    print(\"  - In the numerator: 8 (from polarization and solid angle), 5 (exponent of pi), 4 (exponent of T and k_B)\")\n    print(\"  - In the denominator: 15 (from the integral evaluation), 3 (exponent of h and c)\")\n\n    # --- Entropy (S) ---\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Equilibrium Entropy (S):\")\n\n    equation_S = \"S = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 * V * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\"\n    print(f\"\\n  {equation_S}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The integer numbers appearing in the entropy equation are:\")\n    print(\"  - In the numerator: 32 (from 4/3 * 8), 5 (exponent of pi), 4 (exponent of k_B), 3 (exponent of T)\")\n    print(\"  - In the denominator: 45 (from 3 * 15), 3 (exponent of h and c)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Run the function to display the results\nprint_equilibrium_values()\n```\n<<<E = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 * V * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3), S = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 * V * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)>>>"
