    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecule's composition:** Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions for Carbon (C) in 6-31G:**\n    *   **Core (1s):** The '6' indicates the 1s core orbital is represented by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n    *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** The '31' indicates the valence shell is split.\n        *   Inner valence (2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z): Represented by 1 s-type and 3 p-type functions. This is a total of 4 contracted functions (from 3 primitives each).\n        *   Outer valence (2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z): Represented by another 1 s-type and 3 p-type functions. This is another 4 contracted functions (from 1 primitive each).\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Determine basis functions for Hydrogen (H) in 6-31G:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. The '31' applies to its 1s valence orbital.\n        *   Inner valence (1s): Represented by 1 contracted function (from 3 primitives).\n        *   Outer valence (1s): Represented by 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive).\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 contracted functions.\n4.  **Calculate the total for C7H8:**\n    *   Total from Carbon atoms: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   Total from Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   Grand Total = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1s (core) + 2s,2p (inner valence) + 2s,2p (outer valence) = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1s (inner valence) + 1s (outer valence) = 1 + 1 = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"For toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Total contracted functions = (Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_hydrogen}) = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
