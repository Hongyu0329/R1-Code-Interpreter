    print("Assumption: Constant depth, polynomial width, log-precision transformers are in TC0.")
    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the impact of 'constant precision'.")
    print("Constant precision means that all numbers (weights, activations) are represented by a fixed number of bits, 'b'. This is in contrast to log-precision, where the number of bits can grow with the input size N (as log(N)).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the elementary operations.")
    print("With constant precision, elementary arithmetic operations like adding or multiplying two numbers become very simple from a circuit complexity perspective. A circuit to multiply two b-bit numbers has a constant size and depth.")
    print("Non-linearities like softmax or GELU, when applied to constant-precision numbers, operate on a finite domain of 2^b possible inputs. Such functions can be perfectly implemented by a lookup table (LUT), which in turn can be implemented by a constant-depth, polynomial-size circuit (an AC0 circuit, which is a subset of TC0).")

    print("\nStep 3: Combine operations into a transformer.")
    print("A constant-depth transformer consists of a constant number of layers. Each layer involves a polynomial number of these elementary operations (in matrix multiplications and attention).")
    print("Since each individual operation can be implemented by a constant-depth, constant-size circuit, and we are composing a polynomial number of them in a constant-depth structure, the resulting circuit family remains constant-depth and polynomial-size.")
    print("The key operation that requires the 'T' in TC0 (threshold gates) is summing up a polynomial number of values. Summing polynomial numbers of constant-bit values is a canonical TC0 operation.")
    print("Conclusion: Restricting the precision from logarithmic to constant does not increase the complexity. The model remains within TC0.")

    print("\n--- Question 2: Polynomial Steps of Chain-of-Thought ---")
    print("Step 1: Interpret 'polynomial steps of chain-of-thought'.")
    print("This implies a sequential, recurrent computation. The output of the transformer at step 't' becomes the input for step 't+1'. This is repeated for P(N) steps, where N is the input size and P is a polynomial.")
    print("This fundamentally changes the model from a parallel, constant-depth circuit to a sequential, polynomial-depth computation.")

    print("\nStep 2: Relate sequential computation to complexity classes.")
    print("A single pass of the transformer (as described in Part 1) is a polynomial-size computation. Let's denote this computation as function F.")
    print("The chain-of-thought process computes F(F(F(...F(input)...))), iterated P(N) times.")
    print("This is the definition of a polynomial-time algorithm. A Turing machine can simulate one application of F in polynomial time. Repeating this simulation P(N) times results in a total runtime that is still polynomial (poly * poly = poly).")
    print("This computational power—the ability to perform a polynomial number of sequential steps, where each step is itself a polynomial-time computation—is what defines the class P (Polynomial Time).")
