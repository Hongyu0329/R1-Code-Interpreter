    "The statement is True. Here is a step-by-step explanation, followed by a Python script that demonstrates the principle quantitatively.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical value representing the total proportion of phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by all measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) put together. It represents the *upper limit* of prediction accuracy achievable using a linear model of these SNPs.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** A PGS is a practical predictive model. It's constructed using effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a finite sample size. The predictive ability (R²) is how much of the phenotype's variance the PGS can explain in a *new, independent* sample.\n\nThe R² of a PGS is necessarily lower than the h²_SNP because the process of creating and applying a PGS introduces imperfections and statistical noise that are not present in the theoretical h²_SNP value. Key reasons include:\n\n*   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** Effect sizes for SNPs are *estimated* with error from a limited discovery sample. A larger GWAS sample reduces this error but never eliminates it.\n*   **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** PGS methods must account for the complex correlation structure between SNPs, which is a significant challenge and source of inaccuracy.\n*   **Mismatch between Samples:** Differences in ancestry and LD patterns between the GWAS discovery sample and the prediction target sample will lower the PGS accuracy.\n\n### Quantitative Demonstration\n\nThe following Python code uses a standard formula from statistical genetics to calculate the *expected* R² of a PGS. This formula shows how the predictive ability is limited by the SNP heritability, the GWAS sample size (`N`), and the effective number of independent SNPs (`M`). The result will demonstrate that the predicted R² is lower than the total SNP heritability.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_pgs_prediction_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (R^2)\n    is lower than the total SNP heritability (h2_snp).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Input Parameters ---\n    # SNP heritability: The total proportion of variance explained by all SNPs.\n    # Let's assume a trait with 50% heritability.\n    h2_snp = 0.5\n\n    # GWAS sample size: The number of individuals in the discovery study.\n    # A large, but finite, sample size.\n    N = 150000\n\n    # Effective number of independent SNPs.
