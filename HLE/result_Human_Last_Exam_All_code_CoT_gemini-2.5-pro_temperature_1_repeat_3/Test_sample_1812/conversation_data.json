    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The variable \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be extraneous information since the matrix `A` is explicitly provided.\n\nI will use Python with the NumPy library to perform the calculation. The steps are as follows:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` using a NumPy array.\n2.  Calculate the determinant of `A` using `numpy.linalg.det`.\n3.  To satisfy the requirement of showing the calculation, I will manually print the determinant formula with the specific values from matrix `A`.\n4.  I will then print the step-by-step evaluation of the formula.\n5.  Finally, I will print the result obtained from the NumPy function to confirm the manual calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The matrix is given as:\n# A = [[ 2, -1, -1],\n#      [-1,  2, -1],\n#      [-1, -1,  2]]\n# The information m_{1/2} = 13 is not needed for this calculation.\n\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extracting the elements for clarity in the formula\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the determinant using the formula:\n# det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\nterm1 = a * (e * i - f * h)\nterm2 = b * (d * i - f * g)\nterm3 = c * (d * h - e * g)\ndeterminant = term1 - term2 + term3\n\nprint(f\"Given the matrix A:\\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(\"The determinant is calculated using the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values from matrix A:\")\n\n# Printing each number in the final equation\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"       = {a}({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b})({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c})({d*h} - {e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a}({e*i - f*h}) - ({b})({d*i - f*g}) + ({c})({d*h - e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1} - ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1 + term2 + term3}\") # Note: term2 is negative, so term1 - term2 becomes term1 + (-term2)\nprint(f\"       = {determinant}\")\n\n# Verifying with numpy's built-in function\nnp_determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\nprint(f\"\\nDeterminant calculated by NumPy: {np_determinant}\")\nprint(f\"The final result is {int(round(np_determinant))}.\")\n\n<<<0>>>\n```"
