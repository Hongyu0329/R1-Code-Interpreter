# This script simulates the effect of a dominant invasive species on the
# latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) as predicted by Hubbell's neutral theory.

# --- Plan ---
# 1. Define the study sites and their approximate absolute latitudes.
# 2. Simulate the initial 'pre-invasion' state with a strong LDG, where
#    diversity is high at the equator (low latitude) and low at the poles (high latitude).
# 3. Calculate the slope of this initial diversity gradient using linear regression.
# 4. Simulate the 'post-invasion' state. According to the theory, a dominant
#    invasive leads to biotic homogenization, causing diversity to drop to a low,
#    relatively constant level across all sites.
# 5. Calculate the new slope and the final equation for diversity.
# 6. Compare the initial and final slopes to demonstrate that the gradient has flattened.

# Step 1: Define site latitudes (absolute distance from the equator in degrees)
