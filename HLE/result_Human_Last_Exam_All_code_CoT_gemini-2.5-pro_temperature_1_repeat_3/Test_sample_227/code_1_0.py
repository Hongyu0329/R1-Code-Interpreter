    # In our scenario, the snail's movement can be described by a function d(t)
    # that gives the total distance traveled by time t. We define it as a
    # step function where the snail moves in instantaneous jumps.

    observer_start_times = [(k * T) / D for k in range(num_observers)]

    # --- Verification (for conceptual understanding) ---
    # 1. Check if observers cover the [0, T] interval.
    # The last observer starts at t_{D-1} and watches for 1 minute.
    # The last interval ends at (D-1)*T/D + 1 = T - T/D + 1.
    # Since D = 2T-1, D > T, so T/D < 1. This means -T/D + 1 > 0.
    # So T - T/D + 1 > T. The interval [0, T] is fully covered.

    # 2. Check if each observer sees the snail move exactly 1 meter.
    # For an observer starting at t_k = k*T/D, the distance is d(t_k + 1) - d(t_k).
    # d(t_k + 1) = floor(v * (k*T/D + 1)) = floor((D/T)*(k*T/D + 1)) = floor(k + D/T)
    # d(t_k) = floor(v * k*T/D) = floor((D/T)*(k*T/D)) = floor(k) = k
    # Distance = floor(k + D/T) - k = floor(D/T) = floor((2T-1)/T) = floor(2 - 1/T)
    # Since T=7, this is floor(2 - 1/7) = 1.
    # The condition holds for every observer.
