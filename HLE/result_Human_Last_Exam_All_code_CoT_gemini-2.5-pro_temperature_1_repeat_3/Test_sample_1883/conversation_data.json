    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** I will first identify the key characteristics of the reaction: the number of pi electrons in the conjugated system of the reactant and the reaction condition (thermal).\n2.  **Apply FMO Theory/Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** Based on the number of pi electrons and the thermal condition, I will determine the stereochemical mode of the electrocyclic ring closure. For an 8-pi electron system under thermal conditions, the rules predict a specific type of rotation (either conrotatory or disrotatory).\n3.  **Analyze Reactant Stereochemistry:** I will examine the specific stereoisomer of the reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, to determine the relative positions of the methyl substituents at the ends of the conjugated system (C2 and C9).\n4.  **Predict Product Stereochemistry:** I will simulate the allowed rotational motion determined in step 2 on the specific reactant from step 3. This will show whether the methyl groups end up on the same side (*cis*, product A) or opposite sides (*trans*, product B) of the newly formed ring.\n5.  **Determine the Ratio:** The FMO theory predicts that the \"allowed\" pathway is energetically far more favorable than the \"forbidden\" pathway. The formation of the \"forbidden\" product is considered negligible. This will allow me to determine the ratio of product A to product B.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will encapsulate this entire logical process into a Python script that prints the step-by-step analysis and the final predicted ratio.\n\n```python\ndef solve_electrocyclic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the product ratio for the thermal electrocyclization of\n    (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene using Frontier Molecular Orbital theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction based on FMO theory.\n    pi_electrons = 8\n    condition = \"thermal\"\n    # The system is a 4n pi-electron system, where n=2.\n    # For thermal reactions, 4n systems undergo conrotatory closure.\n    allowed_motion = \"conrotatory\"\n\n    print(\"--- FMO Theory Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Reactant has a conjugated system with {pi_electrons} pi electrons.\")\n    print(f\"The reaction is conducted under {condition} conditions.\")\n    print(f\"For a system with {pi_electrons} (a '4n' system), FMO theory predicts a '{allowed_motion}' ring closure.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry of the reactant's terminal groups.\n    # Reactant: (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\n    # The pi system for cyclization is from C2 to C9.\n    # At C2 (from 2Z), the methyl group points \"in\" relative to the carbon chain's curve.\n    # At C9 (from 8E), the methyl group points \"out\" relative to the carbon chain's curve.\n    substituent_C2 = \"in\"\n    substituent_C9 = \"out\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reactant Stereochemistry ---\")\n    print(\"The reactant is (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\")\n    print(f\"In the conformation required for cyclization:\")\n    print(f\"  - The methyl group at C2 is '{substituent_C2}'.\")\n    print(f\"  - The methyl group at C9 is '{substituent_C9}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Predict the outcome of the allowed (conrotatory) and forbidden (disrotatory) pathways.\n    # Conrotatory motion: both ends rotate the same way (e.g., both clockwise).\n    # - The 'in' group at C2 rotates to point 'down'.\n    # - The 'out' group at C9 rotates to point 'up'.\n    # Result: One methyl is 'up', one is 'down' -> trans product (B).\n    conrotatory_product = \"trans-isomer (B)\"\n\n    # Disrotatory motion: ends rotate opposite ways.\n    # - The 'in' group at C2 rotates 'down'.\n    # - The 'out' group at C9 rotates 'down'.\n    # Result: Both methyls are 'down' -> cis product (A).\n    disrotatory_product = \"cis-isomer (A)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Predicting the Product ---\")\n    print(f\"Applying the allowed '{allowed_motion}' motion:\")\n    print(\"  - The 'in' methyl group at C2 and the 'out' methyl group at C9 rotate.\")\n    print(\"  - This places the two methyl groups on opposite faces of the new ring.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the '{allowed_motion}' pathway leads to the {conrotatory_product}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The alternative 'disrotatory' motion is thermally forbidden.\")\n    print(f\"This forbidden pathway would be required to form the {disrotatory_product}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude the product ratio.\n    # The allowed path is overwhelmingly favored.
