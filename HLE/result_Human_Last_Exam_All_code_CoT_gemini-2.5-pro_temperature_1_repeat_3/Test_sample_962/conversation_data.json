    "Of course. Here is a plan to design and demonstrate a two-round threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Complexity**: Designing a cryptographically \"tightly secure\" scheme is a subject of academic research. A full implementation is beyond the scope of a single script. Therefore, instead of a production-ready implementation, this response will provide a conceptual overview and a Python script that *simulates the mathematical operations* of a state-of-the-art scheme.\n2.  **Choose a Scheme**: We will model our simulation on **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**. FROST is an excellent choice because it's a well-regarded t-out-of-n scheme based on Schnorr signatures, and its signing protocol consists of exactly two rounds.\n3.  **Simulate the Math**: The Python code will not use real elliptic curve cryptography for simplicity. Instead, it will perform all calculations using modular arithmetic over a large prime number `q`. This makes the underlying mathematical principles clear and easy to follow.\n4.  **Demonstrate Step-by-Step**: The code will simulate a 2-out-of-3 scenario:\n    *   **Key Generation**: It will create a secret key and distribute \"shares\" of that key to 3 parties.\n    *   **Signing (2 Rounds)**: It will simulate the two communication rounds for 2 of the 3 parties to sign a message.\n    *   **Output Equations**: For every major calculation (e.g., creating a signature share, aggregating the final signature), the code will print the full equation with the actual numbers used, fulfilling the requirement to show each number in the final equation.\n    *   **Verification**: Finally, it will perform a verification check to prove that the generated signature is valid for the original secret key.\n\nThis approach will provide a clear, educational demonstration of how a two-round threshold signature scheme works mathematically.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\n\n# A helper function for modular inverse, used for Lagrange coefficients\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    \"\"\"Computes the modular inverse of a modulo m using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\"\"\"\n    a = a % m\n    return pow(a, -2, m) # Using Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(m-2) = a^(-1) mod m for prime m\n\ndef print_equation(parts, result, modulus):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to print equations clearly.\"\"\"\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, parts))\n    print(f\"    = {equation} mod {modulus}\")\n    print(f\"    = {sum(parts)} mod {modulus}\")\n    print(f\"    = {result}\\n\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a 2-out-of-3 FROST-like Threshold Signature Scheme.\n    NOTE: This is a simplified simulation for educational purposes.
