# This script decodes the meeting location based on the puzzle's clues.
# The solution is derived from the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic,
# a concept a software engineer would be familiar with. The word "Кома" (comma)
# hints at this numerical representation.

# --- Parameters from IEEE 754 Standard ---

# For a 64-bit double-precision float:
double_sign_bits = 1
double_exponent_bits = 11
double_mantissa_bits = 52

# For a 32-bit single-precision float:
single_exponent_bias = 127

# --- The Equation for the Coordinates ---

# The latitude is calculated from the bit structure of a 64-bit double.
# The total number of bits (1 + 11 + 52) is 64.
latitude = double_sign_bits + double_exponent_bits + double_mantissa_bits

# The longitude is calculated from a combination of single and double precision parameters.
# This combines the exponent bias of a 32-bit single with components of a 64-bit double.
longitude = single_exponent_bias + double_mantissa_bits - double_sign_bits

# --- Output the Result ---
