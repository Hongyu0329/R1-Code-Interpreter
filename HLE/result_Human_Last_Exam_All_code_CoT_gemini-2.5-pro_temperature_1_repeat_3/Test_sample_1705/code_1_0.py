    # The argument is that for analytic maps like f(x), the set of points
    # that do not converge to an attracting cycle has measure zero.
    #
    # A sequence can have a finite number of distinct values only if it is
    # eventually periodic. This means the starting point must be a preimage
    # of a periodic point.
    #
    # The fixed point at x=0 is repelling, since |f'(0)| > 1.
    # The fixed point at x=x_star is attracting, since |f'(x_star)| < 1.
    #
    # The set of preimages of all repelling cycles constitutes the Julia set,
    # which has measure zero for this function.
    #
    # The set of preimages of the attracting fixed point x_star is a countable
    # set of points. A countable set has Lebesgue measure zero.
    #
    # Any other point in the basin of attraction of x_star (which has measure 1)
    # will generate a sequence with infinitely many distinct values.
    #
    # Therefore, the set S, containing points that generate sequences with
    # exactly 7 distinct values, must be a subset of a measure-zero set.
    # Thus, its Lebesgue measure is 0.
