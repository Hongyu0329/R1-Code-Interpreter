    "This riddle points to the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the clues:\n1.  **Andrei Voznesensky:** The famous Russian poet wrote the poem \"Avos!\" which later became the basis for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" This opera tells the story of Rezanov's journey to California and his tragic romance with Concepción Argüello. The poetic description \"a joy-discovering sailor\" fits his mission to establish relations and trade.\n2.  **\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\":** This line is from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which also focuses on Rezanov. Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his way back to St. Petersburg. His grave at the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed when the Soviets demolished the cathedral in the mid-20th century, leaving its exact location lost for many years.\n3.  **The answer emerged in the late 1980s:** During the era of Perestroika, there was a resurgence of interest in historical figures like Rezanov, fueled by the popularity of the rock opera. This led to historical investigations and the establishment of a new memorial (a cenotaph) in Krasnoyarsk in 2000, symbolically answering the question of his final resting place. The cultural and historical \"rediscovery\" fits this timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the man's last name is Rezanov.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote extensively about him.\n# His grave was lost and his story was culturally rediscovered in the late 20th century.\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
