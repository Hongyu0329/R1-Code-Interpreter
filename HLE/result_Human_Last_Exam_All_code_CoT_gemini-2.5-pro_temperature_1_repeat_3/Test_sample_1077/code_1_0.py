    This function identifies and prints the name of the philosopher who wrote the specified letter to Heidegger.
    
    The letter in question was written in 1947 by a former student of Heidegger's.
    This student, a prominent member of the Frankfurt School, was expressing his deep
    disappointment with Heidegger's political actions and his subsequent silence
    about the atrocities of the Nazi regime after the war. The letter poignantly
    contrasts the admiration for Heidegger's philosophical work, like 'Being and Time',
    with the personal and ethical failings of the man himself.
