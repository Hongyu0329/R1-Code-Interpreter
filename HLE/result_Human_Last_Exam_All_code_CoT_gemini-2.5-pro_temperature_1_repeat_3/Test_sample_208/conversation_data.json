    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain a specific number (n) of smaller, equal-sized circles.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Identify the number of small circles (n=14) and their radius (r=1).\n2.  The solution to this problem for n=14 has been determined through mathematical research. The optimal packing configuration is known, and from it, the ratio of the large circle's radius (R) to the small circle's radius (r) has been calculated.\n3.  I will use this known ratio, which is approximately 3.4279.\n4.  Since the radius of the small circles is 1, the radius of the large circle is simply this ratio value.\n5.  The Python code will store this known value, calculate the final radius, and print the result formatted to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n# This is a known problem in geometry, and we use the established result for the optimal packing of 14 circles.\n\n# Radius of the small circles\nr_small = 1.0\n\n# Number of small circles\nn = 14\n\n# For the tightest packing of 14 circles, the ratio of the radius of the\n# enclosing circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r) is a known constant.\n# Source: Mathematical literature on circle packing, e.g., E. Specht's survey.\nradius_ratio = 3.4279029\n\n# Calculate the radius of the large circle. The final equation is R = ratio * r.\nR_large = radius_ratio * r_small\n\n# Output the numbers used in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation for the large radius (R) is based on the equation: R = ratio * r\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values: R = {radius_ratio} * {r_small}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting radius R = {R_large}\")\n\n# The problem asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n# We format the calculated radius to 4 significant figures.\nformatted_R_large = f\"{R_large:.4g}\"\n\nprint(\"\\n---\")\nprint(f\"The radius of the large circle up to 4 significant digits is: {formatted_R_large}\")\n```\n<<<3.428>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
