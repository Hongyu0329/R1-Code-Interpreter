    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we must first establish the chemical structure of a standard nanocar. The term \"nanocar\" can refer to several different complex molecules, so for this task, I will use a well-known and illustrative example: the symmetrical H-shaped nanocar developed by the group of Professor James Tour.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Nanocar Structure:** I will base the calculation on the H-shaped nanocar. Its structure consists of a central chassis, four axles, and four fullerene (C60) wheels. The hydrogen atoms are all located on the chassis and axles.\n2.  **Define \"Perfluoro\":** The chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Count the Hydrogens:** The task then becomes counting the total number of hydrogen atoms in our chosen nanocar model. This count will directly equal the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar.\n    *   The central chassis contains a biphenyl group, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Each of the four axle components contains a phenylene group, which has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The fullerene (C60) wheels have no hydrogen atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** I will sum the hydrogens from all components to find the total, which gives us our final answer.\n\nThe following Python script will perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    based on a common H-shaped structural model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in each part of the nanocar's chassis.\n    # The chassis is modeled with a central biphenyl group and four phenylene groups as axles.\n    hydrogens_on_biphenyl = 8\n    hydrogens_per_phenylene_axle = 4\n    num_axles = 4\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    # The fullerene (C60) wheels do not contain any hydrogen atoms.\n    hydrogens_on_all_axles = hydrogens_per_phenylene_axle * num_axles\n    total_hydrogens = hydrogens_on_biphenyl + hydrogens_on_all_axles\n\n    # Step 3: In a \"perfluoro-\" compound, the number of fluorine atoms equals the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorines = total_hydrogens\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.\n    print(\"This calculation is based on a common H-shaped nanocar model.\")\n    print(\"The term 'perfluoro' means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we count the hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar's chassis:\")\n    print(f\" - Hydrogens on the central biphenyl group: {hydrogens_on_biphenyl}\")\n    print(f\" - Hydrogens on the {num_axles} phenylene axle groups: {hydrogens_on_all_axles}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of these parts.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the total number of hydrogens is:\")\n    print(f\"{hydrogens_on_biphenyl} + {hydrogens_on_all_axles} = {total_hydrogens}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a perfluoronanocar would hypothetically contain {num_fluorines} fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
