    "I will determine the currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita\" and the year it was officially proposed.\n\n1.  **Identify the Common Name:** The genus *Perdita* consists of very small bees native to North America. Due to their tiny size and often iridescent appearance, they are widely referred to as \"fairy bees\".\n\n2.  **Find the Coining Year:** To find when this name was established, I will search entomological literature. The name was formally suggested by the prominent entomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell. In a 1926 article titled \"Some bees of the group Perdita\" published in the *Journal of the New York Entomological Society*, he wrote, \"They may be called the fairy bees (*Perdita* s. lat.), including as they do the smallest of all our bees...\".\n\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will now write a Python script to print the name and the year in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# The common name for the bee genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" is \"fairy bees\".\n# This name was proposed by the entomologist T.D.A. Cockerell in a 1926 publication.\n# This script will print the name and the year it was coined.\n\ncommon_name = \"fairy bees\"\nyear_coined = 1926\n\nprint(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n```\n<<<fairy bees, 1926>>>"
