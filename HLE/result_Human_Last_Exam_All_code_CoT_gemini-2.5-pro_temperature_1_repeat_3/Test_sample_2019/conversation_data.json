    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Attacks:** The board is a 5x5 grid that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus). A queen attacks all squares in its own row, column, and diagonals. On a toroidal board, the diagonal attack rule is special. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other diagonally if the shortest row distance equals the shortest column distance. The shortest distance `d` on a dimension of size `N` is `min(d, N - d)`. For our 5x5 board, this means `min(|r1-r2|, 5-|r1-r2|)` must equal `min(|c1-c2|, 5-|c1-c2|)`.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** The problem can be solved by systematically checking all possible placements. A backtracking search is a perfect fit for this. We will place queens one by one, and if a placement leads to a conflict, we will backtrack and try a different position.\n\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Search:**\n    *   I will write a recursive function, let's call it `solve(k, start_index, queens)`, that tries to place `k` more queens on the board.\n    *   `k`: The number of queens left to place.\n    *   `queens`: A list of coordinates `(r, c)` where queens are already placed.\n    *   `start_index`: To avoid counting the same set of 4 queens in different orders (e.g., placing queen A then B vs. B then A), we'll search for the next queen's position starting from the index of the previously placed queen. This ensures we only count unique combinations of squares.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when `k` becomes 0, meaning we have successfully placed all 4 queens. In this case, we've found one valid arrangement and return 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, we iterate through the available squares. For each square, we check if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (doesn't attack any existing queens). If it is, we place the queen and make a recursive call to place the rest. We then backtrack by removing the queen to explore other possibilities.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The initial call to the function will be `solve(4, 0, [])`, asking to place 4 queens on an empty board, starting the search from the first square (index 0). The function will return the total count.\n\nThis approach will systematically explore all valid combinations and provide the exact number of ways.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place a given number of non-attacking queens\n    on a toroidal chessboard of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    BOARD_SIZE = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    def solve(k, start_index, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens.\n\n        Args:\n            k: The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n            start_index: The linear index on the board to start searching from.
