# This script provides the answer to a specific paleontological question
# based on scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002, "Irritator challengeri,
# a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil").

# The lacrimal bone of Irritator challengeri features a large depression
# known as the lacrimal recess (part of the antorbital fossa).
# According to the scientific description, this recess contains a specific
# number of smaller, subsidiary depressions or fenestrae.

# Storing the factually-derived number in a variable.
number_of_depressions = 2

# Printing the answer in a descriptive sentence.
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} smaller depressions.")

# As requested, showing the final number in an equation format.
print(f"{number_of_depressions} = {number_of_depressions}")
