    "To answer this question, I will retrieve the specific anatomical information from paleontological literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most relevant source is the 2002 paper by Sues et al. that describes the holotype. I will find the description of the lacrimal bone and identify the number of subsidiary depressions mentioned within the lacrimal recess. Then, I will write a Python script to state this fact and print the number as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the answer to a specific paleontological question\n# based on scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002, \"Irritator challengeri,\n# a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\").\n\n# The lacrimal bone of Irritator challengeri features a large depression\n# known as the lacrimal recess (part of the antorbital fossa).\n# According to the scientific description, this recess contains a specific\n# number of smaller, subsidiary depressions or fenestrae.\n\n# Storing the factually-derived number in a variable.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Printing the answer in a descriptive sentence.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} smaller depressions.\")\n\n# As requested, showing the final number in an equation format.\nprint(f\"{number_of_depressions} = {number_of_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
