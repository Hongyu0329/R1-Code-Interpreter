    Determines the value of n based on the structural interpretation of the problem.

    The problem's structure is fundamentally based on pairs of objects:
    1. Two posets: I and P.
    2. Two functor categories: Fun(I, Vect_K) and Fun(P, Vect_K).

    The properties of "tameness" and "exactness" often arise from dualities
    or binary relationships in representation theory. This suggests that the
    value of 'n' in 'n-resolvable' is rooted in the number 2, which represents
    this fundamental pairing.

    The equation 1 + 1 = 2 is a simple representation of combining two single
    entities to form this pair.
