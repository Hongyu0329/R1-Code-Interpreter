    # The set of ordinals is X = {1, 0, delta, gamma, delta**gamma, gamma**delta,
    # gamma**gamma, delta * gamma, gamma * delta, delta + gamma, gamma + delta}.
    
    # Here, gamma is the minimal ordinal such that omega**gamma = gamma (this is epsilon_0).
    # And delta is the minimal ordinal such that delta**omega = delta.
    
    # Step 1: Establish the relationship between gamma and delta.
    # gamma is an epsilon number, so omega**gamma = gamma.
    # Let's test if gamma satisfies the condition for delta:
    # gamma**omega = (omega**gamma)**omega = omega**(gamma * omega) = omega**(gamma + 1).
    # Since gamma is a limit ordinal, gamma + 1 > gamma.
    # Therefore, omega**(gamma + 1) > omega**gamma = gamma.
    # So, gamma**omega > gamma.
    # Since the function f(x) = x**omega is increasing, the minimal fixed point delta must be greater than gamma.
    # Thus, we have the basic ordering: 0 < 1 < gamma < delta.

    # Step 2: Identify equalities within the set X.
    # It can be shown that delta must also be an epsilon number (omega**delta = delta).
    # For ordinals alpha < beta where beta is an epsilon number, we have:
    # - alpha + beta = beta
    # - alpha * beta = beta (for alpha > 0)
    # - alpha**beta = beta (for alpha > 1, and beta is large enough, which is the case here)
    
    # Applying these rules with alpha = gamma and beta = delta:
    # - gamma + delta = delta
    # - gamma * delta = delta
    # - gamma**delta = (omega**gamma)**delta = omega**(gamma*delta) = omega**delta = delta
    
    # So, four elements of the set are equal to delta.
    
    # Step 3: Define the groups of equal elements and their sorted order.
    # The elements are sorted based on the rules of ordinal arithmetic.

    # It is also much smaller than delta.
    group4 = ["gamma**gamma"]
    
    # This group contains delta and its aliases.
    group5 = ["delta", "gamma + delta", "gamma * delta", "gamma**delta"]

    group6 = ["delta + gamma"]
