    """
    This function determines and prints the set partition corresponding to
    Chapter 39 of "The Tale of Genji".

    The patterns, known as Genji-kō (源氏香), represent partitions of
    five elements, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The sticks are numbered 1 to 5
    from right to left.

    For Chapter 39, "Yūgiri" (夕霧), the pattern is as follows:
    - Sticks 1 and 2 are connected.
    - Sticks 3 and 4 are connected.
    - Stick 5 is by itself.

    This visual pattern translates to the partition {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5}}.
