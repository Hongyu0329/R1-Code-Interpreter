def solve_scale_cardinalities():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H_1(B/A, Q).

    The derivation is based on the following steps:
    1.  The initial object A is identified as (Z, id), so its underlying group is Z.
    2.  The scale S is (hyperreals, inclusion), so its group is *R.
    3.  The terminal object B is identified as ({0}, 0), so its group is {0}.
    4.  The quotient S/A corresponds to the group quotient *R/Z.
        The cardinality of *R is Beth_1. The cardinality of Z is Beth_0.
        The cardinality of the quotient |*R/Z| is Beth_1.
    5.  The quotient B/S corresponds to the group quotient {0}/{0}.
        The cardinality is 1.
    6.  The space B/A is {0}/{0}, which is a point.
        The first homology group H_1(point, Q) is the trivial group {0}.
        The cardinality of this group is 1.
