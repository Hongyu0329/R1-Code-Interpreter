# This script prints the solution based on an analysis of violin acoustics.
# The task is to identify which parameter group changes for four variations
# in playing a violin scale, and the direction of change for one parameter.

# Variation (1) sul ponticello: Affects high harmonic content, related to nu. Group ii.
# Variation (2) bridge mute: Damps high-frequency body resonances, related to f_2. Group iv.
# Variation (3) helium environment: Changes air resonance frequency, related to f_1. Group iii.
# Variation (4) different string: Changes the open string fundamental, F. Group i.
# Direction for (2): Adding a mute (mass) lowers the resonance frequency f_2. Direction is down.

# The final answer is constructed by combining these findings in the required format.
group_1 = "ii"
group_2 = "iv"
group_3 = "iii"
group_4 = "i"
direction_for_2 = "down"

final_answer = f"{group_1},{group_2},{group_3},{group_4},{direction_for_2}"

print(final_answer)
#<<<ii,iv,iii,i,down>>>
