    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we denote as $P_i$. This implies that their derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** We will set the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  **Simplify the equations:** We will use the resulting linear equations to express probabilities $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n    *   From $P_{3}'(t)=0$, we get $\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0$.\n    *   From $P_{2}'(t)=0$, we get $\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = 0$.\n    *   From $P_{0}'(t)=0$, we get $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1} = 0$.\n3.  **Use the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be 1: $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$. We will substitute the expressions from step 2 into this equation to solve for $P_1$.\n4.  **Calculate the probabilities:** Once we have the value for $P_1$, we can calculate the value for $P_0$.\n5.  **Find the final sum:** Finally, we will compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$ and present the result as an equation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are 0.\n# This gives a system of linear equations.\n# We express P0, P2, and P3 in terms of P1.\n\n# From P_3'(t) = 0 => lambda_23*P2 = lambda_31*P3\n# P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * P2\n# Since lambda_23 = lambda_31 = 0.008, P3 = P2.\n\n# From P_2'(t) = 0 => lambda_12*P1 = (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*P2\n# P2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * P1\n# lambda_21 + lambda_23 = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4\n# Since lambda_12 = 0.4, P2 = (0.4 / 0.4) * P1 = P1.\n# Therefore, P1 = P2 = P3.\n\n# From P_0'(t) = 0 => lambda_01*P0 = lambda_10*P1\n# P0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * P1\ncoeff_p0_p1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# The normalization condition is P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1.\n# Substitute the expressions in terms of P1:\n# (coeff_p0_p1 * P1) + P1 + P1 + P1 = 1\n# (coeff_p0_p1 + 3) * P1 = 1\nP1 = 1 / (coeff_p0_p1 + 3)\n\n# Now calculate P0\nP0 = coeff_p0_p1 * P1\n\n# The required sum is P0 + P1\ntotal_prob = P0 + P1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"The steady-state probabilities are P0 = {P0} and P1 = {P1}.\")\nprint(f\"The required sum is P0 + P1.\")\nprint(f\"{P0} + {P1} = {total_prob}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462513527819549>>>"
