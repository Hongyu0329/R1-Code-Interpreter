    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots:** We list all knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0₁), the right-handed trefoil (3₁), the left-handed trefoil (-3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n\n2.  **Identify Valid Surgeries:** An integral surgery on a knot K (called a p-surgery) results in a homology 3-sphere (a manifold with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere) only if the surgery coefficient `p` is either +1 or -1.\n\n3.  **Distinguish the Resulting Manifolds:** The resulting homology spheres can be distinguished by their homology cobordism invariants. We will use the pair `(λ, μ)`, where `λ` is the Casson invariant and `μ` is the Rokhlin invariant. Two homology spheres with different `(λ, μ)` pairs represent distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n4.  **Calculate Invariants:**\n    *   The Casson invariant `λ` for a p-surgery on a knot K is given by the formula `λ = (p/2) * Δ''_K(1)`, where `Δ''_K(1)` is the second derivative of the knot's Alexander polynomial evaluated at 1.\n    *   The Rokhlin invariants `μ` for these specific surgeries are well-established results in knot theory.\n\n5.  **Count Unique Elements:** We will systematically calculate the `(λ, μ)` pair for `+1` and `-1` surgery on each of the identified knots. We will then count the number of unique `(λ, μ)` pairs.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It uses pre-computed values for `Δ''_K(1)` and the Rokhlin invariants for each knot and surgery type.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from surgery on knots\n    with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Knot data:\n    # 'delta_double_prime' is the value of the second derivative of the Alexander\n    # polynomial at t=1.\n    # 'mu' is a dictionary mapping the surgery coefficient p to the Rokhlin invariant\n    # of the resulting homology sphere.
