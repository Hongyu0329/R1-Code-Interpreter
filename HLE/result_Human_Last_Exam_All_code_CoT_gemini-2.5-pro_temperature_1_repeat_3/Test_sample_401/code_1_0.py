    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("The question asks for the smallest number of 'composants' an 'indecomposable continuum' can have, noting that the continuum is 'not necessarily metric'.")
    print("- A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.")
    print("- An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.")
    print("- A composant of a point x in a continuum X is the set of all points y in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both x and y.")

    print("Step 2: Establishing a lower bound for the number of composants.")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("An indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants. Here's why:")
    print("A theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz states that every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a 'boundary set', which means its complement is dense in the space.")
    print("If there were only one composant, it would have to be the entire space itself. The complement of the entire space is the empty set. The empty set is not dense, which contradicts the theorem.")
    print("Therefore, there must be at least 2 composants.")

    print("Step 3: The difference between metric and non-metric continua.")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("For *metric* indecomposable continua (e.g., the Knaster 'buckethandle' continuum):")
    print(" - Each composant can be shown to be a 'meager set' (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets).")
    print(" - The entire space, being a compact metric space, is a 'Baire space', which by definition is not meager.")
    print(" - Since the space is the union of its composants, it cannot be a countable union of meager sets. This implies that there must be an *uncountable* number of composants.")
    print("\n")
    print("For *non-metric* continua, this argument fails.")
    print(" - The proof that a composant is a meager set relies on properties of metric spaces. In a general non-metric continuum, a composant is not necessarily a meager set, so the Baire Category Theorem cannot be used to force an uncountable number of them.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Finding the smallest possible number.")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("We know the number of composants must be at least 2.")
    print("The question then becomes: is the number 2 actually achievable?")
    print("In a 1959 paper, topologist J. R. Isbell constructed an example of a non-metric indecomposable continuum which has exactly two composants.")
    print("This existence proof shows that the lower bound of 2 is attainable.")
