    "This is a question from the field of point-set topology. To answer it, we need to understand the definitions of the terms involved and some key theorems, particularly how they differ between metric and non-metric spaces.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the key terms: continuum, indecomposable continuum, and composant.\n2.  Establish a lower bound for the number of composants. I will show that an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n3.  Discuss the difference between metric and non-metric continua. For the metric case, a well-known theorem (using the Baire Category Theorem) shows there must be uncountably many composants.\n4.  Explain why this theorem fails for the general non-metric case.\n5.  Cite the result that demonstrates a non-metric indecomposable continuum can, in fact, have the minimum possible number of composants.\n6.  Combine these points to arrive at the final answer.\n\nI will encapsulate this logical flow within a Python script that prints the explanation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the smallest number of\n    composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the question and key terms.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the smallest number of 'composants' an 'indecomposable continuum' can have, noting that the continuum is 'not necessarily metric'.\")\n    print(\"- A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.\")\n    print(\"- An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"- A composant of a point x in a continuum X is the set of all points y in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both x and y.\")\n    print(\"The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Establishing a lower bound for the number of composants.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"An indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants.
