    print("Step 1: Understand the problem.")
    print("Limited recombination can lead to 'genetic deterioration' like Muller's Ratchet, the buildup of harmful mutations.")
    print("A 'compensatory mechanism' must counteract this effect.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the options.")
    print("A. Tandem repeats: A source of local mutation, not a buffer against genome-wide decay.")
    print("B. Chromosomal inversions: These reduce recombination, they do not compensate for the lack of it.")
    print("C. Transposable elements: A source of variation, but also a major source of harmful mutations.")
    print("D. Multigene families: Provides redundancy for specific genes, which is a plausible but localized solution.")
    print("E. Polyploidy: Having extra sets of chromosomes provides massive, genome-wide redundancy. This masks the effects of harmful mutations and is a classic mechanism hypothesized to allow long-term survival of lineages with limited recombination.\n")

    print("Polyploidy provides the most robust and genome-wide solution to the problem of accumulating deleterious mutations in the absence of recombination.")
