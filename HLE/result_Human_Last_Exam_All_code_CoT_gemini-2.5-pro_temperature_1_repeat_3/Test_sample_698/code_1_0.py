# Description: This script will analyze the "True Avalanche" puzzle and determine the correct answer.

# The core word is "computer", with the syllables: com-pu-ter.
# The description is: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# We need to find an answer that both repeats the syllables of "computer" and matches the description.

# Let's analyze the options:
# A. Computers comp few urns -> Syllables don't match well, and meaning is irrelevant.
# B. Computer: "Come poo, tern!" -> Syllables "Come poo, tern" are a perfect phonetic match for "com-pu-ter".
#    A "tern" is a bird, and the computer is telling it to "poo", which matches the description.
# C. Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!" -> Syllable count and sounds do not match.
# D. Comb pewter computer -> Phonetically similar, but "comb pewter" has no connection to the description.
# E. Computer needs bird relieves -> This is a statement, not a pun or avalanche.

# Conclusion: Option B is the only choice that works as a pun and matches the story.

correct_answer = 'B'
explanation = 'The phrase "Come poo, tern!" is a phonetic repetition of the syllables in "computer" (com-pu-ter). It fits the description because the computer is giving a command to a bird (a tern) to relieve itself ("poo").'
