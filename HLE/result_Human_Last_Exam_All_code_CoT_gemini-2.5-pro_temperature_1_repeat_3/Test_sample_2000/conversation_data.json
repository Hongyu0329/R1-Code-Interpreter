    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible value for the generalized hypertreewidth (ghtw) of any hypergraph that has exactly 3 hyperedges. We don't have any restrictions on the number of vertices or the size of the hyperedges (the rank).\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** First, I will determine the maximum possible ghtw for any hypergraph with 3 edges. This is straightforward, as a trivial decomposition always exists.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** Second, I will show that this upper bound can actually be achieved. To do this, I will construct a specific hypergraph with 3 edges and prove that its ghtw is equal to this upper bound.\n3.  **The Proof's Logic:** The proof for the lower bound will rely on the properties of a Generalized Hypergraph Decomposition (GHD), specifically the \"vertex coverage\" property. By constructing a hypergraph with a particular pattern of vertex intersections between its hyperedges, we can force any valid GHD to have a large bag.\n4.  **Helly's Property:** The core of the argument uses the Helly property for subtrees in a tree, which states that if a set of subtrees pairwise intersect, they must all share at least one common node.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By showing that the lower bound equals the upper bound, we can conclude the maximum possible ghtw.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this step-by-step reasoning. It doesn't compute the ghtw (which is NP-hard), but rather prints the logical proof that leads to the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to find the maximum generalized\n    hypertreewidth (ghtw) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    The solution is derived through logical deduction rather than direct computation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem specifies a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound.\n    # For any hypergraph H = (V, E), its ghtw is at most the total number of\n    # hyperedges, |E|.
