    "This is a specialized question about cephalopod neuroanatomy. My plan is to first consult my knowledge base on the brain structure of cuttlefish and other cephalopods to identify the relevant lobes. Then, I will write a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will define the brain regions in question and print them with an explanation.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a large structure in the posterior subesophageal mass of the cephalopod brain.\n    # It controls visceral organs and jet propulsion.\n    # Anatomical studies show that motor control lobes for fins and chromatophores are situated just behind it.\n\n    posteriorly_adjacent_lobes = {\n        \"Region 1\": \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\",\n        \"Region 2\": \"Fin lobes\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are:\")\n    print(f\"- {posteriorly_adjacent_lobes['Region 1']}\")\n    print(f\"- {posteriorly_adjacent_lobes['Region 2']}\")\n    print(\"\\nThese lobes are part of the posterior subesophageal mass and are primarily involved in motor control for coloration and fin movement.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information.\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
