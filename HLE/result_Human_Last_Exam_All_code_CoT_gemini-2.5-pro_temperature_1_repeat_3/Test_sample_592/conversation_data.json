    "Based on my knowledge, the premise of your question is slightly incorrect. In the 1997 film *Ovosodo*, the character Tommaso (played by Marco Cocci) does not move to the United States; he stays in his hometown of Livorno. It is another character, Susy, who is the main character's first love, who moves to the US.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that prints this clarification and identifies the city she moves to.\n\n```python\ndef get_movie_fact():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a factual clarification about the plot of the 1997 movie 'Ovosodo'.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_in_question = \"Tommaso\"\n    character_who_moved = \"Susy\"\n    destination_city = \"New York City\"\n\n    print(f\"In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character {character_in_question} does not move to the United States.\")\n    print(f\"It is the character {character_who_moved} who moves to {destination_city}.\")\n\nget_movie_fact()\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
