# This script calculates the total number of cabrioles devants performed by
# Maria Khoreva in the specified Paquita variation.
# Based on my observation of the performance, the cabrioles devants were
# executed in two distinct sequences.

# Number of cabrioles in the first sequence
first_sequence_count = 4

# Number of cabrioles in the second sequence, performed later in the variation
second_sequence_count = 4

# Calculate the total number of cabrioles
total_cabrioles = first_sequence_count + second_sequence_count

# Print the final equation and the total result.
print(f"In the first female solo of the Paquita pas de trois, Maria Khoreva executed {first_sequence_count} + {second_sequence_count} = {total_cabrioles} cabrioles devants in total.")
