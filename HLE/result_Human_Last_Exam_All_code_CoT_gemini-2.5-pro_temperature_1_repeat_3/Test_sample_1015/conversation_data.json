    "My plan to answer this question is to first analyze the core principles of both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods, then apply those principles to the specific movement of *cambré derrière* (a backward bend). I will compare how each school of thought approaches the movement's mechanics, focusing on the provided options to identify the most fundamental difference.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method Analysis:** This Russian method emphasizes precision, strength, and anatomical correctness. For a *cambré derrière*, the Vaganova technique insists on keeping the hips perfectly square to the direction the dancer is facing. This creates a stable base, and the bend originates from the upper and middle back, protecting the lumbar spine. The line is pure and controlled.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method Analysis:** This American neoclassical method, developed by George Balanchine, prioritizes speed, musicality, and creating long, dynamic lines. A key stylistic element is the use of more extreme positions and an \"off-balance\" aesthetic. In a *cambré derrière*, the Balanchine style often encourages the dancer to release the hip of the supporting leg forward.\n\n3.  **Comparison and Conclusion:** The act of releasing the hip in the Balanchine method is a direct contradiction to the Vaganova rule of keeping the hips square. This change in hip placement is the most fundamental mechanical difference between the two versions of the step. It is this hip release that allows for the deeper backbend (Option D) and influences the placement of the head and arms (Options E and A) that are also characteristic of the Balanchine style. Therefore, the placement of the hip (Option B) is the root cause and the most significant difference.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine\n    methods for a cambré derrière and prints the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The provided multiple-choice options\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    # The correct answer is B based on technical analysis.\n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    correct_answer_text = options[correct_answer_key]\n\n    # Explanation of the reasoning\n    explanation = (\n        \"The most fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods \"\n        \"is the placement of the hip.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Vaganova Method: This technique requires the hips to remain 'square' to the front, creating a stable \"\n        \"base and ensuring the bend comes from the upper spine for a pure, classical line.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Balanchine Method: This style often involves releasing the hip of the supporting leg forward. \"\n        \"This allows for a deeper, more dynamic backbend and creates a signature 'off-balance' aesthetic, \"\n        \"which is a defining characteristic of the Balanchine technique.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The correct answer is: {correct_answer_key}. {correct_answer_text}\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Detailed Explanation ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
