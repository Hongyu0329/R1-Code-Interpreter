    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$.\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.** We will apply the formula for $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$.\n3.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volumes.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ (of dimension $m$ and $n$, respectively) that satisfy certain conditions (such as having non-zero simplicial volumes), the simplicial volume of their product is given by $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$. Since surfaces with genus $g \\ge 2$ are hyperbolic, this formula is applicable.\n4.  **Calculate the binomial coefficient.** For our surfaces, the dimensions are $m=2$ and $n=2$. We need to compute $\\binom{2+2}{2}$.\n5.  **Combine the results.** We will multiply the binomial coefficient by the individual simplicial volumes to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_simplicial_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    # The dimensions of the surfaces are both 2.\n    m = 2\n    n = 2\n\n    print(f\"We want to compute the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface.\n    # The formula is ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1) for g >= 1.\n    sv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\n    sv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n    print(f\"The simplicial volume of the first surface, ||Σ_{g1}||, is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = 4 * {g1 - 1} = {sv1}\")\n    print()\n    print(f\"The simplicial volume of the second surface, ||Σ_{g2}||, is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = 4 * {g2 - 1} = {sv2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula.\n    # The product formula is ||M x N|| = C(m+n, m) * ||M|| * ||N||.\n    coefficient = math.comb(m + n, m)\n    print(\"For the product space, we use Gromov's product formula:\")\n    print(\"||M x N|| = C(m+n, m) * ||M|| * ||N||\")\n    print(f\"Here, the dimensions are m={m} and n={n}.\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient is C({m}+{n}, {m}) = C({m+n}, {m}) = {coefficient}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final simplicial volume of the product space.\n    total_sv = coefficient * sv1 * sv2\n    print(\"Finally, we multiply the components to get the total simplicial volume:\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = C({m+n}, {m}) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||\")\n    print(f\"The final equation with the computed values is:\")\n    print(f\"{coefficient} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\nsolve_simplicial_volume()\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
