  Calculates the number of guards for the fortress problem on a unit cube.
  
  As explained in the reasoning, for a unit cube (L-infinity unit ball),
  6 guards are necessary and sufficient. They should be placed at the center
  of each face.
  
  - Guards positions: (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,-1)
  - A guard at (1,0,0) sees the region where x >= 1.
  - A guard at (-1,0,0) sees the region where x <= -1.
  - ...and so on for y and z axes.
  
  The union of the visible regions covers the entire exterior of the cube.
  Any point (x,y,z) outside the cube has max(|x|,|y|,|z|) > 1, so at least
  one coordinate has magnitude >= 1 (e.g., |x|>=1), making it visible.
  
  The number of faces of a cube determines the minimum number of guards.
  """
  
  # A cube has 6 faces.
  num_faces = 6
  
  # Each face needs a guard to see the exterior region in that direction.
  num_guards = num_faces
  
  # The final equation is simply that the number of guards is 6.
  # We print the components of this "equation" as requested.
  print(f"The minimum number of guards necessary is determined by the number of faces of the cube.")
  print(f"Number of faces = 6")
  print(f"Therefore, the minimum number of guards = 6")
