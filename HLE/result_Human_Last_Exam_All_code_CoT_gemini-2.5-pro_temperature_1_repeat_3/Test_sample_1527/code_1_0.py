# Step 1: Define the problem parameters based on the geometric analysis.
# The angle bisectors of the tangent lines are x=2 and y=3.
# We place the center of circle C (radius r) on y=3, C = (h, 3).
# We place the center of circle D (radius 2) on x=2, D = (2, k).
radius_D = 2

print("Step 1: The centers of the two circles, C and D, lie on the angle bisectors x=2 and y=3.")
print("Let C = (h, 3) and D = (2, k).")

# Step 2: Relate radii to center coordinates.
# For circle C: The square of the distance from the center's x-coordinate 'h' to the bisector intersection '2' is related to r^2.
# (h - 2)^2 = 2 * r^2
# For circle D: The square of the distance from the center's y-coordinate 'k' to the bisector intersection '3' is related to its radius (2).
# (k - 3)^2 = 2 * (radius_D)^2
d_sq_term = 2 * radius_D**2
print(f"\nStep 2: From the radius formulas, we find (h-2)^2 = 2*r^2 and (k-3)^2 = {d_sq_term}.")

# Step 3: Use the tangency condition of the two circles.
# The square of the distance between centers C and D is (h-2)^2 + (k-3)^2.
# Substituting from Step 2, this becomes 2*r^2 + 8.
# Since the circles are tangent, the distance is also the sum of radii, r + 2.
# So, the squared distance is (r + 2)^2 = r^2 + 4r + 4.
print("\nStep 3: The tangency of the circles leads to a distance relationship.")

# Step 4: Form and solve the final equation.
# We set the two expressions for the squared distance equal.
# 2*r^2 + 8 = r^2 + 4r + 4
# This simplifies to the quadratic equation: r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0.
print("\nStep 4: Equating the distance expressions gives the following equation:")
c1 = 2
c2 = 8
c3 = 1
c4 = 4
c5 = 4
print(f"{c1}*r^2 + {c2} = {c3}*r^2 + {c4}*r + {c5}")
print("This simplifies to: r^2 - 4*r + 4 = 0, or (r - 2)^2 = 0.")

# The solution to (r-2)^2 = 0 is r=2.
r = 2
print(f"The unique solution for the radius r is {r}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer, r^2.
r_squared = r**2
print(f"\nStep 5: The problem asks for the value of r^2.")
