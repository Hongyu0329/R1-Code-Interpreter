# The problem is to determine if the set Sigma is empty, and if not, compute a specific value.
#
# Let's analyze the condition for a set A to be in Sigma:
# A is a finite subset of positive integers, and A+A is a subset of A x A.
#
# Interpretation 1: The condition is literal.
# A+A contains integers. A x A contains ordered pairs of integers.
# An integer cannot be an ordered pair. Therefore, no set A can satisfy this condition.
# The collection of sets satisfying the condition is empty.
# Sigma = emptyset \ {emptyset, {2}} = emptyset.
#
# Interpretation 2: The condition contains a typo (A x A should be A * A).
# The condition becomes: A+A is a subset of the product set A * A.
# Mathematical analysis shows that the only non-empty set of positive integers
# satisfying this condition is A = {2}. The empty set is also a solution.
# So, the collection of sets satisfying the condition is {emptyset, {2}}.
# Sigma is defined by removing emptyset and {2} from this collection.
# Sigma = {emptyset, {2}} \ {emptyset, {2}} = emptyset.
#
# Conclusion: In either interpretation, the set Sigma is empty.
#
# The problem asks for min_{A in Sigma} max_{a in A}, but if Sigma is empty, return 0.
# Since Sigma is empty, the result is 0.

final_value = 0

# The "final equation" is the assignment of the result based on the problem's condition.
