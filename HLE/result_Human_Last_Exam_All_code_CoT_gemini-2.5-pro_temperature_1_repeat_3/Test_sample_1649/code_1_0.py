    This script determines the smallest possible size of the limit of a specific diagram of sets.

    Problem Deconstruction:
    - J is a directed poset: A set with a partial order where every finite subset has an upper bound.
      Example: The natural numbers (N) with the usual order <=.
    - F is a functor from J^op to Set: It maps each element j in J to a set F(j) and each
      relation i <= j to a function f_ji: F(j) -> F(i).
    - Conditions:
        1. Every set F(j) is non-empty.
        2. Every map f_ji is surjective (onto).
    - Goal: Find the minimum possible size of the limit of F, denoted lim F. The limit is the set
      of all "coherent families" (x_j) where x_j is in F(j) and for all i <= j, f_ji(x_j) = x_i.

    Step 1: Establish a lower bound for the size.
    A fundamental theorem in category theory (relying on the Axiom of Choice) states that the
    inverse limit of a system of non-empty sets indexed by a directed set with surjective
    maps is always non-empty. Our problem perfectly matches these conditions.
    Therefore, the size of the limit set must be at least 1.
    Size(lim F) >= 1.

    Step 2: Construct an example to find the minimum.
    We need to check if a size of 1 is achievable. Let's create the simplest possible system
    that fits the criteria.

    - Let the directed poset J be the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, ...} with the usual
      order <=.
    - For each number n in J, let the set F(n) be a singleton set, e.g., F(n) = { 'A' }.
      This satisfies the non-empty condition.
    - For any m <= n, we need a surjective map f_nm: F(n) -> F(m).
      Since F(n) = { 'A' } and F(m) = { 'A' }, the only possible function is the one that
      maps 'A' to 'A'. This function is surjective.

    Step 3: Calculate the size of the limit for our example.
    An element in the limit is a sequence (x_1, x_2, x_3, ...) such that:
    1. Each x_n must be in F(n). Since F(n) = { 'A' }, every x_n must be 'A'.
       This means the only possible sequence is ('A', 'A', 'A', ...).
    2. The coherence condition must hold: for any m <= n, f_nm(x_n) = x_m.
       In our example, f_nm('A') = 'A', and x_m is also 'A'. The condition holds.

    Since only one sequence satisfies the conditions, the limit set contains exactly one element.
    The size of the limit for this example is 1.

    Conclusion:
    We've shown that the size must be at least 1, and we have constructed an example
    where the size is exactly 1. Therefore, the smallest possible size is 1.
