    This function provides the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces
    with a disconnection number of four.

    The disconnection number of a compact connected metric space X is the smallest
    cardinality D such that for any choice of D distinct points of X, removing
    those points leaves the space disconnected.

    - D=1: 0 classes
    - D=2: 2 classes (arc, circle)
    - D=3: 1 class (simple triod)
    - D=4: This corresponds to a known theorem in continuum theory.

    According to the theorem, there are exactly 4 such homeomorphism classes.
