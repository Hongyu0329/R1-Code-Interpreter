    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm. This involves stacking the two matrices and then using elementary row operations to reduce the stacked matrix to a simpler form.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Construct a stacked matrix `M` by placing `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  Perform a sequence of elementary row operations on `M`. These operations include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another. The goal is to transform `M` into an upper triangular form with zero rows at the bottom.\n3.  The process will result in a matrix of the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is a 2x2 zero matrix.\n4.  This resulting matrix `G` is a greatest common right divisor of the original matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic polynomial manipulation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of\n    two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # 1.
