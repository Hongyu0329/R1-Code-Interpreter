    This function calculates the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers
    with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    A thorough mathematical analysis reveals the following:
    1.  Any totally bounded group topology on the integers (Z) is defined by a 'supernatural number' m.
        The basic open neighborhoods of 0 are the subgroups nZ where n is a natural number that divides m.
    2.  The condition "no nontrivial convergent sequences" means that any sequence that converges must be
        eventually constant.
    3.  We can show that for any choice of supernatural number m, the corresponding topology always admits
        nontrivial convergent sequences.
        - If m is a finite integer d, the topology is the dZ-adic one. The sequence x_k = k*d converges
          to 0 but is not eventually constant.
        - If m corresponds to an infinite set of divisors, we can construct a sequence from the lcm of these
          divisors which converges to 0 but is not eventually constant.
    4.  Since no such topology satisfies the condition, the number of such topologies is 0.
