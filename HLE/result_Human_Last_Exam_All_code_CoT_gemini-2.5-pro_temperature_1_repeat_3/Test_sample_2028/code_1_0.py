    This function provides the answers to the VEST complexity questions.
    The reasoning is based on parameterized complexity theory.

    (a) The problem is shown to be in FPT by reducing it to computing the k-th power of a
    linear operator on an n^2-dimensional space, which can be solved efficiently using
    algorithms for k-th term of a linear recurrence. Since FPT problems are not believed
    to be W[2]-hard, the answer is No.

    (b) The restrictions on the matrices T_i are very strong, simplifying the problem
    significantly. The sum over all sequences reduces to a simple sum with m terms,
    which can be calculated in FPT time (even polynomial time if k is small).
    Thus, it cannot be W[1]-hard. The answer is No.

    (c) For matrices with one non-zero entry per row, the general method of reducing the
    problem to computing the k-th term of a linear recurrence applies. This method
    yields an FPT algorithm. Therefore, the complexity is FPT.
