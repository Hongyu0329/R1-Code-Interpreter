    # P(token | prompt). A single forward pass of the LLM with the prompt as
    # input will yield the log likelihoods for ALL possible tokens in the

    # likelihoods of its constituent tokens, each conditioned on the prompt and
    # the preceding tokens.
    # For an answer A = (t1, t2, ..., tk), we need log P(t1|prompt) + log P(t2|prompt,t1) + ...
    # A single forward pass on the concatenated sequence (prompt + A) allows the model
    # to compute all these conditional probabilities at once.
    # Since the 4 multi-token answers are distinct sequences, we must perform a
    # separate forward pass for each one.
