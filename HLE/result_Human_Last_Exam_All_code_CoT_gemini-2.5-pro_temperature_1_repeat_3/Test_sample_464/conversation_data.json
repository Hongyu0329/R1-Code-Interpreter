    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic result in Fourier analysis. The answer is yes, the function must be the zero function.\n\nHere is my plan to demonstrate why this is the case:\n1.  I will first state the final answer: Yes, if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n2.  The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform. I will explain the key steps of the proof.\n3.  The main idea is to relate the moments of the function $f(x)$ to the derivatives of its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, at the origin ($\\xi=0$).\n4.  The condition that all moments are zero implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n5.  A key property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms are also Schwartz functions, which are analytic (infinitely differentiable and can be represented by their Taylor series).\n6.  An analytic function for which all derivatives at a point are zero must be identically zero everywhere. Thus, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$.\n7.  Finally, by the properties of the inverse Fourier transform, if a function's Fourier transform is zero, the function itself must be zero.\n8.  I will provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to symbolically walk through these steps of the proof.\n\nHere is the Python code that illustrates the reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically demonstrates that if all moments of a Schwartz function f(x)\n    are zero, then f(x) must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    x, xi = sp.symbols('x xi', real=True)\n    k = sp.Symbol('k', integer=True, nonnegative=True)\n\n    # Define a generic Schwartz function f(x)\n    f = sp.Function('f')(x)\n\n    print(\"Problem: Suppose f is a Schwartz function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) from -oo to oo is 0 for all non-negative integers k.\")\n    print(\"Does it follow that f(x) = 0 for all x?\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Answer: Yes.
