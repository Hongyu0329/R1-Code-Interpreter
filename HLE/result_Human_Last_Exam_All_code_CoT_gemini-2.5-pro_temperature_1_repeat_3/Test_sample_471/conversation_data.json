    "This problem can be solved using Morse theory, which relates the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topology.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Topology of the 2-Torus ($T^2$):** We need the Betti numbers of the torus, which describe its fundamental topological features.\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. Since a torus is a single connected object, $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of one-dimensional \"holes\" or independent loops. A torus has two such loops (one latitudinal, one longitudinal), so $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of two-dimensional \"voids\". The torus encloses a single void, so $b_2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Morse Inequalities:** For any smooth function on a compact manifold like the torus, the Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of a given type (index) must be at least the corresponding Betti number.\n    *   Number of minima ($c_0$) $\\ge b_0 = 1$.\n    *   Number of saddle points ($c_1$) $\\ge b_1 = 2$.\n    *   Number of maxima ($c_2$) $\\ge b_2 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimal Total:** The total number of critical points is the sum of the minima, saddles, and maxima. By summing the inequalities above, we get a lower bound for the total number of critical points. This bound is known to be achievable, meaning there exists a smooth function on the torus with exactly this many critical points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number by summing the Betti numbers of the torus.\n\n```python\n# The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n# b0: Number of connected components\nb0 = 1\n# b1: Number of 1-dimensional holes (tunnels)\nb1 = 2\n# b2: Number of 2-dimensional holes (voids)\nb2 = 1\n\n# According to the Morse inequalities, the number of critical points of each index\n# (c0 for minima, c1 for saddles, c2 for maxima) must be at least the\n# corresponding Betti number.\n# c0 >= b0\n# c1 >= b1\n# c2 >= b2\n# Therefore, the minimal total number of critical points is the sum of the Betti numbers.\nmin_minima = b0\nmin_saddles = b1\nmin_maxima = b2\n\ntotal_critical_points = min_minima + min_saddles + min_maxima\n\n# The final equation shows the minimal number of each type of critical point\n# and the total minimal number of critical points.\nprint(f\"The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is given by the sum of its Betti numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Minimal number of minima (index 0) = {min_minima}\")\nprint(f\"Minimal number of saddles (index 1) = {min_saddles}\")\nprint(f\"Minimal number of maxima (index 2) = {min_maxima}\")\nprint(f\"Total minimal number of critical points:\")\nprint(f\"{min_minima} + {min_saddles} + {min_maxima} = {total_critical_points}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
