    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the expression for the infinite product, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Express the Product:** The infinite product starts from `n=3`. We can relate this to the more standard product starting from `n=1` by dividing by the first two terms:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  **Use the Gamma Function Identity:** The infinite product from `n=1` has a known closed form related to the Gamma function, Γ(x). The identity comes from the Weierstrass product factorization and can be shown to be:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n    where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a complex cube root of unity.\n\n3.  **Combine the Parts:** By substituting the identity into our expression from step 1, we get the final formula. The terms for `n=1` and `n=2` are `(1 - z^3)` and `(1 - z^3 / 8)`.\n\n4.  **Present the Result with Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints the final symbolic formula in a clear, structured way, and explicitly outputs each constant number appearing in the formula as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the solution.\n\n```python\ndef display_infinite_product_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and displays the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    Π_{n=3 to ∞} (1 - z^3/n^3).\n    It prints each component and number of the final formula as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The final expression for the infinite product is a fraction.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Numerator\n    numerator = 1\n    print(f\"The numerator of the fraction is:\")\n    print(numerator)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Denominator\n    print(\"The denominator is a product of three main parts:\")\n    print(\"Part 1: The term corresponding to n=1, which is (1 - z^3 / d1)\")\n    d1 = 1**3\n    print(f\"The number d1 is 1^3, which is:\")\n    print(d1)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Part 2: The term corresponding to n=2, which is (1 - z^3 / d2)\")\n    d2 = 2**3\n    print(f\"The number d2 is 2^3, which is:\")\n    print(d2)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Part 3: The infinite product from n=1, expressed using the Gamma function Γ:\")\n    print(\"Γ(A - z) * Γ(A - z*ω) * Γ(A - z*ω^2)\")\n    A = 1\n    print(\"The number A in the Gamma function arguments is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"...where ω is the complex cube root of unity, ω = exp(B*π*i / C)\")\n    B = 2\n    C = 3\n    print(\"The number B in the definition of ω is:\")\n    print(B)\n    print(\"The number C in the definition of ω is:\")\n    print(C)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Final Assembled Equation\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Assembling all parts, the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"\\n      {numerator}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"(1 - z^3/{d1}) * (1 - z^3/{d2}) * Γ({A} - z) * Γ({A} - z*ω) * Γ({A} - z*ω^2)\\n\")\n    print(\"Or, with simplified constants:\")\n    print(f\"\\n      {numerator}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"(1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Γ(1 - z) * Γ(1 - z*ω) * Γ(1 - z*ω^2)\")\n\n\ndisplay_infinite_product_solution()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3 / 8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)))>>>"
