    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological phase like the toric code depends on the topology of the manifold on which it is defined. The presence of holes (which are a type of boundary) introduces new topological features that increase the degeneracy.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Model:** We consider the toric code defined on a 2D surface, which we can think of as an infinite plane. The `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes are punctures or regions removed from this plane.\n\n2.  **Logical Operators:** The degeneracy arises from operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are not products of the Hamiltonian's terms (stabilizers). These are called logical operators. For the toric code, these are string-like operators (Wilson loops and 't Hooft loops).\n\n3.  **Smooth Holes:** A smooth boundary (or \"Z-boundary\") is one where the electric charges (`e` anyons) can condense or disappear. A logical operator associated with a smooth hole is an `X`-type loop (`X_L`) that encircles the hole. This operator measures the magnetic flux (`m` anyon charge) through the hole. Since `X_L` is a closed loop of Pauli-X operators, it commutes with all star operators (`A_s`). Because `e` condenses, it also effectively commutes with the plaquette operators (`B_p`) at the boundary. Thus, for each of the `n` smooth holes, we get an independent logical operator of `X`-type.\n\n4.  **Rough Holes:** A rough boundary (or \"X-boundary\") is one where the magnetic fluxes (`m` anyons) can condense. A logical operator associated with a rough hole is a `Z`-type loop (`Z_L`) that encircles the hole. This operator measures the electric charge (`e` anyon charge) inside the loop. For each of the `m` rough holes, we get an independent logical operator of `Z`-type.\n\n5.  **Counting the Operators:** We have `n` logical operators of type `X` (one for each smooth hole) and `m` logical operators of type `Z` (one for each rough hole).\n    *   All `X`-type operators commute with each other.\n    *   All `Z`-type operators commute with each other.\n    *   Any `X`-type operator commutes with any `Z`-type operator.\n    *   On an infinite plane (as opposed to a compact sphere), these `n+m` loop operators are all topologically independent.\n\n6.  **Calculating Degeneracy:** Each of these `n+m` independent logical operators squares to the identity and thus has two eigenvalues (+1 and -1). Each operator doubles the ground state space. With `n+m` such operators, the total degeneracy is `2 * 2 * ... * 2` (`n+m` times).\n\nTherefore, the ground space degeneracy (GSD) is `2^(n+m)`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value based on user input.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        n_str = input(\"Enter the number of smooth holes (n): \")\n        n = int(n_str)\n        if n < 0:\n            print(\"Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n            return\n\n        m_str = input(\"Enter the number of rough holes (m): \")\n        m = int(m_str)\n        if m < 0:\n            print(\"Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n            return\n\n        exponent = n + m\n        degeneracy = 2 ** exponent\n\n        # The final print statement is formatted to clearly show the equation\n        print(f\"The Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is calculated as 2^(n + m).\")\n        print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m}) = 2^{exponent} = {degeneracy}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.
