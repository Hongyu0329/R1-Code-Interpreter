    "Of all the graphs on n=128 vertices, we want to find the one that has the maximum number of different clique sizes as induced subgraphs.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Interpreting the question:** The question asks for the \"maximum possible number of different clique sizes\". A \"clique\" can refer to any complete subgraph, or it can be shorthand for a \"maximal clique\" (a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex).\n    *   If \"clique\" means any complete subgraph, then for any graph `G`, if it has an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`), it must also have an induced clique of size `k-1`. This means the set of induced clique sizes is always `{1, 2, ..., m}`, where `m` is the size of the largest clique in `G` (`m = Ï‰(G)`). To maximize the number of sizes, we would need to maximize `m`. The maximum possible `m` for a graph with `n=128` vertices is 128, achieved by the complete graph `K_128`. This interpretation seems too simple for a coding challenge.\n    *   A more challenging and common interpretation in algorithmic problems is that \"clique\" refers to a \"maximal clique\". In this case, the set of maximal clique sizes is not necessarily a continuous range of integers. For example, the graph `K_3 \\cup K_5` (a disjoint union of a 3-clique and a 5-clique) has maximal cliques of sizes 3 and 5 only.\n\n2.  **Adopting the \"maximal clique\" interpretation:** We will proceed assuming the question asks for the maximum number of different *maximal* clique sizes. Let this number be `m`. Our goal is to construct a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices that has `m` maximal cliques with `m` different sizes, and we want to maximize `m`.\n\n3.  **Formulating the optimization problem:** To have `m` maximal cliques of different sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, we need to construct a graph using at most `n=128` vertices. To maximize `m`, we should choose the smallest possible distinct integer sizes for the cliques, which are `1, 2, ..., m`.\n\n4.  **Designing a vertex-efficient construction:** We need to arrange cliques of sizes `1, 2, ..., m` in a way that uses as few vertices as possible.\n    *   A simple approach is a disjoint union of cliques `K_1, K_2, ..., K_m`. The number of vertices required is the sum `1 + 2 + ... + m = m*(m+1)/2`. We would need to find the largest `m` such that `m*(m+1)/2 <= 128`. This gives `m=15` (since `15*16/2 = 120`, but `16*17/2 = 136`).\n    *   A more efficient construction is to \"chain\" the cliques together, making them share vertices. We can construct a graph with maximal cliques of sizes `1, 2, ..., m` as follows: one isolated vertex (which is a `K_1`), and a chain of cliques `K_2, K_3, ..., K_m` where each `K_i` and `K_{i+1}` share exactly one vertex. This construction is more vertex-efficient.\n\n5.  **Calculating vertices for the chained construction:**\n    *   The isolated `K_1` requires 1 vertex.\n    *   For the chain `K_m, K_{m-1}, ..., K_2`, we start with `K_m` (m vertices), then add `K_{m-1}` by sharing one vertex (adding `m-2` new vertices), then add `K_{m-2}` (adding `m-3` new vertices), and so on, down to `K_2` (adding `1` new vertex).\n    *   The total number of vertices `N(m)` is `1 (for K_1) + [m + (m-2) + (m-3) + ... + 1] (for the chain)`.\n    *   The sum `1 + 2 + ... + (m-2)` is `(m-2)(m-1)/2`.\n    *   So, `N(m) = 1 + m + (m-2)(m-1)/2`.\n\n6.  **Solving for `m`:** We need to find the largest integer `m` such that `N(m) <= 128`. We can write a script to compute this.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the maximum `m`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with n=128 vertices.\n\n    The problem is interpreted as finding the maximum number of different *maximal* clique sizes.\n    To maximize this number, m, we choose the smallest possible sizes: 1, 2, ..., m.\n\n    We use a vertex-efficient \"chained clique\" construction:\n    - A disjoint K_1 (maximal clique of size 1).\n    - A chain of cliques K_2, K_3, ..., K_m, where K_i and K_{i+1} share a vertex.\n\n    The number of vertices for this construction is N(m) = 1 + m + (m-1)*(m-2)/2.\n    We find the largest integer m for which N(m) <= 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n    \n    m = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the number of vertices needed for m maximal cliques of sizes 1...m\n        if m == 1:\n            # For m=1, we just need a K_1.\n            vertices_needed = 1\n        else:\n            # For m > 1, use the chained-clique formula.\n            # sum_of_additions is for the chain K_m, ..., K_2\n            chain_vertices = m + (m - 2) * (m - 1) // 2\n            # Total vertices = K_1 + chain\n            vertices_needed = 1 + chain_vertices\n        \n        if vertices_needed > n:\n            # This m is too large, so the previous value was the maximum.\n            m = m - 1\n            break\n        \n        m += 1\n        \n    final_m = m\n    \n    # Recalculate values for the final m to display the equation.\n    if final_m == 1:\n        final_vertices_needed = 1\n        sum_val = 0\n    else:\n        sum_val = (final_m - 1) * (final_m - 2) // 2\n        final_vertices_needed = 1 + final_m + sum_val\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"We aim to find the maximum number (m) of distinct maximal clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"To maximize m, we choose clique sizes 1, 2, ..., m.\")\n    print(\"Using a chained-clique construction, the number of vertices required is:\")\n    print(\"N(m) = 1 + m + (m-1)*(m-2)/2\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"For m = {final_m}:\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: 1 + {final_m} + ({final_m}-1)*({final_m}-2)/2 = 1 + {final_m} + {sum_val} = {final_vertices_needed}\")\n    print(f\"Since {final_vertices_needed} <= {n}, it is possible to have {final_m} different sizes.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Check the next value of m to confirm it's not possible.\n    next_m = final_m + 1\n    next_sum_val = (next_m - 1) * (next_m - 2) // 2\n    next_vertices_needed = 1 + next_m + next_sum_val\n    print(f\"For m = {next_m}:\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: 1 + {next_m} + ({next_m}-1)*({next_m}-2)/2 = 1 + {next_m} + {next_sum_val} = {next_vertices_needed}\")\n    print(f\"Since {next_vertices_needed} > {n}, it is not possible to have {next_m} different sizes with this construction.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is {final_m}.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<16>>>\n```"
