    "To determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Start and End Years:** I will use the established StarCraft lore to find the start and end years of the conflict. The Second Great War begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* in the year 2504 and concludes with the events of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* in the year 2506.\n2.  **Interpret the Calculation:** A simple subtraction (`2506 - 2504`) yields 2 years. However, the war's events took place *during* three distinct calendar years (2504, 2505, and 2506). Since the prompt asks for the duration to be \"rounded up,\" this suggests that a simple 2-year answer is insufficient. The most reasonable interpretation that honors the \"rounded up\" instruction is to calculate the span of years the conflict was active.\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** To calculate the inclusive span of years, the equation will be `(end_year - start_year) + 1`.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the start and end years, performs this calculation, and prints the full equation along with a descriptive text as the final output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore is the primary conflict in the StarCraft II trilogy.\n# According to the official timeline, the war began in the year 2504 with the events of Wings of Liberty.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war concluded with the defeat of the dark god Amon in Legacy of the Void, in the year 2506.\nend_year = 2506\n\n# A simple subtraction of the years (2506 - 2504) gives a result of 2.\n# However, the conflict spanned across three separate calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n# Since the problem requires rounding up the duration, we calculate the total span of years the war was active in.\n# This is calculated by finding the difference and adding 1 to inclusively count the start year.\nduration = (end_year - start_year) + 1\n\nprint(\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in {} and ended in {}.\".format(start_year, end_year))\nprint(\"To find the war's duration in years (rounded up), we calculate the span of years the conflict was active:\")\nprint(\"{} - {} + 1 = {}\".format(end_year, start_year, duration))\nprint(\"\\nThe war lasted for {} years.\".format(duration))\n```\n<<<3>>>"
