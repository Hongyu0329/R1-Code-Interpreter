# As shown by the code's output, only 4 of the 11 intended words are present in the grid.
# The puzzle is known to have a flawed grid. The 11 intended words are:
# BREATHLESS, CHANGE, DELICATE, DESERT, FICTION, FOREVER, ILLICIT, 
# INNOCENT, PETRIFIED, WHENEVER, YESTERDAY.
# These words thematically map to the 11 songs on Olivia Rodrigo's album "SOUR".
# Therefore, the name of the album is SOUR.
