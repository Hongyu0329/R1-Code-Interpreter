    This script solves the Bromophenol blue color problem by following these steps:
    1. Define the chemical and physical constants from the problem.
    2. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the ratio of the different colored forms of Bromophenol blue at the given pH.
    3. Determine the resulting color from the mixture of forms.
    4. Use the Beer-Lambert law concept to explain the difference in color intensity between the thin and thick sides of the prism.
