    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap

    """

    # The transformation requires adding one node to the heap and restructuring it.
    # Let the initial chain be C_k. Its root has degree 1 (for k > 1).
    # A plausible target is a new chain C_{k+1} where a new node 'x' is the root,
    # and the old chain C_k becomes its child.

    # To link the tree C_k under 'x', both must be in the root list and have the
    # same degree during consolidation. The degree of C_k's root is 1.
    # So, we must construct a new tree rooted at 'x' with degree 1.

    # A tree of degree 1 can be made by linking two nodes of degree 0.
    # Let's call our new nodes 'x' and a helper node 'y'.

    # The plan requires the following steps:
    # 1. Get C_k, 'x', and 'y' into the root list.
    # 2. Trigger a consolidation to link them.

    # This can be accomplished with the following operations:
    op1 = "Insert(x): a new node for the final chain."
    op2 = "Insert(y): a helper node to create a degree-1 tree."
    op3 = "Insert(z): a dummy node with a key smaller than all others."
    op4 = "Delete-min(): this deletes 'z' and triggers a consolidation of C_k, x, and y."
