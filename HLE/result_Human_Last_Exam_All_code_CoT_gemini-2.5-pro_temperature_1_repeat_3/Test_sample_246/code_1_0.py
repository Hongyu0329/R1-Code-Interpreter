    This function determines the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group
    of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.

    The steps of the derivation are as follows:
    1.  The fundamental group (let's call it Pi) has the presentation:
        Pi = <a, b, t | a^2 = b^3, t^2 = 1, at = ta, btb = a^5 * b * a^(-5)>

    2.  To find the minimal number of generators, d(Pi), we establish lower and upper bounds.

    3.  Lower Bound: The group is non-abelian, so it requires at least 2 generators.
        d(Pi) >= 2.

    4.  Upper Bound: We find a generating set with 2 elements. Let's test the set {a, ab}.
        - Let g1 = a and g2 = ab.
        - We can generate 'a' directly (it's g1).
        - We can generate 'b' as b = a^(-1) * (ab) = g1^(-1) * g2.
        - We can generate 't' from the relation btb = a^5 * b * a^(-5), which gives
          t = b^(-1) * a^5 * b * a^(-5) * b^(-1).
        - Since 'a' and 'b' can be formed from g1 and g2, 't' can also be formed.
        - Therefore, {a, ab} is a valid generating set of size 2.
        - This means d(Pi) <= 2.

    5.  Conclusion: From 2 <= d(Pi) <= 2, we conclude d(Pi) = 2.
