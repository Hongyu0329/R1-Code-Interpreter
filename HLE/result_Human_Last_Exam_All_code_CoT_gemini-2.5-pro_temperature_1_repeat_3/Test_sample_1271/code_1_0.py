    Step 1: Understand the Geodesics
    A geodesic in the space C[0,1] with the given metric is an isometric image of the real line R.
    An analysis of the metric reveals two types of geodesics, both passing through the origin (the zero function):
    1.  Straight Geodesics: These are lines through the origin, of the form {t*u | t in R} where u is a function of norm 1. Topologically, this is a line, composed of two opposite rays R(u) and R(-u).
    2.  Bent Geodesics: These are unions of two non-collinear rays from the origin, of the form {t*u | t >= 0} U {t*v | t >= 0}, where u and v are linearly independent functions of norm 1. Topologically, this is a 'V' shape.

    Step 2: Analyze the Intersections
    The intersection of two geodesics, G1 and G2, is a set containing the origin plus a number of common rays. Since each geodesic is composed of two rays from the origin, their intersection can have 0, 1, or 2 common rays.
    This leads to four possible shapes for the intersection:
    - 0 common rays: The intersection is just the origin {0}.
    - 1 common ray: The intersection is a single ray starting from the origin.
    - 2 common rays (collinear): The geodesics are the same straight line, so their intersection is that line.
    - 2 common rays (non-collinear): The geodesics are the same bent geodesic, so their intersection is that 'V' shape.

    Step 3: Classify by Homeomorphism
    We need to count how many of these shapes are topologically distinct.
    1.  A single point: This is a 0-dimensional space.
    2.  A ray: This is homeomorphic to [0, infinity). It has one endpoint (the origin) whose removal does not disconnect the space.
    3.  A line: This is homeomorphic to R. It has no endpoints. Removing any point disconnects it into two components that are topologically equivalent.
    4.  A 'V' shape: This is a union of two rays R(u) and R(v) where u and v are linearly independent. It is not homeomorphic to a line. Removing the origin disconnects it into two open rays. Removing any other point also disconnects it, but into two topologically different components.

    Conclusion
    The four shapes (point, ray, line, and V-shape) are all topologically distinct.
    Therefore, there are 4 homeomorphism classes.
