    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The criterion states that if a prime $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, the polynomial is irreducible. For $x^4 + 8x + 14$, the coefficients are (1, 0, 0, 8, 14). The prime $p=2$ divides 0, 8, and 14, but not the leading coefficient 1. Also, $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant:** For an irreducible quartic, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. We can distinguish between subgroups of the alternating group $A_4$ and those that are not by checking if the discriminant, $\\Delta$, is a perfect square. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic:** To further distinguish between the possible groups ($S_4$ and $D_4$ if $\\Delta$ is not a square, or $A_4$ and $V_4$ if it is), we analyze its resolvent cubic. For $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. The Galois group is $D_4$ or $V_4$ if and only if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., has a rational root). Otherwise, the group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Group and its Order:**\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square and $R(y)$ is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square and $R(y)$ is reducible, the group is $D_4$ (order 8).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square and $R(y)$ is irreducible, the group is $A_4$ (order 12).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square and $R(y)$ is reducible, the group is $V_4$ (order 4).\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_integer_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = {1, n}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    \n    # Return both positive and negative divisors\n    positive_divs = list(divs)\n    all_divs = positive_divs + [-d for d in positive_divs]\n    return sorted(all_divs)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Irreducibility (explained in text)\n    print(\"Step 1: Check Irreducibility\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant (Δ)\")\n    delta = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\n    print(f\"Δ = 256 * q^3 - 27 * p^4\")\n    print(f\"Δ = 256 * ({q})^3 - 27 * ({p})^4\")\n    print(f\"Δ = 256 * {q**3} - 27 * {p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {256 * q**3} - {27 * p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {delta}\")\n    \n    # Check if the discriminant is a perfect square\n    is_square = False\n    if delta > 0:\n        sqrt_delta = math.isqrt(delta)\n        if sqrt_delta * sqrt_delta == delta:\n            is_square = True\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIs the discriminant a perfect square? {is_square}\")\n    if not is_square:\n        print(f\"Since Δ = {delta} is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are S4 or D4.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Since Δ = {delta} is a perfect square, the Galois group is a subgroup of A4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are A4 or V4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic R(y)\")\n    # Resolvent cubic is y^3 - 4*q*y - p^2 = 0\n    c2 = -4 * q\n    c3 = -(p**2)\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic is y^3 - 4*q*y - p^2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"R(y) = y^3 - 4*({q})*y - ({p})^2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"R(y) = y^3 + ({c2})y + ({c3}) = 0\")\n\n    # Check for rational roots of the resolvent cubic\n    # By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term.\n    constant_term = c3\n    divisors = get_integer_divisors(constant_term)\n    \n    rational_root = None\n    for d in divisors:\n        if d**3 + c2*d + c3 == 0:\n            rational_root = d\n            break\n            \n    is_resolvent_reducible = rational_root is not None\n\n    print(f\"\\nIs the resolvent cubic reducible over Q?\")\n    if is_resolvent_reducible:\n        print(f\"Yes, it has a rational root y = {rational_root}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No, it does not have any rational roots.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the Galois group and its order\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion\")\n    order = 0\n    if not is_square and is_resolvent_reducible:\n        group_name = \"D4 (Dihedral group of order 8)\"\n        order = 8\n    elif not is_square and not is_resolvent_reducible:\n        group_name = \"S4 (Symmetric group on 4 letters)\"\n        order = 24\n    elif is_square and not is_resolvent_reducible:\n        group_name = \"A4 (Alternating group on 4 letters)\"\n        order = 12\n    elif is_square and is_resolvent_reducible:\n        # Need to check if all roots are rational to distinguish V4.\n        # But for this problem, this branch is not taken.\n        group_name = \"V4 (Klein four-group)\"\n        order = 4\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial is irreducible, its discriminant is NOT a perfect square, and its resolvent cubic IS reducible.\")\n    print(f\"This implies the Galois group is {group_name}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe order of the Galois group is {order}.\")\n    \n    return order\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
