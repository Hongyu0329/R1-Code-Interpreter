    # The problem provides l1 and alpha1. Based on the structure of the problem,
    # we can deduce the value of x11.
    # The matrix equation is:
    # A*X + X*I = I + C*U
    # where A = [[0, 1], [0, 0]], I is the identity matrix.
    # This leads to the scalar equations:
    # 1) x11 + x21 = 1 + c1*u1
    # 2) x12 + x22 = 0
    # 3) x21 = 0
    # 4) x22 = 1 + c2*u2
    #
    # From equation (3), x21 = 0. Substituting this into equation (1) gives:
    # x11 = 1 + c1*u1

    # Rearranging for u1, we get:

    # alpha1 = (1 + k)**6 * (1 - k + k**2)
    # x11 = alpha1 / l1 = (1 + k) * (1 - k + k**2)
    # This is the sum of cubes identity: (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) = a^3 + b^3
    # With a=1 and b=k=10^5, we have:
    # x11 = 1^3 + k^3 = 1 + (10^5)^3 = 1 + 10^15
