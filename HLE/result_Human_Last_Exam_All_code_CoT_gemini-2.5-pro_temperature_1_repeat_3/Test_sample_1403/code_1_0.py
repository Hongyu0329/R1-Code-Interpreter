# Define the variables for the number of guaranteed correct guesses
# in each scenario based on the logic explained above.

# N is the guaranteed number of correct guesses for 9 people guessing simultaneously.
# The group is split into a team of 5 and a team of 4.
# The number of correct guesses is the minimum size of the two teams.
N_team1_size = 5
N_team2_size = 4
N = min(N_team1_size, N_team2_size)

# M is the guaranteed number of correct guesses when one person guesses first.
# The first person's guess informs the other 8, who can then all guess correctly.
M = 8

# The problem asks for the difference M - N.
difference = M - N
