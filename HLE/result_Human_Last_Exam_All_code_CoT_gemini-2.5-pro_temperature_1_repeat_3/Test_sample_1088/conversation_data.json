    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the atom in question. The notation **6-311G\\*\\*** tells us how to calculate this number for any given atom.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the notation:\n\n*   **6-**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single basis function, which is a sum (a contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **-311G**: Each valence atomic orbital is described by three basis functions. The first is a contraction of **3** primitive Gaussians, the second is a single primitive Gaussian (**1**), and the third is also a single primitive Gaussian (**1**). This is known as a triple-zeta split-valence basis set.\n*   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a single set of **d-type** polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. This adds **1** primitive Gaussian.\n    *   The second `*` adds a single set of **p-type** polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This adds **1** primitive Gaussian.\n\n### Example Calculation for Carbon (C)\n\nLet's calculate the number of primitives for a Carbon atom (a common example):\n1.  **Core (1s orbital):** Carbon is in the second period, so its only core orbital is the 1s orbital. The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   Primitives for 1s = **6**\n2.  **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `-311` rule applies to the 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n    *   Primitives for 2s = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**\n    *   Primitives for 2p = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**\n3.  **Polarization (`**`):**\n    *   The first `*` applies because Carbon is a heavy atom. This adds one d-function. Primitives = **1**\n    *   The second `*` applies only to Hydrogen, so it's ignored for Carbon.\n4.  **Total:**\n    *   Total Primitives = (1s core) + (2s valence) + (2p valence) + (d polarization)\n    *   Total = `6 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 17`\n    *   The final equation is: `6 + (3+1+1) + (3+1+1) + 1 = 17`\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation for any element from Hydrogen (H) to Argon (Ar).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_6_311g_star_star(symbol: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Gaussian functions in the 6-311G**\n    basis set for a given element (H to Ar).\n\n    Args:\n        symbol: The atomic symbol of the element (e.g., 'H', 'C', 'Si').\n    \"\"\"\n    s_valence_prims = 3 + 1 + 1\n    p_valence_prims = 3 + 1 + 1\n\n    # Atomic numbers for elements from H to Ar\n    atomic_numbers = {\n        'H': 1, 'HE': 2, 'LI': 3, 'BE': 4, 'B': 5, 'C': 6, 'N': 7, 'O': 8, 'F': 9, 'NE': 10,\n        'NA': 11, 'MG': 12, 'AL': 13, 'SI': 14, 'P': 15, 'S': 16, 'CL': 17, 'AR': 18\n    }\n\n    z = atomic_numbers.get(symbol.upper())\n\n    if z is None:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the element '{symbol}' is not supported by this script (supported: H-Ar).\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Calculating primitive Gaussians for {symbol} (Z={z}) in 6-311G** basis set:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Period 1: H, He\n    if 1 <= z <= 2:\n        # For H and He, 1s is the valence orbital.\n        # The second '*' adds p-polarization functions.\n        pol_prims = 1\n        total = s_valence_prims + pol_prims\n        print(\"Valence 1s contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\")\n        print(\"Polarization 'p' contribution: 1\")\n        print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: (3+1+1) + 1 = {total}\")\n\n    # Period 2: Li - Ne\n    elif 3 <= z <= 10:\n        # Core is 1s orbital, described by 6 primitives.\n        core_prims = 6\n        # Valence are 2s and 2p orbitals.\n        # The first '*' adds d-polarization functions.\n        pol_prims = 1\n        total = core_prims + s_valence_prims + p_valence_prims + pol_prims\n        print(f\"Core 1s contribution: {core_prims}\")\n        print(f\"Valence 2s contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = {s_valence_prims}\")\n        print(f\"Valence 2p contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = {p_valence_prims}\")\n        print(f\"Polarization 'd' contribution: {pol_prims}\")\n        print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {core_prims} + ({3}+{1}+{1}) + ({3}+{1}+{1}) + {pol_prims} = {total}\")\n\n    # Period 3: Na - Ar\n    elif 11 <= z <= 18:\n        # Core are 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals, each described by 6 primitives.\n        core_1s = 6\n        core_2s = 6\n        core_2p = 6\n        core_prims_total = core_1s + core_2s + core_2p\n        # Valence are 3s and 3p orbitals.\n        # The first '*' adds d-polarization functions.\n        pol_prims = 1\n        total = core_prims_total + s_valence_prims + p_valence_prims + pol_prims\n        print(f\"Core 1s, 2s, 2p contribution: {core_1s} + {core_2s} + {core_2p} = {core_prims_total}\")\n        print(f\"Valence 3s contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = {s_valence_prims}\")\n        print(f\"Valence 3p contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = {p_valence_prims}\")\n        print(f\"Polarization 'd' contribution: {pol_prims}\")\n        print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: ({core_1s}+{core_2s}+{core_2p}) + ({3}+{1}+{1}) + ({3}+{1}+{1}) + {pol_prims} = {total}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # You can change the element symbol here to get the count for another atom.\n    element_symbol = input(\"Enter an element symbol (e.g., H, C, O, Si): \")\n    calculate_primitives_6_311g_star_star(element_symbol)\n\n```\n<<<17>>>"
