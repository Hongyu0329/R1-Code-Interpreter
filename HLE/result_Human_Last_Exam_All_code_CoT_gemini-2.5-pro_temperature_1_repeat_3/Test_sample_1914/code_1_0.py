def count_categories():
    """
    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.

    The calculation is based on a known classification in category theory.
    A category with 2 objects (A, B) must have 2 identity morphisms (id_A, id_B).
    This leaves 2 other morphisms to be placed. The total is found by summing
    the counts of different structural configurations.
