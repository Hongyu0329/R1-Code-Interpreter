    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in enumerative category theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the basic constraints:** A category with 2 objects (let's call them `A` and `B`) must have an identity morphism for each, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n2.  **Account for remaining morphisms:** We are given 4 morphisms in total. Since 2 are used for identities, we have 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms left to place and define composition rules for.\n3.  **Breakdown by structure:** The most effective way to count the number of non-isomorphic categories is to classify them by their overall structure.\n    *   **Disconnected Categories:** The objects `A` and `B` live in separate components with no morphisms between them. The 4 total morphisms are partitioned between the two objects.\n    *   **Connected Categories:** There is at least one morphism between `A` and `B`.\n4.  **Enumerate and sum:** We will count the number of non-isomorphic categories within each class and sum the results. The number of monoids (single-object categories) of a given size is a known result that we will use.\n\nThis Python code implements this case-by-case analysis to find the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The calculation is based on a known classification in category theory.\n    A category with 2 objects (A, B) must have 2 identity morphisms (id_A, id_B).\n    This leaves 2 other morphisms to be placed.
