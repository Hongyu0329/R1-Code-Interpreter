    # --- Analysis for Question (a) ---
    # The functional J becomes unbounded from below if the power of t in a negative term
    # exceeds the power of t in the dominant positive term.
    # The dominant positive term is the kinetic energy, which scales as t^max(2s, 2).
    # The negative L^p term scales as t^((1+s)*(p/2 - 1)).
    # Assuming s >= 1 (a standard assumption for such anisotropic problems), the kinetic
    # energy scales as t^(2s).
    # The condition for being unbounded below is: (1+s)*(p/2 - 1) > 2s
    # p/2 - 1 > 2s / (1+s)
    # p/2 > (1+s+2s)/(1+s)
    # p > 2*(1+3s)/(1+s)
    # This matches the condition in the question. Thus, the statement is true (under s>=1).
    answer_a = "True"

    # --- Analysis for Question (b) ---
    # The Mountain Pass Theorem guarantees the existence of a critical point, but not
    # its properties. This critical point is not necessarily a "ground state" (lowest energy
    # non-trivial solution) nor is it guaranteed to be "positive" (u>0, v>0).
    # Additional arguments are needed to establish these properties.
    answer_b = "No"

    # --- Analysis for Question (c) ---
    # Uniqueness of minimizers is a very strong property, typically requiring convexity
    # of the functional, which is not the case here due to the nonlinear terms.
    # Furthermore, the problem on R^2 is translation-invariant, meaning if (u(x),v(x))
    # is a solution, so is (u(x-c),v(x-c)), immediately violating uniqueness. Even when
    # considering uniqueness "up to symmetries", it is not guaranteed for such systems.
    answer_c = "No"
