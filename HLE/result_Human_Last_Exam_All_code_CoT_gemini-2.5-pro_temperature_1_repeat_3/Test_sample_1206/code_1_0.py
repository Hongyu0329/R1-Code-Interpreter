    """
    This function analyzes the counseling options for a mother whose adolescent son has started vaping.

    The analysis of the options is as follows:
    - Option I is incorrect because it normalizes vaping for an adolescent. The goal should be cessation, not just harm reduction.
    - Option II is a correct and evidence-based approach. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a first-line treatment to manage nicotine dependence and withdrawal safely.
    - Option III is a correct and crucial counseling point. It highlights that the risk-benefit calculation for an adult smoker is different from that for an adolescent, for whom the risks are high and long-term effects are unknown. The goal for youth is zero nicotine use.
    - Option IV is incorrect because it makes the dangerous and unsupported claim of "clear benefits" of vaping for children.
    - Option V is a potential second-line treatment, but NRT (Option II) and behavioral counseling are the primary recommendations.

    Therefore, the best options to consider are II and III. This combination corresponds to answer choice J.
