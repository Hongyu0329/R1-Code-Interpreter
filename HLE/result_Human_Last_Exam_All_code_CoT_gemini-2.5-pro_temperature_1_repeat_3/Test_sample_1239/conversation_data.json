    "Of course. The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of a set of differential equations is found through a systematic mathematical procedure (Lie's algorithm). This is not something that can be computed from first principles with a simple script. However, the result for the Navier-Stokes equations is a well-known fact in mathematical physics.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that calculates this dimension by summing the dimensions of the individual, known symmetry transformations that constitute the full group. The script will outline each component of the symmetry group and its contribution to the total dimension.\n\nThe finite-dimensional symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:\n1.  **Time translation**: The laws of physics don't change over time.\n2.  **Spatial translations**: The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space.\n3.  **Spatial rotations**: The laws of physics are the same no matter how you orient your coordinate system.\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: The equations are invariant under a transformation to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity.\n5.  **Scaling**: The equations exhibit a specific scaling symmetry that relates changes in length, time, velocity, and pressure scales.\n\nThe script below will sum the dimensions corresponding to each of these symmetries to find the total dimension.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of\n    symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n\n    The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the individual known\n    symmetry groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
