    # Choice A: Osteoarthritis
    print("\nA. Osteoarthritis:")
    print("  - For: Patient's age ({}) is a risk factor.".format(patient_age))
    print("  - Against: Presentation is too acute and inflammatory (redness, swelling). X-rays are negative for degenerative changes. Critically, it would not typically worsen on steroids.")
    print("  - Likelihood: Unlikely.")

    # Choice B: Charcot Arthropathy
    print("\nB. Charcot Arthropathy (Neuroarthropathy):")
    print("  - For: Classic presentation. An acute inflammatory episode (pain, swelling, redness) in a weight-bearing joint after minor trauma (the walk).")
    print("  - For: Early X-rays are often negative, showing only soft tissue swelling.")
    print("  - For: Failure to respond to NSAIDs and worsening despite steroids is highly characteristic.")
    print("  - For: Synovial fluid is typically non-inflammatory, matching the finding of no crystals or white blood cells.")
    print("  - For: Bony tenderness is a key feature.")
    print("  - Likelihood: Very high. This is the best fit for the complete clinical picture.")

    # Choice C: Septic Arthritis
    print("\nC. Septic Arthritis:")
    print("  - For: Acute, painful, red, swollen joint.")
    print("  - Against: Synovial fluid analysis is definitive. The absence of white blood cells or organisms on gram stain effectively rules this out.")
    print("  - Likelihood: Ruled out.")

    # Choice D: Chronic osteomyelitis
    print("\nD. Chronic osteomyelitis:")
    print("  - For: Can cause pain, swelling and have elevated inflammatory markers (CRP).")
    print("  - Against: X-rays are repeatedly negative. A bone infection present for over 10 days would likely show bony changes (e.g., periosteal reaction). The presentation is more typical of a joint process (arthropathy).")
    print("  - Likelihood: Unlikely.")

    # Choice E: Pseudogout
    print("\nE. Pseudogout (CPPD):")
    print("  - For: Can present as an acute, inflammatory monoarthritis in an older adult.")
    print("  - Against: Synovial fluid analysis is definitive. The diagnosis requires finding calcium pyrophosphate crystals, but the analysis revealed 'no crystals'. Also, it should respond well to steroids, not worsen.")
    print("  - Likelihood: Ruled out.")

    print("\n[Conclusion]")
    print("The patient's presentation of an acute, inflammatory arthropathy with negative X-rays, a failure to respond to standard anti-inflammatory treatment (NSAIDs, steroids), and non-diagnostic synovial fluid is a classic picture of early-stage Charcot Arthropathy.")
