# The puzzle uses 't' and 'b' characters to visually represent a word.
# By interpreting this ASCII-art-like representation, we can identify the letters.

# The first letter formed on the left is 'F'.
# The second letter in the middle is a blocky 'O'.
# The third letter on the right is an 'X'.

# Combining these letters reveals the hidden word.
decoded_word = "FOX"

# The following line will print the final answer.
print(f"The encoded word is: {decoded_word}")
