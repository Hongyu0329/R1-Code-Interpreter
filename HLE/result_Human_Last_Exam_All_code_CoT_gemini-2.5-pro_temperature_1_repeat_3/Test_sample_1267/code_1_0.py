    print("   - This low frequency implies that the mutated Leucine-tRNA must compete with the cell's correct and more abundant/efficient Glutamine-tRNA.")
    print("   - The correct tRNA successfully binds most of the time, but the mutated tRNA occasionally wins this competition.\n")

    # --- Step 5: Conclusion ---
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The mutation allows the tRNA to misread a codon for a different amino acid, causing a missense mutation.")
    print("The rarity of the event is due to competition with the correct tRNA.")
    print("This matches option C: It allows insertion of an amino acid usually inserted by another, more common anticodon.")
