    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is given by a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that satisfy the condition:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis single condition on the pair of maps $(L, R)$ implies that one map uniquely determines the other. An adjunction exists if and only if there is an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$, or equivalently, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ satisfying $R(n)=m$.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value in the sequence. So, our task reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem, often solved using \"stars and bars\". The number of such non-decreasing sequences of length $k$ with values taken from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$ is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{N+1 \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right)$, which is equal to the binomial coefficient $\\binom{(N+1)+k-1}{k} = \\binom{N+k}{k}$.\n\nIn our case:\n*   The length of the sequence is $k = 23$ (for the values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, so the maximum value is $N = 37$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to count the number of order-preserving maps L: [23] -> [37]\n# with the property L(0) = 0.\n# This is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences\n# of length 23, with elements from {0, 1, ..., 37}.\n\n# Let k be the length of the sequence and N be the maximum value.\n# k = 23\n# N = 37\n# The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient C(N+k, k).\n\nk = 23\nN = 37\n\nn_comb = N + k\nk_comb = k\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(60, 23)\nresult = math.comb(n_comb, k_comb)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions is C({n_comb}, {k_comb}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<464303318541543400>>>"
