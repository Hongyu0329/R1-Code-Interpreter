# The core of the proof reduces the problem to analyzing the properties
# of coefficient sequences. As explained, a digitary function must take the form
# f(x) = a*x + c. This arises from constraints on how the function is built
# from digits.
#
# A key step in the derivation is finding the relationship between the coefficients
# a_n in the expression p_n(d) = a_n * d + b_n. The consistency condition for
# numbers with dual representations (e.g., 0.5 = 0.499...) yields a
# recurrence relation for these coefficients.
#
# The final recurrence relation is a_{k-1} = 10 * a_k.
# This can be written as a homogeneous linear equation:
# 1 * a_{k-1} - 10 * a_k = 0
#
# This equation is central to the argument. We will print the numbers from it
# as requested by the prompt.

# The recurrence relation a_{k-1} = 10 * a_k implies that the entire sequence of
# coefficients {a_k} is determined by a single parameter, a_0.
# The second set of coefficients, {b_k}, must form a summable sequence,
# contributing another single parameter, c = sum(b_k).
#
# Thus, any digitary function is specified by exactly two parameters, a_0 and c,
# in the form f(x) = a_0 * x + c.
# The vector space of such functions has a basis, for example {1, x}.
# The number of functions in the basis is the dimension of the space.
