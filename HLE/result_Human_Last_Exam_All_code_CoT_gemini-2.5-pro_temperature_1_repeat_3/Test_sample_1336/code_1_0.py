    This function calculates the total number of smooth coverings for the given problem.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of objects related to PSL(2, p)
    by its covering group SL(2, p) for a prime p > 5. In the context of representation
    theory, this number corresponds to the order of the center of the covering group, G = SL(2, p).

    The order of the center of the special linear group SL(n, q) is given by the formula:
    |Z(SL(n, q))| = gcd(n, q-1)

    For this problem, G = SL(2, p), so we have n = 2 and q = p.
