    "The user wants to find the Hopf charge of a given 3D vector field.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that characterizes maps from 3-space (compactified to a 3-sphere `S^3`) to the 2-sphere `S^2`. Our vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)` is a unit vector, so it represents such a map.\n2.  **Method of Calculation**: The Hopf charge can be calculated in several ways. One intuitive way is as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere `S^2`. Another way is using the Whitehead integral formula, which relates the charge to a Chern-Simons integral `(1/4π²) ∫ A ⋅ (∇ × A) dV`, where `B = ∇ × A` is the pullback of the area form on `S^2`.\n3.  **Analyze the Field Structure**:\n    *   The field is described using coordinates `(f, G)` on the `S^2` sphere.\n    *   `f = atan2(y,x)` is the standard azimuthal angle in the base space `(x,y,z)`.\n    *   `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)` is the polar angle, which depends on `r2`, the distance from a specific circle `x²+y²=0.5, z=0`.\n    *   This structure, where the azimuthal angle of the space `f` is mapped to the azimuthal angle of the field `n`, and the other coordinates `(√(x²+y²), z)` determine the polar angle `G`, is characteristic of a field configuration called a Hopfion. The Hopf charge is expected to be an integer, typically 1 for this fundamental form.\n4.  **Linking Number Approach**:\n    *   Let's choose two regular values (points) on the `S^2` sphere. For simplicity, let's pick two opposite points on the equator, for example, `p₁ = (1, 0, 0)` and `p₂ = (-1, 0, 0)`.\n    *   The preimage of `p₁` is the set of points `(x,y,z)` where `n(x,y,z) = (1,0,0)`. This requires `G=π/2` and `f=0`.\n        *   `f=0` means `y=0, x>0`.\n        *   `G=π/2` translates to `exp(-10*r2) = 0.5`, or `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n        *   Substituting `r2`'s definition, we get a closed loop `C₁` in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\n    *   The preimage of `p₂` is the set of points where `n(x,y,z) = (-1,0,0)`. This requires `G=π/2` and `f=π`.\n        *   `f=π` means `y=0, x<0`.\n        *   `G=π/2` gives the same condition on `r2`.\n        *   This defines a second closed loop `C₂` in the `y=0, x<0` half-plane.\n    *   The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C₁, C₂)`.\n    *   Since both curves lie in the same plane (`y=0`) and are disjoint, their linking number is 0. This seems paradoxical. Let's reconsider the preimages.\n\n5.  **Revisiting Linking Number**: Let's choose `p₁ = (1, 0, 0)` and `p₂ = (0, 1, 0)`.\n    *   Preimage `C₁` of `p₁`: `f=0`, `G=π/2`. This is a loop in the `y=0, x>0` plane.\n    *   Preimage `C₂` of `p₂`: `f=π/2`, `G=π/2`. This is a loop in the `x=0, y>0` plane.\n    *   These two loops are perpendicular to each other. One lies in the `y=0` plane, centered off-axis, and the other in the `x=0` plane, also centered off-axis. These two loops are indeed linked, like two links of a chain. Their linking number is 1. The previous choice of antipodal points was misleading.\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**: We can confirm this by numerically calculating the linking number using the Gauss linking integral. This involves a double line integral over the two preimage curves. This is a robust way to compute the topological charge.\n\n7.  **Final Code**: The python code will:\n    *   Define the parameterizations of the two preimage curves, `C₁` and `C₂`.\n    *   Define the integrand of the Gauss linking integral.\n    *   Use `scipy.integrate.dblquad` to compute the double integral.\n    *   The result of the integral divided by `4π` gives the linking number, which is the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import dblquad\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field using the linking number approach.\n\n    The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the S^2 sphere.\n    We choose the points p1 = (1,0,0) and p2 = (0,1,0).\n\n    1. Preimage of p1 = (1,0,0):\n       This corresponds to n=(1,0,0), which means G=pi/2 and f=0.\n       G = pi * exp(-10*r2) = pi/2  =>  exp(-10*r2) = 0.5  =>  r2 = ln(2)/10.\n       f = atan2(y,x) = 0  => y=0, x>0.\n       The preimage is a curve C1 in the xz-plane, defined by:\n       r2^2 = ((x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2) = (ln(2)/10)^2.\n\n    2. Preimage of p2 = (0,1,0):\n       This corresponds to n=(0,1,0), which means G=pi/2 and f=pi/2.\n       f = atan2(y,x) = pi/2 => x=0, y>0.\n       The condition on r2 is the same.\n       The preimage is a curve C2 in the yz-plane, defined by:\n       r2^2 = ((y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2) = (ln(2)/10)^2.\n\n    3. Linking Number Calculation:\n       The linking number of two curves C1 and C2 is given by the Gauss linking integral:\n       Lk(C1, C2) = (1 / 4pi) * integral_C1 integral_C2\n                      (r1 - r2) .
