    "This problem can be interpreted in two ways. A strict interpretation implies that no queen can attack any other queen, regardless of color. A more complex interpretation, common in chess puzzles, is that no queen attacks another queen *of the same color*. The second interpretation presents a more challenging problem that requires coding to solve, which aligns with the prompt's instructions. I will proceed with this second interpretation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The task is to find the maximum number `m` such that we can place `m` white queens and `m` black queens on a 16x16 board, where queens of the same color do not attack each other. The set of squares occupied by white queens must be disjoint from the set for black queens.\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:** This is equivalent to finding the maximum `m` for which two disjoint `m`-queen non-attacking configurations can be placed on a 16x16 board. The maximum possible value for `m` is 16, as it's impossible to place more than 16 non-attacking queens on a 16x16 board. We need to determine if `m=16` is achievable.\n3.  **Develop a Strategy:** To show that `m=16` is possible, we need to find two disjoint solutions to the 16-Queens problem. A solution is a set of 16 board positions where no two queens threaten each other.\n4.  **Construct a Solution:** A simple method exists to generate a second, disjoint solution from a first one on an even-sized board like 16x16.\n    *   First, we find one valid solution to the 16-Queens problem. Let's represent this solution by an array `P`, where `P[i]` is the column of the queen in row `i+1`.\n    *   This will be the configuration for the white queens.\n    *   Next, we create a second solution, `B` (for the black queens), by reflecting the first solution across the horizontal midline of the board. If a white queen is at `(row, col)`, the corresponding black queen will be at `(row, 16 + 1 - col)`. So, `B[i] = 17 - P[i]`.\n    *   This new configuration `B` is also a valid 16-Queens solution.\n    *   Crucially, these two solutions are always disjoint. A square can't be occupied by both a white and a black queen because for any given row `i`, the white queen is in column `P[i]` and the black queen is in column `17 - P[i]`. If they were the same, `P[i]` would have to equal `17 - P[i]`, which simplifies to `2 * P[i] = 17`. This is impossible since `P[i]` is an integer.\n5.  **Implement the Code:** The Python code will first find one solution to the 16-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. Then, it will use this solution to construct the second disjoint solution and print both, demonstrating that `m=16` is indeed achievable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's possible the recursion depth could be an issue for N=16, so increase the limit.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\nclass QueenSolver:\n    \"\"\"\n    A solver to find one solution for the N-Queens problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.n = n\n        self.solution = None\n\n    def is_safe(self, board, row, col):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if it's safe to place a queen at board[row][col].\n        This function is called when \"col\" queens are already placed in\n        columns from 0 to col-1.
