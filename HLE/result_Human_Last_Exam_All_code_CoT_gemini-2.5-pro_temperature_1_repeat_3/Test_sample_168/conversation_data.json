    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we need to examine the auditory capabilities of each animal listed. The sound produced by muscle contractions is extremely faint and typically at a low frequency. Therefore, the correct animal must have exceptionally sensitive hearing.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that does the following:\n1.  Stores information about the hearing abilities of each animal in a dictionary.\n2.  Prints the facts for each animal to compare their auditory senses.\n3.  Analyzes these facts to draw a conclusion about which animal is the most likely candidate.\n4.  Prints the final conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing capabilities of different animals to determine\n    which might be sensitive enough to hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    animal_hearing_facts = {\n        'A. Dog': 'Hearing range is approx. 67-45,000 Hz. While their hearing is acute, they are not known for detecting the extremely low-amplitude sounds of muscle contractions.',\n        'B. Bat': 'Specializes in high-frequency ultrasound (20,000-200,000 Hz) for echolocation. Their hearing is not adapted for detecting very faint, low-frequency sounds.',\n        'C. Herring': 'Has an exceptionally sensitive auditory system. A special connection between its swim bladder and inner ear amplifies pressure changes in the water, theoretically making it sensitive enough to detect minute vibrations, such as those from a predator\\'s muscle movements.',\n        'D. Whale': 'Hearing is adapted for long-distance communication (low frequencies) or echolocation (high frequencies) in water. It is not specialized for detecting extremely faint, close-range biological sounds.',\n        'E. Human': 'Hearing range is 20-20,000 Hz. Our hearing is not sensitive enough to perceive the very faint sounds produced by our own muscle twitches under normal conditions.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which animal might hear human muscle twitches based on hearing sensitivity:\\n\")\n    for animal, fact in animal_hearing_facts.items():\n        print(f\"{animal}: {fact}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"A human muscle twitch creates a very faint, low-amplitude vibration.\")\n    print(\"Of the animals listed, the Herring has a unique auditory system that is exceptionally sensitive to pressure waves in water.\")\n    print(\"This makes it the most plausible candidate for being able to detect such a subtle sound.\")\n\nanalyze_animal_hearing()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
