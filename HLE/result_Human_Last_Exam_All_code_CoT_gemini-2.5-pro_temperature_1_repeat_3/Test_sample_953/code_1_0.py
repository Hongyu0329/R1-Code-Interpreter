def solve():
    """
    This function provides the solution based on the theoretical analysis of Luby's algorithm.

    The analysis shows that for all three graph classes (cycles, trees with bounded degree,
    and general graphs with bounded degree), the number of steps required by the algorithm
    is Theta(log n) with high probability.

    According to the problem's categories, a complexity of Theta(log n) falls into
    category 9: f(n) = Omega(log n).

    Therefore, the digits for f_1(n), f_2(n), and f_3(n) are all 9.
