    "My plan to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided words. They appear to be gibberish, which suggests some form of encoding or pattern.\n2.  I'll reject complex cryptographic ciphers for now, as they often require a key which is not provided. Instead, I will look for a simpler, more logical pattern, possibly related to the physical properties of the words themselves.\n3.  The request to \"output each number in the final equation\" is a major clue. It suggests the words represent numbers and that these numbers are related by an equation.\n4.  I will examine the lengths of the words:\n    *   `utpshtheas`: 10 characters\n    *   `fkuhu`: 5 characters\n    *   `numhkatnatu`: 11 characters\n    *   `anhaeketn`: 9 characters\n5.  I'll hypothesize that the decoded number for each word is its length minus a constant value, let's call it `C`. So, the numbers are `10-C`, `5-C`, `11-C`, and `9-C`.\n6.  The most common equation pattern in such puzzles is `number1 + number2 = number3`. I will test this hypothesis:\n    `(10 - C) + (5 - C) = (11 - C)`\n    `15 - 2C = 11 - C`\n    `4 = C`\n7.  The constant `C` is 4. This means the rule to \"decode\" a word is to calculate its length and subtract 4.\n8.  I will apply this rule to the first three words to verify the pattern:\n    *   `utpshtheas` -> `10 - 4 = 6`\n    *   `fkuhu` -> `5 - 4 = 1`\n    *   `numhkatnatu` -> `11 - 4 = 7`\n    The equation `6 + 1 = 7` holds true, confirming the pattern.\n9.  Finally, I will apply the same rule to the last word, `anhaeketn`, to find its decoded value.\n10. The python code will perform these calculations and print the verification equation, as requested, followed by the final decoded value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the word puzzle by finding a mathematical pattern based on word lengths.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = [\n        \"utpshtheas\",\n        \"fkuhu\",\n        \"numhkatnatu\",\n        \"anhaeketn\"\n    ]\n\n    # The pattern is that each word represents a number, and the numbers\n    # are related by an equation.
