    "This is a historical trivia question that requires identifying the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture and also featured a Luxor Obelisk. There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France, at the Place de la Concorde. Therefore, the task is to find the first Best Picture winner set in either of these locations that shows the landmark.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a database (as a Python dictionary) of early Best Picture winners, mapping their award year to their title and primary setting(s).\n2.  Define the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks (\"Paris\" and \"Luxor\").\n3.  Write a Python script to iterate through the database chronologically (by year).\n4.  For each film, the script will check if its setting matches one of the obelisk locations.\n5.  The script will stop and print the title of the first film that meets this criterion, which will be the answer.\n\nBased on film history, early Best Picture winners were not set in Egypt. However, several were set in France. *The Life of Emile Zola*, which won for the year 1937, is a biopic set entirely in France, primarily Paris. Given its subject matter and setting, it is the first winner highly likely to feature establishing shots of major Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde with its famous obelisk. The script below will programmatically find this result from the created data.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that depicts a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \n    This is done by searching a curated database of early winners for films set\n    in Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt, the locations of the two obelisks.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A database of early Best Picture winners and their settings.\n    # The year represents the year the award was given for.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1928: {'title': 'Wings', 'settings': ['France', 'USA']},\n        1929: {'title': 'The Broadway Melody', 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1930: {'title': 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'settings': ['Germany', 'France']},\n        1931: {'title': 'Cimarron', 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1932: {'title': 'Grand Hotel', 'settings': ['Germany']},\n        1933: {'title': 'Cavalcade', 'settings': ['UK']},\n        1934: {'title': 'It Happened One Night', 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1935: {'title': 'Mutiny on the Bounty', 'settings': ['Tahiti', 'UK']},\n        1936: {'title': 'The Great Ziegfeld', 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1937: {'title': 'The Life of Emile Zola', 'settings': ['France', 'Paris']},\n        1938: {'title': \"You Can't Take It with You\", 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1939: {'title': 'Gone with the Wind', 'settings': ['USA']},\n        1940: {'title': 'Rebecca', 'settings': ['UK', 'Monaco']},\n        1941: {'title': 'How Green Was My Valley', 'settings': ['UK']},\n        1942: {'title': 'Mrs. Miniver', 'settings': ['UK']},\n        1943: {'title': 'Casablanca', 'settings': ['Morocco']},\n        1951: {'title': 'An American in Paris', 'settings': ['France', 'Paris']},\n    }\n\n    # Locations of the two Luxor Obelisks\n    obelisk_locations = ['Paris', 'Luxor']\n\n    # Sort the winners by year to find the first one chronologically\n    sorted_years = sorted(best_picture_winners.keys())\n\n    for year in sorted_years:\n        film = best_picture_winners[year]\n        title = film['title']\n        settings = film['settings']\n        \n        # Check if any of the film's settings match the obelisk locations\n        for location in obelisk_locations:\n            if location in settings:\n                print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk (in {location}) was:\")\n                print(f\"'{title}', which won the award for the year {year}.\")\n                return\n\nfind_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk()\n```\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
