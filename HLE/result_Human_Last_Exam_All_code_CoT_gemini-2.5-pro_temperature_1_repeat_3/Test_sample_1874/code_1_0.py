    print("The problem asks for the second smallest possible value of a cardinal delta.")
    print("This delta is the length of a special sequence of sets called a 'tower'.")
    print("Let's analyze the properties of this tower:")
    print(" - The tower is a sequence of sets <x_alpha : alpha in delta>.")
    print(" - Each x_alpha is a subset of omega_2 with size omega_2.")

    print("Step 4: Finding the smallest and second smallest possible values.")
    print("We are looking for possible values for delta = t(omega_2), which must be regular cardinals greater than or equal to omega_3.")

    print("   It is known to be consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) = omega_3.")
    print("   Therefore, the smallest possible value for delta is omega_3.")
    print(" - The second smallest possible value: We need to find the next regular cardinal after omega_3.")
    print("   The successor of a regular cardinal is always regular. The successor of omega_3 is omega_4.")
    print("   It is also known to be consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) = omega_4.")
