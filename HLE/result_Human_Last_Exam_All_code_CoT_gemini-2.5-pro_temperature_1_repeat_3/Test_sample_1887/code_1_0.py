    print("Let kappa = 2^w, the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.")
    print("The problem provides the following constraints on kappa:")
    print("1. The continuum hypothesis fails. This is a general statement, but the specific constraints are more important.")
    print("2. kappa < Aleph_{w_{w+5}}.")
    print("3. kappa is not a regular cardinal, meaning it is a singular cardinal. So, cf(kappa) < kappa.")
    print("\nFrom general set theory (KÃ¶nig's Theorem), we have an additional constraint:")
    print("4. cf(kappa) > w (omega), which means cf(kappa) >= Aleph_1.")
    print("\nLet X be the set of all possible cofinalities of kappa. We want to find the order type of X.")
    print("Let gamma = cf(kappa) be an element of X.")
    print("\nStep 1: Determine the properties of gamma.")
    print("From the definition of cofinality, gamma must be a regular cardinal.")
    print("From constraint (4), we have gamma >= Aleph_1.")
    print("From constraints (2) and (3), we have gamma = cf(kappa) <= kappa < Aleph_{w_{w+5}}.")

    print("Let gamma be any regular cardinal satisfying Aleph_1 <= gamma < Aleph_{w_{w+5}}.")
    print("We need to show there exists a singular cardinal kappa satisfying the given constraints such that cf(kappa) = gamma.")
    print("Let's construct such a kappa. A standard way to build a singular cardinal with a specific cofinality is to find a suitable limit ordinal alpha for its index, so kappa = Aleph_alpha.")
    print("For kappa to be singular, alpha must be a limit ordinal.")
    print("We need cf(kappa) = cf(Aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha) = gamma.")
    print("Let's choose alpha = gamma * 2. Since gamma >= Aleph_1, gamma is a limit ordinal, and so is gamma * 2.")
    print("The cofinality cf(gamma * 2) = cf(gamma). Since gamma is a regular cardinal, cf(gamma) = gamma.")
    print("So, the cardinal kappa = Aleph_{gamma*2} is singular and has cofinality gamma.")
    print("We must check if kappa < Aleph_{w_{w+5}}, which means alpha < w_{w+5}, i.e., gamma * 2 < w_{w+5}.")
    print("The condition gamma < Aleph_{w_{w+5}} means the cardinality of gamma is less than Aleph_{w_{w+5}}.")
    print("Since w_{w+5} is the initial ordinal of cardinality Aleph_{w_{w+5}}, any ordinal with smaller cardinality (like gamma and gamma*2) must be smaller than w_{w+5}.")
    print("Therefore, this construction works. The set X is precisely the set of all regular cardinals gamma such that Aleph_1 <= gamma < Aleph_{w_{w+5}}.")
    print("\nStep 3: Determine the order type of the set X.")
    print("The order type of this set of cardinals is the same as the order type of their indices.")
    print("Let I be the set of indices beta such that Aleph_beta is in X. So, I = {beta | 1 <= beta < w_{w+5} and Aleph_beta is regular}.")
    print("A cardinal Aleph_beta is regular if beta is a successor ordinal (e.g., alpha+1) or if beta is a weakly inaccessible cardinal.")
    print("Let S be the set of all successor ordinals beta such that 1 <= beta < w_{w+5}. S = {alpha+1 | 0 <= alpha < w_{w+5}}.")
    print("The set S is a subset of I (S subset I).")
    print("The order type of S is w_{w+5}, because the map f(alpha) = alpha+1 is an order isomorphism from the set of ordinals less than w_{w+5} to S.")
    print("The set I is a subset of the set of all ordinals less than w_{w+5}, so its order type is at most w_{w+5}.")
    print("So we have: order_type(S) <= order_type(I) <= order_type({beta | 1 <= beta < w_{w+5}}).")
    print("This means: w_{w+5} <= order_type(I) <= w_{w+5}.")
