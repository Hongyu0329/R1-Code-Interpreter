    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system (n):** The system of differential equations is given by $x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)$. The matrix $A$ is a $202000 \\times 202000$ matrix, and the vector $I(t)$ has 202000 components. For the matrix-vector multiplication $Ax(t)$ to be defined and the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the vector $x(t)$ must have 202000 components. Therefore, the dimension of the system is $n = 202000$.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k):** The problem provides a list of boundary conditions. We need to identify how many of these are unique and not redundant.\n    Let's analyze the given conditions:\n    *   $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    *   $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$. This is identical to the second condition.\n    *   $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$, which also simplifies to $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$.\n    *   $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$.\n    *   $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$.\n\n    By inspecting the list, we can see there are only three distinct, linearly independent conditions:\n    1.  A condition on $x_1$.\n    2.  A condition on $x_2$.\n    3.  A condition on $x_{2024}$.\n    Thus, the number of linearly independent boundary conditions is $k = 3$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index:** The index of a linear boundary-value problem defined on a system of $n$ ordinary differential equations with $k$ linearly independent boundary conditions is given by the formula:\n    `index = n - k`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:** We will now substitute the values of $n$ and $k$ into the formula and calculate the index.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the system of differential equations.\nn = 202000\n\n# The number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n# Conditions given are:\n# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n# 3. 5(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n# 4. 100(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n# 5. -1000(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n# 6. 100(x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0\n# Counting the unique conditions gives k=3.\nk = 3\n\n# The index of the boundary-value problem is n - k.\nindex = n - k\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result.\nprint(f\"{n} - {k} = {index}\")\n```\n<<<201997>>>"
