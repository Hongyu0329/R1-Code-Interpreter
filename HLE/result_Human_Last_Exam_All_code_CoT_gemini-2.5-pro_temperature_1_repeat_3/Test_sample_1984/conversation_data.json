    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** The equilibrium points of the differential equation `x'(t) = f(x)` are the values of `x` for which `x'(t) = 0`. I will solve the algebraic equation `-x³ + 2x² - x = 0` to find these points.\n2.  **Determine Stability:** To determine the stability of each equilibrium point `x*`, I will use the first derivative test. Let `f(x) = -x³ + 2x² - x`. I will calculate its derivative, `f'(x)`.\n    *   If `f'(x*) < 0`, the equilibrium is stable.\n    *   If `f'(x*) > 0`, the equilibrium is unstable.\n    *   If `f'(x*) = 0`, the test is inconclusive, and I will analyze the sign of `f(x)` in the neighborhood of `x*` to determine stability.\n3.  **Count Stable Points (m):** I will count the number of stable equilibrium points found in the previous step. This count will be the value of `m`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Expression:** Finally, I will compute the value of `m - 2^4048`. Python can handle arbitrarily large integers, making this calculation straightforward.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by finding the number of stable equilibria 'm'\n    and then calculating m - 2^4048.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The differential equation is x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x.\")\n    print(\"Let f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find the equilibrium points by solving f(x) = 0.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Find Equilibrium Points ---\")\n    print(\"We need to solve -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.\")\n    print(\"Factoring the equation: -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to: -x(x - 1)^2 = 0\")\n    eq_point_1, eq_point_2 = 0, 1\n    print(f\"The equilibrium points are x = {eq_point_1} and x = {eq_point_2}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Determine Stability ---\")\n    print(\"We use the first derivative test.
