    "Here is my plan to solve this sequence problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  I will try to find a mathematical relationship or pattern between the consecutive numbers. I'll test simple arithmetic and geometric progressions first.\n3.  After some trials, I found a more complex but consistent pattern. The pattern appears to be `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c_n`, where `a_n` is the current term, `a_{n-1}` is the previous term, and `c_n` is a value that also follows a pattern. This rule holds true starting from the third term.\n    *   For `n=3`: `a_3 = 23`. `3 * a_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. So, `23 = 33 - 10`.\n    *   For `n=4`: `a_4 = 51`. `3 * a_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. So, `51 = 69 - 18`.\n    *   For `n=5`: `a_5 = 119`. `3 * a_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. So, `119 = 153 - 34`.\n4.  Now, let's analyze the sequence of numbers being subtracted: 10, 18, 34.\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is 8.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is 16.\n5.  The differences (8, 16) are doubling. This means the next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n6.  Therefore, the next number to subtract will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n7.  Finally, I will calculate the next term in the original sequence using the last known term (119) and the number we just found (66): `3 * 119 - 66`.\n8.  The python code will perform this final calculation and print out the equation with all its components.\n\n```python\n# The last term in the given sequence.\nlast_term = 119\n\n# The last number that was subtracted in the pattern.\n# For 119, the calculation was 3 * 51 - 34 = 119. So, 34 is the last subtrahend.\nlast_subtrahend = 34\n\n# The difference between the last two subtrahends (18 and 34) was 16.\nlast_difference = 16\n\n# The pattern of the differences is that they double each time.\nnext_difference = last_difference * 2\n\n# Calculate the next number to subtract.\nnext_subtrahend = last_subtrahend + next_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the main sequence.\nnext_term = 3 * last_term - next_subtrahend\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"The calculation for the next term is:\")\nprint(f\"3 * {last_term} - {next_subtrahend} = {next_term}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
