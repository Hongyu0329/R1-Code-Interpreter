    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending and starting leg position, I will analyze the definition of each movement. The \"position\" can refer to both the configuration of the legs (e.g., fifth position with the right foot in front) and the location on the stage. A step that ends in the *exact* same position must be performed *sur place* (in place) and must not change which foot is in front.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Define the characteristics of each ballet step from the answer choices, focusing on whether the feet change and whether the step travels.\n2.  **Entrechat six:** This is a vertical jump in place. An even-numbered entrechat (like four, six, or eight) by definition starts and ends in the same fifth position. The feet do not change.\n3.  **Échappé battu changé:** The word `changé` explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating the feet switch their front/back placement. This step does not end in the starting position.\n4.  **Assemblé:** This step travels and usually involves changing the feet (e.g., `assemblé dessus` where the back foot moves to the front).\n5.  **Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding, *traveling* step. While the feet may not change (a non-`changé` glissade), the dancer's location on the floor does. Therefore, the overall position is different.\n6.  **Gargouillade:** This is a complex, traveling jump that involves changing the feet.\n7.  Based on this analysis, the `Entrechat six` is the only step listed that is performed in place and returns to the identical starting fifth position. I will write a Python script to represent this logic and print the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    'Position' is defined as both leg configuration and location on the floor.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'changes_feet': False,\n            'travels': False,\n            'description': \"A vertical jump in place where the legs beat and return to the original starting fifth position.\"\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'changes_feet': True,\n            'travels': True,\n            'description': \"A jump where feet 'escape' to an open position and return, with 'changé' indicating the feet swap places.\"\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Assemblé',\n            'changes_feet': True, # In its most common forms, like dessus (over) or dessous (under).\n            'travels': True,\n            'description': \"A traveling jump from one foot to two, where the feet are 'assembled' and typically change position.\"\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Glissade derrière',\n            'changes_feet': False,\n            'travels': True,\n            'description': \"A gliding, traveling step.
