    This function solves the riddle by identifying the correct Father Brown story and place names.

    explanation = """
The riddle points to G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown story, "The Arrow of Heaven".

The clues in the riddle are:
1. A character commits a misdeed for another's sake (a man murders for the woman he loves).
2. Father Brown disapproves of this act.
3. The story involves a reflection on love that has been transformed or corrupted.
4. Father Brown mentions two place names that begin with paired consonants.

In "The Arrow of Heaven", Father Brown investigates a murder at Cray House, which is located near the village of Crook-in-the-Hollow. He explicitly comments on the names:

"I mean that the name of the house is Cray, and the name of the village is Crook... it is a curious coincidence, is it not, that the two names should be so much alike?"

Both place names begin with the paired consonant 'Cr'.

    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation))
