    "This is a knowledge-based question from biochemistry. The core of the problem is to identify the most potent integrin-binding peptide from a list of options. All peptides contain the minimal RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) motif, which is necessary for binding. However, the amino acids flanking this motif significantly influence the binding affinity and specificity.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that uses a predefined \"knowledge base\" to identify the correct peptide. This knowledge base will contain sequences known to be effective integrin binders. The script will then iterate through the given choices and check them against this database.\n\n1.  **Define the choices:** I will create a dictionary to hold the answer choices and their corresponding peptide sequences.\n2.  **Create a knowledge base:** I will create a list containing peptide sequences that are well-documented in scientific literature as high-affinity integrin binders. The sequence RGDSPSS is derived from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein and a natural, potent ligand for several integrins (e.g., α5β1). Therefore, it's the most likely candidate.\n3.  **Iterate and check:** The script will loop through the peptide choices and check if any of them are present in the knowledge base.\n4.  **Print the result:** The script will print the analysis for each peptide and then state the final conclusion, identifying the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to identify the one\n    most likely to bind an integrin receptor based on a known motif.\n    \"\"\"\n    # All choices contain the core RGD motif.
