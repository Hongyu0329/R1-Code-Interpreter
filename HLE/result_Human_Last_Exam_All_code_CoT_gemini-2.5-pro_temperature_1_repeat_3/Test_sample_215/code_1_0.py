# Plan:
# The R script simulates two groups of specimens, 'control' and 'water_stress'.
# To determine the number of expected chemotypes, we must analyze the data generation process for each group.
#
# 1. Within the `generate_chemistry` function, all specimens are initially drawn from the same set of statistical distributions.
# 2. A single `baseline` vector is created for the entire group.
# 3. This same `baseline` is then subtracted from every specimen in that group.
#
# This process ensures that all specimens within a single group (like 'control') are simply noisy variations of one another,
# belonging to a single statistical population. Therefore, they constitute a single chemotype.
# The same logic applies independently to the 'water_stress' group.
#
# The code below will state and print the number of chemotypes for each group based on this analysis.

# Number of chemotypes expected for the control group
num_chemotypes_control = 1

# Number of chemotypes expected for the water stressed group
num_chemotypes_water_stress = 1

print(f"Based on the script's logic, the number of chemotypes for the control group should be: {num_chemotypes_control}")
print(f"Based on the script's logic, the number of chemotypes for the water stressed group should be: {num_chemotypes_water_stress}")
