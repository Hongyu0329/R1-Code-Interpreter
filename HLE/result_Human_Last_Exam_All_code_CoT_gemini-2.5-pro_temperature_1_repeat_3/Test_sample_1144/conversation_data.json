    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles and formulas.**\n    *   We need Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) from the given uncertainty in position (Δx). The principle states: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n    *   We need the formula for the momentum (p) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1). From the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized (L = nħ), and for the first orbit, the momentum is given by p = ħ / a₀, where a₀ is the Bohr radius.\n\n2.  **Derive the formula for the required ratio.**\n    *   The ratio is Δp / p.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from step 1: Ratio = [ħ / (2 * Δx)] / [ħ / a₀].\n    *   The reduced Planck constants (ħ) cancel out, simplifying the formula to: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n\n3.  **Gather the constants and given values.**\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m. We will use a more precise value from Python's `scipy.constants` library.\n\n4.  **Write a Python script to perform the calculation.**\n    *   The script will define the values for a₀ and Δx.\n    *   It will calculate the ratio using the simplified formula from step 2.\n    *   It will print the derivation steps, the final equation with the numerical values, and the final result, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum \n# to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n# --- Given values and Constants ---\n# The uncertainty in position is given as 10 pm.\n# 1 pm = 1e-12 m\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# The Bohr radius (a₀) is a physical constant.
