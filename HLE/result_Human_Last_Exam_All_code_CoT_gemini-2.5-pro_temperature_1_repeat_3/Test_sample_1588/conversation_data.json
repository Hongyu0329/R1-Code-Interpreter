    "To find the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The BCH formula, `log(e^X e^Y)`, is an infinite series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`. The number of linearly independent terms of a given order `n` corresponds to the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (`X` and `Y`).\n\nThis dimension is given by Witt's formula:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order of the terms (in our case, `n = 10`).\n*   `k` is the number of generators (in our case, `k = 2`, for `X` and `Y`).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify parameters**: `n = 10`, `k = 2`.\n2.  **Find the divisors of `n=10`**: These are `d = 1, 2, 5, 10`.\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor**:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime factor)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime factor)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is a product of 2 distinct prime factors)\n4.  **Calculate `k^(n/d)` for each divisor**:\n    *   `d=1`: `2^(10/1) = 2^10 = 1024`\n    *   `d=2`: `2^(10/2) = 2^5 = 32`\n    *   `d=5`: `2^(10/5) = 2^2 = 4`\n    *   `d=10`: `2^(10/10) = 2^1 = 2`\n5.  **Apply Witt's formula**: Sum the terms `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` and divide by `n`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints each step of the formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Moebius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_term_count(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-zero coefficients of order n for k generators\n    using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum_val = 0\n    \n    # For printing the formula\n    formula_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n//d)\n        term_val = mu_d * power_val\n        total_sum_val += term_val\n        \n        formula_terms.append(f\"({mu_d}) * {k}**({n//d})\")\n        value_terms.append(f\"{term_val}\")\n\n    result = total_sum_val // n\n    \n    print(\"The number of non-zero coefficients is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * {k}^({n}/d)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Calculation steps:\")\n    # Print the expanded formula with all numbers\n    formula_str = \" + \".join(formula_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( {formula_str} )\")\n    \n    # Print the formula with evaluated powers\n    value_str = \" + \".join(value_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( {value_str} )\")\n\n    # Print the sum\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum_val}\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {total_sum_val // n}\")\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is: {result}\")\n    \n# For the specific problem: n=10, k=2\nn = 10\nk = 2\ncalculate_bch_term_count(n, k)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
