    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the given membership values. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define two variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values. The formula is `activation_level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`.\n3.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values for the fuzzy set\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a type of binary operation used in fuzzy logic to model a logical conjunction (AND).\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which we will use here.\n# The rule activation level is calculated by applying the t-norm to the given values.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n# Print the calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k}, {mu_G}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
