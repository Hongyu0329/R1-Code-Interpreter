    "To develop an analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for a small $\\epsilon$, we can analyze the behavior of the integrand.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the integrand**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the term $\\epsilon$ is very small. The denominator becomes small if the polynomial part, $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$, is also small.\n2.  **Identify the dominant region**: The polynomial $f(x)$ is zero at $x=0$. For $x > 0$, $f(x)$ is positive and increasing. Therefore, the integrand becomes very large only in a small region near $x=0$. This means the main contribution to the integral's value comes from this region.\n3.  **Approximate the integrand**: For small $x$ (i.e., near $x=0$), the term with the lowest power of $x$ in the polynomial dominates. So, we can approximate $f(x)$ by its leading term: $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n4.  **Approximate the integral**: We can now replace $f(x)$ with its approximation in the integral. Furthermore, because the contribution from larger $x$ values is negligible (as the integrand becomes very small), we can extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ to simplify the calculation. This yields:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n5.  **Solve the simplified integral**: This integral can be solved using a scaling substitution. Let $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} u$. This transforms the integral into a standard form:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9.0^{1/5} \\epsilon^{4/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+u^5}du$.\n6.  **Evaluate the constant**: The definite integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+u^n}du$ has a known solution: $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For our case, $n=5.0$, so the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n7.  **Final Formula**: Combining these results, we get the analytical approximation:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n    This is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-p}$. The following Python code will calculate the numerical values for the coefficient `C` and the exponent `p`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the constants for the analytical approximation of the integral I(epsilon).\n    The approximation has the form I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^(-p).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the dominant term in the denominator polynomial, a*x^p\n    a = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n\n    # The exponent of epsilon in the approximation\n    p = (n - 1) / n\n\n    # The coefficient C in the approximation\n    # C = (pi / n) / (a^(1/n) * sin(pi/n))\n    C = (math.pi / n) / (a**(1/n) * math.sin(math.pi / n))\n\n    print(\"The analytical formula for I(epsilon) in the small epsilon regime is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^(-p)\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated values for the constants:\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient C is: {C}\")\n    print(f\"The exponent p is: {p}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThus, the final approximate formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {C} * epsilon^(-{p})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0.688843906233215>>>"
