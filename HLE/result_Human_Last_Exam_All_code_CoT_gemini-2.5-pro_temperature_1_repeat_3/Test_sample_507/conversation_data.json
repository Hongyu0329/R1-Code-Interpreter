    "This is a fascinating linguistic puzzle. The key to solving it is understanding that words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across completely unrelated languages. This is because they are \"nursery words,\" formed from the simple sounds babies make first (like /m/, /p/, /b/, /a/). Therefore, the real challenge is finding a matching word for a cultural item like \"broom.\"\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify two languages from geographically distant and culturally separate parts of Asia to satisfy the \"no direct contact\" rule. I will choose Malay (an Austronesian language from Southeast Asia) and Turkish (a Turkic language from West Asia).\n2.  Compare the words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" in these languages, focusing on both formal and informal/nursery words.\n3.  Compare the word for \"broom.\" Here, the similarity might not be in the full noun itself but in the verb root from which the noun is derived (i.e., the word for \"to sweep\").\n4.  Present these findings in a Python script that prints the explanation and the comparison.\n\n```python\ndef find_similar_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies two languages from different Asian cultures with no direct contact\n    that share similar words for \"mom,\" \"dad,\" and \"broom.\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n    lang1 = \"Malay\"\n    lang2 = \"Turkish\"\n    culture1 = \"Maritime Southeast Asia\"\n    culture2 = \"Anatolia / West Asia\"\n\n    print(f\"The two languages are {lang1} and {lang2}.\")\n    print(f\"These languages are from two distant Asian cultures ({culture1} and {culture2})\")\n    print(\"with unrelated linguistic origins (Austronesian and Turkic) and no significant direct historical contact.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"\\nHere is the word comparison:\\n\")\n\n    # Mom\n    mom1 = \"Mama\"\n    mom2 = \"Mama\"\n    print(f\"1.
