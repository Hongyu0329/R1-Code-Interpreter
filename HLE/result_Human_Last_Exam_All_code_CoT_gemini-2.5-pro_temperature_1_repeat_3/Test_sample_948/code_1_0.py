# This script prints the numbers of the properties that the system has
# in the limit of time towards infinity, based on the physical analysis.

# The analysis concluded that the following properties hold:
# 1) Zero tunneling
# 2) Zero particles
# 3) Zero losses
# 6) Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations
