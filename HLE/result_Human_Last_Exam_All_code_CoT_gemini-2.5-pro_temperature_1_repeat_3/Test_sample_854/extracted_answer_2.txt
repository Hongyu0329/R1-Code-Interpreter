The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence because their Quality Control test was fundamentally flawed. They misinterpreted the "no growth" result on the Batch 3 control plate as proof that the antibiotic was working. In reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the test bacteria (*Bacillus subtilis*) failed to grow for other reasons (e.g., non-viable culture or suboptimal growth media), a flaw their test was not designed to detect.
