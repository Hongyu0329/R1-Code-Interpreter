    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the number's representation in scientific notation, which is of the form $d \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le d < 10$. The first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are the first two digits of $d$.\n\nHere is the plan to find the value of $d$:\n1.  Let $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We will work with the base-10 logarithm of $N$.\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n2.  We can express $\\log_{10}(N)$ as the sum of an integer part $k$ and a fractional part $m$ (the mantissa), where $0 \\le m < 1$. So, $\\log_{10}(N) = k + m$.\n3.  From the properties of logarithms, we can write $N = 10^{k+m} = 10^m \\times 10^k$.\n4.  By definition, the number $d$ in the scientific notation of $N$ is $10^m$. Since $0 \\le m < 1$, we have $1 \\le 10^m < 10$, which matches the condition for $d$.\n5.  The value of $7^{13}$ is very large, so we need to perform the calculation with high precision to get an accurate value for the mantissa $m$. We will use Python's `decimal` library for this purpose.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the value of $d$ and extract its first two digits.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations. 50 digits should be sufficient.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n    # Let N = e^(-7^13). We want to find the first two non-zero digits of N.\n    # We can write N in scientific notation: N = d * 10^k, where 1 <= d < 10.\n    # The digits of d are the non-zero digits of N.\n    # To find d, we use logarithms:\n    # log10(N) = log10(d) + k\n    # By convention, the mantissa of a logarithm is the positive fractional part.\n    # Let log10(N) = floor(log10(N)) + m, where m is the mantissa (0 <= m < 1).\n    # Then log10(d) = m.\n    # So, d = 10^m.\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the value of the exponent, 7^13.\n    # This can be done with standard integer arithmetic.\n    exponent_val = 7**13\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e) using the decimal library.\n    # We need decimal.Decimal(1).exp() to get a high-precision value of e.\n    log_N = -decimal.Decimal(exponent_val) * decimal.Decimal(1).exp().log10()\n\n    # Step 3: Find the mantissa m of log10(N).\n    # m = log10(N) - floor(log10(N))\n    k = log_N.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\n    m = log_N - k\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate d = 10^m. This will be the significand.\n    d = decimal.Decimal(10)**m\n\n    # The final equation giving the significand is d = 10^m.\n    # We print the numbers involved in this equation.\n    print(f\"The number is N = e^(-7^13). In scientific notation, N = d * 10^k.\")\n    print(f\"The significand 'd' is given by the equation: d = 10^m\")\n    print(f\"where m is the mantissa of log10(N).\")\n    print(f\"The value of the mantissa m is: {m}\")\n    print(f\"The value of the significand d is: {d}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Extract the first two digits from d.\n    # Since 1 <= d < 10, d will be a string like \"1.555...\".\n    # The first digit is at index 0, and the second is at index 2 (after the decimal point).\n    d_str = str(d)\n    first_digit = d_str[0]\n    second_digit = d_str[2]\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"The first non-zero digit is: {first_digit}\")\n    print(f\"The second non-zero digit is: {second_digit}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
