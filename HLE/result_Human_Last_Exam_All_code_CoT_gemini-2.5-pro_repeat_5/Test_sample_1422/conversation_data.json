    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we need to use the topological relations that govern the structure of these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and its Properties:** We'll assume the most common type of interacting scalar field theory, which is the **$\\phi^4$ theory**. In this theory, each interaction vertex involves four field lines (propagators).\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** There are two key formulas that relate the number of vertices (V), internal lines (I), external lines (E), and loops (L) in a connected Feynman diagram.\n    *   The number of loops is given by: `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   A vertex counting rule: `k * V = 2 * I + E`, where `k` is the number of lines per vertex (`k=4` for $\\phi^4$ theory).\n3.  **Set the Goal:** We are given that the number of loops `L = 2`. We want to find the minimum possible integer value for `V`. Since the problem asks for *a* diagram, we are free to choose the number of external lines (`E`) to find the absolute minimum for `V`.\n4.  **Systematic Search:** We can write a script to search for the smallest `V` (starting from `V=1`) for which we can find a non-negative integer `I` (number of internal lines) and a non-negative integer `E` (number of external lines) that satisfy both formulas simultaneously. The first value of `V` that yields a valid solution will be the minimum.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this search. It will first check `V=1` and see if a valid number of internal and external lines exists to form a two-loop diagram.\n\n```python\ndef find_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory (assumed to be phi^4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Setup ---\n    # L: Number of loops\n    # k: Number of lines per vertex (4 for phi^4 theory)\n    L_target = 2\n    k = 4\n\n    print(\"Goal: Find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a Feynman diagram with L=2 loops.\")\n    print(\"Assumption: The theory is a phi^4 scalar theory, so each vertex connects k=4 lines.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe topological relations for a connected diagram are:\")\n    print(\"1.
