def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function explains and prints the solution to the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of
    max({lambda, mu}) - lambda, where lambda and mu are specific cardinal numbers.

    1.  lambda is the minimal size of a family of functions F from kappa to kappa
        such that for any g, some f in F agrees with g on kappa-many points.
        This is a known cardinal characteristic, and lambda = 2**kappa.

    2.  mu is the minimal size of a family of functions G from kappa+ to kappa+
        such that for any h, some g in G agrees with h on at least kappa-many points.
        Results by Shelah show that mu > kappa+. The maximum possible value for mu
        in ZFC is 2**(kappa+).

    3.  The expression max({lambda, mu}) - lambda evaluates to mu if mu > lambda,
        and 0 otherwise.

    4.  To maximize this value, we need a model of set theory where mu is maximized
        and mu > lambda. It is a theorem that 2**kappa < 2**(kappa+). It is
        consistent with ZFC to have a model where mu = 2**(kappa+).
        In such a model, mu > lambda.

    5.  Therefore, the maximum possible value for the expression is the maximum
        possible value for mu, which is 2**(kappa+).
