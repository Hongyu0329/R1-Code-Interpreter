    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button, we need to analyze a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) opening range for that position, making a key adjustment for the rake-free environment.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Context:** We are in the most powerful pre-flop position (the button) in a 100BB cash game. Our primary goal with a 2.5x raise is to steal the 1.5BB in the pot from the blinds.\n2.  **Consider the Rake-Free Aspect:** In a normal game, the house takes a small percentage (rake) from most pots. In a rake-free game, the reward for stealing the blinds is higher, and our equity in post-flop pots is not diminished. This provides a strong incentive to play a wider, more aggressive range of hands.\n3.  **Analyze Suited Jacks (Jxs):** We will list all suited jack combinations, from strongest to weakest. The hands like AJs, KJs, QJs, and JTs are premium and always opened. The question is how far down the list we should go.\n4.  **Consult GTO Strategy:** Modern poker solvers have calculated optimal opening ranges. For the button, these ranges are already very wide (often 45-50% of hands). In a rake-free environment, these ranges expand even further. Aggressive GTO models show that due to the combination of high-card value, flush potential, and supreme positional advantage, it is profitable to open *all* suited jacks.\n5.  **Identify the Worst Hand:** Based on this, the \"worst\" suited jack that is still a profitable open-raise is the weakest one possible: Jack-Two suited.\n\nThe following Python code will define the list of suited jacks and print the correct answer based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free game.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of all suited jack hands, ordered from strongest to weakest.\n    # The ranking is based on the value of the second card and overall playability.\n    suited_jacks = [\n        \"AJs\", \"KJs\", \"QJs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\",\n        \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # In a 100BB rake-free game, a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy from the button\n    # is extremely aggressive. The absence of rake increases the profitability of\n    # stealing the blinds and playing in position.\n    #\n    # Because of this, modern poker solvers show that it is correct to open\n    # a very wide range of hands, including the entire category of suited jacks.\n    # The combination of flush potential and positional advantage makes even the\n    # weakest suited jack a profitable open-raise.\n    worst_hand_to_open = suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_hand_to_open}\")\n\nfind_worst_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
