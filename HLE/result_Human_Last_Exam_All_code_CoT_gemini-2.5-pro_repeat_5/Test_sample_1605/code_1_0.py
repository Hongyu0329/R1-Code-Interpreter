# This problem is a conceptual question in topology and graph theory, not a computational one.
# The solution involves logical reasoning about the properties of spaces.
# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces
# with a disconnection number of four.
# Based on topological analysis, there are two such classes of spaces.
#
# 1. The Triod: A space homeomorphic to the letter 'Y', consisting of three
#    arcs meeting at a single point.
#    - Removing the 3 endpoints leaves the space connected.
#    - Removing any 4 points disconnects it.
#    - Thus, its disconnection number is 4.
#
# 2. The Theta-space: A space homeomorphic to the Greek letter 'theta' (Î¸),
#    consisting of two points joined by three distinct arcs.
#    - Removing 3 points from a single arc leaves the space connected.
#    - Removing any 4 points disconnects it.
#    - Thus, its disconnection number is 4.
#
# These are the only two such fundamental structures.

number_of_classes = 2
print(f"The number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces with disconnection number equal to four is {number_of_classes}.")
# The question is a mathematical riddle. The final answer is an integer.
# The code block is used to present the final answer clearly as requested.
# The equation is simply stating the result of the derivation.
