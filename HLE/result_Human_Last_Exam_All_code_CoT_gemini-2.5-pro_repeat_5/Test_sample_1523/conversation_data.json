    "Of course. Let's break down this problem in finite-temperature field theory step-by-step to find the expression for the inner product `(φ, Dφ)`.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Partition Function:** In finite-temperature quantum field theory, physical properties are derived from the partition function, `Z`. For a neutral scalar field `φ`, `Z` is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations:\n    `Z = ∫ Dφ exp(-S[φ])`\n    Here, `S[φ]` is the Euclidean action, and the theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime where time is imaginary, `t -> -iτ`. At a finite temperature `T`, this imaginary time `τ` is compactified on a circle with circumference `β = 1/T`.\n\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action:** The Euclidean action `S[φ]` for a neutral scalar field with mass `m` and a potential `V(φ)` is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, `L_E`:\n    `S[φ] = ∫ d⁴x_E L_E = ∫ d⁴x_E [ 1/2 (∂_μ φ)² + 1/2 m² φ² + V(φ) ]`\n    The term `(∂_μ φ)²` is shorthand for `(∂_τ φ)² + (∇φ)²`, and the integral `∫ d⁴x_E` is `∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x`.\n\n3.  **Isolate the Quadratic Part:** The inner product `(φ, Dφ)` is associated with the quadratic (or free) part of the action, which we'll call `S_quad`. This is the part of the action that only contains terms of order `φ²`.\n    `S_quad[φ] = ∫ d⁴x_E [ 1/2 (∂_μ φ)² + 1/2 m² φ² ]`\n\n4.  **Identify the Operator D:** To find the operator `D`, we want to write `S_quad` in the form `1/2 (φ, Dφ)`, where the inner product `(A, B)` is defined as `∫ d⁴x_E A(x)B(x)`. We can achieve this by applying integration by parts to the kinetic term `(∂_μ φ)²`:\n    `∫ d⁴x_E (∂_μ φ)² = - ∫ d⁴x_E φ (∂_μ² φ)`\n    (The boundary terms vanish due to the periodic boundary conditions on `τ` and the assumption that the field vanishes at spatial infinity).\n    Substituting this back into `S_quad`:\n    `S_quad[φ] = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x_E [ -φ (∂_μ² φ) + m² φ² ] = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x_E φ(x) [ (-∂_μ² + m²) φ(x) ]`\n    Comparing this to the form `S_quad = 1/2 (φ, Dφ) = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x_E φ(Dφ)`, we can directly identify the operator `D` as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    `D = -∂_μ² + m²`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Inner Product (φ, Dφ):** With the operator `D` identified, we can now write the expression for the inner product:\n    `(φ, Dφ) = ∫ d⁴x_E φ(x) (Dφ)(x) = ∫ d⁴x_E φ (-∂_μ² + m²) φ`\n    Using integration by parts in reverse on this expression (or simply by looking at the original form of `S_quad`), we arrive at the final, more common form:\n    `(φ, Dφ) = ∫ d⁴x_E [ (∂_μ φ)² + m² φ² ]`\n    This expression is equivalent to twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, `2 * S_quad[φ]`.\n\nThe following Python code will print this final result in a clear, formatted way.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the mathematical expression for the inner product\n    (φ, Dφ) in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    The expression includes all relevant numbers (exponents and dimensions)\n    as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the equation using strings with unicode for clarity\n    lhs = \"(φ, Dφ)\"\n    integral_sign = \"∫\"\n    differential = \"d⁴x_E\"\n    \n    # Integrand terms: (∂_μ φ)² + m²φ²\n    partial_mu_phi_sq = \"(∂_μ φ)²\"\n    m_sq_phi_sq = \"m²φ²\"\n    \n    integrand = f\"[{partial_mu_phi_sq} + {m_sq_phi_sq}]\"\n    \n    # Assemble the final equation string\n    full_equation = f\"{lhs} = {integral_sign} {differential} {integrand}\"\n    \n    print(\"In the functional integral representation for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature,\")\n    print(\"the inner product (φ, Dφ) is given by the following expression:\")\n    \n    # Print a formatted box around the equation\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * (len(full_equation) + 4))\n    print(f\"  {full_equation}  \")\n    print(\"=\" * (len(full_equation) + 4) + \"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - φ: The neutral scalar field.\")\n    print(\"  - D: The Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, defined as D = -∂_μ² + m².\")\n    print(\"  - ∂_μ: The four-gradient in Euclidean spacetime.\")\n    print(\"  - m: The mass of the scalar field.\")\n    print(\"  - ∫ d⁴x_E: The integral over 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime.\")\n    print(\"  - The numbers in the equation are 4 (for the spacetime dimension) and 2 (for the exponents).\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\nprint_inner_product_expression()\n```\n<<<(φ, Dφ) = ∫ d⁴x_E [ (∂_μ φ)² + m² φ² ]>>>"
