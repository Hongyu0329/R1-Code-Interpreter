# The chemical formula for the chassis of the original nanocar is C44H26.
# This information is based on the work by James Tour's group at Rice University.
num_hydrogen_atoms_in_chassis = 26

# The term "perfluoro" means all hydrogen (H) atoms are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.
# The wheels of the nanocar are C60 fullerenes, which have no hydrogen atoms to replace.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is equal to the
# number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar's chassis.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms_in_chassis

# Final equation showing the substitution.
