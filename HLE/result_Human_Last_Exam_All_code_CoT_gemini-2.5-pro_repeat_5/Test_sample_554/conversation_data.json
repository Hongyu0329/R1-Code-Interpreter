    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need to identify the chemical structure of the original nanocar. The nanocar developed by Prof. James Tour's group at Rice University has a chassis with the chemical formula C44H26. The term \"perfluoro\" in chemistry means that all the hydrogen atoms in an organic compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar, we simply need to count the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar's chassis and replace them with fluorine atoms. The wheels, which are C60 fullerenes, contain no hydrogen atoms and are thus unaffected by this process.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation:\n```python\n# The chemical formula for the chassis of the original nanocar is C44H26.\n# This information is based on the work by James Tour's group at Rice University.\nnum_hydrogen_atoms_in_chassis = 26\n\n# The term \"perfluoro\" means all hydrogen (H) atoms are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n# The wheels of the nanocar are C60 fullerenes, which have no hydrogen atoms to replace.\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is equal to the\n# number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar's chassis.\nnum_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms_in_chassis\n\n# Final equation showing the substitution.\nprint(\"To create a hypothetical perfluoronanocar from a nanocar (chassis formula C44H26),\")\nprint(\"we replace all hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms.\")\nprint(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms in original nanocar = {num_hydrogen_atoms_in_chassis}\")\nprint(f\"Number of fluorine atoms in perfluoronanocar = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<26>>>"
