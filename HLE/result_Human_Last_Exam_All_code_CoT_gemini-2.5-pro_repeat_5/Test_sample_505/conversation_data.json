    "To solve this, we first need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in the surface code. The number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is laid out.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the topology**: The problem describes \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". A \"patch\" implies a planar surface, which has a topological genus (g) of 0. The most reasonable interpretation that maximizes the qubit count is that *each* of the two patches has two holes. A \"hole\" in this context is a boundary.\n2.  **Use the formula**: The number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded on a single connected surface is given by the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`, where `g` is the genus and `b` is the number of boundaries (holes).\n3.  **Calculate for one patch**: We will apply the formula for a single patch with `g=0` and `b=2`.\n4.  **Calculate the total**: Since we have two identical, independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n5.  **Construct the Python script**: The script will perform these calculations and print the steps clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_surface_code_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in\n    two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
