    "My plan is to identify the radical for the kanji 謄 and provide its Hepburn transcription by programmatically extracting the information from a reliable online Japanese dictionary.\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** I will use the online dictionary Jisho.org as the data source due to its comprehensive and well-structured kanji information.\n2.  **Web Scraping:** I'll write a Python script to perform web scraping.\n3.  **Fetch Data:** The script will use the `requests` library to download the HTML content of the Jisho.org page for the character 謄.\n4.  **Parse Data:** The `BeautifulSoup` library will be used to parse the fetched HTML.\n5.  **Locate Information:** I will navigate the parsed HTML to find the \"Radical:\" section.\n6.  **Extract and Process:** I'll extract the text containing the radical's name. Jisho often provides multiple readings (e.g., \"nikuniku, nikuzuki\"). The name 'nikuzuki' is the specific term for the 月 radical when it originates from 肉 ('meat'), which is the case for 謄. The script will isolate this name.\n7.  **Output:** The script will print the final answer, capitalized to match the format of the example provided (\"Onnahen\").\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the bushu/radical for the character 謄 by scraping Jisho.org\n    and prints its name in Hepburn transcription.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = '謄'\n    \n    try:\n        # The URL for the specific kanji page on Jisho.org\n        url = f\"https://jisho.org/search/{kanji}%20%23kanji\"\n        headers = {\n            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'\n        }\n\n        # Send a request to the website\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n\n        # Parse the HTML content\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n        # Find the 'dt' element with the text 'Radical:'\n        # Using regex to ignore potential whitespace\n        radical_label = soup.find('dt', string=re.compile(r'\\s*Radical:\\s*'))\n\n        if radical_label:\n            # The radical name is in the next 'dd' element\n            radical_data = radical_label.find_next_sibling('dd')\n            if radical_data:\n                # The text is structured like: '肉 nikuniku, nikuzuki'\n                # We extract the full text, strip whitespace\n                full_text = radical_data.get_text(strip=True)\n                \n                # The first character is the radical symbol, we remove it\n                readings_part = full_text[1:]\n                \n                # Split readings by comma and take the last one, which is often the most specific name\n                radical_name = readings_part.split(',')[-1].strip()\n                \n                # Capitalize the first letter as in the example \"Onnahen\"\n                final_answer = radical_name.capitalize()\n                \n                print(final_answer)\n                return\n\n        print(\"Could not find the radical information.\")\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
