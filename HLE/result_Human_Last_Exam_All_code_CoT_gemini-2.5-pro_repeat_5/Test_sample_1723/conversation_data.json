    "My plan is to address the user's question by first acknowledging the premise. The question asks for a specific genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print. While it is a common belief, and some mushrooms are themselves blue, a true blue spore print is not a known characteristic in the fungal kingdom.\n\nHowever, there is one genus that is famously and distinctly blue, which often leads to the misconception that its spore print is also blue. I will write a Python script to identify and print the name of this genus, as it is the most likely answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_blue_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the mushroom genus most likely being referred to\n    by the user's question.\n\n    The question states there is a single genus of mushroom known for a\n    distinctly blue spore print. This is a common mycological misconception.\n    While no mushroom is known to produce a true blue spore print, the genus\n    Lactarius contains species, most famously Lactarius indigo, which are\n    themselves distinctly blue and exude a blue latex. This often leads to\n    the incorrect assumption that their spore print is also blue.\n\n    Therefore, Lactarius is the most probable answer to the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the genus famed for its blue color.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom known for its distinct blue coloration, often mistaken for having a blue spore print, is: {genus_name}\")\n\nfind_blue_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
