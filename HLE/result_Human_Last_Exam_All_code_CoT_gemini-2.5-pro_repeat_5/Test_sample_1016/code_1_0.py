import math

# --- Parameters ---
# c: Propagation speed of the wave
# T: The time instant up to which convergence is required
# M: The size of the overlap between subdomains (M = b - a)

# Let's use some example values to demonstrate the calculation.
c = 1.5  # Propagation speed
T = 7.0  # Final time
M = 2.0  # Overlap size

# --- Calculation ---
# The formula for the number of iterations 'k' is: k = ceil((c * T) / M)
# This is because each iteration effectively resolves the solution over a
# distance equivalent to the overlap size M. We need to cover the
# total characteristic distance 'c*T' for the given time interval.

# Calculate the ratio
ratio = (c * T) / M

# Calculate the number of iterations using the ceiling function
iterations = math.ceil(ratio)

# --- Output ---
