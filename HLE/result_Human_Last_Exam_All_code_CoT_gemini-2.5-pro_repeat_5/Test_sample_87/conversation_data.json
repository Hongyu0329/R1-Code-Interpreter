    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible value of the conditional mutual information `I(X;Y|W)`. We will use fundamental identities from information theory to express `I(X;Y|W)` in terms of the given quantities and then find the tightest possible upper bound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Express `I(X;Y|W)` in terms of knowns:** We will use information theory identities to relate `I(X;Y|W)` to the given values `I(X;Y)`, `I(X;Y|Z)`, and `I(X;Z|Y)`. The fact that `W` is a deterministic function of `Z` (`H(W|Z)=0`) is a crucial piece of information. This will result in an equation for `I(X;Y|W)` that includes one unknown term, `I(X;W|Y)`.\n2.  **Constrain the unknown term:** We will establish a second identity relating the variables. By combining this with the first identity, we can derive a relationship between `I(X;W)` and `I(X;W|Y)`.\n3.  **Use the non-negativity of mutual information:** The fundamental property that mutual information cannot be negative (`I(A;B) >= 0`) will be applied to the relationship derived in step 2. This will give us a lower bound on the unknown term `I(X;W|Y)`.\n4.  **Maximize `I(X;Y|W)`:** To find the largest possible value of `I(X;Y|W)`, we will use its expression from step 1 and the minimum possible value of `I(X;W|Y)` found in step 3.\n5.  **Calculate the final value:** We will substitute the given numerical values into our derived formulas to compute the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given values\nI_X_Y = 3\nI_X_Y_cond_Z = 2\nI_X_Z_cond_Y = 5\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Derive and calculate the minimum possible value for the unknown term I(X;W|Y).\n# Based on information theory identities, we can derive two key equations:\n# 1) I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y)\n# 2) I(X;W) = I(X;Y) + 2 * I(X;W|Y) - (I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y))\n#\n# From the non-negativity of mutual information, we know I(X;W) >= 0.\n# Applying this to the second equation gives us a lower bound for I(X;W|Y):\n# I(X;Y) + 2 * I(X;W|Y) - I(X;Y|Z) - I(X;Z|Y) >= 0\n# 2 * I(X;W|Y) >= I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y)\n# min_I(X;W|Y) = (I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y)) / 2\n\nmin_I_X_W_cond_Y = (I_X_Y_cond_Z + I_X_Z_cond_Y - I_X_Y) / 2\n\nprint(\"To find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), we first find the minimum possible value of I(X;W|Y).\")\nprint(f\"min I(X;W|Y) = (I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y)) / 2\")\nprint(f\"min I(X;W|Y) = ({I_X_Y_cond_Z} + {I_X_Z_cond_Y} - {I_X_Y}) / 2 = {min_I_X_W_cond_Y}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Calculate the maximum value of I(X;Y|W).\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W) in equation (1), we must use the minimum possible value of I(X;W|Y).\n# max_I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - min_I(X;W|Y)\n\nmax_I_X_Y_cond_W = I_X_Y_cond_Z + I_X_Z_cond_Y - min_I_X_W_cond_Y\n\nprint(\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is then calculated using this minimum.\")\nprint(f\"max I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|Y) - min I(X;W|Y)\")\nprint(f\"max I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_Y_cond_Z} + {I_X_Z_cond_Y} - {min_I_X_W_cond_Y} = {max_I_X_Y_cond_W}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {max_I_X_Y_cond_W}\")\n```\n<<<5.0>>>"
