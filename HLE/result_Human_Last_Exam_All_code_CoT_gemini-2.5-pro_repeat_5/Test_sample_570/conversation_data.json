    "This is a classic problem in convex geometry. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Establish a lower bound:** I will find a minimum possible value for the area. I'll do this by considering a few specific lines from the family `px + qy = 1`. These lines will impose constraints on the size of the convex domain, specifically on its \"width\" in the x and y directions. Using a known geometric inequality relating a convex set's area to its widths, I will derive a lower bound for the area.\n\n2.  **Construct a candidate shape:** I will propose a specific convex shape and calculate its area. The goal is to find a shape whose area matches the lower bound found in the first step. A diamond shape defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1` is a good candidate.\n\n3.  **Verify the candidate:** I will prove that the proposed shape from step 2 indeed intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. This will confirm that the shape is a valid solution.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the area of the constructed shape matches the calculated lower bound, it must be the minimal possible area.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, explaining the reasoning and calculating the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the minimal area of a convex domain intersecting all lines px+qy=1 for coprime p, q.\n\n    The solution is derived in two main steps:\n    1.
