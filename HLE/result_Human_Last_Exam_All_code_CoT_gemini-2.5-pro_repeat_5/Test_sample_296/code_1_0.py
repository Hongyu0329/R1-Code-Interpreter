    This script calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.

    # Part 1: Normal subgroups of index 4
    # A normal subgroup N of index 4 means the quotient G/N is a group of order 4.
    # The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is (Z/2Z)^3. This means any
    # abelian quotient must have exponent 2. The only group of order 4 with this
    # property is the Klein four-group, V_4 = (Z/2Z)^2.
    # The number of normal subgroups with V_4 as a quotient is equal to the
    # number of 1-dimensional subspaces in the 3-dimensional vector space F_2^3.

    # Part 2: Non-normal subgroups of index 4
    # A non-normal subgroup H of index 4 corresponds to a transitive permutation
    # representation of G on 4 elements. The image of this representation must be
    # a transitive 2-subgroup of the symmetric group S_4. For H to be non-normal,
    # the image must be the dihedral group D_8.
    # This means the core of H, denoted K, is a normal subgroup of G such that G/K is D_8.
    # The number of such subgroups K is a known result from the study of the
    # Grigorchuk group.

    # For each G/K isomorphic to D_8, the number of subgroups of index 4 in G
    # corresponds to the number of subgroups of index 4 in D_8 with a trivial core.
    # These are subgroups of order 2. There are 4 such subgroups in D_8.
    num_subgroups_per_d8_quotient = 4
    
    num_non_normal_subgroups = num_d8_quotients * num_subgroups_per_d8_quotient
