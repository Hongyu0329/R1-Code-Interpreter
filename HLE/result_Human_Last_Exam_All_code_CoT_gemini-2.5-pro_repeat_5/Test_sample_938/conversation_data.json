    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the recurrence relation for $a_n$**: The recurrence is $a_n = 88a_{n-3} + 57a_{n-4}$. The characteristic equation is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. This polynomial can be factored into $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$.\n2.  **Find the roots**: The roots are:\n    *   From $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$: $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    *   From $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$: $x = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n3.  **Determine asymptotic behavior**: The root with the largest absolute value is the dominant root, $R = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$. For large $n$, the sequence behaves as $a_n \\sim C \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^n$ for some constant $C$. Since the initial values are not all zero, we can expect $C \\neq 0$.\n4.  **Simplify the sum $s_n$**: The expression for $s_n$ is complex. Let's analyze the second sum's term:\n    $V_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\n    By computing the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$, we can discover a hidden identity.\n    $a_0=1, a_1=0, a_2=0, a_3=88, a_4=57, a_5=0, a_6=88^2, a_7=2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57, a_8=57^2, a_9=88^3, \\dots$\n    Checking for $k=6$, we find $V_6 = a_7a_4 + a_8a_3 = (2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57)(57) + (57^2)(88) = 3 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57^2$, which is exactly $a_{11}$.\n    Checking for $k=7$, we find $V_7 = a_9a_4 + a_{10}a_3 = (88^3)(57) + (3 \\cdot 88^2 \\cdot 57)(88) = 4 \\cdot 88^3 \\cdot 57$, which is exactly $a_{13}$.\n    The identity appears to be $V_k = a_{2k-1}$ for $k \\ge 6$.\n5.  **Apply the identity**: Substituting this into the expression for $s_n$:\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}a_{2k-1}$.\n    The sums involving the fastest-growing terms are $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$ and $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$.\n    Let's write them out:\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} = a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    The difference is exactly $a_9$.\n    So, the expression for $s_n$ simplifies to:\n    $s_n = a_9 + \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$.\n6.  **Calculate the limit**: Now we need to find $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$.\n    For large $n$, $s_n$ is dominated by the sums. Both are sums of terms that grow geometrically. The sum is dominated by its largest term.\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100}$ goes up to the term $a_{n+100}$.\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+51}$ goes up to the term $a_{n+51}$.\n    The term $a_{n+100}$ is asymptotically larger. Therefore, $s_n \\sim 2 \\cdot C \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^{n+100}$.\n    $\\ln(s_n) \\sim \\ln(2C) + (n+100)\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n    $\\frac{\\ln(s_n)}{n} \\sim \\frac{\\ln(2C)}{n} + \\frac{n+100}{n}\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n    As $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the limit is $L = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n7.  **Compute the final value**: We need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L$. We can use Python to calculate this value precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem simplifies to finding the limit L = ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n# We then need to compute the integer part of 10000 * L.\n\n# Define the numbers in the final calculation\nten_thousand = 10000\ntwo = 2\nseven = 7\n\n# Calculate the dominant root R\nR = two + math.sqrt(seven)\n\n# Calculate the limit L\nL = math.log(R)\n\n# Calculate the final value\nfinal_value = ten_thousand * L\n\n# Get the integer part of the final value\ninteger_part = int(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"The dominant root R is 2 + sqrt(7) ≈ {R}\")\nprint(f\"The limit L is ln(R) ≈ {L}\")\nprint(f\"The expression to calculate is: {ten_thousand} * L\")\nprint(f\"The value of the expression is ≈ {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The integer part of the value is: {integer_part}\")\n\n```\n<<<15360>>>"
