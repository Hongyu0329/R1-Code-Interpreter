    This function determines the number of homeomorphism classes for the space X.
    
    The problem conditions are:
    1. X is a metric space.
    2. X is locally compact.
    3. X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line.
    4. For each pair of distinct points x, y in X, there is a closed connected set K
       such that x is in the interior of K, and K does not contain y.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    - The conditions on X (metric, locally compact, connected, separable) and the existence of
      the special property (P) are strong enough to uniquely determine the topological
      structure of X.
    - These properties match the topological characterization of the real line, R.
      Specifically, a connected, locally connected, separable metric space where every point
      is a cut-point is homeomorphic to R. The given properties imply these characteristics.
    - A more direct argument shows that the continuous bijection f: R -> X must be a
      homeomorphism. If it weren't, a point in X would be the limit of the image of a
      sequence tending to infinity in R. Property (P) can be used to rule this out.
    - Therefore, any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R.
    - We must verify that R itself satisfies the conditions, which it does.
    - Consequently, there is only one possible homeomorphism class.

    The number of different homeomorphism classes is 1.
