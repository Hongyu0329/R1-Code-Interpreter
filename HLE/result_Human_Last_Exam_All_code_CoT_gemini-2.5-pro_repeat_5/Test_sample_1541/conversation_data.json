  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the problem to find the most efficient solution. The problem asks us to reorder the numbers in a sum string (like \"3+1+2\") so they are in non-decreasing order (like \"1+2+3\"). The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Thinking Steps for the C Program and Memory Analysis**\n\n1.  **Optimal Algorithm**: The most efficient way to sort a small, fixed set of items is using a \"counting sort\". Instead of storing all the numbers and then sorting them, we can simply count how many 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s appear in the input.\n2.  **Memory-Efficient C Implementation**: To make the C program as memory-efficient as possible, we should avoid storing the entire input string (which could be up to 1000 characters). We can read the input one character at a time using the `getchar()` function.\n3.  **Variable Analysis and Memory Calculation (`m`)**:\n    *   We need an array to store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. An integer array `int counts[4]` is perfect for this. Memory: `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16` bytes (assuming a 32-bit integer).\n    *   We need a variable to store the character read from the input, `int c = getchar();`. Memory: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n    *   To print the final sum, we need a flag to correctly place the '+' signs (e.g., not printing a `+` before the first number). A variable `int first_digit = 1;` will work. Memory: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n    *   Finally, we need loop counters to iterate through our `counts` array and print the numbers. Two nested loops with counters `int i;` and `int j;` would be used. Memory: `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n4.  **Total Memory (`m`)**: Summing the memory for all variables gives us the total: `m = 16 (counts) + 4 (c) + 4 (flag) + 8 (loop counters) = 32` bytes.\n\nNow, following the request format, here is the Python code to solve the task.\n\n```python\n# Read the input sum as a string.\n# Example input: \"3+2+1\"\ns = input()\n\n# The summands are separated by '+'. We can split the string by '+'\n# to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n# For \"3+2+1\", this results in ['3', '2', '1']\nsummands_as_strings = s.split('+')\n\n# To sort the numbers correctly, we first need to convert them from strings to integers.\nnumbers = []\nfor summand in summands_as_strings:\n    numbers.append(int(summand))\n\n# Now, we sort the list of integers.\n# For [3, 2, 1], this becomes [1, 2, 3]\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# To print the final sum in the required format (e.g., \"1+2+3\"),\n# we need to convert the sorted numbers back into strings.\noutput_list = []\nfor number in numbers:\n    output_list.append(str(number))\n\n# Finally, we join the elements of our list of strings with a '+' sign in between.\n# For ['1', '2', '3'], this becomes \"1+2+3\"\nfinal_sum_string = \"+\".join(output_list)\n\n# Print the rearranged sum that Xenia can calculate.\nprint(final_sum_string)\n```\n<<<32>>>"
