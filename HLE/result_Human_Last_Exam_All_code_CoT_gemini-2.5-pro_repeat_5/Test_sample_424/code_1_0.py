# Step 1: Count the number of qualifying points from each line segment.
# These are the endpoints of the segments that are adjacent to exactly one component of the complement.

# For the line segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}, both endpoints (-1/2, 1) and (1/2, 1) qualify.
# They are only adjacent to the unbounded component.
num_points_H = 2

# For the line segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2], both endpoints (0, 1/2) and (0, 3/2) qualify.
# (0, 1/2) is adjacent to the inner region, (0, 3/2) to the unbounded region.
num_points_N = 2

# For the line segment [1/2, 3/2] x {0}, only the endpoint (1/2, 0) qualifies.
# It is adjacent to the inner region. The other endpoint (3/2, 0) is on the boundary of two regions.
num_points_E = 1

# For the line segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}, both endpoints (-1/2, 0) and (-3/2, 0) qualify.
# (-1/2, 0) is adjacent to the inner region, (-3/2, 0) to the unbounded region.
num_points_W = 2

# For the line segment {0} x [-3/2, -1/2], only the endpoint (0, -1/2) qualifies.
# It is adjacent to the inner region. The other endpoint (0, -3/2) is on the boundary of two regions.
num_points_S = 1

# Step 2: Sum the counts to get the total number of points.
total_points = num_points_H + num_points_N + num_points_E + num_points_W + num_points_S

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final result.

# The final answer is the total number of points.
