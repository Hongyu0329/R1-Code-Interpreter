    # Step 1: Use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to find b_1(X).
    # The theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface X in CP^n of dimension m=n-1,
    # the inclusion i: X -> CP^n induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups i_*: pi_k(X) -> pi_k(CP^n) for k < m.
    # Here, n=3, so dim(X)=m=2. The theorem applies for k < 2, so for k=1.
    
    # The fundamental group of complex projective space is trivial.
    pi_1_CP3 = 0
    
    # Therefore, pi_1(X) is also trivial.
    pi_1_X = pi_1_CP3
    
    # By the Hurewicz theorem, for a simply-connected space, H_1(X) is the abelianization of pi_1(X).
    # The rank of H_1(X), which is the Betti number b_1(X), is therefore 0.
    b_1_X = 0
    
    # Step 2: Use Poincaré duality to find b_3(X).
    # X is a complex surface, so it is a compact, orientable real 4-manifold.
    # Poincaré duality states that b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X).
    # For k=3, we have b_3(X) = b_1(X).
    b_3_X = b_1_X
    
    # Step 3: Use formality to relate b_3(X) to the rank of pi_3(X).
    # A smooth projective variety is a compact Kähler manifold.
    # A theorem by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that compact Kähler manifolds are "formal".
