    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use results from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  First, we will determine the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$, which is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. We can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for this. This theorem relates the topology of $X$ to the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n2.  Next, we will determine the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$, using Poincaré duality. Since $X$ is a complex surface, it is a compact, orientable real 4-manifold, so duality applies.\n3.  Finally, we will relate the Betti number $b_3(X)$ to the rank of the homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$. This connection is made via rational homotopy theory. A key result states that compact Kähler manifolds (like our smooth projective hypersurface $X$) are \"formal\" spaces. For simply-connected formal spaces, the rank of the third homotopy group is equal to the third Betti number.\n4.  By combining these steps, we can calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to find b_1(X).\n    # The theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface X in CP^n of dimension m=n-1,\n    # the inclusion i: X -> CP^n induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups i_*: pi_k(X) -> pi_k(CP^n) for k < m.\n    # Here, n=3, so dim(X)=m=2.
