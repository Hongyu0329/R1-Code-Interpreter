# Final Answer Selection
# A. The disilirane coordinates to the cerium atoms creating a M2L12 complex -> Incorrect, the reactant is outside the cage.
# B. The disilirane coordinates to a cerium atom creating a ML6 complex -> Incorrect, the reactant is outside the cage.
# C. The cerium atoms continue free random motion inside the fullerene -> Incorrect, their motion becomes fixed.
# D. The cerium atoms are now positioned at the equator of the fullerene -> Incorrect, they are attracted to the poles.
# E. The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene -> Correct.
