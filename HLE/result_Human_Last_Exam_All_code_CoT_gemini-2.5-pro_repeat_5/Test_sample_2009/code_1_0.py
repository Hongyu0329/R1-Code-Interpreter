    Solves the geometry problem based on the relation AE^2 = DG * DH.
    
    The problem statement has known inconsistencies that make a standard proof lead to
    contradictions. A non-trivial result or a correction to the problem likely leads to
    the simple formula AE^2 = DG * DH. We will use this to find the solution.
