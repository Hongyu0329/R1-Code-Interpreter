    This function analyzes the patient's clinical presentation to determine the most likely
    imaging finding.

    The patient's symptoms (monocular vision loss, headaches, hearing loss, joint pain,
    dyspnea, and a painful skin lesion) point to a multi-system inflammatory disorder.
    Sarcoidosis is a primary consideration as it can affect the nervous system (neurosarcoidosis),
    lungs, joints, and skin, providing a unified diagnosis for all symptoms.

    The investigation of the neurological symptoms (vision loss, headache, hearing loss)
    would involve an MRI of the brain. The characteristic findings of neurosarcoidosis on MRI
    include leptomeningeal enhancement and parenchymal lesions, which can sometimes be
    described as "snowball" or punctate hyperintensities. This makes choice B the best fit.
