    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Re-express the Product**: The infinite product starts from `n=3`. We can express this as the full infinite product starting from `n=1` divided by the terms corresponding to `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n2.  **Factor the General Term**: The term inside the product, `1 - z³/n³`, can be factored using the complex cube roots of unity: `1`, `ω = exp(2πi/3)`, and `ω² = exp(4πi/3)`.\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n3.  **Use the Gamma Function Product Identity**: The infinite product for the sine function is well-known, but a more general identity related to the Gamma function is needed here. The Weierstrass product for the Gamma function gives rise to the following identity for a product over integers:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\n    where `γ` is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and `Γ(x)` is the Gamma function.\n4.  **Evaluate the Full Product**: By applying the factorization, we can see that the regularization terms `exp(z/n)`, `exp(ωz/n)`, and `exp(ω²z/n)` will cancel out because `1 + ω + ω² = 0`. This leads to the identity:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n5.  **Combine the Results**: Substitute the result for the full product back into the expression from step 1 and simplify the denominator.\n    *   The terms to divide by are `(1 - z³)` and `(1 - z³/8)`.\n    *   Their product is `(1 - z³)(1 - z³/8) = (1 - z³)(8 - z³)/8`.\n    *   Dividing by this term is equivalent to multiplying by `8 / ((1 - z³)(8 - z³))`.\n6.  **Construct the Final Expression**: Combine all the pieces to get the final closed-form expression for the original infinite product. This final expression will be printed by the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define variables as strings for printing the expression.\n# The variable 'z' represents the complex variable in the problem.\nz = 'z'\n# The variable 'w' represents the principal cube root of unity, exp(2*pi*i/3).\nw = 'w'\n\n# The numerator of the final expression is 8.\nnumerator = 8\n\n# The denominator is composed of a polynomial part and a Gamma function part.\n# The polynomial part comes from the n=1 and n=2 terms of the product.\n# (1 - z**3/1**3) * (1 - z**3/2**3) = (1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3/8) = (1-z**3)*(8-z**3)/8\n# The denominator of this is the numerator of the final expression.\ndenom_poly_part = f\"(1 - {z}**3) * (8 - {z}**3)\"\n\n# The Gamma function part comes from the infinite product identity.\ndenom_gamma_part = f\"Gamma(1 - {z}) * Gamma(1 - {w}*{z}) * Gamma(1 - {w}**2*{z})\"\n\n# Construct the complete final expression as a string.\nfinal_expression = f\"{numerator} / ({denom_poly_part} * {denom_gamma_part})\"\n\n# Print the final result with explanations for the notation.\nprint(\"The value of the infinite product is given by the expression:\")\nprint(final_expression)\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(\" - z is a complex variable.\")\nprint(\" - Gamma(x) denotes the Gamma function.\")\nprint(f\" - w represents the principal cube root of unity, w = exp(2*pi*i/3).\")\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation are 1, 3, 8 as shown.\")\n\n```\n<<<\\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)}, \\text{ where } \\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3}>>>"
