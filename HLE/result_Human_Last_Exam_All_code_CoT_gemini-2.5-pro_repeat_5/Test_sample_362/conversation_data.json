    "My plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction involves breaking down the problem into logical steps, which will be presented and solved within a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant Structures:** I will first decode the names of the reactants, pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, into their chemical structures.\n2.  **Model the Reaction:** The core of the Wittig reaction involves coupling the carbon backbone of the aldehyde (where the carbonyl group was) with the carbon backbone of the ylide (where the phosphorus was). I will programmatically combine these two parts to form the new alkene skeleton.\n3.  **Determine Product Name and Stereochemistry:** I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the resulting structure to derive its systematic name. A crucial part of this is determining the stereochemistry (E/Z) of the newly formed double bond. The ylide in this reaction is considered \"unstabilized,\" which typically leads to the formation of the *Z*-isomer as the major product.\n4.  **Calculate Chemical Properties:** From the final product structure, I will count the atoms to determine its chemical formula and then calculate its molar mass.\n5.  **Generate the Final Output:** The Python script will print a step-by-step analysis, showing how the product's name, formula, and molar mass are derived, fulfilling the request to show the numbers involved in the calculations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and a specific ylide,\n    and prints the details of the resulting product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants and their constituent parts for the reaction.\n    # Pivalaldehyde: (CH3)3C-CHO\n    aldehyde_alkyl_part = \"(CH3)3C-CH\"\n\n    # Ylide: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\n    # Structure: (2-Cl-Ph)-CH2-CH=P(Ph)3\n    ylide_alkylidene_part = \"CH-CH2-(2-Cl-Ph)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Combine the parts to form the product's carbon skeleton.\n    # The Wittig reaction replaces the C=O and C=P bonds with a C=C bond.\n    product_skeleton = f\"{aldehyde_alkyl_part}={ylide_alkylidene_part}\"\n\n    # Step 3: Name the product based on IUPAC nomenclature.\n    # Structure: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-chlorophenyl)\n    # 1.
