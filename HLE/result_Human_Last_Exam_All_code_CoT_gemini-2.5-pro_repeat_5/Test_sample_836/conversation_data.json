    "The quantity you are asking about is a fundamental concept in the field of nuclear reactor noise analysis. It describes the correlation of neutron detection events in both space and time, transformed into the frequency and wave-vector domains.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Function and Transform**: The starting point is the generalized pair correlation function, $G(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, which gives the probability of detecting a neutron at $(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1)$ given a detection at $(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$. Assuming the system is stationary and homogeneous, this depends only on the separation $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$ and $t = t_1 - t_2$, becoming $G(\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The double Fourier transform is taken with respect to both space $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$.\n2.  **State the Common Name**: This transformed function, let's call it $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, is most commonly known in the nuclear criticality community as the **Noise Power Spectral Density (NPSD)**. It is the spatial-frequency decomposition of the neutron noise.\n3.  **Provide a Model**: The shape of the NPSD is determined by the physics of the nuclear system. A common and simple model is the one-group neutron diffusion model. In this model, the NPSD takes the form of a Lorentzian function, whose parameters depend on the properties of the multiplying medium and the spatial mode $\\mathbf{k}$.\n4.  **Develop Python Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Prints the common name of the function.\n    *   Defines typical parameters for a nuclear system (e.g., reactivity, neutron lifetime, diffusion coefficient).\n    *   Calculates the mode-dependent \"Rossi-alpha\" (`alpha_k`), which is the break-frequency of the NPSD for a given spatial mode `k`.\n    *   Prints the general formula for the NPSD in this model.\n    *   Prints the final equation with the specific numerical values substituted, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef explain_npsd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and calculates the Noise Power Spectral Density (NPSD) for a simple reactor model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\n    # is commonly called the Noise Power Spectral Density (NPSD).\n    function_name = \"Noise Power Spectral Density (NPSD)\"\n\n    print(f\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is called the: {function_name}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Model Parameters ---\n    # We use a one-group diffusion model for a simple illustration.\n    # The NPSD for this model has a Lorentzian shape determined by the\n    # mode-dependent Rossi-alpha.\n\n    # Reactivity in dollars (rho / beta_eff)\n    rho_dollars = -0.5  # System is subcritical\n    # Effective delayed neutron fraction\n    beta_eff = 0.0065\n    # Prompt neutron generation time (s)\n    Lambda = 2.0e-5  # seconds\n    # Neutron speed (cm/s)\n    v_neutron = 2.2e5  # cm/s for thermal neutrons\n    # Diffusion coefficient (cm)\n    D = 0.5  # cm\n\n    # Let's analyze a specific spatial mode 'k' and frequency 'omega'\n    k = 0.1  # Spatial mode wave number (1/cm)\n    omega = 300.0  # Angular frequency (rad/s)\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n    # The reactivity in absolute units\n    rho = rho_dollars * beta_eff\n\n    # The fundamental mode Rossi-alpha (alpha for k=0)\n    # alpha = (beta_eff - rho) / Lambda\n    alpha_0 = (beta_eff - rho) / Lambda\n\n    # The mode-dependent Rossi-alpha includes the spatial leakage term D*v*k^2\n    # The term D*v*k^2 represents the increased decay rate of higher spatial modes.\n    alpha_k = alpha_0 + D * v_neutron * (k**2)\n\n    # The NPSD is proportional to 1 / (alpha_k^2 + omega^2)\n    # The constant of proportionality depends on the source strength and detector efficiency.\n    # We will represent it as 'C'.\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"For a one-group diffusion model, the NPSD has the form:\")\n    print(\"S(k, omega) = C / (alpha_k**2 + omega**2)\")\n    print(\"where alpha_k is the mode-dependent Rossi-alpha.\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Given parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  Reactivity (rho): {rho:.6f} (or {rho_dollars} dollars)\")\n    print(f\"  Effective delayed neutron fraction (beta): {beta_eff}\")\n    print(f\"  Prompt neutron generation time (Lambda): {Lambda} s\")\n    print(f\"  Diffusion coefficient (D): {D} cm\")\n    print(f\"  Neutron speed (v): {v_neutron} cm/s\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"For the chosen spatial mode k = {k} 1/cm:\")\n    print(f\"The mode-dependent Rossi-alpha (alpha_k) is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"alpha_k = (beta - rho)/Lambda + D*v*k^2\")\n    print(f\"alpha_k = ({beta_eff:.4f} - ({rho:.6f}))/{Lambda:.1e} + {D}*{v_neutron:.1e}*({k})**2\")\n    print(f\"alpha_k = {alpha_k:.2f} rad/s\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Therefore, the final equation for the NPSD at the specified point is:\")\n    print(f\"S(k={k}, omega={omega}) = C / ( ({alpha_k:.2f})**2 + ({omega:.2f})**2 )\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_npsd()\n```\n<<<Noise Power Spectral Density (NPSD)>>>"
