    "My plan is to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional qudit. I will approach this by discovering a general pattern using code, rather than a purely abstract mathematical proof.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  A Pauli channel is defined by a set of probabilities $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ and the generalized Pauli operators $\\{X^j Z^k\\}$. The rank of a channel depends on its Kraus operators. I will demonstrate that for any choice of probabilities, the rank of the complementary channel is the same.\n2.  I will write a Python script that calculates the rank of the complementary channel for a given dimension $d$. To do this, the script will:\n    a. Construct the generalized Pauli operators, $X$ and $Z$, for the given dimension $d$.\n    b. For simplicity, it will use a specific, representative Pauli channel: the completely depolarizing channel. The choice of channel does not affect the rank of the complementary channel.\n    c. It will then construct the set of Kraus operators for this channel's complementary channel.\n    d. The rank of the channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators. The script will compute this by constructing a matrix where each column represents a flattened Kraus operator and then calculating the rank of this matrix.\n3.  The script will execute this calculation for several dimensions (e.g., $d=2, 3, 4, 5$) to reveal a consistent pattern.\n4.  By observing the output, I will deduce a general formula for the rank in terms of $d$. Since this rank is constant for any Pauli channel, this value is also the maximal rank.\n\nThe final code will print the relationship between the dimension `d` and the calculated rank, which represents the \"final equation\" requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_complementary_channel_rank(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the complementary channel for a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system.\n\n    Args:\n        d (int): The dimension of the qudit system.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rank of the complementary channel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
