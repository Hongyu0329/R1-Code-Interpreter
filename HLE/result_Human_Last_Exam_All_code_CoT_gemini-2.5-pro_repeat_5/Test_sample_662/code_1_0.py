# Define the known variables from the problem description
basic_reproduction_number = 3.0
breakthrough_infection_rate = 0.06

# Step 1: Calculate the vaccine's effectiveness (VE)
# VE is 1 minus the breakthrough infection rate.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - breakthrough_infection_rate

# Step 2: Calculate the herd immunity threshold (Vc)
# The formula is Vc = (1 - 1/Ro) / VE
# This is the minimum proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated.
critical_vaccination_threshold = (1 - 1/basic_reproduction_number) / vaccine_effectiveness

# Step 3: Print the results in a clear format, showing the equation.

# Let's round to one decimal place as in the print statement.
