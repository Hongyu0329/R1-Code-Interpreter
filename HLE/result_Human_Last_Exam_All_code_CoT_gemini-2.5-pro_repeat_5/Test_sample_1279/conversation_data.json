    "In scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that are proportional to $\\lambda^2$, where $\\lambda$ is the coupling constant from the interaction term $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. These diagrams correspond to connected graphs with two vertices (since the power of $\\lambda$ is 2) and no external lines.\n\nEach vertex in $\\phi^4$ theory has 4 lines (or legs) attached. For a diagram with two vertices, there are a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ legs that must be connected to each other by propagators. Since each propagator connects two legs, there must be $8 / 2 = 4$ propagators in total.\n\nBased on graph theory, there are two distinct connected topologies for a graph with two vertices, four edges, and where each vertex has a degree of 4.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Diagrams and Calculate Their Symmetry Factors\n\n**Diagram 1: The \"Melon\" Diagram**\n\nThis diagram consists of two vertices connected to each other by all four propagators.\n\nTo calculate its symmetry factor, $S_1$, we count the number of permutations of its vertices and propagators that leave the diagram unchanged.\n1.  **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. We can swap them, which gives a factor of 2.\n2.  **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the vertices are also indistinguishable. They can be permuted in $4!$ ways. $4! = 24$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors.\n$S_1 = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**Diagram 2: The \"Dumbbell\" or \"Figure-8\" Diagram**\n\nThis diagram consists of two vertices, each with a single loop attached to it. The two vertices are then connected to each other by the remaining two propagators.\n\nThe calculation of its symmetry factor, $S_2$, is more subtle and there is some variance in the literature. However, a rigorous calculation based on the Wick contractions from the Dyson series expansion yields the most reliable result. The number of ways to form this diagram from the initial expression $\\frac{1}{2!}(\\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4(x))^2$ defines the symmetry factor $S$ as $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Contractions}}{2!(4!)^2}$.\n1.  **Number of Contractions:**\n    *   At the first vertex, choose 2 of the 4 field legs to form the loop: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n    *   At the second vertex, choose 2 of the 4 field legs to form its loop: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n    *   The remaining 2 legs at the first vertex must be connected to the remaining 2 legs at the second vertex. There are 2 ways to do this.\n    *   Total number of contractions = $6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72$.\n2.  **Symmetry Factor Calculation:**\n    *   The prefactor from the Dyson series is $\\frac{1}{2!(4!)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24^2} = \\frac{1}{1152}$.\n    *   The contribution is $\\frac{72}{1152} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n    *   Thus, the symmetry factor $S_2$ is 16.\n\nThis result can be understood heuristically by counting the graphical symmetries: swapping the two vertices (x2), swapping the two connecting propagators (x2), and a factor of 2 for the symmetry of each of the two loops (x2 for each), leading to $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 2: Sum the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe final task is to sum the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams.\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2$\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the symmetry factor for the \"Melon\" diagram.\n# This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n# The symmetries are:\n# - Permuting the two identical vertices: 2! = 2\n# - Permuting the four identical propagators: 4! = 24\ns1_melon = math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the symmetry factor for the \"Dumbbell\" diagram.\n# This diagram has two vertices, each with a loop, connected by two propagators.\n# The symmetries are:\n# - Permuting the two identical vertices (and their attached loops): 2! = 2\n# - Permuting the two identical propagators connecting the vertices: 2! = 2\n# - Symmetry of each of the two loops (each can be \"flipped\"): 2 for each loop\ns2_dumbbell = math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(2) * 2 * 2\n\n# This can also be verified by counting Wick contractions, which gives S=16.\n# Number of contractions = (C(4,2) * C(4,2) * 2) = 72\n# Overall factor is (Num Contractions) / (2! * (4!)^2) = 72 / (2 * 576) = 72 / 1152 = 1/16.\n# So, S = 16.\ns2_dumbbell_from_contractions = 16\n\n# We will use the result from the more rigorous contraction counting.\ns2_dumbbell = s2_dumbbell_from_contractions\n\n\n# Step 3: Sum the symmetry factors and print the result.\ntotal_sum = s1_melon + s2_dumbbell\n\nprint(\"There are two second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\nprint(f\"1. The 'Melon' diagram has a symmetry factor of {s1_melon}.\")\nprint(f\"2. The 'Dumbbell' diagram has a symmetry factor of {s2_dumbbell}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total sum of the symmetry factors is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"Total Sum = {s1_melon} + {s2_dumbbell} = {total_sum}\")\n\n```\n<<<64>>>"
