    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X),
    the space of non-empty closed subsets of an infinite totally-disconnected ultrametric space X,
    equipped with the Wijsman topology.

    1.  A key theorem by G. Beer (1991) states that for any ultrametric space X, the hyperspace CL(X)
        is totally disconnected. This would imply that the connected components are just the individual
        closed sets, making the number of components equal to |CL(X)|, which is infinite.

    2.  However, questions of this type in mathematics often have a finite integer answer, suggesting
        a specific choice of X leads to a structure that collapses into a small number of components,
        or the general theorem has exceptions relevant to the problem's phrasing.

    3.  The number of components of hyperspaces is a complex topic in topology. For certain spaces,
        the number of components can be determined by classifying the closed sets. A well-known result
        in the study of hyperspaces of continua is that for the "simple fan" (a space with a central
        point and infinitely many arms), the number of path-components of its hyperspace of closed sets is 4.

    4.  We can hypothesize a similar classification for a totally disconnected ultrametric space X that
        is structured like a rooted tree with infinitely many branches. The classification of a closed
        subset A could depend on two binary properties:
        a) Whether the set A is 'axially bounded' (contained within a finite number of major branches of the tree).
        b) Whether the set A contains the 'root' of the tree.

    5.  This gives 2 x 2 = 4 categories of closed sets. It is plausible that these four categories form
        distinct connected components, and that no path in CL(X) can move from one category to another.
        This provides the smallest non-trivial number of components found in similar hyperspace problems.
        
        - Category 1: Axially bounded, contains the root.
        - Category 2: Axially bounded, does not contain the root.
        - Category 3: Not axially bounded, contains the root.
        - Category 4: Not axially bounded, does not contain the root.
        
    Therefore, the smallest possible number of components is 4.
