  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nLittle Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically.

    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Read Input:** The program will read two strings from the standard input.\n2.  **Normalize Case:** Since the comparison must be case-insensitive, the most straightforward approach is to convert both strings to a common format, either all lowercase or all uppercase. Lowercase is a common convention.\n3.  **Compare Lexicographically:** The program will then perform a lexicographical (alphabetical) comparison on the two normalized strings.\n4.  **Print Output:**\n    *   If the first normalized string is less than the second, it will print \"-1\".\n    *   If the first normalized string is greater than the second, it will print \"1\".\n    *   If the strings are identical, it will print \"0\".\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis:\n\nFor the second part of your request, concerning the most memory-efficient C program:\nTo minimize memory usage, we would read the first string into a buffer of size 101 (`char s1[101];`, 101 bytes) to accommodate the maximum length of 100 characters plus a null terminator. Then, instead of storing the second string, we would read it character by character using `getchar()`. This requires an integer variable (`int c2;`, 4 bytes) to store the return value of `getchar()` and a loop counter (`unsigned char i;`, 1 byte) for the index of the first string. No other variables are necessary.\n\nThe total memory (`m`) used for variables would be the sum of the memory for these variables:\nm = (size of string buffer) + (size of character variable) + (size of index)\nm = 101 + 4 + 1 = 106 bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the lexicographical string comparison problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The memory calculation for the most memory-efficient C program is:\n    # m = 101 (for char s1[101]) + 1 (for unsigned char i) + 4 (for int c2) = 106 bytes.\n    # The numbers in the equation are 101, 1, and 4.\n\n    # Read the two strings from standard input\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n    # Perform the comparison and print the result\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
