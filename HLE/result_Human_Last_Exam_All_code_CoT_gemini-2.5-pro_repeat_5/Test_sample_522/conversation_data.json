    "Here is my plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I will first analyze the relationship between the input and output pairs (A and B) to deduce the transformation rule. The transformation appears to involve a single '2' swapping its position with a single '0'. The core of the puzzle is to identify which '0' is chosen for the swap. The case of `Input_C` resulting in `MISSING` suggests there are specific conditions under which a valid swap cannot occur.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** My analysis suggests the following rules:\n    *   The '2' can only move to an adjacent '0' (including diagonals). These are the \"candidate\" '0's.\n    *   A \"score\" is calculated for each candidate '0'. This score is the number of its own adjacent '0's.\n    *   The '2' attempts to move to the candidate '0' with the *minimum* score.\n    *   **Tie-breaking rules:**\n        *   If there is only one candidate with the minimum score, the '2' moves there.\n        *   If there are exactly two candidates with the same minimum score, the '2' moves to the one that appears first in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).\n        *   If there are more than two candidates with the same minimum score, the situation is ambiguous, and the output is `MISSING`.\n        *   If the '2' has no adjacent '0's to move to, the output is also `MISSING`.\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis:** I will test this hypothesis against all provided examples (`A`, `B`, and `C`) to ensure it consistently produces the correct output.\n\n4.  **Implement the Solution:** I will write a Python script that implements the verified logic. The script will:\n    *   Take the input string for `Input_C`.\n    *   Parse it into a 2D grid.\n    *   Locate the '2' and its adjacent candidate '0's.\n    *   Calculate the score for each candidate.\n    *   Apply the decision and tie-breaking rules to determine the outcome.\n    *   Print the final result, which, based on my hypothesis, will be `MISSING` for `Input_C`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by applying the deduced transformation rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
