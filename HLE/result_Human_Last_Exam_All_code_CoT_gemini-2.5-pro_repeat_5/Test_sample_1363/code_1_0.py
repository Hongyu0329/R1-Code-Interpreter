The dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the European Tango.

Technical Rationale:
The European Tango is a staccato dance, meaning its movements are sharp and disconnected, unlike the other dances listed which are 'swing' dances. The technique for a Tango Reverse Turn specifically lacks the body sway, momentum, and continuous flow that are used in Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep to add extra rotation ('overturn') to a figure. Attempting to force an overturn in a Tango Reverse Turn would introduce a swinging action, which fundamentally violates its core technical principles.
