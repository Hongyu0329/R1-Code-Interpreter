    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The user wants to identify which of the listed ballroom dances has a reverse turn that is technically impossible to overturn. This is a knowledge-based question about dance technique.\n2.  **Formulate a \"Coding\" Approach:** To use my coding skills as requested, I will model this problem numerically. I'll assign a \"technical rigidity\" score to each dance's reverse turn, where a higher score indicates it's more difficult to overturn without breaking technique. A score of 10 will represent \"impossible.\"\n3.  **Implement the \"Equation\":** My code will define this scoring system. The \"equation\" will be the process of finding the maximum score among the options. The code will print out the scores for each dance, show the \"equation\" of finding the maximum value, and then provide a detailed explanation for why the dance with the highest score is the correct answer.\n4.  **Final Answer:** The script will conclude by printing the name of the correct dance. I will then provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer a specific question.\n    It assigns a \"technical rigidity\" score for overturning a reverse turn\n    in each dance and identifies the one where it's technically impossible.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the options and assign a \"technical rigidity\" score.\n    # A score of 10 means it is impossible to overturn without disregarding the technique.\n    dance_analysis = {\n        'A. Viennese Waltz': 7,\n        'B. English Waltz': 4,\n        'C. European Tango': 10,\n        'D. Slow Foxtrott': 3,\n        'E. Quickstep': 5\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: The \"equation\" is to find the dance with the highest rigidity score.\n    highest_rigidity_score = 0\n    correct_dance = \"\"\n    for dance, score in dance_analysis.items():\n        if score > highest_rigidity_score:\n            highest_rigidity_score = score\n            correct_dance = dance\n\n    # Step 3: Provide a detailed explanation for the result.\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the European Tango.\n\nTechnical Rationale:\nThe European Tango is a staccato dance, meaning its movements are sharp and disconnected, unlike the other dances listed which are 'swing' dances. The technique for a Tango Reverse Turn specifically lacks the body sway, momentum, and continuous flow that are used in Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep to add extra rotation ('overturn') to a figure. Attempting to force an overturn in a Tango Reverse Turn would introduce a swinging action, which fundamentally violates its core technical principles.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the analysis, the \"equation\" components, and the final answer.\n    print(\"Analysis of technical rigidity for overturning a reverse turn (1=Easy, 10=Impossible):\")\n    for dance, score in dance_analysis.items():\n        print(f\"- {dance}: Score = {score}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nExecuting the 'equation' to find the maximum rigidity score...\")\n    \n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation.\n    # Our \"equation\" is finding the maximum of the scores.\n    scores = list(dance_analysis.values())\n    print(f\"The numbers (scores) are: {scores[0]}, {scores[1]}, {scores[2]}, {scores[3]}, {scores[4]}\")\n    print(f\"The equation result is: max({', '.join(map(str, scores))}) = {highest_rigidity_score}\")\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The correct choice is '{correct_dance}'.\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
