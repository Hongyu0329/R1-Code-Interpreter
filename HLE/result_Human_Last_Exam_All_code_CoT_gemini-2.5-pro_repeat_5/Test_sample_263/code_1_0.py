# Parameters from the problem
# Although the number of levels and size ratio are given, they are contextual for the LSM-tree structure.
# The core calculation relies on the write buffer's properties.

# 1. Convert the write buffer size from kilobytes to bytes

# 2. As interpreted in the plan, 'num_entries' refers to the entries in the write buffer.
# Calculate the minimum size of one entry.
entry_size_bytes = buffer_size_bytes / num_entries

# 3. Print the inputs, the equation, and the final result.
