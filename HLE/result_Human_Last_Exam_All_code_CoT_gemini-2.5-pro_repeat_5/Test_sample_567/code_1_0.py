    Calculates the critical value of 'a' for the symplectic embedding problem.

    The problem asks for the value of the parameter 'a' for an ellipsoid E(1, a)
    at which the only obstruction to embedding it into a 4D ball is the volume
    constraint.

    Based on the work of McDuff and Schlenk, this condition holds up to the
    point a = tau**4, where tau is the golden ratio. This is the transition point
    where other "symplectic" obstructions become active.

    The golden ratio tau = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
    The value to be calculated is a = tau**4 = ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)**4.
    A simplified exact expression is a = (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2.
