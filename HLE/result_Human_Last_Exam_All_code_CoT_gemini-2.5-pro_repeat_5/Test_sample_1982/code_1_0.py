# Given value for c1
c1 = 10**4

# The parameters l1 and alpha1 are given as:
# l1 = (1 + 10**5)**5
# alpha1 = (1 + 10**5)**6 * (1 - 10**5 + 10**10)
# From the problem structure, we deduce that x11 = alpha1 / l1.
# This simplifies to x11 = (1 + 10**5) * (1 - 10**5 + 10**10).
# This is an application of the sum of cubes formula: (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) = a^3+b^3
# with a=1 and b=10**5.
# So, x11 = 1**3 + (10**5)**3
x11 = 1 + 10**15

# From the matrix equation, we derived the scalar equation: x11 = 1 + c1 * u1
# We can now solve for u1:
# u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1
u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1

# Print the final equation with the computed numerical values
print("From the matrix equation, we derive the relationship x_11 = 1 + c_1 * u_1.")

# Print the final value for u1
