# Plan:
# 1. Identify the group parameters for the semidihedral group of size 512.
# 2. Count the cyclic subgroups contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>.
# 3. Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form sr^i, splitting by whether i is even or odd.
# 4. Sum the counts to get the total number of power (cyclic) subgroups.

# For a semidihedral group of size 512 = 2^n, n = 9.
# The maximal cyclic subgroup <r> has order 256 = 2^(n-1).

# 1. Count subgroups of the cyclic group C_256.
# The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order m is the number of divisors of m.
# The order is 256 = 2^8. The divisors are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8.
# So there are 8 + 1 = 9 subgroups.
count_from_r = 9

# 2. Count cyclic subgroups generated by sr^i where i is even.
# There are 256/2 = 128 such elements. Each has order 2 and generates a unique
# cyclic subgroup of order 2.
count_from_sr_even = 128

# 3. Count cyclic subgroups generated by sr^i where i is odd.
# There are 256/2 = 128 such elements. Each has order 4.
# These elements form pairs (g, g^3) that generate the same subgroup.
# So, the number of distinct subgroups is 128 / 2 = 64.
count_from_sr_odd = 64

# 4. The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these disjoint sets.
total_subgroups = count_from_r + count_from_sr_even + count_from_sr_odd

# Print the final equation and the result.
