    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and the Task:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. Our task is to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$. The presentation of this group is $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$. The group is $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Classify and Count Subgroups:** We can find all cyclic subgroups by considering the two types of elements in the group: those of the form $r^i$ and those of the form $sr^i$. This allows us to partition the cyclic subgroups into three disjoint sets:\n    *   **Set 1: Cyclic subgroups contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.** The element $r$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of its order. The order is $256 = 2^8$, and its divisors are $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^8$. Thus, there are $8+1=9$ such subgroups.\n\n    *   **Set 2: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is even.** The order of such an element is 2. There are 128 even numbers between 0 and 255 (i.e., $0, 2, \\dots, 254$). Each element $sr^i$ (with $i$ even) generates a unique subgroup of order 2: $\\{1, sr^i\\}$. These subgroups are distinct from those in Set 1 (except for the trivial subgroup, which we don't double count). This gives us 128 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n    *   **Set 3: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is odd.** The order of such an element is 4. There are 128 odd numbers between 0 and 255. An element $g=sr^i$ of order 4 generates a cyclic subgroup that has two generators: $g$ and $g^3$. For these elements, it can be shown that $g^3 = sr^{i+128}$. This means the 128 elements of this type form $128/2 = 64$ pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup. This gives us 64 new, distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three disjoint sets.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify the group parameters for the semidihedral group of size 512.\n# 2. Count the cyclic subgroups contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>.\n# 3. Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form sr^i, splitting by whether i is even or odd.\n# 4. Sum the counts to get the total number of power (cyclic) subgroups.\n\n# For a semidihedral group of size 512 = 2^n, n = 9.\n# The maximal cyclic subgroup <r> has order 256 = 2^(n-1).\n\n# 1. Count subgroups of the cyclic group C_256.\n# The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order m is the number of divisors of m.\n# The order is 256 = 2^8. The divisors are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8.\n# So there are 8 + 1 = 9 subgroups.\ncount_from_r = 9\n\n# 2. Count cyclic subgroups generated by sr^i where i is even.\n# There are 256/2 = 128 such elements. Each has order 2 and generates a unique\n# cyclic subgroup of order 2.\ncount_from_sr_even = 128\n\n# 3. Count cyclic subgroups generated by sr^i where i is odd.\n# There are 256/2 = 128 such elements. Each has order 4.\n# These elements form pairs (g, g^3) that generate the same subgroup.\n# So, the number of distinct subgroups is 128 / 2 = 64.\ncount_from_sr_odd = 64\n\n# 4. The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these disjoint sets.\ntotal_subgroups = count_from_r + count_from_sr_even + count_from_sr_odd\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum of three types:\")\nprint(f\"1. Subgroups from the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>: {count_from_r}\")\nprint(f\"2. Subgroups from elements sr^i (i is even): {count_from_sr_even}\")\nprint(f\"3. Subgroups from elements sr^i (i is odd): {count_from_sr_odd}\")\nprint(\"Final calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{count_from_r} + {count_from_sr_even} + {count_from_sr_odd} = {total_subgroups}\")\n```\n<<<201>>>"
