    The primary driver for the long-term decline in the 13C/12C ratio in tree rings globally during this period is the 'Suess Effect'. This is the result of burning fossil fuels, which releases large amounts of CO2 depleted in 13C into the atmosphere. As trees build their rings using this atmospheric CO2, they record this global decline. However, this is not an option. We must evaluate the given choices.

    Conclusion: While the global Suess Effect is the main cause, it is not an option.
