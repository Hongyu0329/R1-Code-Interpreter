    1.  The experiment compares two probes in a photo-labeling reaction. The goal is to see what molecule gets activated by light to attach to proteins.

    2.  The key difference between the two probes is a single functional group:
        *   Probe 1 has a phenol group (-OH attached directly to a phenyl ring).
        *   Probe 2 has a benzyl alcohol group (-CH2OH attached to a phenyl ring).

    3.  Under irradiation with light and a photosensitizer, phenols are readily oxidized to form a highly reactive species called a 'phenoxyl radical'. This radical is very effective at labeling nearby proteins.

    4.  Probe 2, which lacks the phenol group, cannot form a phenoxyl radical. This is why it is much less reactive and gives a much weaker fluorescent signal. The experiment with Probe 2 is a control to prove that the phenol group is crucial.

    5.  Therefore, the large difference in fluorescent signal between the two experiments is caused by the formation of the phenoxyl radical from Probe 1. This is the key reactive molecule responsible for the efficient labeling.
