    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the problem**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^k}$ modulo the prime power factors $p^k$ of $N$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is then $N=\\prod p^k$, and its order is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_{p^k}$.\n\n2.  **Factorize the conductor**: We start by finding the prime power factorization of the conductor $N=36036$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\n    The prime power factors are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\n3.  **Analyze each component**: For each factor $m \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$, we need to find the number of primitive characters $\\chi_m$ of conductor $m$ whose order divides the target order, which is 6. Let's denote the order of a character $\\chi$ as $\\text{ord}(\\chi)$.\n\n4.  **Count the possibilities**: We'll count the number of valid choices for each component character $\\chi_m$.\n    -   For a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The primitive characters are all non-trivial characters. The number of characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k | (p-1)$ and $k>1$.\n    -   For $p^a$, the counting is more specific.\n\n5.  **Verify the final order**: We need to ensure that for any combination of the chosen component characters, the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number**: The total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculates the number of choices for each factor, verifies the lcm condition, and computes the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n), which counts the number of\n    positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    This is also the number of generators of a cyclic group of order n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N and order k.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    order = 6\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {order}.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Factorize N into its prime power components.\")\n    print(f\"N = {N} = 4 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: A character chi modulo N is primitive if and only if it is a product of primitive characters\")\n    print(\"chi_m for each prime power factor m of N.
