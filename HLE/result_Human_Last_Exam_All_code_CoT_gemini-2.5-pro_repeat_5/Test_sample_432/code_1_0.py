    # The cardinality of [0, 1] is the cardinality of the continuum, c = 2^aleph_0.
    # We check each set to see if its cardinality is c.

    # A. (0, 1): The open interval (0, 1) can be put into a one-to-one
    #    correspondence with [0, 1]. For example, by using the
    #    Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem. Its cardinality is c.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |(0, 1)| = |[0, 1]| = c

    # B. N (Natural numbers): This set is countably infinite.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |N| = aleph_0 != c

    # C. Q (Rational numbers): This set is countably infinite.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |Q| = aleph_0 != c

    #    A bijection exists between R and [0, 1].
    #    Cardinality Equation: |R| = c

    # E. R \ Q (Irrational numbers): Since R = Q U (R \ Q) and Q is countable,
    #    the cardinality of the irrationals must be the same as R.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |R \ Q| = |R| - |Q| = c - aleph_0 = c

    # F. C (Complex numbers): C is equivalent to R x R (or R^2).
    #    Cardinality Equation: |C| = |R^2| = c * c = c

    # G. H (Quaternions): H is equivalent to R^4.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |H| = |R^4| = c^4 = c

    # H. {x: c'(x) = 0}, where c(x) is the Cantor function. The derivative is zero
    #    on the countable union of open intervals removed to form the Cantor set.
    #    The cardinality is the sum of cardinalities of these intervals.
    #    Cardinality Equation: aleph_0 * c = c

    # I. The set of strings formable with alphabets (finite alphabet): This is a
    #    countable union of finite sets (strings of length 1, 2, ...), so it is countable.

    # J. Set of all points in a (countably) infinite dimensional space (R^N):
    #    This is the set of all sequences of real numbers.

    #    This is the set of all sequences of integers.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |Z^N| = aleph_0^aleph_0 = c

    # L. N x N: The Cartesian product of two countable sets is countable.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |N x N| = aleph_0 * aleph_0 = aleph_0 != c

    # M. R x R: The Cartesian product of two sets of cardinality c.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |R x R| = c * c = c

    # N. 2^N (Power set of N): This is another definition of the continuum's cardinality.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |2^N| = 2^aleph_0 = c

    # O. 2^Q (Power set of Q): Since |Q| = aleph_0, this is the same as |2^N|.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |2^Q| = 2^aleph_0 = c

    # P. 2^C (Power set of C): |C| = c.
    #    Cardinality Equation: |2^C| = 2^c > c
