    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the central pixel:\n\nFirst, I will use Bresenham's line algorithm to determine all the integer coordinates of the pixels that lie on the line segment from (1, 1) to (11, 5). Since the change in x (10) is greater than the change in y (4), the algorithm will iterate along the x-axis from 1 to 11. At each x-step, it will use a decision parameter to determine whether the y-coordinate should be incremented or stay the same to best approximate the true line.\n\nI will store each of these calculated pixel coordinates in a list. After generating all the pixels for the line, I will find the total count of these pixels. Since the line includes `dx + 1` = 11 pixels (an odd number), there will be a single, unique central pixel. I will calculate the index of this middle pixel and retrieve its coordinates from the list.\n\nFinally, I will print the coordinates of this central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the start and end points of the line\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # This list will store all the pixel coordinates on the line\n    points = []\n\n    # Calculate the change in x and y\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Initialize the current coordinates and the decision parameter 'p'\n    # This specific formula for 'p' is for lines with a slope between 0 and 1\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Add the starting point to our list\n    points.append((x, y))\n\n    # Loop for dx steps to find all the pixels along the line\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            # Keep y the same\n            p = p + (2 * dy)\n        else:\n            # Increment y\n            y += 1\n            p = p + (2 * dy) - (2 * dx)\n        \n        points.append((x, y))\n\n    # Determine the index of the central pixel\n    # For a list of 11 items (0-10), the middle index is (11-1)//2 = 5\n    central_index = (len(points) - 1) // 2\n    central_pixel = points[central_index]\n\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We will print the x and y coordinates of the central pixel to satisfy this.\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are (x, y).\")\n    print(f\"x = {central_pixel[0]}\")\n    print(f\"y = {central_pixel[1]}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result\nfind_central_pixel()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
