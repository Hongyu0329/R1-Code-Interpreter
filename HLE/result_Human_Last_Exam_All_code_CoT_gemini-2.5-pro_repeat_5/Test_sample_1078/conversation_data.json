    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider both irreducible and reducible groups. A finite Weyl group's structure is described by its corresponding Dynkin diagram. The rank of the group is the number of nodes in this diagram.\n\nA group is **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. A group is **reducible** if its diagram is disconnected, meaning it's a direct product of lower-rank irreducible groups. The total rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  List all irreducible finite Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4 based on the complete classification (A, B/C, D families and exceptional types).\n2.  Count the irreducible groups of rank 4.\n3.  Count the reducible groups of rank 4 by finding all partitions of the number 4 into smaller integers (e.g., 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, etc.).\n4.  For each partition, calculate the number of non-isomorphic group combinations.\n5.  Sum the counts from all cases to get the total number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by enumerating the possibilities for each partition of the rank 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_weyl_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    This is done by considering all possible partitions of the rank 4 into\n    ranks of irreducible components.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups and partitions of the rank.\\n\")\n\n    # The classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank.\n    # Note: Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so we only list B_n.\n    irreducible_by_rank = {\n        1: [\"A_1\"],\n        2: [\"A_2\", \"B_2\", \"G_2\"],\n        3: [\"A_3\", \"B_3\"],\n        4: [\"A_4\", \"B_4\", \"D_4\", \"F_4\"]\n    }\n\n    # We will sum the counts for each partition of 4.\n    counts = []\n\n    # Case 1: Irreducible groups (Partition: 4)\n    # These are the connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes.\n    count_4 = len(irreducible_by_rank[4])\n    counts.append(count_4)\n    print(f\"Number of irreducible groups of rank 4: {count_4}\")\n\n    # Case 2: Reducible groups (Partition: 3 + 1)\n    # A product of one rank-3 group and one rank-1 group.\n    count_3_1 = len(irreducible_by_rank[3]) * len(irreducible_by_rank[1])\n    counts.append(count_3_1)\n    print(f\"Number of reducible groups for partition 3+1: {count_3_1}\")\n\n    # Case 3: Reducible groups (Partition: 2 + 2)\n    # A product of two rank-2 groups.
