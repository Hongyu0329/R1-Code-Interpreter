    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), we need to review the established chemical processes. The primary method for producing XeF4 is the direct reaction of its constituent elements, xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2).\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to solve this problem:\n1.  I will create a data structure (a dictionary) to store information about different synthesis methods for xenon fluorides, including the compound produced, the reaction temperature, and the method's efficiency.\n2.  The script will then specifically search for methods that produce `XeF4` and are rated as having 'High' efficiency.\n3.  From this list of efficient methods, the script will identify the one with the lowest temperature.\n4.  Finally, it will print out the reasoning and the identified temperature, comparing it against the provided multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_optimal_synthesis_temp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes chemical synthesis data to find the coldest temperature\n    for efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Database of synthesis methods for Xenon Fluorides\n    # Data is based on standard inorganic chemistry literature.\n    synthesis_methods = {\n        'XeF4': [\n            {\n                'method': 'Direct thermal synthesis: Xe + 2F2 -> XeF4',\n                'temperature_C': 400,\n                'efficiency': 'High',\n                'notes': 'This is the most common and efficient industrial method.
