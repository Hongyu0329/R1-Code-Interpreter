    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, such that $f$ is the left adjoint of $g$ ($f \\dashv g$). This relationship is defined by the property: $f(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le g(y)$ for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $f$ or the right adjoint map $g$. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n\nFor a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between two posets to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema (joins). In the context of the totally ordered sets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, any subset has a supremum, which is its maximum element. The supremum of the empty set is defined as the minimum element of the poset, which is 0.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ automatically preserves suprema of all non-empty sets. For the supremum of the empty set, we require $f(\\sup_{x \\in \\emptyset} x) = \\sup_{y \\in \\emptyset} y$. This translates to the condition $f(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ that satisfy $f(0)=0$.\n\nThe problem asks for adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$, so we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of sequences $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n1. $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$ (order-preserving property)\n2. $f(0) = 0$ (left adjoint condition)\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ of length $23$ with values from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of such maps is given by the multiset coefficient formula for choosing $k$ items from a set of $r+1$ items with replacement, which is $\\binom{r+k}{k}$.\nHere, we are choosing $k=m=23$ values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set of $r+1=n+1=38$ possible values.\nThe formula becomes $\\binom{(n+1) + m - 1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula for order-preserving maps from $[k]$ to $[r]$, which is $\\binom{r+k+1}{k+1}$:\nWe are counting maps from the set $\\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (which is isomorphic to $[22]$) to $[37]$. So, $k=22$ and $r=37$.\nThe number is $\\binom{37+22+1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nFor our problem, with $m=23$ and $n=37$, the number of adjunctions is:\n$\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define m and n based on the problem statement\n# Adjunction from [m] to [n]\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# The number of adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m) or C(n+m, n)\n# C(37+23, 23) = C(60, 23)\nN = n + m\nK = m\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final answer\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).\")\nprint(f\"C({n} + {m}, {m}) = C({N}, {K})\")\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<23233345422184400>>>"
