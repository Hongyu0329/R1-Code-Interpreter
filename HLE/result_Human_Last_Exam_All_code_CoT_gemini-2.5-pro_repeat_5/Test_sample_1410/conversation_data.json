    "This is a chess puzzle that requires finding the shortest forced checkmate for White.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** I will parse the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` to understand the placement of pieces and the current threats. White is to move, but is facing a back-rank mate threat from Black's rook on e1.\n2.  **Identify candidate moves:** Due to the immediate threat, White's moves must be forcing, which means they must be checks. I will evaluate the most promising checking moves.\n3.  **Calculate the main variations:** The key is to find a sequence of moves that leads to checkmate regardless of how Black defends. This involves looking at all of Black's possible responses to White's forcing moves.\n4.  **Determine the optimal line:** Assuming Black plays optimally, they will choose the defensive line that prolongs the game the most. The number of moves for White to win is determined by this longest-to-mate line.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that explains the solution and prints the final answer. To satisfy the prompt's constraint to \"output each number in the final equation\", the code will display the sum of individual moves that leads to the total move count.\n\n### Analysis\nThe critical winning line for White starts with a queen sacrifice check:\n\n1.  **1. Qxf7+**: This is the most forcing move. Black's only legal reply is `1... Kh7`.\n2.  **2. Bg6+**: This follow-up move continues the attack. Black now has two main defenses:\n    *   **Defense A:** `2... Kh8`. This allows a smothered mate in 4 more of White's moves: `3. Nf7+ Kg8 4. Nxh6+ Kh8 5. Qg8+ Rxg8 6. Nf7#`. The total length of this line is 6 moves for White.\n    *   **Defense B:** `2... fxg6`. This also leads to a smothered mate, but it takes one move longer: `3. Qxg6+ Kh8 4. Nf7+ Kg8 5. Nxh6+ Kh8 6. Qg8+ Rxg8 7. Nf7#`. The total length of this line is 7 moves for White.\n\nSince Black plays optimally, they will choose Defense B (`2... fxg6`) to survive for as long as possible. Therefore, White can force a checkmate in 7 moves.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates and explains the solution to the chess puzzle.\n# The goal is to find the minimum number of moves for White to force a checkmate.\n\n# The analysis of the position reveals a forced checkmate sequence.\n# White's best line forces a win in 7 moves against optimal defense from Black.\n# The sequence of White's moves is as follows:\n# 1. Qxf7+\n# 2. Bg6+\n# 3. Qxg6+\n# 4. Nf7+\n# 5. Nxh6+\n# 6. Qg8+\n# 7. Nf7#\n\n# The total number of moves for White to win is 7.\n# We can represent this as a sum of each individual move.\nnumber_of_moves = 7\n\n# We create a list where each element represents one move.\nmoves_list = [1] * number_of_moves\n\n# To satisfy the prompt's requirement of showing an equation,\n# we will print the sum of these moves.\n# First, we print each number that will be part of the equation.\nprint(\"The final equation is built from the following numbers:\")\nfor number in moves_list:\n    print(number)\n\n# Then, we print the full equation.\nequation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, moves_list))\nresult = sum(moves_list)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_string} = {result}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThus, White can win in {result} moves.\")\n```\n<<<7>>>"
