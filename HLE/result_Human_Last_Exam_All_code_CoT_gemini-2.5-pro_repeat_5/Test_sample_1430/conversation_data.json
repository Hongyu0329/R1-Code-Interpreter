    "To find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number $\\rho(X)$, of a symmetric power $X = C^{(d)}$ of a curve $C$ is related to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. For a curve of genus $g$ and a symmetric power of degree $d$, if $d \\ge g$, the formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n    In this problem, we have $g=3$ and $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, this formula applies.\n\n2.  **Determine the Range for $\\rho(J(C))$**: The problem now reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, such as the Jacobian $J(C)$, the Picard number is bounded by:\n    $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le g^2$\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Rank**: The smallest rank of $NS(X)$ occurs when $\\rho(J(C))$ is at its minimum.\n    *   The minimum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$, is achieved for a \"very general\" curve $C$ in the moduli space of genus 3 curves. These are curves whose Jacobians have the minimal possible endomorphism ring, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Largest Rank**: The largest rank of $NS(X)$ occurs when $\\rho(J(C))$ is at its maximum.\n    *   The maximum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2$, is achieved for special curves with Complex Multiplication (CM). For $g=3$, we need to see if a curve exists such that $\\rho(J(C))=3^2=9$. The Fermat quartic curve, defined by $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$, is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has this property.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the smallest and largest ranks based on this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the problem\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(f\"The genus is g = {g} and the symmetric power is d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: State the main formula.\n    # The condition d >= g holds (15 >= 3), so we can use the formula.\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group (Picard number) of X is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C)), where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the smallest possible rank.\n    # This occurs when rho(J(C)) is minimal.
