# (A) The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School". The deception
# involved shoeing a horse with pattens to create the tracks of a cow. The
# shoes were intended to belong to a cow in the world of the deception.
a = 6

# (B) The allusion to Sherlock Holmes (master of logical education) highlights
# by contrast the narrator Kinbote's commentary, which is a masterpiece of
# mis-education. With A=6 and C=7, B must be 3 for the sum to be a
# multiple of 8 (6 + 3 + 7 = 16).
b = 3

# (C) Nabokov's most profound and pervasive experience with "intricate
# back-referencing" was his massive scholarly translation of and commentary
# on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin", a project whose form "Pale Fire" parodies.
c = 7

# The final answer is the sequence of the three numbers.
print(f"{a} {b} {c}")

# The instructions state to "output each number in the final equation".
# Here is the final equation showing the sum is a multiple of 8.
total = a + b + c
