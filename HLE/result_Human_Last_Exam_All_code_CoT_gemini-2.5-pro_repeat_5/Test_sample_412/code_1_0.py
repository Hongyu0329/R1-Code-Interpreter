    Analyzes the nonstandard definition of continuity and determines the correct option.

    explanation = """
1.  In nonstandard analysis, the concept of "points being close" is formalized by the relation of being "infinitesimally close", denoted by `~`.
2.  A function `f` is continuous at a standard point `x_0` if it preserves this closeness. Specifically, any point `x_1` that is infinitesimally close to `x_0` must be mapped to a point `f(x_1)` that is infinitesimally close to `f(x_0)`.
3.  This condition must hold for any `x_1` in the nonstandard extension `X*` of the space `X`, as the power of nonstandard analysis comes from testing standard points against nonstandard ones.
4.  For the function `f` to be continuous on the entire space `X`, this property must hold for every standard point `x_0` in `X`.
5.  This reasoning is precisely captured by option B: `∀ x_0 ∈ X, ∀ x_1 ∈ X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ⇒ f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)`.

Why other options are incorrect:
-   **A**: Is too weak as it only considers standard points, for which `x_0 ~ x_1` implies `x_0 = x_1`.
-   **C**: Is too strong. This condition, `∀ x_0, x_1 ∈ X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ⇒ f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)`, is called S-continuity. For functions on non-compact spaces, it is equivalent to the stronger property of *uniform continuity*, not simple continuity. For example, `f(x) = x^2` is continuous on the real numbers but not uniformly continuous, and it fails condition C for infinite hyperreal numbers.
-   **D, E, F**: Are converses of the continuity conditions. They are related to injectivity and are falsified by simple continuous functions like constant functions.
