    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure to identify the structure of the group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check Irreducibility**: First, we must confirm that the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant**: We will calculate the discriminant, $\\Delta$, of the polynomial. The sign of the discriminant and whether it is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ gives crucial information about the Galois group. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Find the Resolvent Cubic**: We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial, $g(y)$. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further constrains the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We will check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots. If it does, it is reducible, which implies the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_8$.\n5.  **Determine the Group**: Based on the previous steps, we will narrow down the possible Galois groups. The final step to distinguish between the remaining options often involves checking if the original polynomial becomes reducible over a specific field extension related to the discriminant or the roots of the resolvent cubic.\n6.  **State the Order**: Once the Galois group is identified, its order is known.\n\nNow, we will execute this plan using Python to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n    \n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + qx + r, we have q=8 and r=14.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n    f = sympy.Poly(x**4 + q*x + r, x)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Check irreducibility of f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\")\n    # We apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2.\n    # The coefficients are [1, 0, 0, 8, 14].\n    # p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    # p=2 divides all other coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14).\n    # p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\n    # By Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\n    is_irreducible = sympy.irreducible_p(f, domain='QQ')\n    print(f\"Is the polynomial irreducible over Q? {is_irreducible}.
