    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user is asking for the full name of a historical figure, \"HE,\" based on a specific theological interpretation attributed to \"Veronika Campan.\" The clues are:\n    *   The interpretation is from Veronika Campan.\n    *   \"HE\" addressed \"the issue of another's material possessions\" at the end of \"HIS work.\"\n    *   \"HE\" did this by \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **\"The prohibition against representation\"**: This is a very strong clue pointing to the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (The Ten Commandments), which forbids the making and worshiping of graven images or idols.\n    *   **\"Another's material possessions\"**: This points to the final commandments against stealing and coveting.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: This suggests that the commandments about possessions are the last ones in this figure's version of the Decalogue.\n    *   **\"Ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This means that in this figure's formulation of the Ten Commandments, the Second Commandment (against images) is either removed or, more likely, absorbed into the First Commandment (\"You shall have no other gods before me\"). This is a known historical variation in the numbering of the Decalogue.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Connect to History:** I need to find a figure who is famous for a specific arrangement of the Ten Commandments that does two things:\n    1.  Combines the prohibition of idols with the First Commandment.\n    2.  Splits the final commandment against coveting into two separate commandments (e.g., one for a neighbor's wife, and another for a neighbor's material goods).\n\n    This specific arrangement is known as the Augustinian or Traditional Catholic and Lutheran numbering. By combining the first two commandments (as numbered in the Jewish tradition), the prohibition against images is de-emphasized as a separate command. To maintain the number ten, the final prohibition against coveting is split into the Ninth and Tenth Commandments. This places the coveting of \"another's material possessions\" as the very last commandment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Figure:** The originator of this influential system of numbering the commandments is the highly influential theologian and philosopher, St. Augustine of Hippo. His work on the Decalogue established this tradition, which was later adopted by the Catholic Church and Martin Luther. Therefore, \"HE\" is Augustine of Hippo. Veronika Campan, as a scholar of the Decalogue's history, would certainly analyze and discuss his foundational interpretation.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** The request asks for a Python script that outputs the answer. The task is to simply print the full name I have identified.\n\n```python\n# The historical figure described is known for establishing a specific\n# numbering of the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).\n#\n# 1. He combined the prohibition against graven images (the \"prohibition against representation\")\n#    with the first commandment, thus \"ignoring\" it as a separate command.\n# 2. To maintain a total of ten commandments, he split the final commandment\n#    against coveting into two separate commandments.\n# 3. This places the coveting of \"another's material possessions\" as the tenth and final\n#    commandment in his schema, which is what is meant by \"at the end of HIS work.\"\n#\n# This specific tradition of enumerating the Decalogue was established by the\n# influential Christian theologian and philosopher from the Roman province of Africa.\n\nhis_full_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
