# The historical figure described is known for establishing a specific
# numbering of the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).
#
# 1. He combined the prohibition against graven images (the "prohibition against representation")
#    with the first commandment, thus "ignoring" it as a separate command.
# 2. To maintain a total of ten commandments, he split the final commandment
#    against coveting into two separate commandments.
# 3. This places the coveting of "another's material possessions" as the tenth and final
#    commandment in his schema, which is what is meant by "at the end of HIS work."
#
# This specific tradition of enumerating the Decalogue was established by the
# influential Christian theologian and philosopher from the Roman province of Africa.
