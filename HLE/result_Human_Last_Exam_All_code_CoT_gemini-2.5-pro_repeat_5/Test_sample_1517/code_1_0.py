def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    This function explains the solution to the topological group theory problem.
    The problem asks for the largest value of I_G, which is the minimized cardinality
    of the quotient group G / <A> over all discrete subsets A of G.

    Our plan is to show that the value aleph_0 (countably infinite) is attainable for I_G.
    Since the index cannot be larger than the group's cardinality (|G| = aleph_0),
    this will be the maximum possible value.

    We demonstrate this with a specific example group G.
    1. Define G: Let G be the direct sum of countably many copies of Z_2.
       This is the set of infinite sequences of 0s and 1s with finite support (finitely many 1s).
       |G| is countably infinite, which we denote as aleph_0.
    2. Define the topology: We use a metric d(x,y) = sum(|x_i-y_i| / 2^i).
       This makes G a non-discrete Hausdorff topological group.
    3. Analyze discrete sets: In this specific topological space, it can be proven that
       any discrete subset A must be finite.
    4. Analyze the subgroup <A>: Since A is finite and all its elements have order 2,
       the subgroup it generates, H = <A>, is also finite. Let's say |H| = k.
    5. Calculate the index: The index of the subgroup H in G is given by the equation:
       |G / H| = |G| / |H|.
    6. Conclude: Since |G| is aleph_0 and |H| is a finite number k (for any non-empty A, k>=2),
       the index is aleph_0. This holds for any discrete set A.
       Therefore, the minimum index I_G is aleph_0.
