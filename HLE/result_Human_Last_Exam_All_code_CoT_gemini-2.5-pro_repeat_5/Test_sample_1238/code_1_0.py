    This function explains the solution to the user's question regarding
    finite-time blow-up for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations.
    """
    explanation = """
The question asks if there is a smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data u_0 for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation such that the solution u blows up in finite time.

The definitive answer to this question is: No.

This is a classical, rigorously proven result in the theory of partial differential equations. For the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, given any smooth initial data (like the one described), a unique, smooth solution exists for all time. This property is known as "global regularity".

Key points:
1.  **Global Regularity in 2D:** It has been mathematically proven that solutions to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations do not develop singularities or "blow up" in finite time. They remain smooth forever.
2.  **Contrast with 3D:** This is in stark contrast to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Whether smooth solutions exist for all time in 3D is a major unsolved problem in mathematics and is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems.
3.  **Implication for Code:** Because it is mathematically impossible for such initial data to exist in 2D, no Python code or shell script can be written to find or construct it. The problem is answered by a mathematical theorem, not by computation.
