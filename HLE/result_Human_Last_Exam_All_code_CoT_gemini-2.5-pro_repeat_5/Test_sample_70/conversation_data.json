    "To solve this, I will first determine the rank of the Danish flag based on the provided assumption. Then, I will find all African national flags that share this same rank.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:** The problem states that the rank of each flag is maximal. The simplest and most direct way to achieve maximal rank for a matrix representing a flag is to have the rank equal to the number of distinct colors. The flag of Denmark has two colors: red and white. Therefore, under the given assumption, its rank is 2.\n2.  **Identify African Flags with the Same Rank:** My task is now to find all African national flags that are composed of exactly two colors.\n3.  **Create a Program:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores a mapping of African countries to the number of colors in their national flags.\n    *   Defines the rank of the Danish flag as 2.\n    *   Iterates through the African flags data and identifies which ones have a rank of 2.\n    *   Prints the names of the countries that satisfy this condition, explicitly stating that their rank is 2.\n\n```python\ndef find_flags_with_same_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds African national flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The rank of a flag is assumed to be maximal, which is interpreted as the\n    number of distinct colors in the flag.
