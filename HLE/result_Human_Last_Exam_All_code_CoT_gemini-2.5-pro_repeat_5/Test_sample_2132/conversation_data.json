    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. In the case of a cyclic ketone like 2-chlorocyclohexanone, the reaction leads to a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a five-membered ring, and the final product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (or its corresponding salt or ester, depending on the base and workup). We will use cyclopentanecarboxylic acid for our calculation.\n\n2.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** The Böttcher complexity is an information-theoretic index calculated using the formula:\n    `C = N * log2(N) - Σ(ni * log2(ni))`\n    Where:\n    *   `N` is the total number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   `ni` is the number of atoms belonging to the i-th symmetry equivalence class (orbit). Atoms are in the same class if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product's Structure:**\n    *   **Molecule:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   **N (non-hydrogen atoms):** It has 6 Carbon atoms and 2 Oxygen atoms, so `N = 8`.\n    *   **Symmetry Classes (ni):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the cyclopentane ring. This symmetry leads to the following equivalence classes of non-hydrogen atoms:\n        *   The single carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group: `n₁ = 1`.\n        *   The two carbon atoms adjacent to C1 (alpha position): `n₂ = 2`.\n        *   The two carbon atoms beta to C1: `n₃ = 2`.\n        *   The carboxyl carbon atom: `n₄ = 1`.\n        *   The carbonyl oxygen atom: `n₅ = 1`.\n        *   The hydroxyl oxygen atom: `n₆ = 1`.\n    *   The list of class sizes is `[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Complexity:** We will substitute these values into the formula and calculate the result using a Python script. The script will print out each step of the calculation, including all the numbers used in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the molecular properties based on the analysis of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n# Total number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 Carbons + 2 Oxygens)\nN = 8\n\n# Sizes of the symmetry equivalence classes (ni).\n# The order does not matter for the final sum.\n# {C_ring-alpha}, {C_ring-beta, C_ring-beta'}, {C_ring-gamma, C_ring-gamma'}, {C_carboxyl}, {O_carbonyl}, {O_hydroxyl}\nni_list = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the two main terms of the Böttcher formula.\n# First term: N * log2(N)\nterm1 = N * math.log2(N)\n\n# Second term: The sum of ni*log2(ni) for each class\nsum_term_parts = []\nfor ni in ni_list:\n    # math.log2(1) is 0, so 1*log2(1) is 0.\n    if ni > 1:\n        sum_term_parts.append(ni * math.log2(ni))\n    else:\n        sum_term_parts.append(0.0)\nterm2 = sum(sum_term_parts)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final complexity index.\ncomplexity = term1 - term2\n\n# Step 4: Print the detailed calculation as requested.\nprint(\"Calculation of Böttcher Molecular Complexity for Cyclopentanecarboxylic Acid:\\n\")\nprint(f\"Formula: C = N*log2(N) - sum(ni*log2(ni))\")\nprint(f\"N (non-hydrogen atoms) = {N}\")\nprint(f\"ni (sizes of symmetry classes) = {ni_list}\\n\")\n\n# Build and print the equation with substituted numbers\nequation_part1 = f\"{N}*log2({N})\"\n\n# We re-sort the list for a prettier equation printout, though it's not necessary for the calculation.\nsorted_ni_list = sorted(ni_list, reverse=True)\nequation_part2_terms = [f\"{ni}*log2({ni})\" for ni in sorted_ni_list]\nequation_part2 = \" + \".join(equation_part2_terms)\n\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\n# The equation string is constructed to show each number.\nprint(f\"C = ({equation_part1}) - ({equation_part2})\")\n\n# Print the evaluated terms\nsorted_sum_term_parts = sorted([p for p in sum_term_parts if p > 0], reverse=True)\n# Add the zero terms back for clarity\nwhile len(sorted_sum_term_parts) < len(ni_list):\n    sorted_sum_term_parts.append(0.0)\n    \nprint(f\"C = ({term1}) - ({' + '.join([str(p) for p in sorted_sum_term_parts])})\")\nprint(f\"C = {term1} - {term2}\")\nprint(f\"C = {complexity}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is {complexity}.\")\n```\n<<<20.0>>>"
