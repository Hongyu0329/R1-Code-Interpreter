    # - Infinitely large population (no genetic drift)
    # - Random mating (panmixia)
    # - Quantitative trait with broad-sense heritability (H^2) = 0.7
    # - Phenotype has no bearing on fitness
    # - No mutations
    # - No gene flow
    # - All genotypes have equal fitness (no selection)
    # - Diploid, sexual, non-overlapping generations
    # - Autosomal trait
    # - Researcher samples the entire population, split into west and east halves.

    # It also states: "All genotypes have equal fitness, with no selective advantage or disadvantage for any particular allele."
    # These two points are the definition of "no natural selection".

    # The prompt states there are "discrete and non-overlapping generations". This is a term in population genetics
    # models meaning the parental generation dies before the offspring generation is mature and ready to reproduce.
    # It does not make any claims about social behaviors like parental care during the offspring's youth.
    # We cannot conclude anything about parental care from the information given.

    # The prompt describes the conditions of the population as "currently true". It gives a snapshot in time.
    # It does not guarantee these conditions will persist forever. Future changes (e.g., a geographic barrier,
    # the start of mutation, a new selection pressure) could occur and lead to speciation.

    # Random mating across the entire region ensures that the gene pool is homogeneous. Allele frequencies will be the
    # same in the west and east. However, the phenotype is also affected by the environment.
    # The broad-sense heritability (H^2) is 0.7, which means 30% of the phenotypic variance is due to environmental variance.
    # The prompt does not forbid a systematic environmental difference between the west and east (e.g., a climate gradient).
    # Such a difference could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype.
