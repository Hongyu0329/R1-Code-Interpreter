    "Here is a plan to find the two languages that fit the user's criteria:\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints**: The core requirements are two languages from Asia, from different cultures with no significant direct contact, that share highly similar words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\".\n2.  **Handle \"Mom\" and \"Dad\"**: The words for \"mom\" (like *mama*, *eomma*, *amma*) and \"dad\" (like *papa*, *baba*, *appa*) are often \"nursery words\". These are based on the simple sounds babies make, so similarities can be found across many unrelated languages worldwide. This means finding a match for these two is relatively easy, but they must be paired with a match for \"broom\".\n3.  **The \"Broom\" Challenge**: The word for a common object like a \"broom\" is typically arbitrary and not shared unless languages are related or have had contact. Finding a coincidental or distantly borrowed match for \"broom\" is the key to solving the puzzle.\n4.  **Identify a Candidate Pair**: I will investigate language pairs that are geographically and culturally distant. The pair **Korean** (East Asia) and **Persian (Farsi)** (West Asia) is a strong candidate. They existed at opposite ends of the Silk Road, allowing for potential distant transmission of words without direct cultural contact, and their language families (Koreanic and Indo-European) are unrelated.\n5.  **Verify the Word Similarities**:\n    *   **Broom**: The Persian word is *jāru*. The Korean word is *bitjaru*. The \"-jaru\" part is a striking phonetic match.\n    *   **Mom**: The informal Persian word is *māmān*. The Korean word is *eomma*. Both are based on the classic \"ma\" nursery sound.\n    *   **Dad**: The informal Persian word is *bābā*. The Korean word is *appa*. Both use a repeated bilabial stop (`b`/`p`) and the vowel 'a', a common pattern for \"dad\" nursery words.\n6.  **Construct Python Code**: I will write a Python script to clearly print and present this finding, detailing the languages and the similar words.\n\n```python\ndef find_similar_language_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints two Asian languages with no direct contact\n    that have surprisingly similar words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\".\n    \"\"\"\n\n    language1 = {\n        \"name\": \"Korean\",\n        \"culture_location\": \"East Asia\",\n        \"words\": {\n            \"mom\": \"eomma (엄마)\",\n            \"dad\": \"appa (아빠)\",\n            \"broom\": \"bitjaru (빗자루)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    language2 = {\n        \"name\": \"Persian (Farsi)\",\n        \"culture_location\": \"West Asia\",\n        \"words\": {\n            \"mom\": \"māmān (مامان)\",\n            \"dad\": \"bābā (بابا)\",\n            \"broom\": \"jāru (جارو)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Finding two languages from different Asian cultures with no direct contact and similar core words.\\n\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n    print(f\"Selected Languages: {language1['name']} and {language2['name']}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Analysis of Word Similarities:\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    # Mom\n    print(f\"1.
