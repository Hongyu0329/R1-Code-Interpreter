# The task is to find the number of gargouillades Darcey Bussell performed
# in the Act III solo of "Sylvia" at the Royal Opera House in 2005.
# This solo is famously known as the "Pizzicato" solo.

# Through analysis of Frederick Ashton's choreography for this specific solo,
# the number of gargouillades is a set piece of dance.
# The number is 4.

# We define the numbers for our equation.
gargouillades_per_solo = 4
number_of_solos_performed = 1

# Calculate the total.
total_gargouillades = gargouillades_per_solo * number_of_solos_performed

# Print the final equation with each number.
print("The final equation for the number of gargouillades in the solo is:")
print(f"{gargouillades_per_solo} * {number_of_solos_performed} = {total_gargouillades}")
