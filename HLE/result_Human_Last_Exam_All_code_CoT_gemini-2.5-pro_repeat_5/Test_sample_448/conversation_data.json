    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases:** The stable noble gases in Earth's atmosphere are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), and Xenon (Xe). Radon (Rn) is also a noble gas, but it is radioactive and its concentration is not stable. Therefore, Xenon is considered the rarest *stable* noble gas.\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data:** I will use the standard atmospheric abundances for these gases, measured in parts per million (ppm). These concentrations are extremely stable over time, so the values from 2002 are effectively the same as they are today.\n3.  **Find the Rarest:** I will write a Python script to compare the abundance values and identify the gas with the lowest concentration.\n4.  **Calculate Percentage:** The script will then convert the abundance of the rarest gas from ppm to a percentage to answer the user's specific query format. The formula for this conversion is: `percentage = ppm / 10,000`.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name of the rarest stable noble gas and show the calculation used to find its percentage abundance.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest stable noble gas from a predefined list\n    of their atmospheric abundances, and calculates its percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the abundance of stable noble gases in Earth's atmosphere\n    # in parts per million (ppm) by volume. These concentrations are stable over\n    # decades, so the 2002 values are the same as today's accepted values.\n    # Note: Radon is the absolute rarest noble gas, but it is radioactive with a\n    # highly variable concentration. Xenon is the rarest stable noble gas.\n    noble_gas_abundances_ppm = {\n        'Helium': 5.24,\n        'Neon': 18.18,\n        'Argon': 9340,\n        'Krypton': 1.14,\n        'Xenon': 0.087\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances_ppm, key=noble_gas_abundances_ppm.get)\n    rarest_gas_ppm = noble_gas_abundances_ppm[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the percentage from ppm\n    # The conversion equation is: percentage = ppm / 10,000\n    rarest_gas_percentage = rarest_gas_ppm / 10000\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results, including the numbers in the final equation\n    print(f\"The rarest stable noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its atmospheric abundance is approximately {rarest_gas_ppm} parts per million (ppm).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation to convert its abundance to a percentage is:\")\n    # Using 'g' format specifier to handle scientific notation for small numbers gracefully.\n    print(f\"Percentage = Abundance in ppm / 10000\")\n    print(f\"Percentage = {rarest_gas_ppm} / 10000 = {rarest_gas_percentage:.9f}%\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Xenon>>>"
