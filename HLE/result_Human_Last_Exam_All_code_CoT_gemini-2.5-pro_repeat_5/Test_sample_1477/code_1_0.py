    This function determines the largest upper bound for the learning rate
    in gradient descent for the given logistic regression problem.

    The problem is to minimize a convex, L-smooth function R(w).
    The standard convergence theorem for gradient descent states that
    for such a function, the algorithm converges for any initialization
    if the learning rate gamma satisfies:
    0 < gamma < 2 / L

    The question asks for the largest upper bound M such that for all gamma < M,
    convergence is guaranteed. This M is the supremum of the valid range for gamma.
