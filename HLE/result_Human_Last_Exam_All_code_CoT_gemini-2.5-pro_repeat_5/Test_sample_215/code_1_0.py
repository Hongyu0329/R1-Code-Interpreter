    # The R script calls the function `generate_chemistry` separately for each group.
    # Let's analyze what happens inside one of these calls.
    
    # 1. A base set of peaks is generated. All specimens in the call are created
    #    using the same means in the `rnorm` function.
    #    For example: `peaks = lapply(1:n_peaks,\(m) rnorm(n_specimens, m, 1))`
    #    This means all specimens start from the same statistical foundation.
    
    # 2. A single baseline vector is created.
    #    `baseline = runif(n_peaks, 0, 1)`
    #    This ONE baseline will be used for ALL specimens within this single function call.
    
    # 3. The baseline is subtracted from all specimens.
    #    Since the function is called with a single treatment name (e.g., 'control'),
    #    the `for` loop runs only once, and the baseline subtraction is applied
    #    to every specimen in the dataset.
    
    # Conclusion: Because all specimens within the 'control' group generation
    # are subjected to the exact same generative process (same statistical distributions
    # and same baseline subtraction), they all represent random variations of a
    # single underlying chemical profile. Therefore, there is only one chemotype.
    num_chemotypes_control = 1
    
    # The same logic applies identically to the 'water_stress' group, which is
    # generated in a completely separate function call.
    num_chemotypes_water_stress = 1
    
    print("Based on the analysis of the data generation script:")
    print("The control group data is generated in a single batch, with all specimens sharing the same underlying statistical properties and baseline subtraction.")
