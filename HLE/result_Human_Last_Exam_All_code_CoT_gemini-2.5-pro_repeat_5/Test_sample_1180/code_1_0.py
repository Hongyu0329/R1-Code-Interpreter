# The user is asking for the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1 above 2.
# The valuation v is normalized to v(2)=1.

# 1. Start with the curve equation.
# z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1
# Reduce mod 2: z^2 = 1 (mod 2), or (z-1)^2 = 0 (mod 2).
# This is a non-reduced special fiber, a double line at z=1.

# 2. Perform a change of variables to resolve the singularity.
# Let z = 1 + 2*z_1. Substitute this into the equation.
# (1 + 2*z_1)^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1
# 1 + 4*z_1 + 4*z_1^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1
# 4*z_1 + 4*z_1^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
# Divide by 2:
# 2*z_1*(1 + z_1) = x^3*(x^2 + 1)

# 3. Analyze the new equation.
# The equation 2*z_1(1+z_1) = x^3(x^2+1) describes the next stage of the model.
# A double point (node) in the stable reduction has a local equation of the form XY = 2^k * U,
# where U is a unit and k is the thickness.
# The factor '2' in the term 2*z_1(1+z_1) is what creates the singularity that will be resolved into a node.
# The valuation of this factor gives the thickness of the node.

# 4. Determine the thickness.
# The valuation is v(2). The problem states v(2)=1.
# Therefore, the thickness k is 1.

thickness = 1

# Final equation representation is not directly applicable here as we are not solving
# an equation in the traditional sense, but determining a property of a geometric object.
# However, to meet the output format, we can represent the finding.
