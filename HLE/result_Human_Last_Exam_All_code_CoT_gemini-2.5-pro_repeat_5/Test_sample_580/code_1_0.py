    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms.
    # The patient has pain in the L4-S1 distribution, which is characteristic of sciatica.
    # An unremarkable X-ray suggests a soft-tissue cause, such as a herniated disc or piriformis syndrome.
    patient_symptoms = "Pain in the lower right extremity L4-S1 distribution."

    # Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis.
    # Piriformis syndrome is a key differential for sciatica-like symptoms, where the piriformis muscle
    # irritates the sciatic nerve.
    diagnosis_to_confirm = "Piriformis Syndrome"

    # Step 3: Understand the physical exam.
    # The physician is performing a resisted muscle test on the extended right leg to reproduce the pain.
    # This involves the patient actively contracting a muscle against the physician's resistance.
    exam_technique = "Resisted muscle test of the extended right leg."

    # Step 4: Identify the function of the piriformis muscle.
    # The primary function of the piriformis muscle is the external rotation of the hip.
    piriformis_action = "External Rotation"

    # Step 5: Conclude the confirmatory action.
    # To confirm piriformis syndrome, the physician would resist the primary action of the piriformis muscle.
    # If this action (resisted external rotation) reproduces the patient's specific sciatic pain,
    # it strongly supports the diagnosis. This is known as the Pace maneuver.
    confirmatory_action = "External Rotation"
