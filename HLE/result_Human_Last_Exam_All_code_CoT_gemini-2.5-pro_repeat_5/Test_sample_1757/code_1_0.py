def calculate_sum_of_ratios():
    """
    Calculates the sum over all natural dimensions of the specified ratio.

    The problem is solved by first deriving a formula for the ratio in a given dimension 'd'
    and then summing these ratios over d = 1, 2, 3, ...

    The formula for the ratio in dimension 'd' was derived as:
    Ratio(d) = (d+1) / (d! * 2^d * (1 + (d-1) * C_dist))

    where C_dist is the expected distance between two points on orthogonal axes,
    C_dist = E[sqrt(x^2 + y^2)] for x,y ~ U(-1,1), which evaluates to:
    C_dist = (sqrt(2) + log(1 + sqrt(2))) / 3.
    Note that log(1 + sqrt(2)) is equivalent to asinh(1).

    The code calculates this sum numerically. The series converges quickly, so summing
    the first 30 terms is sufficient for high precision.
