        "Introduction": "Fst is a measure of genetic differentiation between two groups. A high Fst value indicates that the allele frequencies at a given genetic marker are significantly different between the groups. In this scenario, the groups being compared are males and females from the same population.",
        
        "Analysis of the Correct Answer (B)": (
            "The most direct explanation for high Fst at specific markers between sexes is the presence of sex chromosomes, "
            "such as in XY or ZW sex-determination systems. Markers located on these chromosomes will naturally have "
            "different frequencies between males and females."
        ),
        
        "Example (XY System)": (
            "In an XY system (like humans):\n"
            "1. Females are XX and males are XY.\n"
            "2. A marker on the Y chromosome will be present in males but absent in females. The Fst will be maximal.\n"
            "3. A marker on the X chromosome is present in two copies in females but only one in males. This difference in gene dosage can lead to different allele frequencies and a high Fst."
        ),
        
        "Example (ZW System)": (
            "In a ZW system (like birds):\n"
            "1. Females are ZW and males are ZZ.\n"
            "2. A marker on the W chromosome will only be found in females, leading to high differentiation."
        ),

        "Analysis of Incorrect Answers": (
            "Other options are less likely:\n"
            "- A. Genetic Load: Refers to fitness effects, not directly the cause of differentiation between sexes.\n"
            "- C, D, E (Reproductive Isolation, Local Adaptation, Hybrid Zones): These phenomena explain differentiation between distinct populations, not between the two sexes within a single, interbreeding population."
        ),
        
        "Conclusion": "Therefore, finding markers with pronounced Fst between males and females strongly suggests these markers are located on the sex chromosomes."
