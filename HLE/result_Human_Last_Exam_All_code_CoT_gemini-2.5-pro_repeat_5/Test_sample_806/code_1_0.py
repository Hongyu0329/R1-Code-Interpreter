    print("The patient's development of skin blisters after starting a new anticonvulsant suggests a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).")
    print("\nThe biochemical process is initiated by a specific immune reaction to the drug:")
    print("\n--- Step 1: The Initiating Biochemical Reaction ---")
    print("The process begins with the non-covalent binding of the causative drug directly to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule on the surface of the patient's cells. This alters the shape of the HLA molecule.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: T-Cell Recognition ---")
    print("This altered 'drug-HLA' complex is now recognized as a foreign danger signal by the T-cell receptors (TCRs) of the immune system's cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Immune System Activation ---")
    print("This recognition triggers a massive and widespread activation of these drug-specific CTLs, causing them to multiply rapidly.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Tissue Attack and Damage ---")
    print("The activated CTLs release a powerful cytotoxic protein called Granulysin. This molecule is the primary mediator responsible for inducing widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis) of keratinocytes (skin cells).")

    print("\n--- Step 5: Clinical Result ---")
    print("The extensive death of skin cells causes the top layer of the skin (epidermis) to separate from the layer below (dermis), resulting in the formation of the characteristic skin blisters and sloughing.")
