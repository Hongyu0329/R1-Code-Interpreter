# Step 1: Define the number of terms and literals for c2 and c2' expressions.
# Expression for c2 = a1*b1 + a0*a1*b0 + a0*b1*b0
# It has 3 terms with 2, 3, and 3 literals respectively.
c2_literals_per_term = [2, 3, 3]

# Expression for c2' = a1'*b1' + a0'*a1' + a1'*b0' + a0'*b1' + b0'*b1'
# It has 5 terms, each with 2 literals.
c2_prime_literals_per_term = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

# Step 2: Calculate multiplications for each of the four parts of the s2 expression.
# s2 = (a2'*b2'*c2) + (a2'*b2*c2') + (a2*b2'*c2') + (a2*b2*c2)

# Part 1: a2'*b2'*c2
# The two literals a2', b2' are multiplied with each term of c2.
# So, the new terms have (2 + lit) literals.
# Number of multiplications for a term with k literals is k-1.
part1_mults = sum([(2 + lit) - 1 for lit in c2_literals_per_term])

# Part 2: a2'*b2*c2'
# The two literals a2', b2 are multiplied with each term of c2'.
part2_mults = sum([(2 + lit) - 1 for lit in c2_prime_literals_per_term])

# Part 3: a2*b2'*c2'
# The two literals a2, b2' are multiplied with each term of c2'.
part3_mults = sum([(2 + lit) - 1 for lit in c2_prime_literals_per_term])

# Part 4: a2*b2*c2
# The two literals a2, b2 are multiplied with each term of c2.
part4_mults = sum([(2 + lit) - 1 for lit in c2_literals_per_term])

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of multiplications.
total_multiplications = part1_mults + part2_mults + part3_mults + part4_mults

# Step 4: Print the results, showing each number in the final equation.
