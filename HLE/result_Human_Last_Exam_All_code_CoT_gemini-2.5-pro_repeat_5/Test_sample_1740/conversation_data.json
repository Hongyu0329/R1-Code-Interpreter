    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the members:** I will identify the canonical members of the human let-7 microRNA family. This family is defined by a group of microRNAs that share a conserved seed sequence. The members are well-established in microRNA databases like miRBase. The primary members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98, which is functionally and structurally part of the family.\n2.  **Create a Python script:** I will write a Python script to do the following:\n    *   Store the names of these family members in a list.\n    *   Calculate the total number of items in the list to get the count.\n    *   Print a clear message listing the members and stating the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_family():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the members of the human let-7 microRNA family.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The let-7 family in humans is comprised of several distinct microRNAs.\n    # The following list contains the names of the canonical members.\n    # Note: miR-98 is included as it's considered part of the let-7 family\n    # due to its high sequence similarity and related function.\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n\n    # Calculate the total number of members in the list.\n    total_members = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    # Print the result in a readable format.\n    print(\"The canonical members of the human let-7 family are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBased on this list, the total number of members is:\")\n    print(total_members)\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\ncount_human_let7_family()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
