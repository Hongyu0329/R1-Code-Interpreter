# This script solves for the missing Old Church Slavonic grammar form.
# The prompt asks for the "(3rd person singular plural, imperative, command or suggestion)" form.
# The term "singular plural" is a contradiction. Based on the pattern, it's assumed to be a typo
# for "3rd person plural, imperative".

# The verb in question is "бꙑти" (to be).
# The 3rd person plural imperative form (meaning "let them be") in Old Church Slavonic is "бѫдѫтъ".
