    This script calculates the value of S(n) mod p based on the derived recurrence relation and properties of modular arithmetic.
    
    The problem leads to a linear recurrence relation for S(n), the number of valid colorings.
    Let p = 23627. The key insight is that 510^2 is congruent to 203 modulo p.
    This simplifies the original 3rd-order recurrence relation to a 2nd-order one modulo p:
    S(n+1) = 202 * S(n) + 202 * S(n-1) (mod p), for n >= 2.

    The argument N = 23626 * (23628^100 - 23628^50) is a multiple of p-1 = 23626.
    Using the matrix form of the recurrence, v_n = M^(n-2) * v_2, where v_n = [S(n), S(n-1)]^T.
    Since N is a multiple of p-1, we can show that M^(N-2) = M^(-2) (mod p).
    This reduces the problem to calculating S(N) = (inv(202) * S(2) - S(1)) (mod p).

    We calculate the necessary components:
    1. p = 23627
    2. S(1) mod p: For n=1, there are no 2x3 subgrids, so all 510^2 colorings for the column are valid.
    3. S(2) mod p: For n=2, there are no 2x3 subgrids, so all (510^2)^2 colorings are valid.
    4. The modular inverse of 202 mod p.
    Finally, we combine these to get the result.
