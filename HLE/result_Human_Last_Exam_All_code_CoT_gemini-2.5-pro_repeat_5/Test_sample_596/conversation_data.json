    "This problem asks for a specific number related to the topology of the Möbius band. The number can be found using a known theorem from the field of combinatorial algebraic topology. My plan is to:\n\n1.  State the relevant theorem that connects the number of non-collapsing rooted forests to the homology of the underlying space.\n2.  Identify the specific topological invariants of the Möbius band needed for the formula. These are its first Betti number and the order of the torsion subgroup of its first homology group.\n3.  Use the well-known first homology group of the Möbius band to find these invariants.\n4.  Finally, write a Python script that uses these values to calculate the final answer according to the theorem, explaining each step of the calculation.\n\nThe theorem states that for a 2-dimensional simplicial complex $K$, the number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ where the forest $F$ does not simplicially collapse onto its root $R$ is given by the formula:\n$N = |\\text{Tors} H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})|^2 \\cdot \\beta_1(K)^2$\n\nHere, $H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the first homology group with integer coefficients, $\\text{Tors} H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$ is its torsion subgroup, and $\\beta_1(K)$ is the first Betti number (the rank of the free part of the group).\n\nFor the Möbius band, $M$, the first homology group is known to be the infinite cyclic group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nFrom this, we can determine the components needed for the formula:\n*   The group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is torsion-free, meaning its torsion subgroup is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. The order (size) of this subgroup is 1.\n*   The rank of $\\mathbb{Z}$ as a free abelian group is 1, so the first Betti number, $\\beta_1(M)$, is 1.\n\nI will now write a Python script to plug these values into the formula and compute the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_non_collapsing_forests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests of the standard\n    triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto the root.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem can be solved using a theorem from combinatorial algebraic topology.\n    # The formula for the number of non-collapsing rooted forests (N) for a 2-complex K is:\n    # N = |Tors H_1(K, Z)|^2 * beta_1(K)^2\n    # where H_1(K, Z) is the first homology group, Tors is its torsion subgroup,\n    # and beta_1 is the first Betti number.\n\n    # Step 1: Define the topological invariants for the Möbius band (M).\n    # The first homology group of the Möbius band is the group of integers, Z.\n    # H_1(M, Z) = Z\n    \n    # From H_1(M, Z) = Z, we can determine the necessary values.\n    # The group Z is free, so its torsion subgroup is trivial ({0}).\n    torsion_subgroup_order = 1\n    \n    # The rank of the group Z is 1.
