    "To find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5, we can write a program to systematically check all possibilities. The total number of strings of length 5 that can be made from the 7 given symbols is 7^5, which is 16,807. This number is small enough for a computer to iterate through in a short amount of time.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the code:\n1.  **Generate All Possibilities**: We will create every possible string of length 5 using the symbols `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`. The `itertools.product` function in Python is perfect for this task.\n2.  **Translate to Python Syntax**: For each generated string, we will translate it into a format that Python's `eval()` function can understand. This involves replacing:\n    *   `T` with `True`\n    *   `F` with `False`\n    *   `&` with ` and `\n    *   `|` with ` or `\n    *   `!` with ` not `\n    (The spaces around the operators are crucial to separate them from operands).\n3.  **Evaluate and Count**: We will use a `try-except` block to handle the evaluation.\n    *   The `try` block will attempt to `eval()` the translated string. This automatically handles operator precedence (`! > & > |`) and parenthesis rules.\n    *   If the expression is syntactically invalid (e.g., \"T&&F|\"), `eval()` will raise an error, which the `except` block will catch, and we will simply move to the next string.\n    *   If the expression is valid and evaluates to `True`, we will increment a counter.\n4.  **Print the Result**: After checking all 16,807 possibilities, the final count of true expressions will be printed.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of a fixed length\n    using a given set of symbols.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    length = 5\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of the given length\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=length)\n\n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        expression_str = \"\".join(combo)\n\n        # Translate the expression to a Python-evaluable string\n        py_expr = expression_str.replace('T', 'True')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', 'False')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the expression.\n            # We only care about boolean results.\n            result = eval(py_expr)\n            if isinstance(result, bool) and result is True:\n                true_expression_count += 1\n        except (SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError):\n            # This expression is not syntactically valid, so we ignore it.\n            continue\n    \n    # The final count is the answer to the user's question.\n    print(f\"Total number of true boolean expressions of length 5 is: {true_expression_count}\")\n\ncount_true_expressions()\n```\n<<<410>>>"
