    "This is a question from the field of topology, a branch of mathematics. The answer is a known result based on a classification theorem. There is no computational algorithm to derive the answer from first principles. Instead, I will write a Python script that presents the known classes and counts them to provide the answer, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  State the classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua.\n2.  Create a list containing the names of the distinct homeomorphism classes identified by this theorem.\n3.  Print each class name for clarity.\n4.  Construct and print an equation that sums the number of these classes to find the total.\n5.  Print the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution to the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on the known mathematical classification.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to the classification theorem by R.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
