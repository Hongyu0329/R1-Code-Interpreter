    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The starting material is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide. The reduction of a disulfide bond (R-S-S-R) breaks the sulfur-sulfur bond and, with the addition of hydrogen, yields two thiol molecules (2 x R-S-H). Therefore, the major reduction product is **perylene-3-thiol**.\n\n2.  **Represent the Molecule as a Graph**: To calculate graph-theoretical indices like the Szeged and Wiener indices, the molecule will be represented as a graph. The atoms (including hydrogens, as specified) will be the vertices, and the chemical bonds will be the edges. I will use the RDKit library to handle this conversion from a chemical representation (SMILES string) to a graph.\n\n3.  **Define Topological Indices**:\n    *   **Wiener Index (W)**: This is the sum of the shortest path distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the molecular graph.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz)**: For each bond (edge) `e=(u,v)` in the graph, we count the number of vertices closer to `u` (`n_u`) and the number of vertices closer to `v` (`n_v`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products `n_u * n_v` over all bonds.\n\n4.  **Calculation Steps**: The Python script will perform the following steps:\n    *   Define the SMILES string for perylene-3-thiol.\n    *   Use RDKit to create a molecule object and add explicit hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Compute the all-pairs shortest path distance matrix for the molecular graph.\n    *   Use the distance matrix to calculate the Wiener index.\n    *   Iterate through all bonds to calculate the Szeged index based on its definition.\n    *   Finally, compute the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index and print all the calculated values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef calculate_indices_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol.\n\n    The function performs the following steps:\n    1. Defines the molecule perylene-3-thiol using its SMILES string.\n    2. Adds explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecule, as required by the problem.\n    3. Computes the distance matrix (shortest paths between all atom pairs).\n    4. Calculates the Wiener index (W) by summing all pairwise distances.\n    5. Calculates the Szeged index (Sz) by iterating over each bond and applying its definition.\n    6. Computes the ratio Sz / W and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # SMILES string for perylene-3-thiol, the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide.\n    smiles = 'SC1=CC2=C3C=CC4=CC=CC5=C4C3=C(C=C2)C2=C1C=CC=C25'\n\n    # Create an RDKit molecule object from the SMILES string\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n\n    # Add explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecule graph\n    mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Get the total number of atoms (vertices in the graph)\n    num_atoms = mol_h.GetNumAtoms()\n\n    # Calculate the all-pairs shortest path distance matrix\n    dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_h)\n\n    # Calculate the Wiener Index (W)\n    # W is half the sum of all elements in the distance matrix.\n    wiener_index = np.sum(dist_matrix) / 2.0\n\n    # Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz)\n    szeged_index = 0\n    # Iterate over all bonds (edges) in the molecule\n    for bond in mol_h.GetBonds():\n        # Get the indices of the two atoms in the bond\n        u = bond.GetBeginAtomIdx()\n        v = bond.GetEndAtomIdx()\n\n        n_u = 0  # Counter for atoms closer to u\n        n_v = 0  # Counter for atoms closer to v\n\n        # For the current bond(u,v), partition all atoms in the graph\n        for w in range(num_atoms):\n            dist_wu = dist_matrix[w, u]\n            dist_wv = dist_matrix[w, v]\n            if dist_wu < dist_wv:\n                n_u += 1\n            elif dist_wv < dist_wu:\n                n_v += 1\n        \n        # Add the product of the partition sizes to the index\n        szeged_index += n_u * n_v\n\n    # Calculate the final ratio\n    if wiener_index == 0:\n        ratio = 0.0 # Avoid division by zero for single-atom molecules\n    else:\n        ratio = szeged_index / wiener_index\n\n    # Print the results in a clear format, including the numbers for the final equation\n    print(f\"Molecule: Perylene-3-thiol (C20H11SH)\")\n    print(f\"Number of atoms (including H): {num_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"Szeged Index (Sz): {int(szeged_index)}\")\n    print(f\"Wiener Index (W): {int(wiener_index)}\")\n    print(f\"Szeged/Wiener Ratio = {int(szeged_index)} / {int(wiener_index)} = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Execute the calculation\n    # Note: RDKit is required.
