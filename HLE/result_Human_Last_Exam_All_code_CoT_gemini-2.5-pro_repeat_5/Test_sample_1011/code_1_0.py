    print("### Step 1: Finding a Lower Bound ###")
    print("Let U' be the set of accumulation points of U.")
    print("1. Since U is an infinite set in the compact space N*, it must have at least one accumulation point. So, |U'| >= 1.")

    print("\n2. We can prove a stronger lower bound. Let's partition the index set N into two infinite disjoint sets, O (odd numbers) and E (even numbers).")
    print("   - This splits our set U into two infinite disjoint subsets: U_O = {u_i | i is odd} and U_E = {u_i | i is even}.")

    print("\n3. Let's define two large sets based on this partition:")
    print("   - P_O = union of all P_i for i in O.")
    print("   - P_E = union of all P_i for i in E.")
    print("   These two sets, P_O and P_E, are disjoint and their union is N.")

    print("\n4. In the topology of the Stone-Cech compactification, the sets corresponding to P_O and P_E, denoted Â(P_O) and Â(P_E), are both open and closed (clopen) and are disjoint.")

    print("\n5. For any odd index i, P_i is a subset of P_O. Since P_i is in the ultrafilter u_i, P_O must also be in u_i. This means all ultrafilters in U_O belong to Â(P_O).")
    print("   - Therefore, the entire set U_O is contained in Â(P_O).")
    print("   - Similarly, the entire set U_E is contained in Â(P_E).")

    print("\n6. Since Â(P_O) and Â(P_E) are closed sets, the closures of U_O and U_E must also be contained within them.")
    print("   - The accumulation points of U_O, let's call this set U'_O, must be in Â(P_O).")
    print("   - The accumulation points of U_E, let's call this set U'_E, must be in Â(P_E).")

    print("\n7. The set of all accumulation points U' is the union of U'_O and U'_E. Since U_O and U_E are infinite sets in a compact space, they must have accumulation points. So, U'_O and U'_E are non-empty.")

    print("\n8. Since U'_O is in Â(P_O) and U'_E is in Â(P_E), and these two 'hat' sets are disjoint, U'_O and U'_E must be disjoint.")
    
    print("\n9. This leads to our final equation for the lower bound:")
    print("   The number of accumulation points, |U'|, is |U'_O| + |U'_E|.")

    print("   Therefore, there must be at least 2 accumulation points.\n")

    print("### Step 2: Showing the Lower Bound is Achievable ###")
    print("To show that 2 is the smallest *possible* number, we must show that a configuration with exactly 2 accumulation points can be constructed.")
    print("1. This relies on a known (but non-trivial) result in the theory of ultrafilters: it is possible to choose a partition and a corresponding sequence of ultrafilters that has exactly one accumulation point.")
    
    print("\n2. We can apply this principle to our two subsequences, U_O and U_E, independently.")
    print("   - We can construct the partition sets {P_i | i is odd} and the ultrafilters {u_i | i is odd} in such a way that the sequence U_O has exactly one accumulation point, v1.")
    print("   - We can do the same for the even-indexed sets, constructing them so that U_E has exactly one accumulation point, v2.")
    
    print("\n3. As established before, v1 must lie in Â(P_O) and v2 must lie in Â(P_E). Since these containing sets are disjoint, v1 and v2 must be distinct points.")
    
    print("\n4. The total set of accumulation points for U is U' = {v1, v2}, which has a size of 2.")
    print("   This shows that it is possible to achieve exactly 2 accumulation points.\n")
