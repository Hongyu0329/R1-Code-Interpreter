    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Formula:** The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n`, denoted as `a(n)`, is calculated using the formula `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`. The `!!` symbol represents the double factorial.\n2.  **Define Double Factorial:** The double factorial of an odd number `k` is the product of all odd integers from `k` down to 1 (e.g., `7!! = 7 * 5 * 3 * 1`).\n3.  **Apply for n=3:** The request is for `a(3)`.\n    *   Substitute `n = 3` into the formula: `a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!! = (6 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n4.  **Calculate the Value:** Calculate `5!!`, which is `5 * 3 * 1 = 15`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will:\n    *   Set `n = 3`.\n    *   Calculate `k = 2n - 1`.\n    *   Use a loop to compute the double factorial of `k`.\n    *   During the calculation, build a string that shows each number in the multiplication.\n    *   Print the final equation and the result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n - 1)!!.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the value k for the double factorial, which is 2n - 1\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    # Initialize the result and a list to store the terms for the equation string\n    result = 1\n    equation_terms = []\n\n    # Calculate the double factorial of k by iterating from k down to 1 with a step of -2\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        equation_terms.append(str(i))\n\n    # Join the terms with \" * \" to create the equation string\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_terms)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculated equation\n    print(f\"The number of diagrams a(n) for n={n} is given by (2*n - 1)!! = {k}!!\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{k}!! = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n    return result\n\n# We need to find the value for a(3)\nn_value = 3\na3 = calculate_feynman_diagrams(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, what is a(3)?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
