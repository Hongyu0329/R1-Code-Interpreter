    "My approach is to analyze the sequence `ZXXCVYBN` by looking for patterns related to the standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The sequence appears to be constructed by interleaving two distinct sequences of letters.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Primary Sequence:** I'll establish that the main underlying sequence is the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, read from left to right (`Z, X, C, V, B, N, M, ...`).\n2.  **Identify the Secondary Sequence:** I'll identify the letters that are inserted into this primary sequence (`X`, `Y`).\n3.  **Determine the Interleaving Rule:** The rule for insertion seems to follow a numeric pattern. The secondary sequence letters are inserted after taking a specific number of letters from the primary sequence. I'll find this number pattern (1, 3, 5, ...).\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sequence:** I will use this rule to build the sequence `ZXXCVYBN` step-by-step.\n5.  **Predict the Next Letter:** Based on the reconstruction, I will determine which sequence the next letter comes from and what that letter is.\n\nThe python code below will implement this plan, demonstrating the logic and printing the next letter in the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by identifying and reconstructing the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The pattern is based on the QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    # 1.
