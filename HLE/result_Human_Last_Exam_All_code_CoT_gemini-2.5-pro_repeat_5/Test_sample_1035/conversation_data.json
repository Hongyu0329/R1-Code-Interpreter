    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges together form the complete graph $K_{35}$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\{H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k\\}$, and let $V_i$ be the vertex set of graph $H_i$. The problem asks for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the minimum number of graphs ($k$)**: First, we need to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of $K_n$. This is a known problem in graph theory. The minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover $K_n$, denoted as $b(K_n)$, has been studied extensively.\n    *   An upper bound is given by the number of *complete* bipartite graphs (bicliques) needed, which is $bc(K_n) = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. Since any biclique is a bipartite graph, we have $b(K_n) \\le \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n    *   A lower bound for $b(K_n)$ was given by Tverberg. For $n=35$, both bounds coincide.\n    *   For $n=35$, $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$. Tverberg's theorem also implies that $k$ must be at least 6. Thus, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is exactly $k=6$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total number of vertices**: The standard construction that achieves this minimum number of graphs, $k=6$, involves creating 6 *spanning* subgraphs. This means each of the 6 bipartite graphs uses all $n=35$ vertices of the original $K_{35}$.\n    *   In this construction, each graph $H_i$ has a vertex set $V_i$ of size $n$.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of vertices in this family of graphs is the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets: $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i| = k \\times n$.\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation**: We will use Python to calculate the result for $n=35$.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   $n = 35$\n*   $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = \\lceil 5.129... \\rceil = 6$\n*   Minimum total vertices = $k \\times n = 6 \\times 35 = 210$\n\nThis approach gives an achievable value. It is also the minimum possible because the standard construction that uses $k=6$ graphs cannot be improved by making the graphs non-spanning without leaving some edges uncovered.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of vertices in the complete graph K_n\nn = 35\n\n# Step 1: Find the minimum number of bipartite graphs (k) required to cover K_n.\n# This is given by the formula k = ceil(log2(n)).\nk = math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of vertices in the family of graphs.\n# The standard construction uses k spanning bipartite graphs, so each graph has n vertices.\n# The total number of vertices is the sum of vertices in each graph, which is k * n.\ntotal_vertices = k * n\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"The minimum number of bipartite graphs required is k = ceil(log2({n})) = {k}.\")\nprint(\"The standard construction uses k spanning graphs.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum total number of vertices is k * n, which is:\")\nprint(f\"{k} * {n} = {total_vertices}\")\n\n```\n<<<210>>>"
