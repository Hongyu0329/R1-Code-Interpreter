    # Point 3: Rga1 inhibition type
    print(f"- As determined previously, Rga1's inhibition is not reversed by substrate (kcat stays at {rga1_kcat}/second). Classifying it as an 'irreversible inhibitor' is a strong and valid interpretation of this data. This part is correct.")

    print(f"D: Incorrect. XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor because activity was restored from {data['XAG1']} to {data['XAG1_high_A']} with more substrate.")
