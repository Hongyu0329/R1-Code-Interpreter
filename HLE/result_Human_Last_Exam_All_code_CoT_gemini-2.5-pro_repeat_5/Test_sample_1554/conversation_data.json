    "Of course. I will identify the philosopher in question and then provide a Python script that prints the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first analyze the philosophical query to identify the key concepts: the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" and the decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n2.  I will cross-reference these concepts with the known works of philosophers from that school.\n3.  The specific philosopher who made this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n4.  I will then create a simple Python script that assigns this name to a variable and uses the `print()` function to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n# The key distinction is the decomposition of the concept of a \"hallmark\"\n# into \"symptoms\" (natural signs) and \"signals\" (conventional signs).\n\n# Step 1: Define the philosopher in question based on this specific contribution.\nphilosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\n# Step 2: Define the school of thought.\nschool_of_thought = \"Lviv-Warsaw School\"\n\n# Step 3: Print the final answer in a structured way.\nprint(f\"The philosopher from the {school_of_thought} who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals is:\")\nprint(philosopher_name)\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
