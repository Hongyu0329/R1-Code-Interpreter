    Analyzes statements about language model inference and identifies the correct ones.

    The final analysis concludes the following statements are correct:
    A) The combination of top-k and nucleus sampling is an intersection, which is the more restrictive set.
    C) Temperature Ï„ > 1 flattens the distribution, changing which tokens fall into the p=0.9 cumulative mass.
    E) Renormalizing a truncated distribution involves dividing all probabilities by the same sum, preserving their ratios.
    G) The combination of top-k and nucleus sampling is an intersection of the two sets, and intersection is commutative.
    M) Determinism in MoE models is achievable, though it may require specific framework settings like torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True) in addition to seeding.
    O) Different GPU architectures have physical differences that lead to minor variations in floating-point calculations, which can cause divergences in beam search.
    P) If expert pruning is non-deterministic, the model itself changes between runs, altering the output probability distribution and thus the nucleus set.
    Q) Even with deterministic routing, non-determinism in other components like attention can lead to different outputs.
    R) Variable sequence lengths can lead to different tensor shapes, which can cause PyTorch/CUDA to select different, non-bit-identical kernels.
    X) The order of summation in parallelized attention score calculations is not fixed, and floating-point addition is not associative, leading to potential variations.
    Y) Recomputing activations introduces another floating-point calculation step that is subject to numerical non-determinism.
