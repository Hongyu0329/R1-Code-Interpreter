    # Step 1 & 2: Define the principles of broadband CARS.

    print("1. CARS is a nonlinear optical process where pump (ωp), Stokes (ωs), and probe (ωpr) beams interact with a sample.")
    print("2. The process is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference matches a molecular vibration (Ω): ωp - ωs = Ω.")
    print("3. In broadband CARS, using a broadband beam (in this case, the pump) allows for the simultaneous excitation of a wide range of molecular vibrations.")

    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the information content of the signal.
    print("\n### Signal Generation and Information Content ###\n")
    print("The generated anti-Stokes signal has a frequency (ωas) given by the equation: ωas = ωp - ωs + ωpr.")
    print("By substituting the resonance condition (ωp = Ω + ωs) into the equation, we get:")
    print("   ωas = (Ω + ωs) - ωs + ωpr")
    print("   ωas = Ω + ωpr")
    print("\nThis result is key: each molecular vibration 'Ω' generates a signal at a unique and distinct frequency 'ωas' in the anti-Stokes spectrum.")
    print("Therefore, the resulting broadband anti-Stokes beam contains a rich spectrum where each frequency component corresponds to a specific vibration. This information is distinguishable using a spectrometer.")

    # Step 5: Evaluate the choices and provide the final answer.
