# Based on the analysis of the boundary value problem, the condition for the
# existence of a solution is that the initial values (x0, y0, z0)
# must lie on a sphere.

# The equation for this sphere is derived as:
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2
# where R^2 = 10^25 / 2.

# We need to find the surface area of this sphere.
# The formula for the surface area is: Area = 4 * pi * R^2.

# Define the components for the R^2 calculation from the derived equation
numerator = 10**25
denominator = 2

# Calculate the squared radius (R^2)
R_squared = numerator / denominator

# Define the components for the area calculation
factor_4 = 4
