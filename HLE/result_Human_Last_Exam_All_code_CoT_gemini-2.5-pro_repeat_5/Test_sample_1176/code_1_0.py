# The user wants to classify 10 geological statements as either "Consensus" (C) or "Debated" (D).
# My plan is to evaluate each statement based on established geological knowledge and then compile the results into a single string.

# Statement Evaluation Plan:
# (1) Morrison Formation: Evaluate its depositional setting in the context of the Sevier orogeny.
# (2) Metamorphic Core Complexes (MCCs): Evaluate the various hypotheses for their formation trigger.
# (3) Nevadaplano: Assess the general acceptance of a high plateau in Cretaceous Nevada.
# (4) Arizonaplano: Assess the specific hypothesis of a plateau formed by magmatic thickening in Arizona.
# (5) Laramide vs. Sevier location: Recall the fundamental spatial relationship between these two deformational styles.
# (6) Batholiths: Recall the textbook origin of the Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths.
# (7) Ignimbrite propagation: Evaluate the documented Cenozoic volcanic trends in the northern Cordillera.
# (8) Colorado Plateau uplift: Acknowledge the major ongoing debate about its uplift timing and mechanism.
# (9) Cascades Arc history: Compare the age of the modern high peaks to the ancestral arc.
# (10) Laramide cause: Evaluate the Shatsky conjugate hypothesis relative to other models for flat-slab subduction.

# Final verdicts for each statement:
# 1. Consensus (C): The Morrison Formation is a classic foreland basin deposit related to the Sevier orogeny.
# 2. Debated (D): The trigger for MCCs is highly debated, with slab windows, slab rollback, and gravitational collapse being major competing models.
# 3. Consensus (C): The existence of a high-elevation orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") in the Sevier hinterland is a widely accepted concept.
# 4. Debated (D): The "Arizonaplano" and its proposed formation by magmatic thickening is a specific, non-consensus hypothesis.
# 5. Consensus (C): The inboard (eastern) location of Laramide structures relative to outboard (western) Sevier structures is a fundamental observation.
# 6. Consensus (C): It is textbook knowledge that these batholiths are the roots of the Mesozoic Cordilleran volcanic arc.
# 7. Consensus (C): A southward sweep of large-scale silicic volcanism starting in the Eocene in the northern U.S. Cordillera is a well-documented pattern.
# 8. Debated (D): The timing and cause of Colorado Plateau uplift is a classic, major geological debate.
# 9. Debated (D): The modern high Cascade peaks are a young (Pliocene-present) feature; the ancestral Oligocene arc did not have the same "modern elevation".
# 10. Debated (D): While flat-slab subduction is the leading model for the Laramide orogeny, its specific cause (e.g., subduction of the Shatsky conjugate) is highly debated.
