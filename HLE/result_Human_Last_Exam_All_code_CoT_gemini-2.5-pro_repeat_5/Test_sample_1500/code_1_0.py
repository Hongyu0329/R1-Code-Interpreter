    # --- Analysis of Question (a) ---
    # (a) True or false: Every coadjoint orbit O_lambda of G admits a compatible
    #     complex structure, making it a Kähler manifold.
    #
    # Reasoning: This statement is True. A coadjoint orbit O_lambda of a compact
    # semisimple Lie group G is a homogeneous space G/K, where K is the stabilizer
    # of lambda. Such spaces are called generalized flag manifolds. It is a fundamental
    # result that these are complex projective algebraic varieties, and as such,
    # they always admit a Kähler structure. The Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form is the
    # associated symplectic form for such a structure.
    answer_a = "True"

    # --- Analysis of Question (b) ---
    # (b) For G = SU(n), with lambda in the Weyl alcove, is the second Betti number
    #     b_2(O_lambda) always given by n - 1?
    #
    # Reasoning: This statement is No. We can demonstrate this with a counterexample.
    # The formula holds for regular lambda, but fails for singular lambda.

    # For a specific choice of a singular lambda, the coadjoint orbit O_lambda
    # for SU(3) is isomorphic to the complex projective plane, CP^2.
    # The second Betti number of CP^2 is well-known to be 1.
    b2_of_counterexample = 1

    print(f"The proposed formula for the second Betti number is b_2 = n - 1 = {n} - 1 = {b2_from_formula}.")

    # --- Analysis of Question (c) ---
    # (c) If O_lambda is endowed with a natural equivariant Kähler metric, must the
    #     corresponding equivariant cohomology ring H_G*(O_lambda; R) be isomorphic
    #     to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph?
    #
    # Reasoning: This statement is Yes. A manifold with a torus action has a GKM
    # description if it satisfies two conditions: (1) the set of fixed points is finite,
    # and (2) the tangential weights at each fixed point are pairwise linearly independent.
    # For any coadjoint orbit O_lambda, the fixed points under the maximal torus action
    # are the Weyl group orbit W.lambda, which is finite. The tangential weights are a
    # subset of the positive roots of the Lie algebra, which are pairwise linearly
    # independent for any semisimple Lie algebra. Since both GKM conditions are satisfied,
    # O_lambda is a GKM manifold, and its equivariant cohomology has a GKM description.
