# (a) Condition for x^d a . r = 0
# Based on common patterns in quantum group theory, the condition often involves
# the q-parameter and the order of the group-like element.
# The expression for the action of x^d is often proportional to (1 - q^d).
# Thus, the action is zero if q^d = 1.
condition_a = "q**d = 1"

# (b) Expression for x^d . r
# Based on a model of a twisted derivation x.r = w(r - q*g.r)
# The d-th power of this action operator becomes w^d(r - q*g.r)
# Let's represent the action g.r as a function g(r)
g_r = sympy.Function('g')(r)
expression_b = w**d * (r - q * g_r)
# To match the output format, we replace g(r) with g*r in the string representation.
expression_b_str = str(expression_b).replace('g(r)', 'g*r')


# (c) Can xja . r be zero for j >= M?
# The action of x^j would be w^j(r' - q*g.r').
# This is zero if q^j = 1 (based on the reasoning for (a)).
# q is a primitive M-th root of unity, so q^j=1 if M divides j.
# This is not true for all j >= M (e.g., j=M+1).
# So, in general, the expression is not zero.
