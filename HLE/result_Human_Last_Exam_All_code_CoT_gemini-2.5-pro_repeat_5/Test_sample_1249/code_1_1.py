# Plan:
# 1. State the derived answers for parts (a), (b), and (c).
# 2. Part (a) asks for the condition under which x^d a . r = 0. Based on the context of q-deformations and Hopf algebras, this kind of identity is often tied to the q-parameter. The condition is that the q-parameter raised to the power of the order of the group-like element is 1.
# 3. Part (b) asks for the expression for x^d . r. A consistent model for the action of x that satisfies the given constraints is x . r = w*(r - q*g.r). Iterating this action d times yields the expression for x^d . r.
# 4. Part (c) asks if x^j a . r can be zero for j >= M. Based on the condition from part (a), this would be zero if q^j=1. Since q is a primitive M-th root of unity, this holds if M divides j, but not for all j >= M. Therefore, the answer is no in general.
# 5. The python code will print these results in the specified format.

# Final expressions:
# (a) q**d = 1
# (b) w**d * (r - q*g*r)
# (c) no

# Let's write the python code to print this.
# I need to print the actual expression including the variables.
print("(a) q**d = 1 (b) w**d * (r - q*g*r) (c) no")
