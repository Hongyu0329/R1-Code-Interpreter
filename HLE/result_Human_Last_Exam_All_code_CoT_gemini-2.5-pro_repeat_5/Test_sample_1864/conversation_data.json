    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider the controls required for proper instrument setup, compensation, and accurate gating. Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the total number:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one sample of your streptavidin beads with no fluorophores to measure autofluorescence and set detector voltages.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** For any multi-color experiment, you must correct for spectral overlap (spillover). This requires a separate control for each fluorophore you are using. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For sorting, the purity of your sorted population is critical. FMO controls are essential for setting accurate gates. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see the spread of fluorescence from all other fluorophores into the channel you are gating. You will need an FMO control for each of the five fluorophores.\n\nThe Python script below will outline these controls, explain their purpose, and calculate the total number needed for your experiment.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the experiment\n    num_colors = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # --- Control Calculations ---\n\n    # 1.
