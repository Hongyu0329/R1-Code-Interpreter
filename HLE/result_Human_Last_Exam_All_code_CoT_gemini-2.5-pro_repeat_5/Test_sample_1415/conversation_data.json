    "My plan is to first solve the integral analytically and then use Python to compute the numerical value.\n\n**1. Analytical Integration**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\nI = ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in the form ∫ (f'(x) / f(x)) dx, where f(x) = F₃(x). The antiderivative of f'(x) / f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\n\nTherefore, the definite integral is:\nI = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nI = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**2. Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits**\nFirst, let's find F₃(x):\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nNow, we evaluate F₃(x) at x=1 and x=0:\n*   For x = 1: F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n*   For x = 0: F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\nFor x in [0, 1], sin(x) ≥ 0, so e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1, which means 1 + e^(sin(x)) > 2, and F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) > ln(2) > 0. Therefore, we can drop the absolute value.\n\nThe value of the integral V is:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\nI will now use Python to compute the numerical value of V and then find the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate F3(1) and F3(0)\n# F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# The integral V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\n\n# Output the equation and the final result\nprint(\"The integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value is V = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is {final_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
