    "For the synthesis of a 100 amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, a single, direct synthesis method is inefficient. The length of the peptide makes standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) prone to very low yields and purification difficulties. The presence of an unnatural amino acid complicates purely biological synthesis methods.\n\nTherefore, the most helpful and standard technique for this challenge is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the plan for how NCL would be applied:\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100 amino acid target peptide sequence is first divided into two smaller, more manageable fragments. For example, Fragment A (residues 1-50) and Fragment B (residues 51-100).\n2.  **Fragment Synthesis:** Each fragment is synthesized independently using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This is a highly efficient method for peptides of this shorter length (~50 aa).\n3.  **Incorporate Unnatural Amino Acid:** During the SPPS of the relevant fragment, the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (AzF), is incorporated using its corresponding protected amino acid building block (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH).\n4.  **Prepare for Ligation:** The fragment that will be at the N-terminus of the final peptide (Fragment A) is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester. The fragment that will be at the C-terminus (Fragment B) is synthesized with a Cysteine residue at its N-terminus.\n5.  **Ligation:** The two purified fragments are dissolved together in solution. The N-terminal Cysteine of Fragment B chemoselectively attacks the C-terminal thioester of Fragment A, forming a native peptide bond and linking the two fragments into the full-length 100 amino acid peptide.\n6.  **Final Purification:** The final product is purified to yield the desired 100aa peptide.\n\nThis approach combines the power of SPPS for incorporating custom amino acids with a robust chemical method for assembling large peptides from smaller, high-purity pieces. The following script outlines these steps.\n\n```python\ndef synthesis_plan():\n    \"\"\"\n    Outlines the synthesis plan for a long peptide with an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_amino_acid = \"Azido Phenylalanine (AzF)\"\n    \n    print(f\"### Synthesis Plan for a {peptide_length}aa Peptide containing {unnatural_amino_acid} ###\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Recommended Technique: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Reason: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is inefficient for peptides over ~60 amino acids.\")\n    print(\"NCL allows for the assembly of long peptides from smaller, high-purity fragments, and easily accommodates unnatural amino acids.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-Step NCL Strategy:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Divide the peptide\n    fragment_a_range = \"residues 1-50\"\n    fragment_b_range = \"residues 51-100\"\n    print(f\"1.
