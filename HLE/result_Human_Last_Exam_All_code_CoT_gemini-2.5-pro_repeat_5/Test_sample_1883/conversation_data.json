    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The problem describes the thermal cyclization of a conjugated polyene, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an electrocyclic reaction. The conjugated system has 4 double bonds, meaning it is an 8π electron system.\n\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For an 8π electron system (which is a 4n system, where n=2), the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict that a thermal electrocyclization will proceed through a **conrotatory** motion.\n\n3.  **Explain the Formation of Two Products:** A single starting isomer undergoing an allowed conrotatory motion can only form one stereoisomeric product. The given reactant, (2Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, upon conrotatory closure, produces the **trans-isomer (B)**. The formation of the **cis-isomer (A)** implies that the starting material isomerizes under the thermal conditions to form another isomer, specifically (2Z,8Z)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, which then cyclizes to form the cis-product A.\n\n4.  **Use FMO Theory (Torquoselectivity) to Predict Ratio:** The ratio of the two products depends on the relative rates of the two cyclization reactions. The rates are determined by the activation energies of their respective transition states. FMO theory helps us understand the factors stabilizing these transition states. The key factor here is **torquoselectivity**: the steric preference for smaller groups to rotate \"inward\" during the conrotatory motion.\n    *   **Pathway to A (cis):** Starts from the (2Z,8Z) isomer. The lowest energy conrotatory path involves rotating the two terminal hydrogen atoms inward. This is sterically favorable.\n    *   **Pathway to B (trans):** Starts from the (2Z,8E) isomer. Any conrotatory path requires one bulky methyl group and one hydrogen atom to rotate inward. This is sterically disfavored compared to rotating two hydrogens inward.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The transition state leading to product A is lower in energy than that leading to product B. Therefore, A is the major product. We can quantify the ratio using the relationship `Ratio(A/B) = exp(ΔEa / RT)`, where `ΔEa` is the difference in activation energy. We will use a standard literature value for the steric energy penalty of rotating a methyl group inward versus a hydrogen, which is approximately `1.4 kcal/mol`. We'll assume room temperature (298 K).\n\nThe following Python code will articulate these steps and calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_product_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function predicts the product ratio for the thermal electrocyclization of\n    (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene using Frontier Molecular Orbital theory\n    and the principle of torquoselectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the reaction and governing rule\n    print(\"Step 1: Reaction Analysis\")\n    print(\"The reaction is a thermal electrocyclization of an 8-pi electron system.\")\n    print(\"According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 8-pi (4n) electron reaction proceeds via a conrotatory mechanism.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the formation of two products\n    print(\"Step 2: Origin of the Two Products (A and B)\")\n    print(\"The starting material (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-tetraene cyclizes via conrotation to form the trans-isomer (Product B).\")\n    print(\"To form the cis-isomer (Product A), the starting material must first isomerize to the (2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)-tetraene, which then undergoes conrotatory cyclization.\")\n    print(\"Product A (cis) is formed from the (2Z,8Z) isomer.\")\n    print(\"Product B (trans) is formed from the (2Z,8E) isomer.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Use torquoselectivity to compare transition state energies\n    print(\"Step 3: FMO Theory and Torquoselectivity\")\n    print(\"The ratio of products A:B is determined by the relative energy of the transition states.\")\n    print(\"Torquoselectivity predicts that the pathway with the least steric hindrance is favored.\")\n    print(\"  - Pathway to A (cis): The most favorable transition state involves rotating two small Hydrogen atoms inward.\")\n    print(\"  - Pathway to B (trans): The transition state requires rotating one bulky Methyl group and one Hydrogen atom inward.\")\n    print(\"The transition state for product A is lower in energy because it is sterically less hindered.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Define constants and calculate the ratio\n    # Delta_Ea: Energy difference between rotating a Me group vs. an H group inward (kcal/mol)\n    # This is the difference in activation energies between the two pathways.\n    delta_Ea = 1.4  # kcal/mol\n    # R: Gas constant in kcal/mol-K\n    R = 1.987 / 1000\n    # T: Temperature in Kelvin (assuming room temperature)\n    T = 298.0\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculating the Ratio\")\n    print(f\"The difference in activation energy (ΔEa) between the two pathways is estimated to be {delta_Ea} kcal/mol.\")\n    print(f\"The reaction temperature (T) is assumed to be {T} K.\")\n    print(f\"The gas constant (R) is {R:.6f} kcal/mol·K.\")\n\n    # Calculate the ratio using the Arrhenius relationship: Ratio = exp(ΔEa / RT)\n    # We use Delta_Ea directly as it represents Ea(disfavored) - Ea(favored)\n    ratio = math.exp(delta_Ea / (R * T))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe ratio of A:B is calculated as: exp(ΔEa / (R * T))\")\n    print(f\"Ratio(A/B) = exp({delta_Ea} / ({R:.6f} * {T}))\")\n    print(f\"Ratio(A/B) = exp({delta_Ea} / {R*T:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"Ratio(A/B) = {ratio:.2f}\\n\")\n    print(f\"The predicted ratio of cis-isomer A to trans-isomer B is approximately {ratio:.1f} : 1.\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer in numeric format:\")\n    print(f'<<<{ratio:.1f}>>>')\n\n# Run the prediction\npredict_product_ratio()\n```"
