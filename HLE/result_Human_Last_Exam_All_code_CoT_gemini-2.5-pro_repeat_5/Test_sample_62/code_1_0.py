# The riddle provides several clues to identify a specific word.
# 1. "THEM" refers to a category, which in this context is vegetables.
# 2. The preference for "peculiar shape" over "correct" points to a vegetable
#    that has both standard and non-standard forms, like a cauliflower.
# 3. The name starting with "Cafi..." is a phonetic clue for "Cauli...".
# Based on these clues, the correct name is Cauliflower.

correct_name = "Cauliflower"

# The following line prints the correctly spelled name.
# In the context of the riddle's instructions, we can consider the final word
# as the result of an "equation" of clues.
