    print("Ammonia (NH3) inversion is a classic example of quantum tunneling. The nitrogen atom is in a double-well potential, with the two wells corresponding to the nitrogen being on either side of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms. Quantum mechanics predicts that the nitrogen can tunnel through the energy barrier between these two wells. This tunneling splits the ground vibrational state into two closely spaced energy levels: a lower-energy symmetric state and a higher-energy antisymmetric state. The phenomenon of tunneling is observed if transitions between these two states are possible.")
