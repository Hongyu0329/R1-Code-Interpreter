Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. The fundamental requirement for tunneling is the existence of the double-well potential. The Pauli principle for bosons (spin-0 nuclei) still allows for the existence of both the symmetric and antisymmetric energy states that constitute the tunneling doublet.
