    # B) If Aristotle held that time could have no beginning, then Aristotle was wrong.
    # Bonaventure directly opposed the Aristotelian view of an eternal universe. Correct.
    b_is_correct = True

    # C) The Christian doctrine of creation entails a beginning of time.
    # For Bonaventure, creation 'ex nihilo' (out of nothing) necessarily means the world and time had a starting point. Correct.

    # E) There are strong philosophical arguments that time must have a beginning.
    # Bonaventure famously developed philosophical arguments against an infinite past, separate from his theological beliefs. Correct.
    e_is_correct = True

    # G) If time has no beginning that would mean that an actual infinite number of things exists, which is impossible.
    # This is a core part of his argument: an eternal past would imply an actual infinite number of past days or souls, which he held to be impossible. Correct.
    g_is_correct = True
    
    # H) It is impossible to traverse an infinite number of days.
    # This is another of his famous arguments. To have reached the present, an infinite succession would need to have been completed, which he argued is impossible. Correct.
    h_is_correct = True
