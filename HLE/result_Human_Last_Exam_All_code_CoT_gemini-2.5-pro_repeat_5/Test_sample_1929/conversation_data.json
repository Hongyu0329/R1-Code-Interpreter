    "The user is asking for the product of a chemical reaction. I will first determine the reaction type and then deduce the product's structure and name.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**:\n    *   Reactant 1: **Butadiene** (specifically, 1,3-butadiene, `CH2=CH-CH=CH2`). This is a conjugated diene, a system with 4 pi electrons.\n    *   Reactant 2: **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene** (`CCl2=CF2`). This is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile, a system with 2 pi electrons.\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Predict the Product Structure**:\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (butadiene) and dienophile (dichloro-difluoroethene) combine to form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the ethene derivative form the new ring.\n    *   The reaction mechanism involves the formation of two new single bonds and the shifting of the pi electrons to form a new double bond within the ring.\n    *   The product will have a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents from the dienophile (`-CCl2-` and `-CF2-`) will be attached to adjacent carbons in the newly formed ring.\n    *   Since 1,3-butadiene is a symmetrical molecule, there is only one possible regioisomeric product, regardless of how the dienophile aligns itself.\n\n3.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature)**:\n    *   The resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring with a `CCl2` group and a `CF2` group on adjacent saturated carbons.\n    *   To name it, we number the ring starting from the double bond to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). The double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    *   Numbering around the ring, the two `CH2` groups (from butadiene) are at positions 3 and 6. The carbons bearing the halogens are at positions 4 and 5.\n    *   The locant set for the substituents is therefore {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n    *   The substituent prefixes are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". According to IUPAC rules, when there's a tie in locant sets, the prefix that comes first alphabetically (\"chloro\") is assigned the lower number.\n    *   Therefore, the `dichloro` group is on carbon 4, and the `difluoro` group is on carbon 5.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n    *   The molecular formula is C6H4Cl2F2. Let's recheck the hydrogens. Butadiene is C4H6. Ethene derivative is C2Cl2F2. Product should be C6H6Cl2F2. My drawing was `CH2-CH=CH-CH2-C(Cl2)-C(F2)`. 2+1+1+2 = 6 hydrogens. The formula is C6H6Cl2F2.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the product of the Diels-Alder reaction between\n    butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the reactants and the product by their names\n    diene = \"1,3-Butadiene\"\n    dienophile = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\"\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n\n    # The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition\n    reaction_type = \"Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition\"\n\n    # Print the reaction details\n    print(f\"The reaction between {diene} and {dienophile} is a {reaction_type}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe overall reaction equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{diene} + {dienophile} -> {product_name}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Product Details ---\")\n    print(f\"IUPAC Name: {product_name}\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {product_formula}\")\n\n    # As per the instruction to output each number in the final equation,\n    # we highlight the locant numbers used in the product's name.\n    locant_numbers = \"4, 4, 5, 5\"\n    print(f\"The locant numbers in the product's name are: {locant_numbers}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\nget_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
