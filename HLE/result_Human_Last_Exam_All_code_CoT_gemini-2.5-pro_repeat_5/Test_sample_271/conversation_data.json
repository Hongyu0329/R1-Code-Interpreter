    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial:** The given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We first try to factor it. By grouping terms, we find:\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors, $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group:** We find the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   The splitting field of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n    *   The polynomial $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$. Its degree is 5, which is a prime number. A calculus check on its derivative $g'(x)=5x^4-9$ shows that $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots. A theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Thus, the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n    *   The Galois group $G$ is the direct product $S_5 \\times C_2$ if the intersection of the splitting fields $K_g \\cap K_h$ is just $\\mathbb{Q}$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is determined by the square root of the discriminant of $g(x)$. The discriminant is a large negative integer, not of the form $2d^2$ for some rational $d$. Therefore, the only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This confirms $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$, and so $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The order of $G$ is $|S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n3.  **Apply Galois Correspondence:** According to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Degrees:** We will use Python with the `sympy` library to find all normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$, calculate their indices, and list the possible degrees.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import SymmetricGroup, CyclicGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.group_constructs import DirectProduct\n\ndef solve_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the possible degrees of intermediate normal field extensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the Galois group G = S5 x C2.\n    S5 = SymmetricGroup(5)\n    C2 = CyclicGroup(2)\n    G = DirectProduct(S5, C2)\n    order_G = G.order()\n\n    print(f\"The Galois group G of the polynomial is the direct product S5 x C2.\")\n    print(f\"The order of G is {order_G}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe normal extensions L/Q with Q < L < K correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups H of G.\")\n    print(\"The degree of such an extension is [L:Q] = |G|/|H|.\\n\")\n    \n    # 2. Find all normal subgroups of G.\n    normal_subgroups = G.normal_subgroups()\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the indices for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups.\n    possible_degrees = set()\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the degrees based on the orders of normal subgroups:\")\n    for H in normal_subgroups:\n        order_H = H.order()\n        # We are interested in proper, non-trivial normal subgroups.\n        if 1 < order_H < order_G:\n            degree = order_G // order_H\n            possible_degrees.add(degree)\n            print(f\"Found a proper normal subgroup H with order {order_H}. The degree of the extension is {order_G} / {order_H} = {degree}.\")\n\n    # 4. List all the unique possible degrees.\n    sorted_degrees = sorted(list(possible_degrees))\n    print(f\"\\nThe list of all possible degrees for the normal field extensions L/Q is: {sorted_degrees}\")\n\nsolve_degrees()\n```\n<<<[2, 4, 120]>>>"
