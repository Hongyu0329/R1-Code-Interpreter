    "Based on paleontological research, the answer to this question can be found in scientific papers describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. I will provide a Python script that states this information.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the primary scientific sources that describe the anatomy of the *Irritator challengeri* skull. The most relevant paper is by Sales and Schultz (2017), which provides a detailed digital reconstruction.\n2.  Extract the specific information about the lacrimal recess from the paper. The paper states that this recess contains two large, distinct pneumatic foramina (openings which are a type of depression).\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this number in a variable.\n4.  The script will then print a clear, descriptive sentence that answers the user's question, including the number.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the number of major depressions found in the lacrimal recess\n# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri, based on published scientific research.\n\n# The number is based on the description of the skull, specifically the\n# presence of two large pneumatic foramina within the lacrimal recess.\n# Source: Sales, M. A. F.; Schultz, C. L. (2017). \"Spinosaurid paleoecology and extinction:\n# a new perspective based on the digital reconstruction of the type specimen of\n# Irritator challengeri (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\". Scientific Reports.\nnumber_of_large_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the final answer in a complete sentence.\nprint(f\"Based on scientific analysis, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_large_depressions} major depressions (specifically, large pneumatic foramina).\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
