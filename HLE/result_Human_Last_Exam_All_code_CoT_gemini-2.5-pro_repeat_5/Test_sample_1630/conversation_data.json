    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of a composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functions:**\n    *   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, so the degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Fixed-Point Equation:** The fixed points are the solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$. This can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n4.  **Upper Bound on the Number of Solutions:** By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Constraints:** We are given that the derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    *   Let's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Using the chain rule, we get $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$, and $g'(x) > 0$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n6.  **Possibility of Achieving 9 Fixed Points:** Now we need to determine if it's possible for a strictly increasing degree-9 polynomial to have 9 fixed points.\n    *   Let's consider the equation $h(x) - x = 0$. For this equation to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   The derivative is $(h(x) - x)' = h'(x) - 1$. So, the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $h'(x) = 1$, must have at least 8 real roots.\n    *   Let's determine the degree of $h'(x)$.\n        *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n        *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n        *   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n        *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n        *   Therefore, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial can have at most 8 real roots. This means it is theoretically possible for $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 real roots, which in turn would allow $h(x)-x=0$ to have 9 real roots.\n\n7.  **Final Check of Conditions:** We have two conditions for $h'(x)$: it must be positive everywhere, and it must be equal to 1 at 8 different points.\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial with a positive leading coefficient (which $h'(x)$ will have) starts at $+\\infty$ for $x \\to -\\infty$ and goes to $+\\infty$ for $x \\to \\infty$. To intersect the line $y=1$ eight times, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. The values at the local minima must be less than 1, and the values at the local maxima must be greater than 1.\n    *   The condition that $h'(x) > 0$ requires that these local minima must all be positive.\n    *   While constructing specific polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complicated, it is known to be possible to choose them such that the resulting $h'(x)$ has its local minima in the interval $(0, 1)$. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9. The following Python code demonstrates the crucial part of this argument: it constructs an 8th-degree polynomial that is always positive but crosses the line $y=1$ eight times. This shows that the conditions required for 9 fixed points are not contradictory.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef demonstrate_derivative_behavior():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that an 8th-degree polynomial H(x) can exist such that:\n    1. H(x) > 0 for all x (as required for h'(x)).\n    2. The equation H(x) = 1 has 8 distinct real roots.\n    \n    This is the key condition required for the original function h(x) = f(g(x))\n    to have 9 fixed points.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let's construct a polynomial H(x) such that H(x) - 1 has 8 roots.\n    # We choose the roots to be -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    # So, H(x) - 1 = c * (x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)(x-3)(x+3)(x-4)(x+4)\n    # H(x) - 1 = c * (x^2-1)(x^2-4)(x^2-9)(x^2-16)\n    # P(x) = (x^2-1)(x^2-4)(x^2-9)(x^2-16) is a polynomial with these roots.\n    # Let's expand P(x) = x^8 - 30x^6 + 273x^4 - 820x^2 + 576\n    p_coeffs = [1, 0, -30, 0, 273, 0, -820, 0, 576]\n    P = np.poly1d(p_coeffs)\n\n    # To ensure H(x) > 0, we need H(x) = 1 + c*P(x) > 0 for all x.\n    # This means 1 > -c * P_min.\n    # Let's find the minimum value of P(x).\n    # We find the roots of the derivative of P(x) to find the extrema.\n    crit_points = P.deriv().r\n    # Evaluate P at the real critical points to find extrema.\n    extrema = P(crit_points[np.isreal(crit_points)])\n    P_min = np.min(extrema) # Approximately -1285.4\n\n    # We need 1 + c * P_min > 0.
