The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test using a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on the media produced the "expected result" of no bacterial growth. The lab incorrectly interpreted this result as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in Batch 3 was active and effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added *before* the high-heat autoclaving process. The QC test was fundamentally flawed and failed to reveal this critical error, thus providing misleading evidence that made the laboratory believe the compromised batch was safe to use.
