    "My plan is to identify the geographic coordinates of Waskaganish, Quebec, and the nearest points on the borders of its neighboring provinces and territories. The primary candidates are Ontario and the territory of Nunavut, as Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick are significantly farther away.\n\n1.  **Get Coordinates**: I will find the latitude and longitude for Waskaganish, the nearby Ontario border on James Bay, and the closest island belonging to Nunavut in James Bay (Akimiski Island).\n2.  **Calculate Distances**: Using Python's `geopy` library, I will calculate the great-circle distance (the shortest distance on the surface of a sphere) from Waskaganish to the points representing Ontario and Nunavut.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated distances to determine which province or territory is closer and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport geopy.distance\n\n# Coordinates for the locations\n# Waskaganish, Quebec\nwaskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.487, -78.758\n\n# The Ontario-Quebec border meets James Bay at approximately longitude 79°31′W.\n# The closest point on the Ontario border is on the James Bay coast.\nontario_border_lat, ontario_border_lon = 51.467, -79.517\n\n# The closest part of the territory of Nunavut is Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n# We'll use a point on the southeastern coast of the island.\nnunavut_island_lat, nunavut_island_lon = 52.933, -79.450\n\n# Define the coordinate tuples\nwaskaganish_coords = (waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon)\nontario_coords = (ontario_border_lat, ontario_border_lon)\nnunavut_coords = (nunavut_island_lat, nunavut_island_lon)\n\n# Calculate the geodesic distance using the geopy library\ndistance_to_ontario_km = geopy.distance.geodesic(waskaganish_coords, ontario_coords).km\ndistance_to_nunavut_km = geopy.distance.geodesic(waskaganish_coords, nunavut_coords).km\n\n# Print the information used for the calculation\nprint(f\"Finding the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC ({waskaganish_lat}, {waskaganish_lon})\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Print the calculation for Ontario\nprint(\"Candidate: Ontario\")\nprint(f\"Closest Point (approx.): ({ontario_border_lat}, {ontario_border_lon})\")\nprint(f\"Distance from Waskaganish to Ontario border: {distance_to_ontario_km:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Print the calculation for Nunavut\nprint(\"Candidate: Nunavut\")\nprint(f\"Closest Point (Akimiski Island, approx.): ({nunavut_island_lat}, {nunavut_island_lon})\")\nprint(f\"Distance from Waskaganish to Nunavut: {distance_to_nunavut_km:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Determine and print the final answer\nif distance_to_ontario_km < distance_to_nunavut_km:\n    closest_place = \"Ontario\"\n    closest_distance = distance_to_ontario_km\nelse:\n    closest_place = \"Nunavut\"\n    closest_distance = distance_to_nunavut_km\n\nprint(f\"Conclusion: The closest province or territory to Waskaganish is {closest_place}, at an approximate distance of {closest_distance:.2f} km.\")\n\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
