# This program calculates the number of positive discrete eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.
# Based on the analysis of the operator and its mathematical context, the number of
# such eigenvalues is given by the formula n * (n - 1) / 2, where n is the dimension of the catenoid.
#
# The problem's use of cylindrical coordinates (r, theta, X^(n+1)) implies a 3D ambient space,
# which means the catenoid is a 2D surface. Thus, we set n = 2.

# The dimension of the catenoid.
n = 2

# The formula for the number of positive discrete eigenvalues.
num_eigenvalues = n * (n - 1) // 2
