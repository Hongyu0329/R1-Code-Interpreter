    "This is a classic geometry problem. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve it, presented as a Python script that prints the explanation.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Icosahedron's Properties**: First, I will consider the key geometric properties of an icosahedron, especially its symmetry.\n2.  **Interpret the Setup**: I'll break down what \"standing on one of its faces\" and \"half-filled\" mean in this context.\n3.  **Locate the Water Level**: Using the properties from step 1 and the conditions from step 2, I will deduce the exact location of the horizontal water surface.\n4.  **Identify the Surface Shape**: Finally, I will determine the shape of the icosahedron's cross-section at the water level, which gives the shape of the water's surface.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icosahedron_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the shape of the water surface\n    in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the shape of the water surface:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the icosahedron\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\")\n    print(\"Crucially, it possesses a center of symmetry.
