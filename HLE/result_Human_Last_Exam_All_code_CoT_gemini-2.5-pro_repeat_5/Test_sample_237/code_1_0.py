# Plan Step 1 & 2: Calculate the minimum memory size 'z'
# The number 100! has 158 digits. We must use an array to store it.
# The most memory-efficient approach is to use an array of `digit` (1D).

# Memory for the array to hold the 158 digits of the result.
# We declare `digit result[158];`
memory_for_array = 158 * 1  # 158 elements * 1D each

# Memory for helper variables in the C code:
# - char i;      // Loop counter from 1 to 100. `cent` (2D) is too small. `char` (3D) is needed.
# - char size;    // To track the number of digits in the array (up to 158). `char` (3D) is needed.
# - char j;      // Inner loop counter (up to 158). `char` (3D) is needed.
# - char carry;   // Carry-over in multiplication. Can go up to 999. `char` (3D) is needed.
memory_for_vars = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3  # Four `char` variables, each costing 3D

# Total memory 'z' is the sum of memory for the array and other variables.
z = memory_for_array + memory_for_vars

# Plan Step 3: Calculate the first 3 digits of 100!
factorial_100 = math.factorial(100)
# Convert the number to a string to easily extract the first three digits.
y = int(str(factorial_100)[:3])

# Plan Step 4: Output the results and the final answer.
