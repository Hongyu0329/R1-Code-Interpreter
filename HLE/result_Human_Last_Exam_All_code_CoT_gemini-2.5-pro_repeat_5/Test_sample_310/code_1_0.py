# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the properties of a laser beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM).
# 2. Determine how these properties affect the shape of the resulting proton beam.
# 3. Determine how these properties affect the energy of the resulting proton beam.
# 4. Combine the findings to select the correct answer and print the conclusion.

# Step 1: Define the laser property and its consequence
# Imbuing photons with OAM gives the laser a helical wavefront.
# This results in an annular, or "doughnut-shaped," intensity profile,
# with near-zero intensity at the very center of the beam.
laser_property = "Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)"
intensity_profile = "Doughnut-shaped (annular)"

print(f"Property of incident laser: {laser_property}")
print(f"Resulting intensity profile on target: {intensity_profile}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Determine the effect on the proton beam's profile
# Protons are accelerated by an electric field created by hot electrons.
# A doughnut-shaped laser heats electrons in a ring.
# This ring of hot electrons creates a corresponding ring-shaped accelerating field.
# This field pushes protons not just forward but also radially outward from the center.
# The result is a more spread-out or hollowed-out proton beam.
beam_profile_effect = "Dispersion"

print(f"Effect of an annular heating source on the proton beam profile:")
print(f"The protons are pushed outwards from the center, causing {beam_profile_effect}.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Determine the effect on the proton beam's energy
# For a given total laser pulse energy, spreading it into a ring lowers the peak intensity
# compared to focusing it all into a single spot (like a standard Gaussian beam).
# The maximum energy of accelerated protons is highly sensitive to the laser's peak intensity.
# Lower peak intensity leads to less efficient acceleration.
proton_energy_effect = "Decreases"

print(f"Effect of reduced peak intensity on proton energy:")
print(f"Less efficient acceleration means the maximum proton energy {proton_energy_effect}.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 4: Final Conclusion
# The final result is the combination of the two effects.
# This section fulfills the requirement to "output each number in the final equation"
# by printing the final textual conclusion.
print("Final Equation/Conclusion:")
print(f"Proton Beam Effect = {beam_profile_effect} and Proton Energy {proton_energy_effect}")
