    This script illustrates the principle of applying a rule to all members of a set.

    Plan:
    1. Define a domain of objects (a list of numbers).
    2. Define a predicate rule 'F(x)' as an equation: x * 3 - 5 >= 10.
    3. Demonstrate understanding of 'Fa' by applying the rule to a single number 'a' from the domain.
    4. Systematically check if the rule 'F(x)' holds true for all 'x' in the domain (evaluating '∀x Fx').
    5. For each check, print the full equation with the specific numbers to show the process.
    6. Print a final conclusion stating whether the rule holds for the entire domain.
