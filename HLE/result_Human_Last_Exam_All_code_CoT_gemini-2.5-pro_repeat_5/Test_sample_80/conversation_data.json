    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares** on a standard 8x8 chessboard. An 8x8 board has 4 sides, each with 8 squares. Since the 4 corner squares are counted in two sides each, we must subtract them once to avoid overcounting. The formula is `(8 * 4) - 4`.\n2.  **Understand bishop movement.** Bishops attack only along diagonals, meaning a bishop on a white square can only attack pieces on other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on other black squares.\n3.  **Determine the optimal placement strategy.** To place the maximum number of bishops on the edge without any of them threatening each other, you can place one bishop on every edge square of a single color (e.g., all the white edge squares).\n4.  **Count the number of edge squares by color.** The total number of edge squares (28) is split evenly between the two colors, meaning there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n5.  **Calculate the maximum number of bishops.** The maximum number of bishops that can be placed is equal to the number of edge squares of one color, which is 14.\n6.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares.** This is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops placed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing\n    the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\n    # There are 8 squares on each of the 4 sides, but the 4 corners are counted twice.\n    side_length = 8\n    corners = 4\n    total_edge_squares = (side_length * 4) - corners\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge.\n    # To maximize the number of non-attacking bishops, we can place them on all\n    # edge squares of a single color.
