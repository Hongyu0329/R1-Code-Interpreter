    "Here is my plan to answer the question:\n\n1.  I will first establish the date of death for Blanche of Lancaster.\n2.  Next, I will research Geoffrey Chaucer's historical records to determine his whereabouts during that specific year.\n3.  I will look for any primary evidence, such as Chaucer's own writings, that might place him in a specific location around the time of her death.\n4.  Based on this information, I will write a Python script that prints the step-by-step reasoning and concludes with the most likely location.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the reasoning to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the date of death for Blanche of Lancaster.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Chaucer's location and role in that year.\n    print(f\"During {year_of_death}, Geoffrey Chaucer was serving in the court of King Edward III in England.\")\n    print(\"He was an esquire in the royal household, and records from this period place him in England, not on diplomatic missions abroad.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Present literary evidence.\n    print(\"Chaucer's first major poem, 'The Book of the Duchess', is an elegy written for Blanche of Lancaster.\")\n    print(\"This poem was likely commissioned by Blanche's husband, John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's patron.\")\n    print(\"This strong connection to the events surrounding her death within the English court is compelling evidence of his presence.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Based on his service to the royal court and the writing of 'The Book of the Duchess', Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\n\nsolve_historical_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
