    print("He was an esquire in the royal household, and records from this period place him in England, not on diplomatic missions abroad.")

    # Step 3: Present literary evidence.
    print("Chaucer's first major poem, 'The Book of the Duchess', is an elegy written for Blanche of Lancaster.")
    print("This poem was likely commissioned by Blanche's husband, John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's patron.")
    print("This strong connection to the events surrounding her death within the English court is compelling evidence of his presence.")

    # Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.
