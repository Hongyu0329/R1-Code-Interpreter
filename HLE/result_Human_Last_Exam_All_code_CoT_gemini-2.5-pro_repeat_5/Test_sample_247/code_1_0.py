    This function conceptually demonstrates the primer design strategy for
    TCR CDR3 region enrichment PCR as described in the correct answer.

    The TCR beta chain mRNA is structured as:
    5' UTR - Leader - V-gene - D-gene - J-gene - C-gene - 3' UTR - Poly(A) tail
    The CDR3 region is formed at the junction of V, D, and J segments.

    To amplify the CDR3 region, we need primers that flank it.
