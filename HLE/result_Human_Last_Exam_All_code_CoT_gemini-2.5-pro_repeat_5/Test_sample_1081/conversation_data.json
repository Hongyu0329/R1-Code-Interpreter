    "To find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group**: The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ is the set $\\{g^{-1} w F(g) \\mid g \\in W\\}$, where $F$ is the action of the Frobenius endomorphism on $W$.\n\n2.  **Specialize to Type $E_8$**: The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of the split form. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group ($F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W$).\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: When the Frobenius action is trivial, the $F$-conjugacy classes simplify to the ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **The Computation**: The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a large and complex group. Its order is $|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600$. While the order can be computed from a formula, calculating the number of its conjugacy classes from scratch is a highly non-trivial task. This number was famously computed by R. W. Carter in 1972 and is a well-established result in mathematics.\n\nThe following Python code first demonstrates a calculation related to $W(E_8)$ by computing its order. Then, it provides the known result for the number of conjugacy classes, which answers your question.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a group of type E8 is equal to the\n# number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, W(E8).\n\n# For context, we first compute the order of W(E8).\n# This is calculated from the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the group.\n# The degrees (d_i) are related to the exponents (m_i) by the formula d_i = m_i + 1.\n\n# The exponents for the E8 root system are:\nexponents_E8 = [1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\n\n# The degrees of the fundamental invariants are:\ndegrees_E8 = [m + 1 for m in exponents_E8]\n\n# The order of W(E8) is the product of these degrees.\norder_W_E8 = math.prod(degrees_E8)\n\nprint(\"For context, let's compute the order of the Weyl group W(E8).\")\nprint(f\"The degrees of the fundamental invariants of E8 are: {degrees_E8}\")\ndegree_str = \" * \".join(map(str, degrees_E8))\nprint(f\"The order |W(E8)| is the product of the degrees:\")\nprint(f\"|W(E8)| = {degree_str} = {order_W_E8}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# The number of conjugacy classes of W(E8) gives the number of maximal tori.\n# This result is a known fact from the theory of reflection groups.\nnum_tori = 112\n\n# The final answer is given by the following equation:\nprint(\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori in G(E8) = Number of conjugacy classes in W(E8)\")\nprint(f\"Number of conjugacy classes in W(E8) = {num_tori}\")\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
