    "My plan is to demonstrate which condition is violated by using a logical proof framed within a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The question is about \"Critical-Level Views\" in population ethics and a specific condition from Arrhenius's impossibility theorems that they violate.\n2.  **Define Critical-Level Views:** A population's value is the sum of individual utilities, but only after subtracting a constant \"critical level\" (`c`) from each person's utility. So, Value = Σ(uᵢ - c). Adding a person is good only if their utility `u` is greater than `c`.\n3.  **Define the condition to be tested:** I will test the \"General Non-Extreme Priority\" (GNEP) condition. GNEP states that for any three welfare levels `w1 > w2 > w3`, there's always *some* number `n` of people with welfare `w3` that would constitute a better population than one with a single person at `w1` and another at `w2`. This captures the intuition that a large quantity of \"good enough\" lives can outweigh a small quantity of \"very good\" lives.\n4.  **Construct the proof:** I will set up a scenario where the critical level `c` is between `w2` and `w3` (i.e., `w1 > w2 > c > w3 > 0`).\n5.  **Calculate population values:**\n    *   Calculate the value of Population A (one person at `w1`, one at `w2`). This value will be positive.\n    *   Calculate the value of Population B (`n` people at `w3`). Because `w3` is below the critical level `c`, the value contribution of each person (`w3 - c`) will be negative.\n6.  **Show the violation:** The total value of Population B will therefore always be negative, and will become *more* negative as `n` increases. A negative value can never be greater than the positive value of Population A.\n7.  **Conclusion:** This shows that for this choice of welfare levels, there is no `n` for which Population B is better than Population A, which is a direct violation of General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n```python\ndef solve_arrhenius_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem\n    is violated by Critical-Level views in population ethics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing Critical-Level Views against Arrhenius's conditions.\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # 1.
