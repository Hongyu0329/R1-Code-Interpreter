    # --- Part 1: Constant Precision Transformers ---
    print("\nQuestion 1: What is the complexity class of constant precision transformers?\n")
    print("Answer: TC0\n")
    print("### Explanation ###")
    print("1. A transformer model is built from a constant number of layers (e.g., attention, feed-forward networks).")
    print("2. The complexity class TC0 represents problems solvable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, using threshold gates.")
    print("3. When using *constant precision* arithmetic, all numbers are represented by a constant number of bits.")
    print("4. Under this constraint, fundamental operations within a transformer can be implemented in TC0:")
    print("   - Multiplication and addition of constant-precision numbers are in TC0.")
    print("   - Activation functions like ReLU (max(0, x)) are in TC0.")
    print("   - More complex functions like Softmax (involving exponentiation and division) can be approximated with sufficient accuracy by TC0 circuits when precision is constant.")
    print("5. Since a standard transformer has a fixed, constant number of layers, the entire model is a constant-depth composition of TC0-computable functions.")
    print("6. The composition of a constant number of TC0 functions is still in TC0. Therefore, a constant-precision transformer is in TC0.")

    # --- Part 2: Polynomial Steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ---
    print("\nQuestion 2: If we allow polynomial steps of chain-of-thought reasoning, what complexity class does it represent?\n")
    print("Answer: P-complete (The class of solvable problems is P)\n")
    print("### Explanation ###")
    print("1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is an iterative process. We can model it as:")
    print("   State_{t+1} = Transformer_Function(State_t)")
    print("   where 't' runs for a polynomial number of steps.")
    print("2. From Part 1, we established that the Transformer_Function is in TC0.")
    print("3. This model, which iterates a TC0 function for a polynomial number of steps, is powerful. We can show it is equivalent to a polynomial-time Turing Machine, which defines the class P.")
    print("4. Here's how the simulation works:")
    print("   a. The state of a Turing Machine (TM)—its tape contents, head position, and internal state—can be encoded into a single, polynomial-length vector. This vector becomes the 'State' in our iterative model.")
    print("   b. A single step of a TM is a simple, local update based on the current state and the symbol under the tape head. This update rule can be implemented by a TC0 circuit.")
    print("   c. Therefore, the transformer can be configured to perform exactly one step of a TM simulation in a single forward pass.")
    print("5. By applying the transformer function for a polynomial number of steps (the CoT process), we can simulate a TM for a polynomial number of steps.")
    print("6. This means the model can solve any problem that a polynomial-time TM can solve. By definition, this is the class P. Since it can solve the hardest problems in P, it is P-complete.")
