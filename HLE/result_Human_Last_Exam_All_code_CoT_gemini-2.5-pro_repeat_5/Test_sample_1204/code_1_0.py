Clinical Analysis:
The patient's heavy, daily cannabis use is the most significant factor currently confounding his treatment. It likely worsens his anxiety and is a primary cause of his insomnia, despite his belief to the contrary. Therefore, addressing this is the top priority.

Evaluating the options:
I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis: Essential first step. This addresses the likely root of his current insomnia and worsening anxiety.
II. Detox off all psych meds: Dangerous and inappropriate. Abrupt cessation would lead to withdrawal and destabilization.
III. Order a urine drug test: Medically necessary. It provides objective data on substance use, which is critical for diagnosis and safe prescribing, especially given his request for stimulants.
IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia: A safe, low-risk, and appropriate intervention to address his chief complaint of severe insomnia while other issues are being managed.
V. Change AUD medications: Not a priority. His AUD is in remission, so the current treatment is working.
VI. Start atomoxetine: The patient is already on this medication. Addressing "questionable ADHD" is a lower priority than active substance use and severe insomnia.

Conclusion:
The three most appropriate and immediate priorities are to counsel the patient on cannabis cessation, obtain a urine drug test for a comprehensive and objective assessment, and offer a safe intervention for his debilitating insomnia.
