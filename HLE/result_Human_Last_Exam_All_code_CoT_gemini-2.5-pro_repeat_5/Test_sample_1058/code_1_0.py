# Step 1: Define the experimental values from the text.
ps_alcohol_pref = -0.38  # mV, PS amplitude in alcohol-preferring rats
ps_sucrose_pref = -0.17  # mV, PS amplitude in sucrose-preferring rats

ps_shRNA_knockdown = -0.37 # mV, PS amplitude in sucrose-preferring rats with Slc6a11 knockdown
ps_control_vector = -0.16 # mV, PS amplitude in sucrose-preferring rats with control vector

# Step 2: Analyze neuronal activity by comparing PS amplitudes.
print("--- Analysis of Neuronal Activity ---")
print(f"PS amplitude in alcohol-preferring rats: {ps_alcohol_pref} mV")
print(f"PS amplitude in sucrose-preferring rats: {ps_sucrose_pref} mV")
if abs(ps_alcohol_pref) > abs(ps_sucrose_pref):
    print("Conclusion: The magnitude of the PS is greater in alcohol-preferring rats, indicating INCREASED neuronal activity/excitability.")
else:
    print("Conclusion: The magnitude of the PS is smaller in alcohol-preferring rats, indicating DECREASED neuronal activity/excitability.")

# Step 3: Analyze the gene knockdown experiment.
print("\n--- Analysis of Gene Knockdown Experiment ---")
print(f"PS amplitude after Slc6a11 knockdown in sucrose-preferring rats: {ps_shRNA_knockdown} mV")
print("This value is very similar to the PS amplitude of alcohol-preferring rats (-0.38 mV).")
print("Conclusion: Reduced function of the Slc6a11 gene mimics the alcohol-preferring state.")

# Step 4: Infer the molecular mechanism related to GABA.
print("\n--- Inference on GABA Levels and Tonic Inhibition ---")
print("The Slc6a11 gene codes for a GABA transporter that removes GABA from the extracellular space.")
print("Reduced Slc6a11 function (as suggested by the knockdown experiment) leads to less GABA removal.")
print("Conclusion 1: The extracellular level of GABA is HIGHER in alcohol-preferring rats.")
print("Tonic inhibition is caused by extracellular GABA.")
print("Conclusion 2: Alcohol-preferring rats have INCREASED tonic inhibition.")

# Step 5: Evaluate a potential therapeutic strategy.
print("\n--- Evaluation of Therapeutic Strategy ---")
print("The alcohol-preferring state is associated with abnormally high GABA signaling.")
print("To counteract this, a drug that BLOCKS GABA effects would be logical.")
print("Conclusion: A GABA receptor ANTAGONIST (not agonist) may decrease alcohol self-administration.")

# Step 6: Select the best answer choice based on the conclusions.
print("\n--- Final Answer Selection ---")
print("We are looking for an option that states:")
print("1. Increased neuronal activity in alcohol-preferring rats.")
print("2. GABA receptor ANTAGONISTS as a potential treatment.")
print("3. Higher extracellular GABA in alcohol-preferring rats.")
print("4. Increased tonic inhibition in alcohol-preferring rats.")
print("\nOption G matches all these conclusions.")

# Final Answer
final_answer = "G. Alcohol-preferring rats show incresed neuronal activity in the amygdala. GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol by alcohol-preferring rats. The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats. Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala compared to alcohol-preferring inhibition"
