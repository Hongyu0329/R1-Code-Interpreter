    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define the Cubes:** We first define the coordinate boundaries for each of the two cubes.\n    *   The first cube is a standard unit cube. We can place it at the origin, so its coordinates range from 0 to 1 on each of the x, y, and z axes.\n    *   The second cube is identical but shifted. A shift of 1/2 along the main diagonal (from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1)) is equivalent to a shift of 1/2 along each of the x, y, and z axes. Therefore, its coordinates range from 0.5 to 1.5 on each axis.\n2.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection of these two cubes is the region where their volumes overlap. To find this, we find the overlapping range for each axis.\n    *   For the x-axis, the overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n    *   This is the same for the y and z axes.\n3.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection forms a new, smaller cube. The side length of this cube is the length of the overlapping range, which is `1 - 0.5 = 0.5`. The volume is then the side length cubed.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the volume.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the cubes and the shift.\n# The side length of the original cubes.\ncube_side_length = 1.0\n# The shift along each axis.\nshift_distance = 0.5\n\n# The first cube's boundaries are [0, 1] on each axis.\ncube1_min = 0.0\ncube1_max = cube_side_length\n\n# The second cube's boundaries are shifted by 0.5 on each axis.\ncube2_min = shift_distance\ncube2_max = cube_side_length + shift_distance\n\n# Step 2: Find the boundaries of the intersection.\n# The intersection is a smaller cube defined by the overlapping region on each axis.\n# For each axis, the overlap is from max(cube1_min, cube2_min) to min(cube1_max, cube2_max).\nintersection_min = max(cube1_min, cube2_min)\nintersection_max = min(cube1_max, cube2_max)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the side length of the intersection cube.\nintersection_side_length = intersection_max - intersection_min\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.\nvolume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation.\nprint(f\"The side length of the intersection cube is the length of the overlapping region on one axis.\")\nprint(f\"Side Length = {intersection_max} - {intersection_min} = {intersection_side_length}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length.\")\n# The final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"Volume = {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n\n# The user is running the script, so we write the answer to the file 'answer.txt'\n# in the format they requested.\ntry:\n    with open('answer.txt', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(f'<<<{volume}>>>')\nexcept (IOError, OSError) as e:\n    # Exit gracefully if we can't write the file.\n    # We still printed the result to the console.\n    sys.exit()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
