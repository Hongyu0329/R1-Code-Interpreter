    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Formula**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant `c` for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in a weighted projective space is given by the formula `c = d - Σw_i`, where `d` is the degree of the polynomial and `w_i` are the weights of the variables.\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d)**: A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. I will calculate the weighted degree for each monomial in the given polynomial using the provided weights `(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    *   `z_1^8 z_3`: `8*22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225`\n    *   `z_1 z_2^7`: `1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n    *   `z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5`: `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `z_2 z_3^4`: `29 + 4*49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n    *   `z_4^3 z_5`: `3*50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `z_5^3`: `3*75 = 225`\n    *   Almost all terms have a weighted degree of 225. The term `z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3` has a degree of `4*22 + 3*29 + 49 = 224`. Assuming this is a typo in the problem statement, the intended degree of the polynomial `d` is 225.\n3.  **Sum the Weights (Σw_i)**: I will calculate the sum of the given weights: `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75`.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant (c)**: I will substitute the values of `d` and `Σw_i` into the formula to find the invariant `c`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation showing all the components as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n    The invariant c is defined as c = d - Σw_i, where d is the degree of the\n    quasi-homogeneous polynomial and w_i are the weights of the variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial is:\n    # 0 = z1^8*z3 + z1^4*z2^3*z3 + z1*z2^7 + z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z2*z3^4 + z4^3*z5 + z5^3\n    # For a Calabi-Yau link defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial, all\n    # monomials must have the same weighted degree.\n    # Let's calculate the degree 'd' from a consistent term, e.g., z1^8*z3.\n    # Note: The term z1^4*z2^3*z3 has degree 224, which is likely a typo.\n    # All other terms have degree 225. We proceed with d=225.\n    d = 8 * weights[0] + 1 * weights[2]\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n    c = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant `c` is calculated using the formula: c = d - Σw_i\")\n    print(f\"Given weights: w = {tuple(weights)}\")\n    print(f\"The quasi-homogeneous degree is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of weights is Σw_i = {' + '.join(map(str, weights))} = {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"c = {d} - ({' + '.join(map(str, weights))})\")\n    print(f\"c = {d} - {sum_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"c = {c}\")\n\n    # Output the final answer in the specified format for parsing\n    # This is a special marker for the platform, not for the user to copy.\n    # The actual numerical answer is printed above for the user.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{c}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```"
