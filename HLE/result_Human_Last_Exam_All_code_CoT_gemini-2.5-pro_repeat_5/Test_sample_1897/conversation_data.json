    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Rewrite the product:** Express the given infinite product using the standard q-series notation.\n2.  **Relate to special functions:** Connect the q-series expression to well-known special functions, specifically Ramanujan's theta function $\\psi(q)$ and the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$.\n3.  **Find the expression for the product:** Formulate the product in terms of these special functions evaluated at specific points.\n4.  **Evaluate the special functions:** Use known modular identities and special values to find closed-form expressions for the functions at the required points. These values often involve constants like $\\pi$, powers of 2, and the Gamma function $\\Gamma$.\n5.  **Combine and simplify:** Substitute the evaluated forms back into the expression for the product and simplify to obtain the final closed-form answer.\n\n### Python Code for the Derivation\n\nThe following Python code will print out the detailed mathematical derivation leading to the final closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation for the closed form of\n    the infinite product prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Let P be the infinite product we want to evaluate:\")\n    print(\"P = \\u220F_{n=0 to \\u221E} (1 - e^{-(2n+1)\\u03C0})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Express the product in q-series notation.\")\n    print(\"Let q = e^{-\\u03C0}.
