    print(" - Number Ω: Defined by the self-referential statement, 'Ω is a real number that cannot be computed by this hypercomputer.'")
    print(" - The Task: The hypercomputer must determine if Ω is a member of S.")
    print(" - The Result: The hypercomputer halts without a definitive answer.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the core paradox of Ω.")
    print("Let's analyze the logical implications of Ω's definition:\n")

    print("Possibility 1: Assume the hypercomputer CAN compute Ω.")
    print(" - If the hypercomputer successfully computes Ω, it violates Ω's own definition, which asserts it CANNOT be computed by the hypercomputer.")
    print(" - This creates a direct logical contradiction.")
    print(" - Therefore, this possibility must be false. The hypercomputer cannot compute Ω.\n")

    print("Possibility 2: Assume the hypercomputer CANNOT compute Ω.")
    print(" - If the hypercomputer cannot compute Ω, then the defining statement of Ω is TRUE.")
    print(" - This means Ω is a valid, well-defined number whose fundamental property is its incomputability by the hypercomputer.")
    print(" - This path does not lead to a logical contradiction.\n")

    print("Step 3: Determining if Ω is in set S.")
    print(" - Set S contains only computable numbers (by a standard Turing machine).")
    print(" - From Step 2, we concluded that Ω cannot even be computed by a hypercomputer, which is vastly more powerful than a standard Turing machine.")
    print(" - Therefore, Ω is a non-computable number and is definitively NOT in the set S.\n")

    print("Step 4: Explaining why the hypercomputer fails to give an answer.")
    print(" - From an external viewpoint, we deduced that 'Ω is not in S'. Why can't the hypercomputer?")
    print(" - For the hypercomputer to conclude 'Ω is not in S', it must first prove to itself: 'I cannot compute Ω'.")
    print(" - This is a self-referential statement of limitation. This scenario is a variation of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems, which state that a sufficiently powerful formal system cannot prove all true statements about itself from within its own axioms.")
    print(" - The hypercomputer is trapped in a paradoxical loop. It cannot complete a formal proof of its own inability to compute Ω. Because it cannot finalize this crucial step, it cannot proceed to the final conclusion and thus halts without a definitive answer.\n")

    print("Step 5: Evaluating the answer choices based on the analysis.")
    print(" - A. Ω is a non-computable number outside the recursively enumerable set S due to its self-referential nature, and the hypercomputer cannot resolve this paradox. -> This matches our analysis perfectly.")
    print(" - B. Claims Ω is computable, which leads to a contradiction.")
    print(" - C. Claims S is not well-defined, which is false. The set of computable numbers is a standard concept.")
    print(" - D. Invokes oracle machines, which is an unnecessary complication not required to explain the paradox.")
    print(" - E. Suggests Ω is both inside and outside S. The issue is not a true contradiction in reality, but the machine's inability to prove a true statement (undecidability).\n")
