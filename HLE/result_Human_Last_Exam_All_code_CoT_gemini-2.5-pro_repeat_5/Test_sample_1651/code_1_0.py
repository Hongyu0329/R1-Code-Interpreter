    To find the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points of the Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R in the Stone-Cech remainder (let's call it R*), we follow these steps:

    1. The Structure of the Remainder R*: The remainder R* = beta(R) \\ R can be decomposed into two disjoint compact, connected components: C+ (related to +infinity) and C- (related to -infinity).

    2. The Action of the Lift F: The behavior of F on C+ and C- depends on the limits of f(x) as x approaches +/- infinity.
        - If lim (x->+inf) f(x) = +inf, then F maps C+ into C+.
        - If lim (x->-inf) f(x) = +inf, then F maps C- into C+.

    3. Existence of Fixed Points: A key topological result states that any continuous map from C+ (or C-) to itself has at least one fixed point.

    4. Constructing a Minimal Case: Let's analyze the function f(x) = x^2.
        - For f(x) = x^2, the limit at both +infinity and -infinity is +infinity.
        - This implies that F maps C+ to C+ and also maps C- to C+.
        - A fixed point p must satisfy F(p) = p. If p is in C-, F(p) is in C+, so p cannot be a fixed point. Thus, any fixed point must be in C+.
        - Since F maps C+ to C+, there must be at least one fixed point in C+.

    5. Conclusion: The function f(x) = x^2 guarantees at least one fixed point in the remainder R*. This means the smallest possible non-zero number is at most 1. Since we seek a non-zero number, the minimum must be at least 1.
    Therefore, the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points is 1.
