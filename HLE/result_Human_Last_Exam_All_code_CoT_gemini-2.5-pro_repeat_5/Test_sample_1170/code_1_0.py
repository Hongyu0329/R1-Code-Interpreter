def solve_prime_tt_ideals():
    """
    This function determines which of the 20 objects generate a prime tt-ideal
    and counts how many primes are not generated by any of them.

    The solution relies on the known structure of the prime ideal spectrum for
    the given category, which is a chain of four ideals: P0 < P1 < P2 < P3.
    In such a structure, every non-trivial object generates a prime ideal.
    Our task is to classify each object to determine which prime it generates.

    We assign a level to each prime: P0 -> 0, P1 -> 1, P2 -> 2, P3 -> 3.
    - Base objects are classified first.
    - Tensor products are classified using the rule: level(X tensor Y) = min(level(X), level(Y)).
