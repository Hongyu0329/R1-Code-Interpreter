    "Of course. Here is the analysis and the Python code to determine the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Criteria:** The request is for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** Possessing an inversion center or a mirror plane.\n    *   **Non-polar:** Lacking a unique polar axis.\n    *   **Optically Active:** Capable of rotating the plane of polarized light.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Principle:** A fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**. An achiral crystal, by definition, is not chiral.\n\n3.  **Recognize the Contradiction:** The request asks for crystal classes that are both **achiral** and **optically active**, which is a contradiction in terms. No crystal class can satisfy both conditions.\n\n4.  **Develop a Python Script:** I will create a Python script to demonstrate this contradiction programmatically.\n    *   The script will define the sets of all 32 crystal classes.\n    *   It will then define the subsets for optically active (chiral), achiral, and non-polar classes.\n    *   Using set theory, it will calculate the intersection of the three requested sets.\n    *   The script will print a detailed explanation of the logic and show that the resulting intersection is an empty set, concluding that no such crystal classes exist.\n\nThis approach will not only provide the answer but also explain the underlying crystallographic principles that lead to the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find those that are achiral,\n    non-polar, and optically active, and explains the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define all 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes)\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', 'ī', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '4̄', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '4̄2m', '4/mmm', '3', '3̄', '32', '3m', '3̄m', '6',\n        '6̄', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '6̄m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm3̄', '432',\n        '4̄3m', 'm3̄m'\n    }\n\n    # Define subsets based on physical properties and symmetry.\n\n    # 1.
