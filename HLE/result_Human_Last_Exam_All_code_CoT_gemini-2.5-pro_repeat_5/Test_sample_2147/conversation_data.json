    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nPavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian, was a classical liberal who was often critical of what he viewed as the decay in contemporary art and culture. The term \"stagnant swamp\" comes from a public debate where he fiercely criticized the new artistic movements of his time. The placeholder \"X-Y\" refers to the group he was targeting.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that will:\n1.  Define variables for 'X' and 'Y'.\n2.  Combine them to form the full term \"X-Y\".\n3.  Print an explanation and then display the components and the final term.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the term Pavel Milyukov used to denounce\n    a cultural movement as a 'stagnant swamp'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Pavel Milyukov, a classical liberal, was critical of modernist art movements.\n    # The \"X-Y\" in the question refers to the specific group he targeted with this phrase.\n    \n    x = \"Decadents\"\n    y = \"Modernists\"\n    \n    full_term = f\"{x}-{y}\"\n    \n    print(\"Pavel Milyukov used the term 'stagnant swamp' to criticize what he saw as the decay in modern art.\")\n    print(\"The term represented by 'X-Y' is a compound name for the artists and thinkers of these movements.\")\n    print(f\"In the term 'X-Y':\")\n    print(f\"X = {x}\")\n    print(f\"Y = {y}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the full term is: {full_term}\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_riddle()\n```\n<<<Decadents-Modernists>>>"
