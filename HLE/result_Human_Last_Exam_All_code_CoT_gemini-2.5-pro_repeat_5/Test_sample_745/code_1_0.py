    This function provides the answer to the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest number of components X \ C can have, where:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (the continuum).
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a component of X \ A.

    The components of X \ C are:
    1. A single component containing the connected set A.
    2. Other components, which must be components of (X \ A) \ C that are not
       topologically connected to A in the space X \ C.

    Through a non-trivial topological construction (for example, by S. Eilenberg),
    it can be shown that it is possible for X \ C to have c components.
    One component is the one containing A, and the other components are c distinct,
    separated sets. Therefore, the maximum number of components is c.

    The cardinality of the continuum, c, is the number of points on the real number line.
    It is equal to 2 raised to the power of aleph_null (the cardinality of integers).

    # In the context of the problem, the number of components can be c.

    # For instance, a component containing A, and then c other components.
    # The total number of components would be c.
    # c + 1 = c for infinite cardinals.
    
    # The final equation for the number of components would look like:
    # Number of components = 1 (for the part containing A) + (c - 1) (for the other parts)
    # Since c is an infinite cardinal, c - 1 = c.
    # So, 1 + c = c.
