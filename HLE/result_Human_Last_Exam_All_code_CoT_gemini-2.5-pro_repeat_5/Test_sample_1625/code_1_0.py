    explanation = """
    In plasma physics and fusion energy research, toroidal systems (like tokamaks) are used to confine plasma. The geometry is that of a torus (a doughnut shape). To describe a position within the torus, a coordinate system is used, which includes the poloidal angle (theta, θ).

    1.  **Poloidal Angle:** This angle describes the position on a cross-section of the torus, i.e., "the short way around".
    2.  **Periodicity:** The poloidal angle is inherently periodic. If you move around the poloidal direction by 2π radians (360 degrees), you return to your starting point. Any physical quantity described as a function of the poloidal angle must also be periodic with a period of 2π.
    3.  **Spectral Expansion:** A spectral expansion represents a function as a sum of basis functions. For a periodic function, the most natural and efficient choice of basis functions are sines and cosines.
    4.  **Fourier Series:** The Fourier series is the mathematical technique that expands a periodic function into a sum of sine and cosine terms. It is the fundamental tool for analyzing periodic phenomena. Other options like Legendre or Chebyshev polynomials are typically defined on a finite interval [-1, 1] and are suited for non-periodic functions, while Spherical Harmonics are for functions on a sphere, not a torus.

    Therefore, the Fourier series is the standard and most appropriate spectral expansion technique adapted for poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.
