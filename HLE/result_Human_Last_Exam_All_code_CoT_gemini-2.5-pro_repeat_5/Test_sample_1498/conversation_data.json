    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task.\n\nFirst, I need to locate a standard version of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, which typically consists of 57 verses (abyat).\n\nSecond, I will read through the poem to find the section dedicated to the Prophets (Anbiya'). I'm looking for the verse that introduces the list of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran, and then the subsequent verses that enumerate their names.\n\nThird, I will identify the exact starting and ending verse numbers where the names are listed.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints the result in a clear, descriptive sentence, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the range of verses (abyat) in the poem\n# 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n\n# Verse 19 serves as an introduction, stating that the details of 25 prophets are binding.\n# The actual enumeration of the names begins in the following verse.\n\n# Define the starting verse number where the names begin.\nstart_bayt = 20\n\n# Define the ending verse number where the list of names concludes.\nend_bayt = 23\n\n# Print the final answer, showing the start and end numbers.\nprint(f\"In Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\n```\n<<<20 to 23>>>"
