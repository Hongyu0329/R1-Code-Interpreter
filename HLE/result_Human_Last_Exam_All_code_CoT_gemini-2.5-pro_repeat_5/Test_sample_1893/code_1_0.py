    Solves for the neutralino mass matrix eigenvalue under the condition of dynamic enhancement.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Analyze the condition of "dynamic enhancement", which implies that the initial states
        (gamma-tilde, H_b-tilde) do not mix with (Z-tilde, H_a-tilde).
    2.  This "no-mixing" condition sets certain off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix to zero,
        which in turn constrains the model parameters.
    3.  With these constraints, the 4x4 mass matrix becomes block-diagonal, simplifying the
        eigenvalue problem.
    4.  We are looking for the eigenvalue that is NOT proportional to M1, M2, or mu.
        We will analyze the eigenvalues of the sub-matrices to find it.
