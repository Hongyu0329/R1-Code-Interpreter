    "Of course. My plan is to first identify the specific character in *The House of the Wolfings* who has a past connected to the Romans. Then, I will confirm from the book's summary that this character recounts a story that directly parallels the myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\nSince the request requires a code-based solution, I will write a Python script that assigns the character's name to a variable and then uses a `print` function to output a detailed explanation answering your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_and_story():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes Roman religious practices\n    in a way that references Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character who was raised for a time among the Romans.\n    character_name = \"Thiodolf\"\n\n    # The mythological figures referenced in the story.\n    mythological_figures = \"Romulus and Remus\"\n\n    # The description of the scene.\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The character in William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings' who recounts this story is {character_name}.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"Thiodolf, the leader of the Wolfings, tells his people about his time living in a Roman city. \"\n        f\"He describes a story a Roman elder told him about the city's founders, who were twin brothers suckled by a she-wolf. \"\n        f\"This is a direct and recognizable reference to the founding myth of Rome, featuring {mythological_figures}.\"\n    )\n\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character_and_story()\n```\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
