    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the most efficient way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple comparison of volumes (Cube Volume / Block Volume = 3375 / 9 = 375) provides an upper bound, but it's not achievable due to the shapes not fitting perfectly.\n\nA better method is to use a packing strategy. We can partition the cube based on the dimensions of the block. Since the block has a length of 9, we can partition each 15-unit edge of the cube into a 9-unit section and a 6-unit section (since 15 = 9 + 6).\n\nThis partitioning strategy divides the 15x15x15 cube into 8 smaller rectangular prisms (sub-cuboids):\n*   One 9x9x9 sub-cuboid.\n*   Three 9x9x6 sub-cuboids.\n*   Three 9x6x6 sub-cuboids.\n*   One 6x6x6 sub-cuboid.\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit within each of these sub-cuboids. The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from all 8 regions. A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into the 6x6x6 sub-cuboid because its longest side (9) is greater than any side of that space.\n\nThe following Python code implements this strategy to find the total number of blocks.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_dims, block_dims):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of blocks that can fit in a cuboid.\n    It checks all 3 unique orientations for a block like (l, w, w).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort dimensions to handle permutations easily\n    c_l, c_w, c_h = sorted(cuboid_dims, reverse=True)\n    b_l, b_w, b_h = sorted(block_dims, reverse=True)\n\n    max_blocks = 0\n    \n    # Orientation 1: Block (l, w, h) aligns with Cuboid (L, W, H)\n    if c_l >= b_l and c_w >= b_w and c_h >= b_h:\n        count1 = (c_l // b_l) * (c_w // b_w) * (c_h // b_h)\n        max_blocks = max(max_blocks, count1)\n\n    # Orientation 2: Block (l, w, h) aligns with Cuboid (W, L, H) etc.\n    # Check all 6 permutations of cuboid dimensions against the block dimensions.\n    # Since block is 9x1x1, many permutations are redundant, but this is a general approach.\n    import itertools\n    for p in set(itertools.permutations(cuboid_dims)):\n        c_p_l, c_p_w, c_p_h = p\n        if c_p_l >= b_l and c_p_w >= b_w and c_p_h >= b_h:\n            count = (c_p_l // b_l) * (c_p_w // b_w) * (c_p_h // b_h)\n            max_blocks = max(max_blocks, count)\n            \n    return max_blocks\n\n# Define dimensions\nCUBE_EDGE = 15\nBLOCK_DIMS = [9, 1, 1]\n\n# Partition the cube edge\npart1 = BLOCK_DIMS[0]\npart2 = CUBE_EDGE - part1\n\n# Define the sub-cuboids based on the (9, 6) partition\ncuboid_999_dims = (part1, part1, part1)  # 9x9x9\ncuboid_996_dims = (part1, part1, part2)  # 9x9x6\ncuboid_966_dims = (part1, part2, part2)  # 9x6x6\ncuboid_666_dims = (part2, part2, part2)  # 6x6x6\n\n# Calculate how many blocks fit in each type of sub-cuboid\nblocks_in_999 = calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_999_dims, BLOCK_DIMS)\nblocks_in_996 = calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_996_dims, BLOCK_DIMS)\nblocks_in_966 = calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_966_dims, BLOCK_DIMS)\nblocks_in_666 = calculate_blocks_in_cuboid(cuboid_666_dims, BLOCK_DIMS)\n\n# There is 1 cuboid of 9x9x9, 3 of 9x9x6, 3 of 9x6x6, and 1 of 6x6x6\ntotal_from_999 = 1 * blocks_in_999\ntotal_from_996 = 3 * blocks_in_996\ntotal_from_966 = 3 * blocks_in_966\ntotal_from_666 = 1 * blocks_in_666\n\n# Calculate the final total\ntotal_blocks = total_from_999 + total_from_996 + total_from_966 + total_from_666\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"The 15x15x15 cube is partitioned into sub-cuboids.\")\nprint(f\"Number of blocks in the single 9x9x9 cuboid: {blocks_in_999}\")\nprint(f\"Number of blocks in each of the three 9x9x6 cuboids: {blocks_in_996}\")\nprint(f\"Number of blocks in each of the three 9x6x6 cuboids: {blocks_in_966}\")\nprint(f\"Number of blocks in the single 6x6x6 cuboid: {blocks_in_666}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"(1 * {blocks_in_999}) + (3 * {blocks_in_996}) + (3 * {blocks_in_966}) + (1 * {blocks_in_666})\")\nprint(f\"= {total_from_999} + {total_from_996} + {total_from_966} + {total_from_666}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_blocks}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe largest number of blocks that will fit is {total_blocks}.\")\n\n```\n<<<351>>>"
