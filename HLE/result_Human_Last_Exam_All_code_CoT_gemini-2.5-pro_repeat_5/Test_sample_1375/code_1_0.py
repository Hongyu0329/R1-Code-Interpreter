# --- Example Usage ---
# You can change the value of n to any odd positive integer.
# Example for n=3 (the regular octahedron):
dimension_n = 3
calculate_average_projection_area(dimension_n)

# Example for n=5:
# dimension_n = 5
# calculate_average_projection_area(dimension_n)

# Example for n=1:
# dimension_n = 1
# calculate_average_projection_area(dimension_n)
