    "Here is my plan to solve this sequence puzzle:\n1.  First, I will represent the given sequence of numbers as a list in Python.\n2.  The sequence does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. I'll analyze the differences between consecutive numbers to find a hidden pattern. I will compute this difference sequence.\n3.  I will then examine the sequence of differences. I expect to see some structure or repeating values that will allow me to predict the next difference.\n4.  Based on the pattern in the differences, I will determine the most likely next value in the difference sequence.\n5.  Finally, I will calculate the next number in the original sequence by adding the predicted next difference to the last number of the original sequence. The code will print out the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the next number in a given integer sequence\n    by analyzing the sequence of differences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # Calculate the differences between consecutive numbers\n    differences = [sequence[i+1] - sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence) - 1)]\n\n    # The problem is to predict the next difference.\n    # Let's look at the end of the difference sequence:\n    # The last few values are [..., 88, 0, 0, -88, 88]\n    # We can observe patterns like (x, -x) or (-x, x) pairs, often followed by 0.\n    # e.g., (106, -106) is followed by 13.
