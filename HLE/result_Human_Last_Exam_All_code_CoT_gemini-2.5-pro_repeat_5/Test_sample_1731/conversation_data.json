    "Of course. Here is a solution using Python's `sympy` library to derive and display the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a photon gas, based on the principles of statistical mechanics which are rigorously formalized by large deviation theorems.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework:** The problem of finding equilibrium properties in statistical mechanics is a direct application of the principles behind large deviation theorems.\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Principle:** The equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macrostate with the highest number of corresponding microstates, which means it is the state of maximum entropy. Sanov's theorem in probability theory provides the mathematical foundation for this, stating that the probability of observing an empirical distribution (a macrostate) far from the true one decays exponentially, with the rate given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is directly related to thermodynamic entropy.\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff and Legendre Transforms:** The relationship between different thermodynamic ensembles (e.g., microcanonical with fixed energy `E` vs. canonical with fixed temperature `T`) is governed by a Legendre transform. This mathematical structure is central to Cramer's theorem, which describes the probability of deviations in the sample mean (e.g., mean energy). The free energy `F`, which is the key potential in the canonical ensemble, is the Legendre transform of the internal energy `U`.\n\n2.  **Methodology:** We will analyze a gas of photons (light quanta) in a volume `V` at temperature `T`. Since photons are bosons whose particle number is not conserved, their chemical potential is zero. The most direct way to find the equilibrium properties is to first calculate the Helmholtz Free Energy `F` from the bosonic partition function and then derive the entropy `S` and mean energy `U` using standard thermodynamic relations.\n\n3.  **Calculations:**\n    *   The Helmholtz free energy for a photon gas is found by integrating over all energy states: `F = - (1/3) * U`.\n    *   The mean energy `U` is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body: `U = a * V * T⁴`, where `a` is the radiation constant.\n    *   Combining these gives `F(T, V) = - (a/3) * V * T⁴`.\n    *   Entropy `S` is derived from the free energy: `S = - (∂F/∂T)_V`.\n    *   Mean Energy `U` can also be derived from `F` and `S` via `U = F + TS`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define these relationships symbolically and print the final, beautifully formatted equations for the equilibrium mean energy `U` and entropy `S`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas\n    based on the principles of statistical mechanics.\n\n    The derivation uses the black-body radiation model for light quanta (photons),\n    which are bosons with zero chemical potential.
