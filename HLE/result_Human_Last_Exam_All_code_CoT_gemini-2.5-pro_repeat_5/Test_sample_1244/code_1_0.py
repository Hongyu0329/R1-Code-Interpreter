  # Part (a): An even unimodular lattice must have a rank that is a multiple of 8.
  # 12 is not a multiple of 8, so no such lattice exists.

  # Part (b): By a theorem from Elkies, for an odd unimodular lattice L with
  # farness d, any d-primitive vector x must satisfy x.x is not congruent to 0 mod 2d.
  # Here d=3, so 2d=6. A 3-primitive vector x must satisfy x.x is not 0 mod 6.
  # The question asks if a vector can violate this, which is impossible.
  answer_b = "no"

  # Part (c): The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice N(D_24). We need the smallest
  # d such that L is a d-neighbor of Z^24.
  # d=1 is not possible as L is even and Z^24 is odd.
  # d=2 works, as 2L is a subset of Z^24 and 2Z^24 is a subset of L.
  # Thus, the smallest d is 2.
