    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number of each type of atom** in the molecule. Toluene (C7H8) has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted functions per atom** for the 6-31G basis set.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom (a heavy atom):** The 6-31G basis set specifies 1 core function (1s) and a split valence shell (2s, 2p). This results in 1 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 6 (2p) = **9** contracted functions per Carbon atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** It has no core electrons. Its single valence shell (1s) is split into two parts. This results in **2** contracted functions per Hydrogen atom.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Multiply the number of each atom by its corresponding number of functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule is C7H8\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom using the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (heavy atom): 1 core (1s) + 4 valence (inner 2s,2p) + 4 valence (outer 2s,2p) = 9\n# Or more simply: 1(1s) + 2(2s) + 6(2px,2py,2pz) = 9\nfuncs_per_C = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen: Valence shell is split into two parts (inner and outer) = 2\nfuncs_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for the molecule\ntotal_funcs_C = num_C * funcs_per_C\ntotal_funcs_H = num_H * funcs_per_H\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_C + total_funcs_H\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_C}H{num_H})\")\nprint(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {funcs_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {funcs_per_H}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} C atoms * {funcs_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_H} H atoms * {funcs_per_H} functions/H) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"({total_funcs_C}) + ({total_funcs_H}) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
