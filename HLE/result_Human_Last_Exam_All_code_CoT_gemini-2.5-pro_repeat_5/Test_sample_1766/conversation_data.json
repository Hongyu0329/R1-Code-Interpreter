    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps. We will calculate these possible `j` values.\n3.  **Calculate `J^2` Eigenvalues:** For each value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the operator `J^2` is given by the formula `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`. We will calculate this for each `j`.\n4.  **Calculate `J_z` Eigenvalues:** For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `j` in steps of 1. The eigenvalue of the operator `J_z` is `ħ * m_j`. We will calculate all possible `J_z` eigenvalues for each `j`.\n5.  **Present the Results:** The script will print the final eigenvalue equations for `J^2` and `J_z` for each possible state, substituting the calculated numerical values. For simplicity, we'll express the eigenvalues in terms of `ħ` (i.e., set `ħ=1` in the calculations and add the symbol `ħ` or `ħ²` to the output).\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1      # orbital quantum number for p-shell\n    s = 0.5    # spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz for a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}).\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues are expressed in terms of ħ (reduced Planck constant).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_values)}\")\n\n    # Steps 3 & 4: Loop through each j to find eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2: j*(j+1) * ħ^2\n        eigenvalue_J2 = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n--- For the state with j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Print the eigenvalue equation for J^2 with the numbers filled in\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue equation for J^2 is:\")\n        print(f\"  J^2 |j={j}, m_j> = {j}({j}+1)ħ^2 |j={j}, m_j> = {eigenvalue_J2}ħ^2 |j={j}, m_j>\")\n\n        # Calculate the possible magnetic quantum numbers (m_j) for the given j\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        # Print the eigenvalue equations for J_z for each possible m_j\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue equations for J_z are:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The eigenvalue for J_z is mj * ħ\n            eigenvalue_Jz = mj\n            print(f\"  J_z |j={j}, m_j={mj}> = {eigenvalue_Jz}ħ |j={j}, m_j={mj}>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1      # orbital quantum number for p-shell\n    s = 0.5    # spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz for a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}).\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues are expressed in terms of ħ (reduced Planck constant).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_values)}\")\n\n    # Steps 3 & 4: Loop through each j to find eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2: j*(j+1) * ħ^2\n        eigenvalue_J2 = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n--- For the state with j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Print the eigenvalue equation for J^2 with the numbers filled in\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue equation for J^2 is:\")\n        print(f\"  J^2 |j={j}, m_j> = {j}({j}+1)ħ^2 |j={j}, m_j> = {eigenvalue_J2}ħ^2 |j={j}, m_j>\")\n\n        # Calculate the possible magnetic quantum numbers (m_j) for the given j\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        # Print the eigenvalue equations for J_z for each possible m_j\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue equations for J_z are:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The eigenvalue for J_z is mj * ħ\n            eigenvalue_Jz = mj\n            print(f\"  J_z |j={j}, m_j={mj}> = {eigenvalue_Jz}ħ |j={j}, m_j={mj}>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```"
