    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$. Since the function's definition changes at $x=3$, we must split the integral into two parts.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Split the integral**: The total integral is the sum of two separate integrals:\n    $I = \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n\n2.  **Calculate the first integral**: For the range $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$. We will calculate the definite integral:\n    $I_1 = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n\n3.  **Calculate the second integral**: For the range $3 \\le x \\le 4$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$. We will calculate the definite integral:\n    $I_2 = \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} dx$\n    The antiderivative for this part is $e^x \\tan(x/2)$, which can be found by simplifying the integrand or using symbolic integration techniques.\n\n4.  **Sum the results**: The final answer is the sum of the two integrals, $I = I_1 + I_2$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result. The script will first compute the value of each integral separately and then add them. It will print the values of both parts and the final equation showing their sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the integral of a piecewise function from x=0 to x=4.\n\n# --- Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3 ---\n# The function is p(x) = 2*x^3 / 8 = x^3 / 4.\n# The antiderivative of x^3 / 4 is x^4 / 16.\n# We evaluate this from 0 to 3.\nintegral_1 = (3**4 / 16) - (0**4 / 16)\n\n# --- Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4 ---\n# The function is p(x) = e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)).\n# The antiderivative is e^x * tan(x/2).\n# We evaluate this from 3 to 4. Note that math.tan expects radians.\nval_at_4 = math.exp(4) * math.tan(4 / 2) # e^4 * tan(2)\nval_at_3 = math.exp(3) * math.tan(3 / 2) # e^3 * tan(1.5)\nintegral_2 = val_at_4 - val_at_3\n\n# --- Total Integral ---\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_1 + integral_2\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"The integral from 0 to 3 is: {integral_1}\")\nprint(f\"The integral from 3 to 4 is: {integral_2}\")\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of these two parts.\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{integral_1} + ({integral_2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4654519985957>>>"
