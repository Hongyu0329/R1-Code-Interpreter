    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Expression**: The initial expression involves the difference of two integrals. I will first combine them into a single integral since they share the same limits of integration and a very similar denominator.\n2.  **Change of Variables**: I will perform a substitution ($u = 1-x$) on the combined integral. This will simplify the integrand into a more manageable form.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. This involves recognizing that the integrand is the result of differentiating a specific function, which I found using the product rule. I will demonstrate that the derivative of the proposed antiderivative matches the integrand.\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral by plugging in the upper and lower limits (1 and 0) into the antiderivative.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression, $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\text{integral value})^4$, and compute the final numerical answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan and shows the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the step-by-step analytical solution to the given mathematical expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to compute the value of the expression:\")\n    print(\"E = (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4\")\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\"I_1 = Integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"I_2 = Integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Combine the two integrals into a single integral I = I_1 - I_2.\")\n    print(\"I = Integral from 0 to 1 of [((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x] / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the substitution u = 1-x.\")\n    print(\"This means x = 1-u, dx = -du.
