    """
    Analyzes the legal scenario and determines the correct answer.

    The key principles are:
    1.  A law firm owes a continuing duty of confidentiality to a former client.
    2.  A conflict of interest arises if the firm represents a new client against a former client in a matter where confidential information from the former client is relevant.
    3.  In this case, the financial and contractual information NC LLP has from Advanced Tech Inc. is highly relevant to its acquisition by Six Wings Inc. This creates a conflict.
    4.  Such a conflict can only be waived with the informed consent of the prejudiced party (the former client).
    5.  The problem states that consent will not be given.
    
    Therefore, NC LLP cannot continue the representation. Answer D provides the most accurate reason.

    # The answer choices are:
    # A. Norman and NC LLP can continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because the previous litigation matters and the transactional matter are not related. (Incorrect, the information makes them related).
    # B. Norman and NC LLP can continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because of the internal measures (ethical screens). (Incorrect, screens are generally insufficient without consent in this context).
    # C. Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue... because partners have access to all information. (Plausible, but not the core legal reason).
    # D. Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue... because the prejudiced party must consent. (Correct, this is the fundamental rule).
    # E. Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue... because a lawyer is expressly prohibited from representing opposing parties regardless of consent. (Incorrect, this is an overstatement and consent is a key factor).

    print("The reasoning is that when a conflict of interest prejudices a former client, that former client must provide consent for the law firm to continue acting. Without consent, the firm must withdraw.")
