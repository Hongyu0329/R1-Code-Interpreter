    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be solved by identifying the historical figure described in the poem by Andrei Voznesensky.\n\n1.  The poem in question is \"Saga\" (\"Сага\"), which formed the basis for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n2.  The poem and opera tell the story of the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n3.  Rezanov undertook a journey to Russian America (Alaska) and California. His story involves a romance with Concepción Argüello in California, fitting the \"joy-discovering sailor\" description.\n4.  He died and was buried in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his return journey. His original gravesite was destroyed, and its location was lost for over a century.\n5.  The grave was rediscovered, and a monument was erected in Krasnoyarsk in the latter half of the 20th century, which aligns with the \"late 1980s\" clue.\n\nTherefore, the man's last name is Rezanov. I will now provide a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the historical figure based on the provided clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1.  Called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    2.  Voznesensky's poem asks about the location of his grave.\n    3.  The grave was found in the late 1980s.\n    \n    The figure is Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\"\n    which became the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n    \"\"\"\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(last_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
