    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve, which has the general form `x = A*cos(nt)` and `y = B*sin(mt)`. In this problem, `A=1`, `B=1`, `n = 9`, and `m = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the Standard Formula:** For Lissajous curves where `n` and `m` are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), there is a direct formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points:\n    `Number of intersections = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Verify the Condition:** We need to check if `n=9` and `m=5` are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so the condition is met and we can apply the formula.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will provide a Python script that applies this formula and prints out the calculation step-by-step to show how the final answer is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of self-intersection points for the\n    Lissajous curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 9\n    m = 5\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos({n}t), sin({m}t)).\")\n    print(\"This is a Lissajous curve.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a Lissajous curve with parameters n and m that are coprime (gcd(n,m)=1),\")\n    print(\"the number of self-intersections is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"N = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2\\n\")\n\n    gcd_nm = math.gcd(n, m)\n    print(f\"First, let's confirm that n={n} and m={m} are coprime:\")\n    print(f\"The greatest common divisor of {n} and {m} is {gcd_nm}.\")\n    if gcd_nm != 1:\n        print(\"The parameters are not coprime.
