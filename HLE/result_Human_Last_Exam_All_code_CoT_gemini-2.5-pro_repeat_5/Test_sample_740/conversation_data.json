    "To solve this integral equation, we will first convert it into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Kernel**: The kernel of the integral equation is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. This can be simplified by recognizing it as the sum of a finite geometric series:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n\n2.  **Convert to a Linear System**: We can rewrite the integral equation using this form of the kernel:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y) dy`\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n    Let's define a set of constants `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n    The solution `u(x)` must then be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    To find the constants `c_j`, we substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n    `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n    `c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`.\n    This is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`. In matrix form, this is `(I - λA)c = b`, where the matrix `A` has elements `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)` and `b` has elements `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm Alternative, this system (and thus the integral equation) has no unique solution if `det(I - λA) = 0`. This is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `μ = 1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n    When `μ = 1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `A`, the equation has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. For the equation to have *no* solution, the vector `b` must not be in the column space of `(I - λA)`. This is equivalent to `b` not being orthogonal to the null space of `(I - λA)ᵀ`. It can be shown that this condition holds for all eigenvalues of `A`.\n    Therefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n4.  **Finding λ via Characteristic Polynomial**: The eigenvalues `μ` of `A` are the roots of its characteristic polynomial, `det(A - μI) = 0`. Let's say this polynomial is `p(μ) = a_n μⁿ + a_{n-1} μⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a_0 = 0`.\n    Since `λ = 1/μ`, we have `μ = 1/λ`. Substituting this into the polynomial gives:\n    `a_n/λⁿ + a_{n-1}/λⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a_0 = 0`.\n    Multiplying by `λⁿ` gives a polynomial for `λ`:\n    `a_0 λⁿ + a_1 λⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a_n = 0`.\n    The coefficients of the polynomial for `λ` are the reversed coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of `A`.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: We will write a Python script using `numpy` to:\n    a. Construct the matrix `A` for a given integer `n`.\n    b. Find the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial for `A`.\n    c. Reverse the coefficients to get the polynomial for `λ`.\n    d. Print the equation for `λ`.\n    e. Calculate the roots of this polynomial, which are the required values of `λ`.\n\nSince `n` is not specified in the problem, I will use `n=2` as an example to demonstrate the method.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.polynomial.polynomial as poly\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solutions\n    for a specified integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for j in range(n):\n        for k in range(n):\n            A[j, k] = 1.0 / (j + n - k)\n\n    # Get the characteristic polynomial for A.
