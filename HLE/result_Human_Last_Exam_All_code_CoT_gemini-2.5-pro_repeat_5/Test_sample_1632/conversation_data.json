    "Of course. Here is a plan and the corresponding Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe problem asks for `a(10)`, which represents the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square (Manhattan) lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path starting from the origin that never visits the same point more than once.\n\nTo solve this, I will use a backtracking algorithm, which is a recursive method suitable for exploring all possible solutions to a combinatorial problem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define a recursive function that explores paths starting from a given point.\n2.  The walk will begin at the origin `(0, 0)`.\n3.  I'll use a `set` to keep track of the points visited along the current path. This allows for efficient checking of the self-avoiding constraint.\n4.  The recursive function will try to move one step in each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n5.  A move is valid only if the destination point has not been visited before in the current path.\n6.  If a move is valid, the function will add the new point to the visited set and call itself recursively for the next step.\n7.  After the recursive call returns, it will \"backtrack\" by removing the point from the visited set, allowing other paths to be explored.\n8.  The recursion's base case is when the path length reaches 10 steps. At this point, we have found one valid walk, so we return 1.\n9.  The final result is the sum of all values returned from the initial set of calls, which represents the total number of unique 10-step self-avoiding walks.\n\nThis approach will systematically count every valid walk.\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_avoiding_walks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This script is configured to calculate a(10).\n    \"\"\"\n    n_steps = 10\n    \n    # A set to keep track of visited coordinates in the current path.\n    # The walk starts at (0, 0), so we add it to the visited set.\n    visited = {(0, 0)}\n\n    def count_walks(x, y, steps_taken):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks using backtracking.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_taken (int): The number of steps taken so far.\n        \n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If we have taken the desired number of steps, we've found one valid walk.\n        if steps_taken == n_steps:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Explore the four possible directions (neighbors on a square lattice).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the next point has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # If not visited, explore this path.\n                visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n                count += count_walks(next_x, next_y, steps_taken + 1)\n                \n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths.\n                visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Start the search from the origin (0,0) with 0 steps taken.\n    total_walks = count_walks(0, 0, 0)\n    \n    # The problem defines a(n) as the number of n-step walks.\n    # The final output prints the result in the format a(n) = value.\n    print(f\"a({n_steps}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_self_avoiding_walks()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
