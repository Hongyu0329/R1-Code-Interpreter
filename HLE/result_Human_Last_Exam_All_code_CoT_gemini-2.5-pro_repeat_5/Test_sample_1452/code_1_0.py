# The user wants to find the equation for Max Born.
# Max Born is famous for the Born rule, which gives the probability density
# of finding a quantum system in a certain state.
# The equation is P = |Ψ|², where P is the probability density and Ψ is the wave function.

# Although the equation doesn't have numbers, the prompt asks to output each number.
# I will interpret this as just printing the equation as is.
# The final answer format is just the equation part.
