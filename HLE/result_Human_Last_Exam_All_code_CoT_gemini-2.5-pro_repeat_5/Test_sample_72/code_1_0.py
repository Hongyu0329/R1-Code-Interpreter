# The user wants me to identify the single grammatically incorrect sentence from a list.
#
# My analysis reveals a consistent system of noun cases marked by suffixes.
# - The suffix "-et" is used for the agent (subject) of a transitive verb.
# - The suffix "-e" is used for the object of a transitive verb.
#
# Let's examine the sentences with the transitive verb "otazsij":
# Sentence 6: Dokujet (agent, -et) kergoe (object, -e) otazsij ga. -> This follows the rule.
# Sentence 9: Dokujet (agent, -et) ketanne (object, -e) esku otazsij kaij. -> This follows the rule.
#
# Now let's examine the sentence in question:
# Sentence 4: Kergoet dokusje otazsij ga.
# - "Kergoet" correctly uses the agent "-et" suffix.
# - By analogy with sentence 6, the second noun should be an object and have the "-e" suffix, making it "dokuje".
# - The word "dokusje" has a unique suffix "-sje" that does not appear on any other noun in the provided data.
# - This deviation from the established grammatical pattern makes sentence 4 the outlier.
