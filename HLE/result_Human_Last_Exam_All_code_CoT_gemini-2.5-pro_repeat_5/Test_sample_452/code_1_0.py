# The problem is to determine the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula for the
# expected cover-and-return time on a random tree, C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
# This is a well-known result in the field of probability on graphs.

# According to advanced results in the theory of random walks and random trees,
# established by researchers such as David Aldous and Jian Ding, this constant 'b'
# is known to be the square root of (2 * pi).

# We will now write a Python script to calculate this value.

# The equation for the constant b is b = sqrt(2 * pi).
# The numbers involved are 2 and pi.
number_in_equation = 2
pi_value = math.pi

# Now we calculate b using the formula.
b = math.sqrt(number_in_equation * pi_value)
