# Plan:
# 1. Define the components of the graph based on the known smallest graph
#    with an automorphism group of size 3.
# 2. The graph has 9 vertices, labeled 0 through 8.
# 3. The edges come from three sets:
#    a. A 9-cycle connecting all vertices.
#    b. A 3-clique (triangle) on the vertex set {0, 3, 6}.
#    c. A 3-clique (triangle) on the vertex set {1, 4, 7}.
# 4. Calculate the total number of edges by summing the edges from each set.

# Number of edges in a 9-cycle graph
edges_c9 = 9

# Number of edges in a 3-clique (a complete graph K_3)
# A K_n graph has n*(n-1)/2 edges. For K_3, this is 3*(2)/2 = 3.
edges_k3_1 = 3
edges_k3_2 = 3

# Total number of edges 'e' is the sum of these edge sets.
e = edges_c9 + edges_k3_1 + edges_k3_2

# Output the reasoning and the final calculation.
print("The smallest number of edges 'e' is found in a graph with 9 vertices.")
