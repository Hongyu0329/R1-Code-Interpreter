    This function determines the result based on the properties of the set Σ.

    The problem asks for the value of min_{A in Σ} max_{a in A}.
    The set Σ is defined as all finite, non-empty subsets A of positive integers
    satisfying A + A ⊆ A · A, excluding the empty set and the set {2}.

    A mathematical analysis reveals the following:
    1. The condition A + A ⊆ A · A implies that the minimum element of A must be 1 or 2.
    2. If min(A) = 1, the set A must be infinite to satisfy the condition, but A must be finite.
    3. If min(A) = 2, the only possible finite set is A = {2}.

    The set A = {2} is the only finite set that meets the core requirement:
    - Sum set: A + A = {2 + 2} = {4}
    - Product set: A · A = {2 * 2} = {4}
    - The condition {4} ⊆ {4} holds true.

    However, the definition of Σ explicitly excludes the set {2}.
    Therefore, the set Σ is empty.

    The problem specifies that if Σ is empty, the function should return 0.
