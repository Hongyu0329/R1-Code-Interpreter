    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can analyze its structure. This approach avoids the direct, and very complex, calculation of the Whitehead integral formula over all of space.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Field's Symmetry**: The vector field is defined using cylindrical coordinates, where `f = atan2(y,x)` is the azimuthal angle `phi`, and the other component `G` depends only on `rho = sqrt(x*x+y*y)` and `z`. This is an axially symmetric field, often called a toroidal skyrmion or a Hopfion.\n2.  **Use the Winding Number Formula**: For such axially symmetric fields, the Hopf charge `H` can be calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers: `H = p * q`.\n3.  **Calculate Azimuthal Winding Number (p)**: `p` describes how many times the vector field wraps around the z-axis as we go around it once. In our case, the field's azimuthal angle `f` is identical to the spatial azimuthal angle `phi`. So, as we circle the z-axis once (`phi` from 0 to 2*pi), the field also wraps exactly once. Thus, `p = 1`.\n4.  **Calculate Poloidal Winding Number (q)**: `q` describes the topology of the field in any poloidal half-plane (e.g., the `y=0, x>0` half-plane). It counts how many times the vector `n` covers the target sphere's great circle as we move from the \"center\" of the structure to \"infinity\". This can be calculated by the formula `q = (G_center - G_infinity) / pi`, where `G` is the polar angle of the vector field `n`.\n5.  **Find G_center**: The \"center\" of this field configuration is where the exponential term is maximal, which occurs where its argument `r2` is zero.\n    `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z^2) = 0`\n    This happens on the circle `x*x+y*y = 0.5` and `z=0`.\n    At this location, `G = pi * exp(-10 * 0) = pi * 1 = pi`.\n6.  **Find G_infinity**: \"Infinity\" is where the coordinates `(x,y,z)` go to infinity. In this limit, `r2` also goes to infinity.\n    As `r2 -> inf`, `exp(-10*r2) -> 0`.\n    At this location, `G = pi * 0 = 0`.\n7.  **Calculate q**: Using the values from the previous steps:\n    `q = (pi - 0) / pi = 1`.\n8.  **Calculate the Hopf Charge H**:\n    `H = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge for the given axially symmetric vector field.\n\n    The Hopf charge H for a field of the form n = (sin(G)cos(p*f), sin(G)sin(p*f), cos(G))\n    is given by H = p * q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
