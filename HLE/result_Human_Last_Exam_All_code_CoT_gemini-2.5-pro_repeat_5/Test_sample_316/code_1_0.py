# The problem asks for the second critical exponent for a reverse square function
# estimate for the cone in R^3.
# One such exponent is given as p=4. This corresponds to the Tomas-Stein restriction
# exponent and arises from a Kakeya-type geometric configuration.
# The other critical exponent is known to arise from a more complex bilinear
# interaction, as studied by T. Wolff. This gives the exponent p = 10/3.

# The numbers in the final equation for the exponent are 10 and 3.
numerator = 10
denominator = 3

# Calculate the value of the exponent
result = numerator / denominator
