    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the complex equation and generate the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Equation**: I will start by setting up the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ and substituting $z = x+iy$.\n2.  **Use Complex Exponentiation**: The term $i^z$ will be expanded using the formula $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. This means $i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$. I'll use the multi-valued complex logarithm, where $\\ln i = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n3.  **Form a System of Equations**: By expanding the equation and separating the real and imaginary parts, I will derive a system of two transcendental equations for the variables $x$ and $y$. These equations will be parameterized by the integer $k$.\n4.  **Solve for Specific Cases**:\n    *   **Real Solutions ($y=0$)**: I will solve the system to find all real solutions for $z$.\n    *   **Pure Imaginary Solutions ($x=0$)**: I will solve the system to find all pure imaginary solutions. This step will require the use of the Lambert W function to find an exact form for these solutions.\n5.  **Develop Python Code**: Based on the analysis, I will write a Python script to compute and display these solutions. The script will:\n    *   Explicitly state the real solutions.\n    *   Calculate the first few pure imaginary solutions using the `scipy.special.lambertw` function and print them, showing the components of the calculation as requested.\n    *   Include comments to explain the mathematical steps.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the solutions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\n# We are solving the complex equation z*i = i^z for z in C.\n#\n# Let z = x + iy.

The equation becomes:\n# -y + ix = exp((x+iy) * i * C_k)\n# -y + ix = exp(-y*C_k + i*x*C_k)\n# -y + ix = exp(-y*C_k) * (cos(x*C_k) + i*sin(x*C_k))\n#\n# Equating the real and imaginary parts gives a system of two equations:\n# 1) -y = exp(-y*C_k) * cos(x*C_k)\n# 2)  x = exp(-y*C_k) * sin(x*C_k)\n\nprint(\"Solving the complex equation: z * i = i^z\")\nprint(\"==========================================\")\n\n# Case 1: Real solutions (y=0)\n# By substituting y=0 into the system, we can show that z=1 and z=-1 are solutions.\nprint(\"1.
