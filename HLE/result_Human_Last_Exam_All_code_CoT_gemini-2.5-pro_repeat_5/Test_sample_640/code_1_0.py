def solve_scattering_statements():

    This function analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering
    and prints the numbers of the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on these principles:
    1. A trivially coupled potential V(r) leads to a trivially coupled S-matrix S(E).
       The converse is false due to "transparent potentials".
    2. The S-matrix S(E) is trivially coupled if and only if the Jost matrix F(E)
       is trivially coupled.
