def solve():

    This function solves the mathematical problem posed by the user.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T on a set X
    of cardinality c can have, given T is neither trivial nor discrete.

    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {empty_set, X}.

    The number of complements is the cardinality of the set of all such topologies S.
    We are looking for the minimum possible value of this cardinality.

    If a topology T can be found that has no complements, the cardinality of the set of its complements is 0.
    Since this cardinality cannot be negative, 0 would be the minimum.

    It is a known result in general topology that such topologies exist. A standard example is the
    one-point compactification of an uncountable discrete space. Let D be a discrete space of cardinality c.
    Its one-point compactification T on X = D U {infinity} is neither trivial nor discrete. It has been
    proven that this topology T has no complements.

    Therefore, the smallest possible number of complements is 0.
