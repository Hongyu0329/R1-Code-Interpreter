    "To find the number of finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2, I will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Properties**:\n    *   A set `S = {a, b}` within a group `G` is **product-free** if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same), their product `x*y` is not in `S`. This means the set of products `{a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b}` must be disjoint from `{a, b}`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing its product-free property. That is, for any element `g` in `G` but not in `S`, the new set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n2.  **Computational Search Strategy**:\n    *   I will write a Python script to programmatically check finite groups for this property.\n    *   The script will leverage the `sympy` library to create and operate on representations of finite groups (like cyclic groups, symmetric groups, etc.).\n    *   A core function will be designed to take a group `G` as input and perform the following checks:\n        1.  Iterate through all possible 2-element subsets `S` of `G`.\n        2.  For each subset `S`, first verify if it is product-free.\n        3.  If `S` is product-free, then check for maximality by ensuring that for every element `g` outside of `S`, the set `S U {g}` is not product-free.\n        4.  If such a set `S` is found for a group, that group is counted as a solution.\n\n3.  **Execution and Result**:\n    *   I will test a list of small, common finite groups to identify all that satisfy the condition.\n    *   The script will then print the names of the groups found and output the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.groups import PermutationGroup, CyclicGroup, DihedralGroup, SymmetricGroup\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group: PermutationGroup, group_name: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given finite group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n    Args:\n        group: A sympy PermutationGroup object.\n        group_name: The name of the group for printing purposes.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if such a set exists, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = list(group.elements)\n    identity = group.identity\n\n    # We only need to consider subsets of non-identity elements, since the identity\n    # can never be in a product-free set (e.g., e*e = e).\n    non_identity_elements = [el for el in elements if el != identity]\n\n    # Iterate over all 2-element subsets S\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(non_identity_elements, 2):\n        S = set(s_tuple)\n\n        # 1.
