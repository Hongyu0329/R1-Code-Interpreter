    Simulates a structural equation model to check if correlation implies causation.

    The model is E->A->B->C<-D<-E.
    A and D are correlated because they share a common cause E. This is confounding.
    This simulation demonstrates that A and D will be correlated in observational data,
    even though there is no causal link between them.
