    explanation = """
    The question asks for the primary factor influencing the persistence of small, non-functional genomic fragments during genome reduction (decay). This process is governed by the interplay between natural selection and genetic drift.

    1.  Natural Selection's Role: Replicating and maintaining useless DNA has a very small energetic cost. Therefore, natural selection weakly favors the deletion of these fragments. If selection were highly efficient, these fragments would be removed quickly.

    2.  Genetic Drift's Role: Genetic drift refers to random fluctuations in the frequency of genetic variants in a population. The strength of drift is inversely proportional to the effective population size (i.e., it is much stronger in smaller populations).

    3.  The Deciding Factor: Genomic decay is most common in organisms with small effective population sizes (e.g., endosymbionts). In these populations, the force of genetic drift is very strong. This strong drift can easily overpower the very weak selective pressure to delete the fragments.

    4.  Conclusion: As a result, the fate of these small fragments (persistence vs. deletion) is largely determined by random chance (drift) rather than by selection. Therefore, the strength of genetic drift is the primary factor influencing their persistence.

    print("B. The strength of genetic drift: Correct. It can overwhelm weak selection, leading to the persistence of slightly deleterious fragments.")
