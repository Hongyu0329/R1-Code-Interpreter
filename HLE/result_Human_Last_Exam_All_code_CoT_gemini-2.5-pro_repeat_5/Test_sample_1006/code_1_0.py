# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with a set of specific topological properties.

# Our mathematical analysis reveals that the properties described for X are the
# defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray, R.
# Let this compactification be denoted βR.
#
# The argument proceeds as follows:
# 1. Any space X satisfying the conditions is a compactification of R.
# 2. The function extension property given is equivalent to the universal property
#    that defines the Stone-Čech compactification.
# 3. The universal property guarantees a unique (up to homeomorphism) space.
# 4. Therefore, any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to βR.
#
# Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to each other, they all fall into a
# single homeomorphism class.

# Let N be the number of distinct homeomorphism classes.
N = 1

# The code prints this result.
