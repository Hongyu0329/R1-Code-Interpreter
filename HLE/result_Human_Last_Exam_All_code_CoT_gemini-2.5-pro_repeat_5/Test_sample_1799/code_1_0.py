The assertion that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is generally considered to be incorrect. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1.  The first postulate, the Principle of Relativity, states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. On its own, this powerful principle severely restricts how measurements in different frames can relate to each other.

2.  If we combine the first postulate with basic assumptions of causality and the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime, we can mathematically derive the general form of the transformation laws. This derivation leads to a family of transformations that contains an undetermined universal speed, let's call it K.

3.  This universal speed K can either be infinite or a finite, positive value.
    *   If K is infinite, the transformation laws become the Galilean transformations of classical mechanics (e.g., time is absolute: t' = t).
    *   If K is finite, the transformation laws become the Lorentz transformations.

4.  The first postulate alone cannot tell us the value of K. It cannot distinguish between a universe with an infinite speed limit and one with a finite speed limit. We need an additional piece of information based on experiment.

5.  This is where the second postulate comes in. It states that the speed of light in a vacuum, c, is the same for all inertial observers. This is an experimental fact. It provides the missing piece of the puzzle: it tells us that the universal speed K is finite and that its value is precisely the speed of light, c.

Conclusion: The second postulate is not superfluous. It is the essential empirical input required to select the correct physical theory (Lorentz transformations) from the possibilities allowed by the first postulate.

The final equations of special relativity emerge from combining these two postulates. A central part of these equations is the Lorentz factor, gamma (γ), which is used in the formulas for time dilation and length contraction.

The equation for the Lorentz factor is:
