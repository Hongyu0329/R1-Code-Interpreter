    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE at the initial point x=0.**\n    The ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\n    The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0.00$, $y'(0) = 3.00$, $y''(0) = 2.00$.\n    We can calculate the third derivative at $x=0$ by substituting these values into the ODE:\n    $y'''(0) = y(0)^4 + y'(0)^4 - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^2+2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0)+1}$\n    $y'''(0) = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{0+1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\n    We notice a special relationship: $y'''(0) = 81$ and $y'(0)^4 = 3^4 = 81$.\n    This means that at the initial point, the term $y'^4$ dominates the right-hand side of the equation, and the approximation $y''' \\approx y'^4$ holds exactly.\n\n2.  **Formulate and solve the approximate ODE.**\n    Based on the observation at $x=0$, we assume that the solution's behavior, at least initially, is governed by the dominant balance:\n    $y''' \\approx y'^4$.\n    This type of equation often leads to a finite-time singularity. We'll look for a solution of the form $y'(x) = c(x_0 - x)^{-q}$, where the derivative becomes infinite as $x$ approaches a singularity point $x_0$.\n    Taking derivatives, we get $y'''(x) = cq(q+1)(x_0 - x)^{-q-2}$.\n    Substituting into the approximate ODE:\n    $cq(q+1)(x_0 - x)^{-q-2} \\approx (c(x_0 - x)^{-q})^4 = c^4(x_0 - x)^{-4q}$.\n    By equating the exponents, we find $q$:\n    $-q-2 = -4q \\implies 3q=2 \\implies q=2/3$.\n    By equating the coefficients, we find $c$:\n    $cq(q+1) = c^4 \\implies c(2/3)(2/3+1) = c^4 \\implies \\frac{10}{9}c = c^4 \\implies c^3 = \\frac{10}{9}$.\n\n3.  **Find the expression for y(x) and determine the constants.**\n    We can now integrate $y'(x)$ to find the form of $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) = \\int c(x_0-x)^{-2/3} dx = -3c(x_0-x)^{1/3} + K$.\n    Here, $K$ is the constant of integration. This expression describes the solution's shape as it approaches the singularity at $x_0$. The phrase \"large x regimes\" is interpreted as this asymptotic singular behavior, where the function and its derivatives grow large.\n    The constants $x_0$ and $K$ can be determined by applying the initial conditions to our approximate solution forms:\n    From $y'(0) = 3$:\n    $3 \\approx c(x_0-0)^{-2/3} \\implies x_0 = (c/3)^{3/2}$.\n    From $y(0) = 0$:\n    $0 \\approx -3c(x_0-0)^{1/3} + K \\implies K = 3c x_0^{1/3}$.\n    Substituting the value of $c=(10/9)^{1/3}$, we can calculate the numerical values for the constants.\n\n4.  **Present the final expression.**\n    The following Python code calculates the constants and prints the final analytical expression, with coefficients rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constant c from the theoretical derivation c^3 = 10/9\nc = (10/9)**(1/3)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the singularity location x_0 using the initial condition y'(0)=3\n# x_0 = (c/3)^(3/2)\nx_0 = (10/243)**(1/2) # Simplified exact form\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the integration constant K using the initial condition y(0)=0\n# K = 3*c*x_0**(1/3)\nK = math.sqrt(10/3) # Simplified exact form\n\n# Step 4: The final expression is y(x) = K - 3*c*(x_0 - x)^(1/3)\n# We will print the equation with the coefficients rounded to two decimal places.\n\ncoeff_K = K\ncoeff_3c = 3 * c\ncoeff_x0 = x_0\n\nprint(\"The analytical expression that approximates the solution is:\")\n# The final equation has the form y(x) = A - B * (C - x)^(1/3)\n# We output each number in this final equation format.\nprint(f\"y(x) = {coeff_K:.2f} - {coeff_3c:.2f} * ({coeff_x0:.2f} - x)^(1/3)\")\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = 1.83 - 3.11 * (0.20 - x)^(1/3)>>>"
