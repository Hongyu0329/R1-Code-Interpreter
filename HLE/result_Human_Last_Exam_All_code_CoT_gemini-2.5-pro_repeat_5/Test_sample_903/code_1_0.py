    Analyzes the coordination of a zinc complex based on its reactants.

    The reaction involves:
    1. Ligand: 1,3-Di[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene
    2. Metal Salt: ZnBr2
    3. Stoichiometry: 1:1

    This function determines and prints the atoms coordinated to the central Zn(II) ion.

    # Step 1: Identify donor atoms in the ligand.
    # The ligand has two '(2-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl' arms.
    # Each arm provides two nitrogen donor atoms:
    # - 1 from the pyridine ring
    # - 1 from the pyrazole ring (the N not attached to the methyl group)
    # Total nitrogen donors from the ligand = 2 arms * 2 N/arm = 4 N atoms.
    num_nitrogen_donors = 4

    # Step 2: Identify donor atoms from the metal salt.
    # ZnBr2 provides two bromide ions (Br-), which are excellent ligands.
    num_bromide_donors = 2

    # Step 3: Determine the final coordination sphere.
    # Zinc(II) commonly forms 6-coordinate complexes.
    # The reaction is 1:1, so all components are expected in the final product.
    # The N4 ligand and the two bromide ions will coordinate to the Zn(II) center
    # to form a stable, neutral 6-coordinate complex: [Zn(ligand)Br2].
    # The coordination sphere is composed of all these donor atoms.
