# Step 1: Solve for k_Yuk
# The N=4 Yukawa term containing one gaugino and one matter fermion is 2 * k_Yuk * f * pi * psi * lambda.
# The corresponding N=1 Yukawa term is -i * sqrt(2) * f * pi * psi * lambda.
# By matching these terms, we establish the relation: 2 * k_Yuk = -i * sqrt(2).
# We solve this equation for k_Yuk.
print("Step 1: Finding k_Yuk")
# Let's represent the equation as 2 * k_Yuk = -i * sqrt(2)
# k_Yuk = -i * sqrt(2) / 2 = -i / sqrt(2)
k_yuk_val = (-1j) / math.sqrt(2)
print(f"From matching Yukawa terms, we get the relation: 2 * k_Yuk = -i * sqrt(2)")
print(f"Solving for k_Yuk gives: k_Yuk = -i/sqrt(2)")
print(f"The numerical value is k_Yuk = {k_yuk_val:.4f}\n")


# Step 2: Solve for the gauge coupling g
# The provided Lagrangian has a non-canonical scalar kinetic term (-1/8 instead of -1/2).
# This implies a field rescaling phi_prompt = 2 * phi_canonical.
# The canonical Yukawa coupling is ig, while the prompt's is k_Yuk * (2).
# This gives the relation: 2 * k_Yuk = i * g.
print("Step 2: Finding the gauge coupling g")
# We use the value of k_Yuk to solve for g.
# g = (2 * k_Yuk) / i = 2 * (-i/sqrt(2)) / i = -sqrt(2)
g = (2 * k_yuk_val) / 1j
print(f"Relating to the canonical Lagrangian, we find: 2 * k_Yuk = i * g")
print(f"Using the value of k_Yuk, we solve for g: g = (2 * ({k_yuk_val:.4f})) / i = {g.real:.4f}")
print(f"So, the gauge coupling is: g = -sqrt(2)\n")


# Step 3: Solve for k_D+F
# The field rescaling also affects the potential term.
# The canonical potential has a coefficient of g^2/4.
# The prompt's potential has a coefficient of k_D+F * (2*2)^2 = 16 * k_D+F.
# This gives the relation: 16 * k_D+F = g^2 / 4.
print("Step 3: Finding k_D+F")
# We use the value of g to solve for k_D+F.
# k_D+F = g^2 / (16 * 4) = g^2 / 64
k_d_f_val = (g**2) / 64
print(f"For the scalar potential, the relation is: 16 * k_D+F = g^2 / 4")
print(f"Using g = {g.real:.4f}, we solve for k_D+F: k_D+F = ({g.real:.4f})^2 / 64 = {k_d_f_val.real:.4f}")
print(f"The value is k_D+F = 2 / 64 = 1 / 32\n")

# Final Answer
print("Final Answer:")
print(f"The constant k_Yuk is -i/sqrt(2), which is approximately {k_yuk_val:.4f}")
print(f"The constant k_D+F is 1/32, which is {k_d_f_val.real:.4f}")

# The prompt asks for the numbers in the final equation.
# Here are the equations with the final numbers plugged in:
# Equation for k_Yuk: 2 * (-0.7071j) = -1.4142j which matches -i * sqrt(2)
# Equation for k_D+F: 16 * (0.03125) = 0.5. And g^2 / 4 = (-sqrt(2))^2 / 4 = 2 / 4 = 0.5. They match.
