    "Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n1.  Establish the start and end years of the war based on the events in the StarCraft II trilogy.\n2.  The war begins with the events of *Wings of Liberty* in the year 2504.\n3.  The war concludes with the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, which takes place in the year 2508.\n4.  Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n5.  Print the equation and the final result, which is an integer and doesn't require rounding up.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in the year 2504\n# with the events of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war concluded in the year 2508 with the epilogue of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration in years.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The problem asks to round up, but since the result is an integer, rounding doesn't change the value.\n# We can still use math.ceil to formally adhere to the rounding instruction.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore began in {start_year} and concluded in {end_year}.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for the duration is:\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration}\")\nprint(f\"So, the war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
