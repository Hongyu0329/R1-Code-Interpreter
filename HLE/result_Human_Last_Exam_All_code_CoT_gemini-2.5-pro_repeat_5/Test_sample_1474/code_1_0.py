    # Option A: Aboriginal masks
    # - William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" opens with the discovery of a Pazuzu amulet, a significant artifact, but not specifically an Aboriginal mask.
    # - This theme is not prominent in Fritz Lang's work.
    print("\n[Analysis A] Aboriginal masks: This is not a common element.")

    # Option B: Magic wands
    # - Neither director is known for fantasy films, making this element highly unlikely for either.
    print("[Analysis B] Magic wands: This is not a common element.")

    # Option C: The first ever cyborgs on screen
    # - Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" (1927) features the famous Maschinenmensch robot, a clear precursor to the cyborg concept.
    # - This is a defining feature for Lang, but not a theme found in William Friedkin's work.
    print("[Analysis C] The first ever cyborgs on screen: This applies to Lang, but not Friedkin.")

    # Option D: Bugs
    # - William Friedkin directed the 2006 psychological horror film "Bug," where insects (real or imagined) are central to the plot.
    # - In Fritz Lang's "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler" (1922), a character under Mabuse's influence hallucinates a swarm of insects.
    # - Therefore, the theme of 'bugs' as a representation of madness or paranoia appears in the work of both directors.
    print("[Analysis D] Bugs: This is a confirmed common element.")
    print("  - Evidence (Lang): Hallucination scene in 'Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'.")
    print("  - Evidence (Friedkin): Directed the film 'Bug'.")

    # Conclusion
    final_answer = 'D'
    print(f"\nConclusion: The correct option is {final_answer} because 'Bugs' appear as a theme in the works of both directors.")
