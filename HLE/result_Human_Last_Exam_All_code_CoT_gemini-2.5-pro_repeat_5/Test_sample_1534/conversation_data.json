    "This is a biological question rather than a coding problem. To answer it, I need to access neuroanatomical information about the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Access my knowledge base on cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n2.  Locate the \"palliovisceral lobe\" within the brain structure of a cuttlefish.\n3.  Identify the anatomical structures that are situated \"posteriorly\" (i.e., towards the rear of the animal) relative to the palliovisceral lobe.\n4.  To satisfy the request for a code block, I will write a Python script that stores this anatomical information in a data structure and then prints the answer in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the known brain regions adjacent\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Anatomical data based on cephalopod neuroanatomy\n    target_lobe = \"palliovisceral lobe\"\n    adjacent_posterior_regions = [\n        \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\",\n        \"Giant fiber lobes\"\n    ]\n\n    # Print the information in a clear statement\n    print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {target_lobe} in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for region in adjacent_posterior_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the giant fiber lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
