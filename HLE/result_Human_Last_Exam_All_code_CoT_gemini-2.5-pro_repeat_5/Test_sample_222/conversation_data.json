    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the new sequence.** The new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving the elements of the two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This means that the even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are from `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed elements are from `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(2n) = x(n)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    *   `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n2.  **Apply the Decimation-In-Time FFT property.** This property allows us to compute an N-point DFT from the N/2-point DFTs of its even and odd parts. In this case, we need to find the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` from the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively.\n\n3.  **Use the combining formula.** The formula that relates the N-point DFT to the N/2-point DFTs of its even (`G(k)`) and odd (`P(k)`) parts is:\n    *   `Y(k) = G(k) + W_N^k * P(k)`\n    *   `Y(k + N/2) = G(k) - W_N^k * P(k)`\n    for `k = 0, 1, ..., (N/2 - 1)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values.** In our problem, `N=8`, `G(k) = X(k)`, and `P(k) = H(k)`. The formulas become:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k + 4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-2j * pi * k / 8)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n5.  **Write the Python code.** I will create a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will iterate from `k=0` to `3`, compute the twiddle factors, and apply the formulas to find all 8 components of `Y(k)`. For clarity, the code will print the detailed calculation for each component, showing the numbers being substituted into the formulas.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence y(n) = {x(0),h(0),...,x(3),h(3)}\n    given the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n    \n    N = 8\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) is calculated using the decimation-in-time FFT formulas:\")\n    print(\"For k = 0, 1, 2, 3:\")\n    print(\"Y(k)   = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Loop through the first half of the points\n    for k in range(N // 2):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_N^k = exp(-2j * pi * k / N)\n        twiddle_factor = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # Calculate the term W_8^k * H(k)\n        term = twiddle_factor * H[k]\n        \n        # Calculate Y(k) and Y(k + N/2)\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k + N // 2] = X[k] - term\n\n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k)\n        print(f\"For k={k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = {X[k]} + ({twiddle_factor:.4f}) * ({H[k]})\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} + ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"   = {Y[k]:.4f}\\n\")\n        \n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k+4)\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = {X[k]} - ({twiddle_factor:.4f}) * ({H[k]})\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} - ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"   = {Y[k+N//2]:.4f}\\n\")\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"The final 8-point DFT vector Y(k) is:\")\n    # Clean up near-zero values for cleaner printing\n    Y[np.isclose(Y, 0)] = 0\n    print(Y)\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the specified format\n    # The string representation is created for the final output format.\n    final_answer_str = f\"[{Y[0].real}, {Y[1].real:.4f}{Y[1].imag:+.4f}j, {Y[2].real:.0f}{Y[2].imag:+.0f}j, {Y[3].real:.4f}{Y[3].imag:+.4f}j, {Y[4].real}, {Y[5].real:.4f}{Y[5].imag:+.4f}j, {Y[6].real:.0f}{Y[6].imag:+.0f}j, {Y[7].real:.4f}{Y[7].imag:+.4f}j]\"\n    return final_answer_str\n\n# Run the solver and print the final answer in the required format.\nfinal_answer = solve_dft()\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n```"
