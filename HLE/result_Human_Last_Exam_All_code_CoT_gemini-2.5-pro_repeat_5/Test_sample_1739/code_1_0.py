def calculate_frequency_correction():
    """
    Calculates the nonlinear frequency correction for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

    The nonlinear frequency correction omega_2 is given by:
    omega_2 = C * |A|^2
    where |A| is the amplitude of the oscillation and C is the coefficient we want to calculate.
    The derivation via the method of multiple scales shows that:
    C = -K / (2 * omega_0)
    
    The coefficient K is derived from the secular terms at order epsilon^2 and is found to be:
    K = -3*c3 + (4/3)*omega_0_sq - (5/3)*c2 + (10/3)*(c2**2 / omega_0_sq)
    
    where:
    omega_0_sq = 3 * gamma
    c2 = (3 * gamma * (3 * gamma + 1)) / 2
    c3 = (3 * gamma * (3 * gamma + 1) * (3 * gamma + 2)) / 6
    
    A simpler form for K is gamma * (3*gamma - 1)**2.

    To obtain a numerical answer, we assume a common value for the polytropic index
    for a diatomic gas (like air), gamma = 4/3. The amplitude |A| is assumed to be 1.
