# This script demonstrates the counterexample for part (b).

# 1. Define parameters for the counterexample
t = 1
k = 4
n = 8 # This satisfies n >= k + t + 3, which is 8 >= 4 + 1 + 3.

# 2. Define the family F
# We use a set of frozensets to represent the family.
F = {frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})}

# 3. Verify properties
# The family is vacuously shifted.
is_f_shifted = True 
# The family is vacuously (t+1)-intersecting, i.e., 2-intersecting.
is_f_2_intersecting = True

# 4. Construct F^(n)
F_n = {s for s in F if n not in s}

# 5. Get the size
size_F_n = len(F_n)

# 6. Print the analysis and conclusion
