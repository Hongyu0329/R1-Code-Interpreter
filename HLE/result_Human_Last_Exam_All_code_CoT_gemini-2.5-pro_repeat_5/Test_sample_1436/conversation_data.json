    "To determine the symmetry factor of the described Feynman diagram, we need to count the number of transformations (permutations of its components) that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. The diagram has two vertices connected by four lines (propagators).\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the symmetry factor, 'S':\n1.  **Identify Symmetries from Vertices:** The two vertices are indistinguishable because they are connected by the same set of four lines. Therefore, we can swap them without changing the diagram. This contributes a factor of 2! (the factorial of the number of permutable vertices).\n2.  **Identify Symmetries from Propagators:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are also identical. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram remains the same. This contributes a factor of 4! (the factorial of the number of permutable propagators).\n3.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the symmetries from the vertices and the propagators.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The symmetry factor (S) of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial number\n# that counts the number of ways the diagram's components can be permuted\n# without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n# For the specified diagram with 2 vertices and 4 propagators connecting them:\n# 1. Symmetry from permuting vertices: There are 2 indistinguishable vertices.\n#    Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2!.\n# 2. Symmetry from permuting propagators: There are 4 identical propagators\n#    (lines) connecting the two vertices. Permuting these lines among\n#    themselves leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 4!.\n#\n# The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\n# Number of indistinguishable vertices that can be permuted\nnum_permutable_vertices = 2\n\n# Number of identical propagators connecting the same two vertices\nnum_permutable_propagators = 4\n\n# Calculate the factorial for vertex permutations\nvertex_symmetry_factor = math.factorial(num_permutable_vertices)\n\n# Calculate the factorial for propagator permutations\npropagator_symmetry_factor = math.factorial(num_permutable_propagators)\n\n# The total symmetry factor is the product\ntotal_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry_factor * propagator_symmetry_factor\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(\"Calculating the symmetry factor for a diagram with 2 vertices connected by 4 propagators.\")\nprint(\"The formula for the symmetry factor (S) is:\")\nprint(\"S = (permutations of identical vertices) * (permutations of identical propagators)\")\nprint(f\"S = {num_permutable_vertices}! * {num_permutable_propagators}!\")\nprint(f\"S = {vertex_symmetry_factor} * {propagator_symmetry_factor}\")\nprint(f\"S = {total_symmetry_factor}\")\n```\n<<<48>>>"
