    # The process is a complex Brownian motion with a drift term v(z) = z / (|z|^2 * ln|z|).

    # Pe ~ ( (n/3) * (1 / (n * ln(n))) ) / (1/2) = 2 / (3 * ln(n)).
    # As n -> infinity, Pe -> 0. This means diffusion dominates.

    # Step 6: We need to find the limit of P(V_n > 2/3) as n -> infinity.

    # the probability that V_n is greater than that number will converge to 1.
