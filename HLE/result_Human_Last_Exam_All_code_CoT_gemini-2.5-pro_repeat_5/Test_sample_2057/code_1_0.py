    # The people with black hats can. Here's a simplified explanation of the logic for one person (P1):
    # P1 (with a Black hat) thinks: "Suppose my hat was White. The new circle of hats would be W B W B B W B B W.
    # In that new hypothetical world, P3 (whose neighbors are P2 and P4) could reason:
    # 'If my hat were Black, the sequence B(P2) B(P3) B(P4) would exist, which is forbidden by Round 1's results.
    # So my hat must be White.'
    # This means, if my (P1's) hat was White, P3 should have been able to solve it in Round 2.
    # But I know P3 (and everyone else) said 'No' in Round 2.
    # Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong. My hat cannot be White."
    # This logic holds for all 5 people with Black hats.
