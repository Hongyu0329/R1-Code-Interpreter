    "This is a highly advanced question in cryptography. Designing and implementing secure cryptographic schemes is notoriously difficult and should only be done by experts. The following code is a simplified **demonstration** and is **not secure for production use**. It serves to illustrate the high-level protocol flow of a two-round threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe goal is to design a `t-out-of-n` threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol. I will implement a simplified version of a scheme inspired by FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold), which fits these criteria.\n\nFor simplicity, all cryptographic operations will be performed using modular arithmetic in a prime field `Z_q`, rather than on an elliptic curve group. This demonstrates the core logic without the complexity of implementing elliptic curve cryptography from scratch.\n\nThe process will be divided into four main phases:\n\n1.  **Key Generation**: A trusted dealer will create a master secret key and use Shamir's Secret Sharing to split it into `n` shares. The corresponding public key is made public.\n2.  **Signing - Round 1 (Commitment)**: A subset of `t` participants who want to sign a message each generate a secret random number (a \"nonce\") and publish a public commitment to it.\n3.  **Signing - Round 2 (Signature Share Generation)**: After receiving commitments from all other participants, each participant calculates a group commitment and a challenge value. They then use their secret key share, their secret nonce, and the challenge to compute their individual signature share.\n4.  **Aggregation and Verification**: A designated aggregator combines the `t` signature shares into a single, final signature. This signature can then be publicly verified by anyone who has the group public key, the message, and the signature.\n\nThe code will print out all the important numbers at each step (keys, shares, commitments, signature components) to make the process clear, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the two-round threshold signature scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
