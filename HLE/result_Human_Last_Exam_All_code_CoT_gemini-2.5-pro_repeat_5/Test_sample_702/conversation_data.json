    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow a multi-step plan based on standard results in algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Map:** The given map is a standard construction in homotopy theory. We can identify it as the adjoint of the smash product of two evaluation maps. Let $\\epsilon_n: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ be the evaluation map, which is the counit of the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction. The map in question, let's call it $f$, is the adjoint of the map $G = \\epsilon_4 \\wedge \\epsilon_6: (\\Sigma\\Omega S^4) \\wedge (\\Sigma\\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n\n2.  **Adjunction and Connectivity:** A fundamental property of the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction is that a map and its adjoint have the same connectivity. Therefore, the connectivity of $f$ is the same as the connectivity of $G$. Our task reduces to calculating the connectivity of $G$.\n\n3.  **Connectivity of a Smash Product of Maps:** We will use a theorem that gives the connectivity of the smash product of two maps. If $f_1: A_1 \\to B_1$ is $c_1$-connected and $f_2: A_2 \\to B_2$ is $c_2$-connected (where all spaces are simply-connected CW complexes), then their smash product $f_1 \\wedge f_2$ is $\\min(c_1 + \\text{conn}(A_2) + 1, c_2 + \\text{conn}(A_1) + 1)$-connected, where $\\text{conn}(X)$ denotes the connectivity of the space $X$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Component Connectivities:** We need to find the connectivities of the individual maps ($\\epsilon_4, \\epsilon_6$) and their domain spaces ($A_1 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^4, A_2 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^6$).\n    *   The connectivity of the evaluation map $\\epsilon_n: \\Sigma\\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ is $2n-3$.\n    *   The connectivity of a sphere $S^n$ is $n-1$.\n    *   The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $n-2$.\n    *   The connectivity of a suspension $\\Sigma X$ is $\\text{conn}(X) + 1$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:** We will plug the calculated values into the formula from step 3 to find the connectivity of $G$, which is our final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final connectivity value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The map is related to spheres S^n1 and S^n2\n    n1 = 4\n    n2 = 6\n    print(f\"The calculation is based on maps involving S^{n1} and S^{n2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the connectivity of the evaluation maps.\n    # The connectivity of epsilon_n: Sigma Omega S^n -> S^n is 2n - 3.\n    conn_e4 = 2 * n1 - 3\n    conn_e6 = 2 * n2 - 3\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the map epsilon_4 (for S^{n1}): 2 * {n1} - 3 = {conn_e4}\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the map epsilon_6 (for S^{n2}): 2 * {n2} - 3 = {conn_e6}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the domain spaces.\n    # The domain spaces are A1 = Sigma Omega S^4 and A2 = Sigma Omega S^6.\n    # The connectivity of Omega S^n is n - 2.\n    # The connectivity of Sigma X is conn(X) + 1.\n    conn_Omega_S4 = n1 - 2\n    conn_A1 = conn_Omega_S4 + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the domain space A1 = Sigma Omega S^{n1}:\")\n    print(f\"  conn(Omega S^{n1}) = {n1} - 2 = {conn_Omega_S4}\")\n    print(f\"  conn(Sigma Omega S^{n1}) = {conn_Omega_S4} + 1 = {conn_A1}\")\n\n    conn_Omega_S6 = n2 - 2\n    conn_A2 = conn_Omega_S6 + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the domain space A2 = Sigma Omega S^{n2}:\")\n    print(f\"  conn(Omega S^{n2}) = {n2} - 2 = {conn_Omega_S6}\")\n    print(f\"  conn(Sigma Omega S^{n2}) = {conn_Omega_S6} + 1 = {conn_A2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the formula for the connectivity of the smash product map.\n    # conn(G) = min(conn(e4) + conn(A2) + 1, conn(e6) + conn(A1) + 1)\n    term1 = conn_e4 + conn_A2 + 1\n    term2 = conn_e6 + conn_A1 + 1\n    \n    print(\"The final connectivity is the minimum of two terms based on the formula:\")\n    print(f\"Term 1: conn(epsilon_4) + conn(A2) + 1 = {conn_e4} + {conn_A2} + 1 = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"Term 2: conn(epsilon_6) + conn(A1) + 1 = {conn_e6} + {conn_A1} + 1 = {term2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Compute the final result.\n    connectivity = min(term1, term2)\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the map is min({term1}, {term2}), which is {connectivity}.\")\n\ncalculate_connectivity()\n\nprint(\"<<<11>>>\")\n```"
