    "My plan is to solve this knowledge-based question by first encoding the defining characteristics of each ballet school's training method into a Python data structure. I will use a dictionary to store the schools and assign a numerical score representing their emphasis on pointe shoe training at the barre. Then, the script will programmatically analyze this data to identify the school with the highest score. Finally, it will print a step-by-step \"equation\" that compares the scores, and provide the final answer based on this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the training methods of famous ballet schools to determine\n    which is most known for female dancers training on the barre with pointe shoes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Encode knowledge about ballet schools into a data structure.\n    # An 'emphasis_score' (1-10) is assigned based on how central barre work\n    # in pointe shoes is to the school's primary training method.\n    # 10 = Hallmark of the method, 1 = Not a focus.\n    ballet_schools_data = {\n        \"A.
