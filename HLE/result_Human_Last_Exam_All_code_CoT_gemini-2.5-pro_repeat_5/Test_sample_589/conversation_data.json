    "My plan is to identify the specific Hollywood film that matches the user's detailed description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: I need to find a film with the following elements:\n    *   A Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n    *   A character who is a teenager.\n    *   The teenager rides a pink bicycle.\n    *   There is a scene where the teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car or vehicle.\n\n2.  **Analyze Potential Films**:\n    *   Many 80s films feature teenagers and bikes (e.g., \"E.T.\", \"The Goonies\"), but a *pink* bike is a very specific clue.\n    *   The movie \"Pretty in Pink\" features the color pink prominently, but the main character drives a pink car, not a bike.\n    *   The horror film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\" (1985), produced by New Line Cinema (a major studio), features a key scene that matches all the criteria.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Match**:\n    *   In \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\", the teenage character Lisa Webber (played by Kim Myers) attempts to save her friend Jesse from Freddy Krueger's possession.\n    *   In the film's climax, she rides her very distinct pink Huffy bicycle to a power plant.\n    *   Inside the plant, she confronts a large industrial truck that Freddy is controlling, which drives directly at her. She is on her pink bike during this confrontation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: This film is the correct answer as it perfectly aligns with all the specific details in the query. I will now generate a Python script to print the name of this film as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_pink_bike_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Hollywood feature film\n    that matches the specific scene described by the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The film is \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\" (1985).\n    # Studio: New Line Cinema (a major studio).\n    # Character: Lisa Webber, a teenager.\n    # Scene: In the climax, Lisa rides her pink bike into a power plant and is\n    # confronted by an oncoming truck controlled by the film's antagonist.\n    \n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals toward an oncoming vehicle is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_with_pink_bike_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
