    This script solves a riddle involving Northern English dialects.
    It deciphers numbers from the Cumbrian dialect and finds their
    equivalent in the Derbyshire dialect.

    # Step 1: Define the terms from the Cumbrian dialect (Kirkby Lonsdale)
    cumbrian_past_quantity_term = "tyaan'eboon"
    cumbrian_present_quantity_term = "daoves"

    # Step 2: Translate the Cumbrian terms into numbers
    # "tyaan'eboon" is a composite number in the Cumbrian system.
    # 'Tyaan' = 2
    # 'eboon' is a local variant of 'Bumfit' = 15
    # So, 2 + 15 = 17
    original_number = 17

    # 'daoves' is a variant of 'Dovera' = 9
    current_number = 9

    print(f"The person from Kirkby Lonsdale (Cumbria) gives us two numbers in their dialect:")
    print(f"- The original quantity was '{cumbrian_past_quantity_term}', which translates to the number {original_number}.")
    print(f"- The current quantity is '{cumbrian_present_quantity_term}', which translates to the number {current_number}.\n")

    # Step 3: Identify the question's requirement
    # The question is: "how many of that thing would he have said he had had, had he had been a Derbyshireman?"
    # This asks for the Derbyshire dialect word for the original quantity (17).
    print("The question asks for the Derbyshire dialect equivalent for the original quantity, which is 17.\n")

    # Step 4: Find the Derbyshire term for 17
    # The Derbyshire system is similar. 17 is also a composite number.
    # 'Tain' = 2
    # 'Bumfit' = 15
    # So, the Derbyshire term is 'Tain-a-bumfit'.
    derbyshire_equivalent_term = "Tain-a-bumfit"
    derbyshire_number = 17

    print("In the traditional Derbyshire sheep-counting dialect:")
    print(f"The number {derbyshire_number} is constructed as Tain (2) + Bumfit (15).")
    print(f"The resulting word is '{derbyshire_equivalent_term}'.\n")

    # Final Answer
    print("Therefore, if he had been a Derbyshireman, he would have said he used to have had:")
    print(f"'{derbyshire_equivalent_term}'")
