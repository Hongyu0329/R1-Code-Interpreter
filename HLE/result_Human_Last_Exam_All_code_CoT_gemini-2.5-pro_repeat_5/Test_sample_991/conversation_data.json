    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle (字谜). I will solve it by breaking down the visual and semantic clues in the description and then combine them to form the final character.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze \"A wooden stick\"**: This is a direct reference to the Chinese character or radical for wood, which is '木' (mù).\n2.  **Analyze \"a square box\"**: This points to the enclosure radical '囗' (wéi), which looks like a box.\n3.  **Analyze \"a ladder placed in the center\"**: The character '木' itself, with its vertical trunk and horizontal branches, has the appearance of a ladder. The riddle implies this \"ladder\" (the '木' character) is placed inside the \"square box\" ('囗').\n4.  **Combine the elements**: By placing the '木' inside the '囗', we form a new character.\n5.  **Write the Python code**: The code will print out this step-by-step logic and show the final \"equation\" that builds the character.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down\n    into its component parts and assembling the final character.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. \"A wooden stick\" refers to the character for wood.\n    part_stick = \"木\"\n    desc_stick = \"A wooden stick\"\n\n    # 2. \"a square box\" refers to the enclosure radical.\n    part_box = \"囗\"\n    desc_box = \"a square box\"\n\n    # 3. \"a ladder placed in the center\" describes the appearance of '木'\n    #    inside the box '囗'.\n    final_character = \"困\"\n    desc_ladder = \"a ladder in the center\"\n\n    # Print the explanation of how the parts fit together.\n    print(\"Let's break down the riddle:\")\n    print(f\"'{desc_stick}' refers to the character: {part_stick}\")\n    print(f\"'{desc_box}' refers to the enclosure radical: {part_box}\")\n    print(f\"'{desc_ladder}' describes the {part_stick} (which looks like a ladder) being placed inside the {part_box}.\")\n    print(\"\\nBy combining these components, we get the final equation:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation showing the components.\n    print(f\"{part_box} + {part_stick} = {final_character}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<困>>>"
