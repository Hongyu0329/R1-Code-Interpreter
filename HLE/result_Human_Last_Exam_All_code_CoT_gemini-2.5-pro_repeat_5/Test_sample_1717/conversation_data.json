    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** I will first find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player, as specified in the game's data.\n2.  **Identify Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I will determine the formula used by the game to increase boss health for each additional player in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Apply the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** I will then analyze this formula in the context of a theoretical, infinite number of players.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that defines the constants from the formula, prints the equation, and explains the logical conclusion derived from it.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to Terraria's source code, the base health for the\n    # Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode (for one player) is 3640.\n    base_health = 3640\n\n    # In Expert Mode, boss health is increased by a certain percentage\n    # for each player after the first. For the Eye of Cthulhu, this value is 35%.\n    health_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    # The formula to calculate health (H) based on the number of players (n) is:\n    # H(n) = BaseHealth * (1 + HealthScalingFactor * (n - 1))\n\n    print(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(\"Health = BaseHealth * (1 + ScalingFactor * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Based on the game's data, the specific values are:\")\n    print(f\"BaseHealth = {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"ScalingFactor = {health_scaling_factor}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"So, the final equation for health (H) with 'n' players is:\")\n    print(f\"H(n) = {base_health} * (1 + {health_scaling_factor} * (n - 1))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"This equation simplifies to a linear function: H(n) = 1274 * n + 2366.\")\n    print(\"As the number of players 'n' approaches infinity, the result of this linear function also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no finite maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in this scenario.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_eoc_max_health()\n```\n<<<Infinite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the source code of the video game Terraria, in Expert Mode what is the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu given an infinite number of players?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
