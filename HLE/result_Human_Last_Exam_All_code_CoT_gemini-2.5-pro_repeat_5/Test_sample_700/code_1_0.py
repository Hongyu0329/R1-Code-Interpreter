# This problem is theoretical and does not require a coding solution.
# The user wants the complexity classes for G and G'.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis:
# G is NP-complete.
# G' is NP-complete.
# The lowest rung of the polynomial hierarchy containing them is NP.
# The requested format is ClassG, ClassG_prime.
