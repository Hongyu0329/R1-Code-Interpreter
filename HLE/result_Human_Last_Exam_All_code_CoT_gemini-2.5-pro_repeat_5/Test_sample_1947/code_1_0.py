# The number of closed tree-like walks of length 6 in X is given by:
# c_1 * e + c_2 * k + c_3 * p + c_4 * sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c_5 * sum(deg(v) choose 3)
#
# Based on combinatorial counting, the coefficients are determined as follows:

# c_1: From walks on a single edge (K_2)
c_1 = 2

# c_2: From walks on a triangle (K_3) traversing each edge back and forth once
c_2 = 9

# c_3: From walks on a path of length 3 (P_4)
c_3 = 6

# c_4: From walks on a path of length 2 (P_3)
c_4 = 10

# c_5: From walks on a star graph (K_1,3)
c_5 = 12
