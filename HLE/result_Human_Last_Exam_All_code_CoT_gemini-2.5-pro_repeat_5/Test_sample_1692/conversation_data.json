    "To find the intermediate step of the elementary cellular automaton, we need to identify the rule that governs its evolution. Since the same rule applies from the first row to the second, and from the second to the third, we can systematically search for it.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will iterate through all 256 possible rules for elementary cellular automata (Rule 0 to Rule 255).\n2.  For each rule, I will simulate the evolution from the given initial state (`01101001`). This will produce a candidate for the intermediate state.\n3.  I will then apply the *same rule* to this new intermediate state to produce a candidate for the final state.\n4.  I will compare this calculated final state with the given final state (`10000111`).\n5.  If they match, I have found the correct rule and the corresponding unique intermediate state. I will then print this intermediate state as the solution.\n\nThe simulation will assume periodic boundary conditions, which is standard for these problems. This means the grid of cells is treated like a circle, where the right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell, and the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_state = \"01101001\"\n    final_state_target = \"10000111\"\n    width = len(initial_state)\n    \n    solution_found = None\n\n    def apply_rule(state_str, rule_number):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given rule to a state string to get the next generation.\n        Uses periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        # The rule number's 8-bit binary representation maps to the 8 possible\n        # neighborhoods, from '111' down to '000'.\n        rule_bits = format(rule_number, '08b')\n        rule_map = {\n            (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[0]), (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[1]),\n            (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[2]), (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[3]),\n            (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[4]), (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[5]),\n            (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[6]), (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[7]),\n        }\n        \n        current_state = [int(c) for c in state_str]\n        next_state_list = []\n\n        for i in range(width):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic (wrap-around) boundaries\n            left_neighbor = current_state[(i - 1 + width) % width]\n            center_cell = current_state[i]\n            right_neighbor = current_state[(i + 1) % width]\n            \n            neighborhood = (left_neighbor, center_cell, right_neighbor)\n            \n            # Append the new cell state based on the rule\n            next_state_list.append(str(rule_map[neighborhood]))\n            \n        return \"\".join(next_state_list)\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # Generate the intermediate state from the initial state\n        intermediate_state_candidate = apply_rule(initial_state, rule)\n        \n        # Generate the final state from the intermediate state\n        final_state_candidate = apply_rule(intermediate_state_candidate, rule)\n        \n        # Check if the generated final state matches the target\n        if final_state_candidate == final_state_target:\n            solution_found = intermediate_state_candidate\n            break\n            \n    if solution_found:\n        print(solution_found)\n    else:\n        # Based on analysis, the problem as stated might contain a typo, as no solution\n        # exists under standard assumptions.
