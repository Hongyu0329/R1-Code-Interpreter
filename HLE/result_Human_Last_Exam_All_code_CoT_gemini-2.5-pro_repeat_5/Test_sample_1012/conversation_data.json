    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the required symmetric key length for quantum resistance:\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat**: The primary quantum algorithm that affects symmetric key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Understand the Impact**: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a symmetric key. This means if a key has `N` possible values (for a k-bit key, `N = 2^k`), a classical computer would take up to `N` attempts, while a quantum computer would take approximately `sqrt(N)` attempts.\n3.  **Quantify the Security Reduction**: For a k-bit key, the quantum attack complexity is `sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2)`. This effectively halves the key's security strength in bits. For example, a 128-bit key has only `128/2 = 64` bits of security against a quantum computer.\n4.  **Establish a Security Benchmark**: A security level of 128 bits (requiring `2^128` operations to break) is a widely accepted standard for strong security against classical computers today.\n5.  **Calculate the Required Key Length**: To achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length must be doubled. Therefore, the required key length is `2 * 128 = 256` bits.\n6.  **Code the Explanation**: The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_safe_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length to be secure against a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A 128-bit key is a common benchmark for strong security against classical computers.\n    # The effort to break it classically is on the order of 2^128 operations.\n    classical_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, provides a quadratic speedup.\n    # This means a quantum computer can break a k-bit key in roughly 2^(k/2) operations.\n    # This effectively halves the bit-strength of the key.\n    security_multiplier = 2\n\n    # To maintain the desired classical security level against a quantum computer,\n    # we must double the key length.\n    quantum_safe_key_length = security_multiplier * classical_security_level\n\n    print(\"The primary threat from quantum computers to symmetric keys is Grover's algorithm.\")\n    print(f\"It effectively halves the bit strength of a key (e.g., a {classical_security_level}-bit key becomes {int(classical_security_level/2)}-bit secure).\")\n    print(f\"To achieve a desired security level of {classical_security_level} bits against a quantum attack, we must use a key of at least:\")\n    \n    # Print each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{security_multiplier} * {classical_security_level} = {quantum_safe_key_length} bits\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_safe_key_length()\n<<<A>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
