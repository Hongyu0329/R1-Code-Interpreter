    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the equation and are left coprime.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Left Coprime Factorization**: A pair of polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, forms a left coprime factorization of $H(s)$ if $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ and the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n2.  **Determine System Poles**: The poles of the system are the union of the poles of all entries in $H(s)$. For a coprime factorization, the roots of $\\det(D(s))$ must be the same as the poles of the system.\n    *   $H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ has a pole at $s=-1$.\n    *   $H_{12}(s) = 1$ has no poles.\n    *   $H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ has poles at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   $H_{22}(s) = 0$ has no poles.\n    The poles of $H(s)$ are at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. Therefore, for a coprime factorization, we must have $\\det(D(s))$ be a polynomial whose roots are $1$ and $-1$, i.e., $\\det(D(s)) = k(s-1)(s+1)$ for some non-zero constant $k$.\n3.  **Construct D(s) and N(s)**: We will construct the rows of $D(s)$ such that the product $D(s)H(s)$ results in a polynomial matrix $N(s)$, while also ensuring the coprimeness condition is met.\n    *   Let the first row of $D(s)$ be $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$. The product with $H(s)$ yields the first row of $N(s)$:\n        $[\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)}{s+1} + \\frac{2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1} \\quad d_{11}(s)]$.\n        For this to be a polynomial row, we can choose $d_{11}(s)=1$ and $d_{12}(s)=s-1$. This makes the first term $\\frac{(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$. The second term is $1$. So, the first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$ and the first row of $N(s)$ is $[1 \\quad 1]$.\n    *   Let the second row of $D(s)$ be $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$. To keep $D(s)$ simple (e.g., triangular) and satisfy $\\det(D(s))=k(s^2-1)$, we can choose $d_{21}(s)=0$. The product with $H(s)$ is $[\\frac{2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1} \\quad 0]$. For this to be polynomial, $d_{22}(s)$ must be a multiple of $s^2-1$. Let's choose $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$. This gives the second row of $D(s)$ as $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$ and the second row of $N(s)$ as $[2 \\quad 0]$.\n4.  **Final Matrices**:\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$, which matches the system poles. This factorization is coprime.\n5.  **Verification**: We will use a Python script to define these matrices and print their elements.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the matrices D(s) and N(s) for the\n    left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The derived left coprime factorization matrices are D(s) and N(s).\n    # D(s) = [[1, s-1], [0, s^2-1]]\n    # N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([[1, s - 1],\n                      [0, s**2 - 1]])\n\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([[1, 1],\n                      [2, 0]])\n\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization of H(s) is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s), where:\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # The use_unicode=True flag ensures a nice print format in supporting terminals.\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_s, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"N(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N_s, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Print each element of the matrices as requested.\n    print(\"--- The elements of the matrices are ---\")\n    print(f\"D(1,1) = {D_s[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(1,2) = {D_s[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,1) = {D_s[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,2) = {D_s[1,1]}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"N(1,1) = {N_s[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(1,2) = {N_s[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,1) = {N_s[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,2) = {N_s[1,1]}\")\n\ncalculate_left_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s-1], [0, s^2-1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>"
