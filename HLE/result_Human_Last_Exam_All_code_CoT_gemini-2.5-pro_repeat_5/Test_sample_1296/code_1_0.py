    # (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # As explained in the plan, the premise that G acts quasiprimitively on the faces
    # implies that N is transitive on the faces, which in turn means D_N must have
    # exactly one face (i.e., be unicellular). So the conclusion is always true
    # under the problem's initial setup.
    answer_a = "Yes"
    
    # (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D
    # if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # The premise implies D_N is unicellular, which implies G/N is cyclic. We check which types allow for a cyclic G/N.
    # HA: Possible if the acting group H is cyclic.
    # TW: G/N is isomorphic to Z_l, which is cyclic.
    # AS: G/N is a subgroup of Out(N), which is cyclic for the given type.
    # Thus, all three types are possible.

    # (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with ℓ ≤ 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    # This questions whether G = T ≀ Z_ℓ (with ℓ ≤ 5) can be a regular map group.
    # It is known that this is possible for ℓ = 3 and ℓ = 5.
    # Since counterexamples exist where such a dessin *can* be formed, the absolute statement
    # that it "cannot" is false.
