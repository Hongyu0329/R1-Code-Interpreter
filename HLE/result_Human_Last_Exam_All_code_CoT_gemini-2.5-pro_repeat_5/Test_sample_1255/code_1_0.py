    print("-----------------------------------")
    
    print("Step 1: Understand the question.")
    print("The question asks if the group structure on a log scheme `G` over `S` automatically implies a group structure on its underlying scheme `|G|` over `|S|`.")
    print("\n")
    
    print("Step 2: Recall the definition of a group object in a category.")
    print("A group object `G` in a category with products (like fiber products `x_S`) is defined by structure morphisms (multiplication, identity, inverse) that satisfy axioms expressed as commuting diagrams.")
    print("For example, associativity `(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)` corresponds to a commuting diagram involving `m: G x_S G -> G`.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Consider the forgetful functor `F`.")
    print("There is a 'forgetful' functor `F` from the category of log schemes over `S` to the category of schemes over `|S|`.")
    print("This functor takes a log scheme `(X, M_X)` to its underlying scheme `X`.")
    print("\n")
    
    print("Step 4: Analyze the properties of the functor `F`.")
    print("Crucially, any functor has two properties relevant here:")
    print("  a) It preserves composition of morphisms. This means it maps commuting diagrams to commuting diagrams.")
    print("  b) This specific functor `F` also preserves fiber products. This means that the underlying scheme of a fiber product of log schemes is the fiber product of their underlying schemes, i.e., `|G x_S G| = |G| x_{|S|} |G|`.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 5: Combine the steps to reach a conclusion.")
    print("Since `G` is a group object, its structure morphisms satisfy the group axiom diagrams.")
    print("When we apply the functor `F` to these diagrams, it turns `G` into `|G|`, `S` into `|S|`, `m` into `|m|`, etc.")
    print("Because `F` preserves commuting diagrams and fiber products, the resulting diagrams for `|G|` are exactly the diagrams required for `|G|` to be a group scheme over `|S|`.")
    print("Therefore, the statement is true. The underlying scheme of `G` is a group object.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.")
    print("  - The answer is 'Yes', so we can eliminate choices C, D, and E, which claim the answer is 'No'.")
    print("  - Let's briefly confirm why the counterexamples are invalid:")
    print("    - C (log elliptic curve): Its underlying scheme (a nodal cubic) is a group scheme.")
    print("    - D (p-torsion of log elliptic curve): Its underlying scheme is a subgroup scheme of a group scheme, hence a group scheme.")
    print("    - E (logarithmic multiplicative group): Its underlying scheme (`A^1`) is isomorphic to `G_m` as a group scheme.")
    print("  - We are left with A and B.")
    print("  - A: 'Yes, because the functor is full.' This is incorrect. The forgetful functor is not full.")
    print("  - B: 'Yes, because the functor is faithful.' This is correct. The forgetful functor is indeed faithful (it is injective on morphisms).")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 7: Select the best answer.")
    print("The most direct reason the proposition is true is that the functor preserves fiber products. This is not given as an option.")
    print("Between A and B, both state the correct conclusion ('Yes'). However, the reason in A is factually incorrect, while the reason in B is factually correct.")
    print("Therefore, B is the best choice among the given options.")
