    "Of course, I can help with that. The question asks to identify the most likely mechanism for both the retention (keeping the extra copy) and divergence (the two copies becoming different) of duplicated genes.\n\nHere is my plan to arrive at the correct answer:\n1.  I will first create a Python script that defines each of the potential mechanisms listed in the answer choices (A-E).\n2.  The script will then systematically evaluate each mechanism against the conditions given in the question: \"retention\" and \"divergence\".\n3.  It will eliminate the incorrect options by explaining why they don't fit. For instance, some mechanisms work against divergence, some represent a failure of retention, and others operate at the wrong biological scale.\n4.  Finally, the script will compare the two most plausible mechanisms (Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization), explain the nuances of each, and conclude which one is considered the most likely general mechanism for preserving duplicate genes, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the possible fates of duplicate genes to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the mechanisms\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': ('Gene conversion', 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This acts against divergence.'),\n        'B': ('Pseudogenization', 'The process where a duplicate gene copy becomes non-functional through mutation. This is a failure to retain a functional duplicate, not a mechanism for its retention.'),\n        'C': ('Neofunctionalization', 'One gene copy retains the original function, while the other acquires a completely new function through mutation. This explains both retention (due to the new benefit) and divergence.'),\n        'D': ('Subfunctionalization', 'An ancestral gene with multiple functions is duplicated. Then, each copy loses different sub-functions, so both genes are now required to perform the original set of tasks. This explains both retention and divergence.'),\n        'E': ('Adaptive radiation', 'A macro-evolutionary process where a lineage rapidly diversifies into new species.
