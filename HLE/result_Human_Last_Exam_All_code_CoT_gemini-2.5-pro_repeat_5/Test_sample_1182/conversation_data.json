    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Reduction:** First, we'll reduce the coefficients of the curve's equation modulo 2. If the resulting curve is stable (meaning its only singularities are ordinary double points), we are done. However, we'll see that this is not the case.\n2.  **Change of Variables:** The initial reduction is singular in a way that requires a change of variables to find a better \"model\" of the curve. We will perform a specific substitution designed to resolve the singularity.\n3.  **New Model Reduction:** We will simplify the equation for the new model and then reduce it modulo 2. This will yield the stable reduction.\n4.  **Singularity Analysis:** We will find the singular points of this stable reduction by computing its partial derivatives.\n5.  **Counting Double Points:** Finally, we will analyze the nature of these singular points to confirm they are double points and count them.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to perform these algebraic steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of a curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define variables for our curve\n    x, y, z = sympy.symbols('x y z')\n\n    # The curve is defined by y^2 = P(x)\n    # The equation is y^2 - (8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x) = 0\n    print(\"The original curve equation is y**2 = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Reduce the curve equation modulo 2\n    # The coefficients become: 8->0, 4->0, 1->1.\n    # So, y^2 = x^2 (mod 2), or y^2 + x^2 = 0 (mod 2) because -1 is 1 in F_2.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Reduce the original equation modulo 2.\")\n    print(\"The reduced equation is y**2 = 1*x**2, which is y**2 + 1*x**2 = 0 in characteristic 2.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to (y+x)**2 = 0, a 'double line', which is not a stable curve.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Perform a change of variables to find a stable model.\n    # The singularity in the reduction is along the line y=x.\n    # We introduce a new variable z such that y = x + 2*z.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Perform a change of variables y = x + 2*z.\")\n    original_equation = y**2 - (8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x)\n    \n    # Substitute y = x + 2*z into the equation\n    new_equation = original_equation.subs(y, x + 2*z)\n    \n    # Expand and simplify\n    # (x+2z)^2 - (8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x)\n    # x^2 + 4xz + 4z^2 - 8x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 - x^2 - 8x\n    # 4z^2 + 4xz - 8x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 - 8x = 0\n    simplified_new_equation = sympy.expand(new_equation)\n    \n    # We can divide by 4 to get a simpler integral model\n    stable_model_equation = sympy.div(simplified_new_equation, 4)[0]\n    \n    print(\"After substitution and simplification, we divide by 4 to get the new model:\")\n    print(\"The equation for the new model is:\")\n    print(\"1*z**2 + 1*x*z - 2*x**5 - 1*x**4 - 1*x**3 - 2*x = 0\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reduce this new model's equation modulo 2\n    # The coefficients become: 1->1, -2->0, -1->1\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Reduce the new model equation modulo 2.\")\n    reduced_stable_equation = stable_model_equation.subs({\n        c: c % 2 for c in stable_model_equation.atoms(sympy.Integer)\n    })\n    # In characteristic 2, -1 is 1.\n    reduced_stable_equation = sympy.poly(reduced_stable_equation, x, z).set_mod(2).as_expr()\n    \n    print(\"The equation for the stable reduction is:\")\n    print(\"1*z**2 + 1*x*z + 1*x**4 + 1*x**3 = 0\")\n\n    # Step 4: Find the singular points of this reduced curve.\n    # Let G(x, z) = z**2 + x*z + x**4 + x**3\n    G = reduced_stable_equation\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Find the singular points of the stable reduction.\")\n    \n    # Partial derivatives modulo 2\n    G_dx = sympy.poly(sympy.diff(G, x), x, z).set_mod(2).as_expr()\n    G_dz = sympy.poly(sympy.diff(G, z), x, z).set_mod(2).as_expr()\n    \n    print(f\"The partial derivative with respect to x is: {G_dx} = 0\")\n    print(f\"The partial derivative with respect to z is: {G_dz} = 0\")\n\n    print(\"Solving 'x = 0' and 'z + x**2 = 0' over the field with 2 elements gives the single point (x,z) = (0,0).\")\n    print(\"Checking if (0,0) is on the curve: 1*0**2 + 1*0*0 + 1*0**4 + 1*0**3 = 0.
