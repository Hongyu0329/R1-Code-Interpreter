    "The problem asks for the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2**: First, we need to determine which of the possible 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains.\n    *   **C2**: This group contains the identity and a 2-fold (180Â°) rotation. It has 2 operations, so its order is 2.\n    *   **D1 (also denoted Cm)**: This group contains the identity and a single reflection. It has 2 operations, so its order is 2.\n    Other point groups (C1, C3, C4, C6, D2, D3, D4, D6) have orders different from 2.\n\n2.  **Identify Corresponding Wallpaper Groups**: Next, we need to list the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which of them are associated with the point groups C2 and D1.\n\n3.  **Count and Sum**: Finally, we will count the number of wallpaper groups for each relevant point group (C2 and D1) and sum these counts to get the total.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will:\n    *   Store the mapping of each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its corresponding point group.\n    *   Count the number of groups associated with C2 and D1.\n    *   Print the individual counts and the final sum in an equation format as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its point group.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': 'C1',\n        'p2': 'C2',\n        'pm': 'D1',\n        'pg': 'D1',\n        'cm': 'D1',\n        'p2mm': 'D2',\n        'p2mg': 'D2',\n        'p2gg': 'D2',\n        'c2mm': 'D2',\n        'p4': 'C4',\n        'p4mm': 'D4',\n        'p4gm': 'D4',\n        'p3': 'C3',\n        'p3m1': 'D3',\n        'p31m': 'D3',\n        'p6': 'C6',\n        'p6mm': 'D6',\n    }\n\n    # The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\n    point_group_c2 = 'C2'\n    point_group_d1 = 'D1'\n\n    # Count how many wallpaper groups fall into each category.\n    count_c2 = 0\n    count_d1 = 0\n\n    list_c2 = []\n    list_d1 = []\n\n    for group, point_group in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group == point_group_c2:\n            count_c2 += 1\n            list_c2.append(group)\n        elif point_group == point_group_d1:\n            count_d1 += 1\n            list_d1.append(group)\n    \n    total_count = count_c2 + count_d1\n\n    print(f\"The point groups of order 2 are {point_group_c2} and {point_group_d1}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group {point_group_c2}: {count_c2} (Group: {', '.join(list_c2)})\")\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group {point_group_d1}: {count_d1} (Groups: {', '.join(list_d1)})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{count_c2} + {count_d1} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
