    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find the number of binary operations on a set of 3 elements that are both **commutative** and **associative**.\n\n2.  **Represent the Set:** Let's use the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ for simplicity. A binary operation is a function that takes two elements from $S$ and returns one element from $S$. We can represent this operation using a $3 \\times 3$ multiplication table (a Cayley table).\n\n3.  **Handle Commutativity:**\n    *   An operation `*` is **commutative** if $x * y = y * x$ for all $x, y$ in $S$.\n    *   This property implies that the Cayley table must be symmetric about its main diagonal.\n    *   To define a commutative operation, we only need to specify the results for pairs $(x, y)$ where $x \\le y$. For a set of 3 elements, these are the 6 pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)$.\n    *   The result for each of these 6 pairs can be any of the 3 elements in $S$.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of commutative operations is $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^6 = 729$.\n\n4.  **Handle Associativity:**\n    *   An operation `*` is **associative** if $(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)$ for all $x, y, z$ in $S$.\n    *   Unlike commutativity, there isn't a simple counting formula for associativity. We must test this property for each of the 729 commutative operations.\n\n5.  **Create a Script:**\n    *   The script will iterate through all 729 possible commutative operations.\n    *   For each operation, it will perform a check for associativity. This check involves verifying the associative law for all $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$ possible triples of $(x, y, z)$.\n    *   A counter will be used to track the number of operations that satisfy both properties.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the steps of the calculation and the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_and_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of associative and commutative binary\n    operations on a set of 3 elements.
