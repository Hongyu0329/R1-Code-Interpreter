    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow a systematic approach. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors, and it is often associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of a saddle point.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** We will first find the equilibrium points of the system by setting both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ to zero and solving for $d$ and $u$.\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points:** We will then compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, we can classify each point (e.g., as a saddle, node, etc.).\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix:** A saddle point has stable and unstable manifolds that act as separatrices. The equations for these manifolds are generally hard to find. However, for well-posed problems like this one, we can often guess a simple form for an invariant curve (a curve that trajectories follow) and check if it passes through the saddle point. We will hypothesize that the separatrix is a simple polynomial curve, specifically of the form $d = -u^2$.\n4.  **Verification with Code:** We will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform the following:\n    *   Automate the process of finding and classifying the equilibrium points.\n    *   Verify that the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant curve of the system.\n    *   Confirm that this invariant curve passes through the saddle point.\n    *   Conclude that $d = -u^2$ is the separatrix and print the final equation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_and_analyze_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and verifies the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for the variables\n    d, u = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n    # Define the system of differential equations from the problem\n    d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1 - u)\n    u_prime = (u - 1)*u**2\n\n    print(\"System of differential equations:\")\n    print(f\"d'(t) = {d_prime}\")\n    print(f\"u'(t) = {u_prime}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find equilibrium points by solving d'=0 and u'=0\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding equilibrium points...\")\n    try:\n        equilibria = sympy.solve([d_prime, u_prime], (d, u), dict=True)\n        print(f\"The equilibrium points (d, u) are: {[(p[d], p[u]) for p in equilibria]}\\n\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not solve for equilibrium points symbolically: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Classify equilibrium points using the Jacobian matrix\n    print(\"Step 2: Classifying equilibrium points...\")\n    J = sympy.Matrix([d_prime, u_prime]).jacobian([d, u])\n    \n    saddle_points = []\n    for point in equilibria:\n        d_val, u_val = point[d], point[u]\n        # We are interested in the u >= 0 half-plane\n        if u_val < 0:\n            continue\n            \n        print(f\"--- Analyzing point ({d_val}, {u_val}) ---\")\n        J_at_point = J.subs(point)\n        \n        # Check for degenerate cases where linearization fails\n        if J_at_point.is_zero_matrix:\n            print(\"Jacobian is the zero matrix.
