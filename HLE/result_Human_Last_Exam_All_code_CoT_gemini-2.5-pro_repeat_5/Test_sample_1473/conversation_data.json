    "To determine the value of the integral $I=\\int_0^{\\pi}{(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})}dx$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: First, we simplify the term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$. By setting $y = \\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$, we can use trigonometric identities to show that this expression is equivalent to $\\arctan(\\sin x)$. This simplifies the integral to $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n\n2.  **Use Integral Symmetry**: The new integrand, $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x}$, is symmetric about $x=\\pi/2$, meaning $f(\\pi - x) = f(x)$. This property allows us to change the limits of integration: $I = 2 \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n\n3.  **Apply Feynman's Trick (Differentiation Under the Integral Sign)**: We introduce a parameter, $a$, to define a new function $I(a) = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\arctan(a \\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$. We then differentiate $I(a)$ with respect to $a$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Integrals**: Differentiating with respect to $a$ gives a simpler integral for $\\frac{dI}{da}$, which we can solve. Then, we integrate the result with respect to $a$ to find an expression for $I(a)$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Integration Constant**: We determine the constant of integration by evaluating $I(a)$ at $a=0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Finally, we compute the value of the original integral by calculating $2 \\times I(1)$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to carry out these symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral I = ∫[0, π] csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) dx\n    using symbolic mathematics with sympy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
