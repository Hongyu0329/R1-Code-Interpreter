# The task is to find the dimension of the ninth cohomology group of a space M,
# H^9(M, Q), as a vector space over the rational numbers Q.

# The solution is based on established principles of algebraic topology rather than
# a direct computation on the given vectors. The specific list of vectors is a
# strong hint towards a highly structured underlying space, but the details of
# the vector coordinates are not necessary for this line of reasoning.

# Step 1: The space M admits a free action by the group S^3 (unit quaternions),
# leading to a principal fibration S^3 -> M -> B, where B = M/S^3.

# Step 2: The base space B is the complement of an arrangement of 36 projective
# hyperplanes within the quaternionic projective space HP^3.

# Step 3: The cohomology of the base space B with rational coefficients, H^k(B, Q),
# is non-zero only when k is a multiple of 4. This follows from the known
# cohomology of quaternionic projective spaces and standard topological arguments
# (Mayer-Vietoris sequences and Alexander duality).

# Step 4: We use the Gysin long exact sequence for the fibration. A relevant
# portion for calculating H^9(M, Q) is:
# ... -> H^9(B, Q) -> H^9(M, Q) -> H^6(B, Q) -> ...

# Step 5: From Step 3, we can determine the dimensions of the cohomology groups
# of B that appear in the sequence.
# The degree of the cohomology group is 9.
cohomology_degree = 9

# The dimension of H^9(B, Q) is 0, because 9 is not a multiple of 4.
dim_H9_B = 0

# The dimension of H^6(B, Q) is 0, because 6 is not a multiple of 4.
dim_H6_B = 0

# The exact sequence segment becomes:
# 0 -> H^9(M, Q) -> 0
# This implies that H^9(M, Q) must be the zero vector space.
# Therefore, its dimension is 0.
final_dimension = 0

# The final equation is dim H^9(M, Q) = 0.
# We will now print this result and the numbers involved in the equation.
