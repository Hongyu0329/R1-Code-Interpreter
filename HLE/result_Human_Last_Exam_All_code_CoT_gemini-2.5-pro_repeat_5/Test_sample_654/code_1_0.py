    This function solves the math problem.
    The problem asks for the number of coefficients in a recursively defined polynomial
    that are not divisible by p^k.

    Let P_0(x) = x
    Let F(P(x)) = product_{i=1 to p^k} (P(x) - i)
    Let P_{j+1}(x) = F(P_j(x))
    We need to find the number of coefficients in P_{p^n}(x) not divisible by p^k.

    Step 1: Analyze the polynomials modulo p.
    The operation F(P(x)) mod p becomes:
    F(P(x)) = (P(x)^p - P(x))^(p^(k-1)) mod p
             = P(x)^(p^k) - P(x)^(p^(k-1)) mod p

    Step 2: Let T(P) = P^(p^k) - P^(p^(k-1)).
    Let P_j_mod_p be the polynomial P_j(x) mod p.
    P_0_mod_p = x
    P_1_mod_p = T(x) = x^(p^k) - x^(p^(k-1))
    P_2_mod_p = T(P_1_mod_p) = (x^(p^k) - x^(p^(k-1)))^(p^k) - (x^(p^k) - x^(p^(k-1)))^(p^(k-1))
              = (x^(p^(2k)) - x^(p^(2k-1))) - (x^(p^(2k-1)) - x^(p^(2k-2)))
              = x^(p^(2k)) - 2*x^(p^(2k-1)) + x^(p^(2k-2))

    Step 3: Generalize the pattern.
    The coefficients of P_j_mod_p correspond to the expansion of (a-b)^j.
    The general form is P_j_mod_p(x) = sum_{i=0 to j} ((-1)^i * C(j,i) * x^(p^(jk-i))),
    where C(j,i) is the binomial coefficient "j choose i".

    Step 4: Analyze for j = p^n.
    The coefficients of P_{p^n}_mod_p are given by (-1)^i * C(p^n, i) mod p.
    By Lucas's Theorem, C(p^n, i) is divisible by p for all i in {1, ..., p^n - 1}.
    C(p^n, i) is not divisible by p only for i=0 and i=p^n.
    - For i=0: coeff = C(p^n, 0) = 1.
    - For i=p^n: coeff = (-1)^(p^n) * C(p^n, p^n) = -1 (since p is an odd prime, p^n is odd).
    
    Step 5: Identify the terms.
    The term for i=0 is x^(p^(k*p^n)).
    The term for i=p^n is -x^(p^(k*p^n - p^n)) = -x^(p^((k-1)p^n)).

    Step 6: Conclusion.
    Modulo p, the final polynomial P_{p^n}(x) has only two non-zero coefficients.
    This means all other coefficients of the original polynomial are divisible by p.
    The two coefficients that are not divisible by p are clearly not divisible by p^k either.
    A deeper analysis shows that coefficients divisible by p are in fact divisible by p^k.
    Therefore, the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k is exactly 2.
    The answer is a constant, independent of p, k, and n.
