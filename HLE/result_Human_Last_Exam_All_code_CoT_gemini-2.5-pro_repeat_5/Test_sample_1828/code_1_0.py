    This script solves the given set theory problem by reasoning about the
    possible cardinalities of maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families
    under the given axiomatic assumptions.

    The problem states:
    1. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) fails, so c > aleph_1.
    2. 2^(aleph_1) = aleph_3.
    3. X is the set of cardinalities of uncountable MAD families.
    We need to find max(|X|) - min(|X|).

    # Step 1: Determine the possible values for the continuum, c = 2^aleph_0.
    # From cardinal arithmetic, aleph_0 < aleph_1 implies 2^aleph_0 <= 2^aleph_1.
    # So, c <= aleph_3.
    # Since CH fails, c > aleph_1.
    # Therefore, the possible values for c are aleph_2 and aleph_3.

    # This requires finding a model of ZFC where the number of possible
    # cardinalities for uncountable MAD families is minimized.
    # A known result from set theory (using Martin's Axiom, MA) is that
    # it is consistent with ZFC + not(CH) that all MAD families have cardinality c.
    # In such a model (which is consistent with our premises, e.g., c=aleph_2),
    # the set of cardinalities of uncountable MAD families is just {c}.

    # A theorem by Shelah shows it's consistent that for every cardinal kappa
    # with aleph_1 <= kappa <= c, there is a MAD family of size kappa.
    # To maximize |X|, we need to maximize the number of cardinals in [aleph_1, c].
    # This means we should choose the largest possible value for c, which is aleph_3.
    # In such a model, X = {kappa | aleph_1 <= kappa <= aleph_3}.
