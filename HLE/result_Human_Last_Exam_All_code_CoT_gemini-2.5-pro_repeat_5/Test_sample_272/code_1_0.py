    # (1) What is the cohomological dimension of H?

    # (2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H*H also has torsion, so its cohomological dimension over Z is infinite.

    # (3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # H contains an infinite cyclic subgroup (isomorphic to Z) of index 2. cd(Z) = 1. So, vcd(H) = 1.
    ans3 = 1

    # (4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G has a finite-index torsion-free subgroup that is a free group of rank > 0. Its cd is 1. So, vcd(G) = 1.

    # (6) How many ends does G have?
    # By Stallings' theorem, a free product of two non-trivial groups, not both of order 2, has infinitely many ends.

    # (7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # The torsion in G is of order 2, which is prime to odd p. Thus, cd_p(P) = vcd(G) = 1.
    ans7 = 1

    # (8) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # Since cd_p(P) is finite, P is pro-p torsion-free. Thus, vcd_p(P) = cd_p(P) = 1.
    ans8 = 1

    # (9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)?
    # H^1(G,F_p) = Hom(G^ab, F_p) = Hom(C_2^4, F_p). Since p is odd, Hom(C_2, F_p) is trivial. So the dimension is 0.
