    print(" - Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print(" - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)")
    print(" - The ligand is bidentate, coordinating to the copper via the two sulfur atoms.")

    # Step 2: Determine the coordination and geometry.
    print("Step 2: Determining the coordination number and geometry...")
    print(" - Two bidentate ligands result in a coordination number of 4 for the copper atom.")
    print(" - A 4-coordinate complex can be either tetrahedral or square planar.")
    print(" - For [M(bidentate)2] type complexes, both geometries result in a 'cis'-like arrangement of the ligand donor atoms.")

    print(" - The key structural feature is the chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S). This 6-membered ring is not planar; it is 'puckered'.")

    print("   - Identity (E): Always present.")
    print("   - Proper Rotation Axis (C_n): There is a two-fold rotation axis (C2) that passes through the Cu atom and interchanges the two identical, puckered ligands. Rotating the molecule 180 degrees around this axis leaves it unchanged.")
    print("   - Mirror Plane (sigma): No. Due to the chiral puckering of the rings, there are no mirror planes. A reflection would change the conformation of the rings (e.g., from delta to lambda), so the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.")
    print("   - Center of Inversion (i): No. The complex does not have a center of symmetry.")
    print("   - Improper Rotation Axis (S_n): No. The absence of mirror planes and an inversion center precludes any S_n axes.")
