    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the non-interacting (or \"bare\") system is described by a quadratic action. For a system of fermions, this action in frequency-momentum space is:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\sum_{k, n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\nHere, $\\psi_{k,n}$ are Grassmann fields, $\\omega_n$ are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy for momentum state $k$.\n\nThe bare Green's function, $G_0$, is the two-point correlator, which can be found by taking the inverse of the term in the quadratic action. This gives:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis equation shows that the bare Green's function $G_0$ is the **inverse of a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$**.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that demonstrates this relationship. The script will:\n1.  Define a function to calculate $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ based on the formula above.\n2.  Fix the Matsubara frequency $\\omega_n$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$ for demonstration purposes.\n3.  Iterate through a range of single-particle energy values, $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.  For each $\\epsilon_k$, calculate $G_0$ and print the complete equation, showing explicitly how the value of $\\epsilon_k$ determines the value of $G_0$.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega_n, epsilon_k, mu):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, i*omega_n).\n    \n    Args:\n        omega_n (float): The Matsubara frequency.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        mu (float): The chemical potential.\n    \n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term i*omega_n in the denominator\n    i_omega_n = 1j * omega_n\n    \n    # The term for the energy relative to the chemical potential\n    xi_k = epsilon_k - mu\n    \n    # G_0 = 1 / (i*omega_n - xi_k)\n    g0 = 1 / (i_omega_n - xi_k)\n    \n    return g0\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the functional dependence of G_0 on epsilon_k.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We choose the lowest positive fermionic Matsubara frequency for demonstration.\n    # omega_n = (2n+1)*pi*T.
