    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases, we need to find the smallest amount of information that can distinguish between all of them, even the most similar ones.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Challenge:** The main difficulty lies in distinguishing between very similar PLL cases. The G-permutations are a classic example of cases that are hard to tell apart. A reliable identification method must work for these worst-case scenarios.\n2.  **Establish a Recognition Strategy:** A common strategy for PLL recognition involves looking for key features like \"blocks\" or \"headlights.\" \"Headlights\" are a pair of corner stickers on the same side face that have the same color.\n3.  **Count Stickers for Feature 1 (Headlights):** To positively identify a pair of headlights on a face, you must observe the two corner stickers on that face. This accounts for **2 stickers**.\n4.  **Count Stickers for Disambiguation:** Once you find headlights, you still need more information. For example, all four G-perm cases have headlights. To tell them apart, you must look at the pattern on an adjacent face. Observing a full adjacent face requires seeing its three non-top-facing stickers (one edge sticker and two corner stickers). This accounts for another **3 stickers**.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** This strategy, which is sufficient to distinguish all 21 PLLs, requires seeing the initial 2 stickers for the headlights plus the 3 stickers on the adjacent face.\n6.  **Justify the Minimum:** While one might hope to use fewer stickers, say 4, it can be proven that no set of 4 stickers is sufficient. Because the top layer can be turned (an \"AUF\" or Adjust Upper Face move), different PLLs can be made to look identical from the limited viewpoint of just 4 stickers. Therefore, 5 is not only sufficient but also necessary.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to be seen to identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # To solve the hardest PLL recognition cases, such as distinguishing\n    # the four G-permutations, a common method is used:\n    \n    # Step 1: Look for a pair of \"headlights\".
