    # To solve the hardest PLL recognition cases, such as distinguishing
    # the four G-permutations, a common method is used:
    
    # Step 1: Look for a pair of "headlights". Headlights are two corner
    # pieces on the same face that show the same color on their side stickers.
    # To confirm the presence of headlights, you must see both stickers.

    # Step 2: Once headlights are found, you need more information to distinguish
    # which specific PLL case it is, as several cases share this feature.
    # The standard way is to inspect an adjacent face. This requires seeing
    # its edge sticker and its two corner stickers.

    # to distinguish all 21 PLL cases without ambiguity. It has been shown
    # that any method using only 4 stickers is insufficient, as different PLLs
    # can be rotated to show the same pattern on a given set of 4 stickers.
