    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. This is equivalent to counting the orbits of the set of these quadratic forms under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Represent the Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form in two variables $(x, y)$ over $R$ can be written as $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 7\\}$. We can represent each form by a tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`. Since there are 8 choices for each of the 3 coefficients, there are $8^3 = 512$ distinct quadratic forms in total.\n\n2.  **Represent the Transformations**: The invertible linear transformations on the vector space $R^2$ form the general linear group $GL_2(R)$. A transformation is represented by a 2x2 matrix $P$ with entries in $R$. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the odd numbers: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\n3.  **Define the Group Action**: An invertible matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ acts on a quadratic form $Q$. The new form, $Q'$, is given by the change of variables $x \\to p_{11}x + p_{12}y$ and $y \\to p_{21}x + p_{22}y$.\n    Substituting these into $Q(x,y)$ gives the new form $Q'(x,y) = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2$, with coefficients:\n    $a' = (a p_{11}^2 + b p_{11}p_{21} + c p_{21}^2) \\pmod 8$\n    $b' = (2a p_{11}p_{12} + b(p_{11}p_{22} + p_{12}p_{21}) + 2c p_{21}p_{22}) \\pmod 8$\n    $c' = (a p_{12}^2 + b p_{12}p_{22} + c p_{22}^2) \\pmod 8$\n\n4.  **Count the Orbits**: The number of equivalence classes is the number of orbits. I will implement a brute-force algorithm to count these orbits:\n    *   Start with the set of all 512 forms.\n    *   Keep track of forms that have already been assigned to a class (i.e., visited).\n    *   Iterate through all forms. If a form hasn't been visited, it represents a new equivalence class. Increment the class counter.\n    *   Then, find all forms in the orbit of this new representative by applying all possible invertible transformations. Mark all forms in this orbit as visited.\n    *   Repeat until all forms have been visited. The final count is the answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the number of equivalence classes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R = Z/8Z by counting the orbits under the action of GL_2(Z/8Z).\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n    \n    # Generate all possible quadratic forms represented by (a, b, c)\n    all_forms = []\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Generate the group of invertible 2x2 matrices GL_2(Z/8Z)\n    G = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p11 in range(N):\n        for p12 in range(N):\n            for p21 in range(N):\n                for p22 in range(N):\n                    det = (p11 * p22 - p12 * p21) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        G.append(((p11, p12), (p21, p22)))\n\n    # Count the number of orbits (equivalence classes)\n    num_classes = 0\n    visited = set()\n\n    for form_tuple in all_forms:\n        if form_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        num_classes += 1\n        \n        # Use a queue for a Breadth-First Search to find the whole orbit\n        q = [form_tuple]\n        visited.add(form_tuple)\n        head = 0\n        \n        while head < len(q):\n            ca, cb, cc = q[head]\n            head += 1\n            \n            # Apply all transformations to the current form to find new elements in its orbit\n            for P in G:\n                p11, p12 = P[0]\n                p21, p22 = P[1]\n                \n                # Transformation formulas for coefficients\n                new_a = (ca * p11**2 + cb * p11 * p21 + cc * p21**2) % N\n                new_b = (2 * ca * p11 * p12 + cb * (p11 * p22 + p12 * p21) + 2 * cc * p21 * p22) % N\n                new_c = (ca * p12**2 + cb * p12 * p22 + cc * p22**2) % N\n                \n                new_form = (new_a, new_b, new_c)\n                \n                if new_form not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_form)\n                    q.append(new_form)\n\n    print(num_classes)\n\nsolve_quadratic_form_classes()\n```\n<<<22>>>"
