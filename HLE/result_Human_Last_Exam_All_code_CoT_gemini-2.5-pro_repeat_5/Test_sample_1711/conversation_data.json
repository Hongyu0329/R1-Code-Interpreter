    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the group G and its subgroups.**\n    The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. It is an abelian group. The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, any cyclic subgroup of $G$ must have an order of 1, 7, or 49.\n\n2.  **Simplify the problem by analyzing the relationships between subgroups.**\n    *   The only cyclic subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. To ensure our set $A$ intersects this subgroup, $A$ must contain the zero element, $0 \\in A$.\n    *   Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Then the element $7g$ has order 7, and it generates a cyclic subgroup $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. This subgroup $H_7$ is contained within $H_{49}$.\n    *   This implies that if a set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it will automatically intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding a minimal set $A'$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. The final answer will then be the size of this set plus one (to account for the zero element).\n\n3.  **Reframe the problem in terms of vector spaces.**\n    The set of elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 forms a subgroup $V = (7\\mathbb{Z}_{49})^{2024}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to a vector space of dimension 2024 over the finite field with 7 elements, i.e., $V \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n    The cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of this vector space $V$.\n\n4.  **Solve the vector space problem.**\n    The task is now to find the minimum size of a set $A'$ that has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n    *   Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Any two distinct subspaces in $\\mathcal{L}$ intersect only at the origin $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   Let $A'$ be a set that intersects every subspace in $\\mathcal{L}$. An element $a \\in A' \\setminus \\{0\\}$ can only belong to one such subspace (the one it generates).\n    *   To intersect every subspace, we must select at least one non-zero element from each. Since these subspaces are otherwise disjoint, we need at least $|\\mathcal{L}|$ elements in $A'$.\n    *   The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\n    *   In our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is $|\\mathcal{L}| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n    *   The minimum size of $A'$ is therefore $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The total size of the set $A$ is $|A'| + 1$ (for the zero element).\n    Size of $A = \\left(\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1 + 6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest size of a set A such that every cyclic subgroup\n    of G = (Z/49Z)^2024 contains at least one element of A.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The group is G = (Z/p^2 Z)^n, where p=7, n=2024.\n    p = 7\n    n = 2024\n\n    # The size of the minimal set A is given by the formula:\n    # ( (p^n - 1) / (p - 1) ) + 1\n    # which simplifies to (p^n + p - 2) / (p - 1).\n    # For p=7, this is (7^n + 5) / 6.\n    \n    numerator_add = p - 2\n    denominator = p - 1\n\n    # Use Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers for the calculation.\n    power_val = pow(p, n)\n    numerator = power_val + numerator_add\n    result = numerator // denominator\n\n    # The final equation's numbers are p, n, numerator_add, and denominator.\n    # We print the equation and its result as requested.\n    print(f\"The calculation is: ({p}^{n} + {numerator_add}) / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n    \n    # Return the final result in the specified format for the platform.\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Execute the function and print the final answer.\nfinal_answer = solve()\n# The problem asks not to print the <<<...>>> directly, so we just calculate.\n# The print statements inside solve() will show the result.\n# The following line is for extracting the answer if needed by the system.\n# print(final_answer)\n\n```\n<<<13145463683959114675542456453666383637402945228511241199321301980696959828114387437463139365224347200742512338332159491033148435134612224734568973815348325064414845558943423483754332943894764356494921996911674252329374431872125539423377587943569427339892188619379857908920956895304199248440935567305959954033324546453530373003576052843440735817234824368562339502903417751995004312534571939108434683515139945415309395275812389657754316901844782944884240751954157121286950337893922338575971444158223652802613991283626941153303108932195123964953335520330663876036124536544524451608675033504116496923481231843336423992212334882199182356230752522700329065636903634026601449830533092476510343756317424578531154563124883395987625129676571536349339031448849887754117387127678383216315849838032488034505191983063546853232232155850935017173454379893110915414441490286899732150111663428935422312613141334645341203932912441961528628236165389628283307524021634560942488665780516139722379361309839999462557303030248877112104033103233306871531649718413697968989531189116348873095361386348425514838637762690964121223946654817448883995878411326442152862551468205436666874023727027375913229560447386364344449852431711202865181755106148347895470123547285640700028247656926390883624384566774641618174360340798363749420083214811985161108398848773950488683510526365132349712711718134441>>>"
