    explanation = """
    The Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) beta function is a proposed exact expression for the beta function of the gauge coupling in N=1 supersymmetric theories. A beta function describes how a coupling constant changes with the energy scale. The remarkable feature of the NSVZ formula is that it connects the beta function for the gauge coupling to the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields, providing an all-loops result.

    # Step 2: Explain the core requirement for the derivation.
    derivation_info = """
    The derivation of the NSVZ formula relies crucially on the consequences of supersymmetry, specifically the holomorphy of the gauge kinetic function (which depends on the holomorphic gauge coupling τ). Holomorphy is a very strong constraint that protects certain quantities from receiving quantum corrections. However, when calculating quantum corrections (loop diagrams), one must use a regularization procedure to handle infinities. Many common regularization schemes, like standard dimensional regularization, explicitly break supersymmetry and, as a result, do not respect the holomorphy of the theory.

    Therefore, for the NSVZ beta function to hold in its exact form, the chosen regularization scheme MUST preserve the holomorphy properties that were essential for its derivation. This is the precise condition. Schemes like dimensional reduction (DRED) are designed for this purpose. This directly corresponds to choice B.
