# The user can change this value for n.
n = 10

# The approximation formula is S_n â‰ˆ n^2/2 + 1/120 + 1/(252*n)
term1 = n**2 / 2
term2 = 1 / 120
term3 = 1 / (252 * n)

# Calculate the sum of the terms
result = term1 + term2 + term3

# The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The following print statement displays the formula with the specific value of n and the numbers.
