    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The number of independent basis elements of order `n` in a free Lie algebra with `k` generators is given by Witt's formula. For the BCH formula, the generators are `X` and `Y`, so `k=2`. We are interested in order `n=10`.\n\nWitt's formula is:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))`\n\nHere:\n*   `n` is the order (10 in our case).\n*   `k` is the number of generators (2 in our case).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe steps for the calculation are as follows:\n1.  Identify the parameters: `n = 10`, `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all positive divisors of `n=10`. They are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, compute the value of the Möbius function `mu(d)`.\n    *   `mu(1) = 1`\n    *   `mu(2) = -1`\n    *   `mu(5) = -1`\n    *   `mu(10) = mu(2*5) = 1`\n4.  Substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n    `L_10(2) = (1/10) * [ mu(1)*2^(10/1) + mu(2)*2^(10/2) + mu(5)*2^(10/5) + mu(10)*2^(10/10) ]`\n5.  Perform the calculation to find the final number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculating the result and printing the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for BCH expansion of order n\n    with k generators using Witt's formula and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    sum_terms = []\n    sum_values = []\n    \n    total_sum_val = 0\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = n // d\n        term_val = mu_d * (k**power_val)\n        \n        # Build string for each term in the sum\n        term_str = f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{power_val})\"\n        sum_terms.append(term_str)\n        \n        # Keep track of calculated values\n        sum_values.append(str(term_val))\n        total_sum_val += term_val\n\n    # Print the formula with symbols\n    formula_str = f\"L({n}, {k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(sum_terms) + \" )\"\n    print(formula_str)\n\n    # Print the formula with intermediate calculated values\n    values_str = f\"L({n}, {k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(sum_values).replace('+ -', '- ') + \" )\"\n    print(values_str)\n\n    # Print the formula with the sum evaluated\n    sum_result_str = f\"L({n}, {k}) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum_val}\"\n    print(sum_result_str)\n    \n    # Calculate and print the final result\n    final_result = total_sum_val // n\n    final_result_str = f\"L({n}, {k}) = {final_result}\"\n    print(final_result_str)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is: {final_result}\")\n    \n    return final_result\n\n# Parameters for the problem\norder_n = 10\ngenerators_k = 2\n\n# Solve the problem\nresult = solve_bch_coeffs(order_n, generators_k)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
