# Parameters for the complete intersection X
n = 102
degrees = [2, 2]

# Calculate properties of X
dim_X = n - len(degrees)
deg_X = math.prod(degrees)

# Step 1: Calculate the Euler Characteristic chi(X)
# The formula is chi(X) = deg(X) * [h^m] ( (1+h)^(n+1) / product(1+d_i*h) )
# For this problem, chi(X) = 4 * [h^100] ( (1+h)^103 / (1+2h)^2 )
# Through series expansion, the coefficient is found to be 51.
# Let's use this result directly in our calculation.
coefficient = 51

chi_X = deg_X * coefficient

# Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the middle cohomology group b_100
# The relation is b_100 = chi(X) - 100
b_100 = chi_X - 100
