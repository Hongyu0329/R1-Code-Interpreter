    # Step 1: Define Burke's concepts of Motion vs. Action.
    print("Step 1: Defining the core concepts of 'Motion' and 'Action'.")
    print("  - Motion: For Burke, this is the realm of the non-symbolic. It encompasses the biological and physical world. A rock falls, tides ebb and flow, bodies bleed. These are events without symbolic motive or choice. It is the realm of 'what is'.")
    print("  - Action: This is the realm of the symbolic, which is uniquely human. Action involves symbols, language, choice, and motive. Crucially, action is born from the 'Negative'.")

    # Step 2: Explain the role of the Negative and the "Tribal No".
    print("Step 2: Understanding the 'Negative' and the 'Tribal No'.")
    print("  - The Negative: Burke argues that the negative is a purely linguistic invention; it does not exist in nature. Nature is only positive ('this IS a tree'). Humans, through language, create the 'not' ('Thou shalt NOT...').")
    print("  - The Tribal No: This refers to the foundational prohibitions, commandments, and taboos of a society. These are the fundamental 'Nots' that structure social order and morality.")
    print("  - Connection: Since the 'Tribal No' is composed of negatives and creates the conditions for moral choice (to obey or disobey), it is the very engine of Action. It lifts human behavior from the realm of mere motion into the symbolic realm of action.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices.
    print("Step 3: Evaluating the choices.")
    print("  - The 'Tribal No' is definitively in the realm of ACTION because it is symbolic and creates choice.")
    print("  - Why is it 'imaginal'? Because the negative does not exist in physical reality. It is a concept created by the human mind, a product of the social imagination. It is a symbolic construct, not a sensory object or a purely rational principle in the logical sense, but a foundational image of order.")
    print("  - Therefore, 'Action; it is imaginal' is the most precise description. It correctly identifies the realm (Action) and the reason (it is a symbolic/imaginal construct).")
