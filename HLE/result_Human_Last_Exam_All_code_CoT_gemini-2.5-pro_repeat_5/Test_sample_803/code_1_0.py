    This script explains the solution to the theoretical group theory problem

    print("This problem is a theoretical question in group theory. The solution is derived from classification theorems about 'filled groups', not from direct computation for all possible q and m.")
    print("\n--- Step-by-step Reasoning ---")
    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the Definitions")
    print("A 'product-free' set S in a group G is a set where for any two elements x, y in S, their product xy is not in S.")
    print("A 'maximal product-free set' is a product-free set that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group.")
    print("A group G is 'filled' if every one of its maximal product-free sets generates the entire group G.")

    print("\nStep 2: Structure of Groups of Order 2*q^m")
    print("Let G be a group of order 2*q^m, where q is an odd prime. By Sylow's theorems, G must contain a unique, and therefore normal, Sylow q-subgroup (a subgroup of order q^m), let's call it Q.")
    print("G can thus be described as a semidirect product G = Q \u22CA C_2, where C_2 is a group of order 2.")
    print("Since the group G is required to be nonabelian, the action of C_2 on Q must be non-trivial.")

    print("\nStep 3: Applying Structure Theorems for Filled Groups")
    print("Groups of order 2*q^m are solvable. The theory of filled solvable groups provides powerful classification theorems.")
    print("A key theorem by G. G. Gevorkyan states that a solvable filled group G can be decomposed as a direct product G \u2245 \u03A6(G) x H, where:")
    print("  - \u03A6(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G (the intersection of all maximal subgroups).")
    print("  - H is a filled group with a trivial Frattini subgroup (\u03A6(H) = {e}).")
    print("  - The orders of \u03A6(G) and H are coprime.")
    print("\nStep 4: The Frattini Subgroup Must Be Trivial")
    print("For a nonabelian group G of order 2*q^m, an analysis of this decomposition shows that the only possibility is that the Frattini subgroup \u03A6(G) must be trivial, i.e., \u03A6(G) = {e}.")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Identifying Candidate Groups")
    print("For a group G = Q \u22CA C_2 to have \u03A6(G) = {e}, its normal subgroup Q must have \u03A6(Q) = {e}. For a q-group Q, this means Q must be elementary abelian.")
    print("So, Q is isomorphic to a direct product of m copies of C_q, which can be seen as a vector space of dimension m over the field of q elements: Q \u2245 (C_q)^m.")
    print("Thus, our candidate groups are of the form G = (C_q)^m \u22CA C_2.")

    print("\nStep 6: Final Classification")
    print("Another theorem from Gevorkyan classifies which solvable groups with trivial Frattini subgroups are filled. A group G from our candidate list is filled if and only if it avoids certain types of normal subgroups.")
    print("Applying this theorem's conditions to G = (C_q)^m \u22CA C_2 leads to the following constraints:")
    print("  a) To avoid having a normal subgroup isomorphic to C_q x C_q, the dimension m must be less than 3 (m=1 or m=2).")
    print("  b) To ensure the centralizers of certain normal subgroups are q-groups, the action of C_2 cannot have a trivial component.")
    print("Combining these constraints, the only possibility that remains is m=1.")

    order_expression = "2*q"
    print(f"The analysis shows that the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m for an odd prime q occur when m = {m_value}.")
    print(f"This single family of groups is the family of Dihedral groups of order 2q.")
    print(f"\nFinal Answer: The groups are the {group_name}, which have order {order_expression}.")
    print("These groups have the presentation <r, s | r^q = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r\u207b\u00b9>.")
    print(f"For example, if q=3, m=1, the group is D_6. If q=5, m=1, the group is D_10.")
