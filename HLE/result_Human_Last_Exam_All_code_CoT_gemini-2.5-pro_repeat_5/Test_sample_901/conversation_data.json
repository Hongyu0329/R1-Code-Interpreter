    "The user wants to identify the major product of an organic reaction and present the answer using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n3.  **Apply E2 Stereochemical Requirements:** The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be *anti-periplanar*. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in axial positions. The reaction must proceed from the chair conformer where the bromine is axial, even if this conformer is less stable.\n4.  **Identify Possible Products (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The bromine is on carbon 1. The beta-hydrogens are on carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the molecule adopts the conformation with the bromine in an axial position. In this conformation, there are axial hydrogens available on both C2 and C6.\n    *   **Path A (Zaitsev):** Removal of the axial hydrogen from C2 would form **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (tri-substituted) and more stable alkene.\n    *   **Path B (Hofmann):** Removal of the axial hydrogen from C6 would form **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (di-substituted) and less stable alkene.\n5.  **Select the Major Product:** The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it preferentially attacks the most accessible proton. The axial proton on C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than the axial proton on C2 (which is closer to the methyl group). Therefore, the reaction will favor the Hofmann pathway.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be created to print the name of this product and explicitly state the number in its name, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the given organic reaction and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reactants and reaction type\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    # E2 elimination with a bulky base favors the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n    # The two possible products are 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev) and 3-methylcyclohexene (Hofmann).\n    # The bulky base preferentially removes the more accessible beta-hydrogen on C6.\n    \n    # Final product identification\n    major_product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    # Printing the reaction equation and the result\n    print(f\"Reaction: {substrate} + {reagent}\")\n    print(f\"This is an {reaction_type} reaction.\")\n    print(f\"Due to the bulky base, the Hofmann product is favored.\")\n    print(f\"The major product is: {major_product}\")\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers from the final product's name\n    numbers_in_name = [char for char in major_product if char.isdigit()]\n    print(f\"The number in the final product's name is: {numbers_in_name[0]}\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
