    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the IUPAC name for the reaction product.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The reaction involves methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride (a strong electrophilic activator), and trimethylsilyl cyanide (a cyanide source). This combination points towards a Pummerer-type reaction.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:** I will trace the reaction step-by-step to find the structure of the final product.\n    *   **Step A: Activation.** The sulfoxide is activated by the triflic anhydride.\n    *   **Step B: Pummerer Rearrangement.** An acidic proton is removed, and the resulting intermediate rearranges to form a highly electrophilic thionium ion.\n    *   **Step C: Nucleophilic Attack.** The cyanide anion from TMSCN attacks the electrophilic thionium ion.\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:** Based on the mechanism, the final structure will be determined.\n4.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Rules:** I will apply the systematic IUPAC nomenclature rules to the final product structure to find its name. This involves identifying the principal functional group, the parent chain, and any substituents.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints out the balanced chemical equation, the detailed explanation of the mechanism and naming process, and the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemical_reaction_naming():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a chemical reaction and determines the IUPAC name of its major product.\n    The reaction is: methyl phenyl sulfoxide + triflic anhydride + trimethylsilyl cyanide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Chemical Reaction ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Balanced Chemical Equation\")\n    print(\"The overall reaction is a Pummerer reaction followed by nucleophilic substitution.\")\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as showing the stoichiometric coefficients.\n    print(\"The balanced equation is:\")\n    print(\"1 C₆H₅S(O)CH₃ + 1 (CF₃SO₂)₂O + 1 (CH₃)₃SiCN -> 1 C₆H₅SCH₂CN + 1 (CH₃)₃SiOSO₂CF₃ + 1 CF₃SO₃H\")\n    print(\"(Methyl phenyl sulfoxide + Triflic anhydride + Trimethylsilyl cyanide -> Product + Trimethylsilyl triflate + Triflic acid)\")\n\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Reaction Mechanism\")\n    print(\"a) Activation of Sulfoxide: The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride.
