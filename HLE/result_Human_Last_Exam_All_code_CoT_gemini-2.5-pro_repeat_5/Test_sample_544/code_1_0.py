    print("a) Activation of Sulfoxide: The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a sulfoxonium triflate intermediate, [C₆H₅-S(OTf)-CH₃]⁺.")
    print("b) Pummerer Rearrangement: A proton on the methyl group (alpha to the positive sulfur) is highly acidic and is removed. The intermediate rearranges into a key electrophilic species called a thionium ion, [C₆H₅-S=CH₂]⁺.")
    print("c) Nucleophilic Attack: Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) serves as a source for the cyanide nucleophile (:CN⁻). The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic methylene carbon (CH₂) of the thionium ion.")

    print("\nStep 4: IUPAC Nomenclature")
    print("To name this structure systematically, we follow IUPAC rules:")
    print("1. Principal Functional Group: Between the sulfide (-S-) and nitrile (-CN) groups, the nitrile has higher priority.")
    print("2. Parent Chain: The parent chain containing the nitrile is -CH₂-CN. This two-carbon chain is derived from ethane, making the parent name 'ethanenitrile'.")
    print("3. Numbering: The carbon of the nitrile group (-CN) is designated as position 1 (C1), making the methylene carbon (-CH₂) position 2 (C2).")
    print("4. Substituent: A group consisting of a phenyl ring attached to a sulfur atom (C₆H₅-S-) is located at C2. This substituent is named 'phenylsulfanyl'.")
