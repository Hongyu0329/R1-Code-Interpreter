# The number of species in the system.
# The user can change this value to calculate the number of equilibria for a different N.
N = 10

# Based on the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra dynamics, the maximum number of
# equilibria is 2^N.
#
# This is derived by showing that for each of the 2^N possible subsets of
# coexisting species, there is at most one unique equilibrium point.
# Furthermore, parameter choices exist for which this maximum number of
# equilibria is achieved. For example, when all A_i coefficients are equal,
# the system decouples into N independent logistic equations, where each species
# i has two equilibrium states: 0 or K_i. This results in exactly 2^N
# distinct equilibria for the N-species system.

# Calculate the maximum number of equilibria
num_equilibria = 2**N
