    Calculates the specified term of the optimal mean response time x.
    
    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the system parameters.
    2. States the formula for the mean response time x under SRPT.
    3. Calculates the two main integral components of the formula.
    4. Combines the components to get the full expression for x.
    5. Removes rational and log-rational terms as per the problem description.
