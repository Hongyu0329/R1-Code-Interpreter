    """
    This function solves for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse
    of a right triangle with area 263, all of whose sides are rational.

    The problem reduces to finding integer solutions (m, n, t) to the equation:
    m*n*(m^2 - n^2) = 263 * t^2

    The hypotenuse 'c' of such a triangle is given by:
    c = (m^2 + n^2) / t

    Finding the solution (m, n, t) that minimizes the denominator of 'c' is
    a complex number theory problem related to elliptic curves (the congruent number problem).

    The solution is known from mathematical research. Here, we present the final result.
