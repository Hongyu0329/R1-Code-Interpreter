    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the provided 3x3 matrix. The context about the Markov quiver and \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\) is noted, but the matrix `A` is explicitly given, so the task simplifies to a direct determinant calculation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan for the code:\n1.  I will use Python and its `numpy` library, which is ideal for matrix operations.\n2.  The script will begin by defining the matrix `A` as a `numpy` array.\n3.  To satisfy the request to show the calculation, I will print the step-by-step expansion of the determinant using the cofactor formula for a 3x3 matrix. This will display how each number from the matrix contributes to the final result.\n4.  The determinant will be calculated using `numpy.linalg.det()`.\n5.  The final result will be printed clearly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix from the problem statement\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Calculate the determinant\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n# Print the matrix\nprint(\"The matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row:\")\n\n# Extract elements for clarity in the printout\na11, a12, a13 = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\na21, a22, a23 = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\na31, a32, a33 = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate intermediate terms for the equation\nterm1 = a11 * (a22 * a33 - a23 * a32)\nterm2 = -a12 * (a21 * a33 - a23 * a31)\nterm3 = a13 * (a21 * a32 - a22 * a31)\n\n# Print the full equation with numbers\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a11}) * (({a22})*({a33}) - ({a23})*({a32})) + ({-a12}) * (({a21})*({a33}) - ({a23})*({a31})) + ({a13}) * (({a21})*({a32}) - ({a22})*({a31}))\")\nprint(f\"       = ({a11}) * ({a22 * a33 - a23 * a32}) + ({-a12}) * ({a21 * a33 - a23 * a31}) + ({a13}) * ({a21 * a32 - a22 * a31})\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1} + {term2} + {term3}\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1 + term2 + term3}\")\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {determinant:.0f}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
