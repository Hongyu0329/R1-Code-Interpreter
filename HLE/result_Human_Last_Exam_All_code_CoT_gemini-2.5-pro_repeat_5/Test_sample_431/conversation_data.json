    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Protein and Sequence**: I will use the canonical amino acid sequence for the human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABRR1), which can be found on UniProt under the accession number P24046.\n2.  **Define Domain Boundaries**: Based on the UniProt annotation for P24046, the third transmembrane domain (TM3) ends at residue 335, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) begins at residue 436. Therefore, the intracellular linker connecting them spans from residue 336 to 435.\n3.  **Extract and Analyze**: I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Store the full protein sequence.\n    *   Extract the subsequence corresponding to the TM3-TM4 linker (residues 336-435).\n    *   Count the number of Cysteine ('C') residues within this extracted linker sequence.\n    *   Print the details of the analysis and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_cysteine_in_linker():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker\n    of the human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt P24046).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
