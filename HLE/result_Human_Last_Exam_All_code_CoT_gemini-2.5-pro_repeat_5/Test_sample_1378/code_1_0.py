# Step 1: Define the historical context.
# In January 1907, a devastating earthquake struck Kingston, Jamaica, which was then a British colony.
# The United States government, under President Theodore Roosevelt, quickly dispatched a naval squadron with aid, commanded by Rear Admiral Charles H. Davis.

# Step 2: Detail the diplomatic incident.
# The British Governor of Jamaica, Sir Alexander Swettenham, was a staunch nationalist.
# He took offense at the presence of American sailors and publicly rebuffed Admiral Davis's offer of assistance in a famously insulting letter.
# This rejection of much-needed aid caused a significant diplomatic incident between the UK and the US, leading to the Governor's forced apology and subsequent resignation.

# Step 3: Analyze the local population's reaction.
# Historical records, including reports from the local newspaper "The Gleaner," show that the Jamaican public and business community were overwhelmingly against Governor Swettenham's decision.
# They were in desperate need of help and saw the American offer as a generous and critical lifeline.
# The business community, in particular, valued its strong economic ties with the United States and was horrified that the Governor's actions might jeopardize this relationship.

# Step 4: Evaluate the provided answer choices.
# A: "The locals were wary of American intervention..." - This is incorrect. The locals were grateful for the offered intervention.
# B & D: These options mention Canadian annexation, which was not a central issue in this specific incident. The local population was not agnostic; they had strong opinions on the matter.
# C: "The locals were loyal British subjects and preferred colonial administration..." - This is incorrect. They were furious with the representative of the colonial administration for his actions.
# E: "The locals preferred American annexation over British rule due to the economic ties between the countries and associated material benefits" - This option most closely aligns with the historical facts. While "annexation" might be an overstatement of the general sentiment, the core of the statement is correct: the locals' reaction demonstrated a clear preference for the material benefits and practical help offered by the Americans, driven by existing economic ties, over the high-handed pride of their British governor. It is the best fit among the choices.

# Step 5: Print the conclusion.
