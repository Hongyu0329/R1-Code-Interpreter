    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `phi^4` theory near four dimensions, we will use the Renormalization Group (RG) framework.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **The Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` runs with the energy scale. Fixed points, denoted `u*`, are the zeros of this function, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`. These points represent scale-invariant theories.\n2.  **Dimensional Regularization:** We work in `d = 4 - ε` dimensions, where `ε` is a small positive parameter. This allows us to control the ultraviolet divergences of the theory. The `phi^4` coupling `u` is made dimensionless in `d` dimensions.\n3.  **Leading Order Calculation:** The one-loop beta function for the O(N)-symmetric `phi^4` theory (where N is the number of scalar field components) is given by:\n    `β(u) = -εu + (N + 8) / (8π²) * u² + O(u³)`\n4.  **Finding the Fixed Point:** We solve for the non-trivial fixed point by setting `β(u*) = 0` and looking for the solution where `u* ≠ 0`.\n    ` -εu* + (N + 8) / (8π²) * (u*)² = 0`\n    ` u* * [-ε + (N + 8) / (8π²) * u*] = 0`\n    The non-trivial solution (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) is:\n    `u* = (8π²ε) / (N + 8)`\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to define the beta function, solve for the fixed point symbolically, and print the resulting expression. The script will explicitly show the numbers and symbols in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the Wilson-Fisher fixed point for phi^4 theory\n    in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions using the one-loop beta function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables\n    # u: the coupling constant\n    # epsilon: the deviation from 4 dimensions (d = 4 - epsilon)\n    # N: the number of field components (e.g., N=1 for a single scalar field)\n    u = sympy.Symbol('u')\n    epsilon = sympy.Symbol('epsilon')\n    N = sympy.Symbol('N')\n\n    print(\"The one-loop beta function for the O(N) phi^4 theory is of the form:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ε*u + C*u^2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The coefficient C comes from the one-loop diagram calculation\n    # C = (N + 8) / (8 * pi^2)\n    C_numerator = N + 8\n    C_denominator = 8 * sympy.pi**2\n    C = C_numerator / C_denominator\n\n    # Define the beta function\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + C * u**2\n\n    print(\"For the O(N) model, the beta function is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(beta_function, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # To find the fixed points u*, we solve β(u*) = 0\n    print(\"Solving β(u) = 0 to find the fixed points...\")\n    fixed_points = sympy.solve(beta_function, u)\n\n    # The solutions are the trivial Gaussian fixed point (u*=0)\n    # and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n    gaussian_fp = fixed_points[0]\n    wilson_fisher_fp = fixed_points[1]\n\n    print(f\"The trivial (Gaussian) fixed point is: u* = {gaussian_fp}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point, u*, is the leading order expression:\")\n\n    # Print the final equation with its components\n    # The expression is u* = (8 * pi**2 * epsilon) / (N + 8)\n    num, den = wilson_fisher_fp.as_numer_denom()\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"      {sympy.pretty(num)}\")\n    print(f\"u* = {'-' * len(sympy.pretty(den))}\")\n    print(f\"      {sympy.pretty(den)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where the numbers and symbols in the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator constant: 8\")\n    print(f\"Symbol: pi (π)\")\n    print(f\"Symbol: epsilon (ε)\")\n    print(f\"Denominator symbol: N (number of field components)\")\n    print(f\"Denominator constant: 8\")\n\n    # For the specific case of a single scalar field (N=1)\n    u_star_N1 = wilson_fisher_fp.subs(N, 1)\n    print(\"\\nFor the simplest case of a single scalar field (N=1), the expression is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(u_star_N1, use_unicode=True)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point()\n```\n<<<(8*pi**2*epsilon)/(N+8)>>>"
