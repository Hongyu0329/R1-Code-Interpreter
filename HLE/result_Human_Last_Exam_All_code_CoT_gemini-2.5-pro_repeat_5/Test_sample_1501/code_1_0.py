    # We are given a nested SQS(v) where the set of ND-pairs can be partitioned
    # into λ_F = v-1 one-factors. The doubling construction creates a nested SQS(2v).

    # (a) True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
    # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.

    # Reasoning for (a):
    # The construction in question produces ND-pairs only between points on the same level,
    # i.e., of the form {(x, i), (y, i)}.
    # Consider an arbitrary element, for example (p, 0) from Q x {0, 1}.
    # It can form ND-pairs with other elements on the same level, which are of the form (q, 0)
    # where q is an element of Q and q is not equal to p.
    # Since there are 'v' elements in Q, there are 'v-1' choices for q.
    # Therefore, the element (p, 0) is part of exactly v-1 distinct ND-pairs:
    # {(p, 0), (q_1, 0)}, {(p, 0), (q_2, 0)}, ..., {(p, 0), (q_{v-1}, 0)}.
    # So, the statement is True.
    answer_a = "True"

    # (b) What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in the resulting
    # nested SQS(2v) if the pair {x, y} had multiplicity μ in the original SQS(v)?

    # Reasoning for (b):
    # The total multiplicity is the sum of contributions from two parts of the construction.
    # Let λ_F be the number of 1-factors in the SQS(v), which is given as v-1.
    # Let μ be the multiplicity of the pair {x, y} in the original SQS(v).
    #
    # Contribution 1: Derived directly from the original ND-pairs.
    # This part contributes μ to the final multiplicity.
    #
    # Contribution 2: Derived from pairs of pairs within the 1-factors.
    # An ND-pair {(x,0), (y,0)} is formed for each 1-factor that does NOT contain {x,y}.
    # The number of such 1-factors is (total 1-factors) - (1-factors containing {x,y}) = λ_F - μ.
    #
    # Total Multiplicity = (Contribution 1) + (Contribution 2)
    # Multiplicity = μ + (λ_F - μ)
    # Since λ_F = v-1, the equation becomes:
    # Multiplicity = μ + (v - 1 - μ) = v - 1.
    # The final expression for the multiplicity is v - 1.
    v_char = "v"
    one = 1
    answer_b_expr = f"{v_char} - {one}"

    # (c) Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?

    # Reasoning for (c):
    # From part (b), we found that any existing ND-pair in the new construction has a multiplicity of v - 1.
    # The question is whether this multiplicity can be equal to v.
    # We set up the equation: v - 1 = v
    # Subtracting 'v' from both sides gives: -1 = 0.
    # This is a contradiction, meaning the equality can never hold.
    # Thus, no ND-pair has a multiplicity of exactly v. The answer is No.
    answer_c = "No"
