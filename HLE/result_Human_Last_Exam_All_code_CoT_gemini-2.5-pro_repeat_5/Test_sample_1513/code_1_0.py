def solve_riddle():
    """
    This function solves the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.
    
    Clues:
    1. An island town.
    2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.
    3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.
    4. The town shares its name with the bay/caldera.
    
    Analysis:
    - The criteria of extreme remoteness (>500 km) and a shared name between the town and its bay
      point strongly to Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
    - Hanga Roa is the town, and it sits on Hanga Roa Bay.
    - Easter Island is over 2,000 km from the inhabited Pitcairn Islands.
    - While the bay itself is not a caldera, the island is famously volcanic with a prominent caldera,
      making this the best fit for the riddle.
