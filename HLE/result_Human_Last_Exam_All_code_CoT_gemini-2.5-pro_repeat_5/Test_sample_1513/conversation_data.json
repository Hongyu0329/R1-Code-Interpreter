    "This is a geographical riddle. My plan is to break down the clues in the question and search for the location that matches them all.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues:**\n    *   It's an island town.\n    *   It's extremely remote, being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    *   The town sits on a bay.\n    *   This bay was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town, bay, and/or caldera share a name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate potential candidates:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** This is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world. Its settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, fits the remoteness criteria. However, it sits on an open coastal plain, not a distinct bay, and the names of the settlement and the main volcano (Queen Mary's Peak) do not match.\n    *   **Aogashima, Japan:** This island is a volcanic caldera with a village inside. However, it is only about 60 km from the nearest inhabited island, so it fails the remoteness test.\n    *   **Hanga Roa, Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is the prime candidate.\n        *   **Island Town:** Yes, Hanga Roa is the main town on Easter Island.\n        *   **Remoteness:** Yes, Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land, Pitcairn Island, is over 2,000 km away, easily satisfying the \">500 km\" condition.\n        *   **Town/Bay Name Match:** Yes, the town of Hanga Roa sits on a bay named Hanga Roa Bay.\n        *   **Volcanic Caldera:** This is the only point of slight inaccuracy in the riddle. Easter Island is a volcanic island and has a famous caldera called Rano Kau. However, Hanga Roa Bay itself is not the caldera. Given that all other specific clues (extreme remoteness, island town, shared town/bay name) point directly to Hanga Roa, it's the most logical answer, accepting a slight geological simplification in the riddle's phrasing.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The island town is Hanga Roa. I will now write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1. An island town.\n    2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4. The town shares its name with the bay/caldera.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    - The criteria of extreme remoteness (>500 km) and a shared name between the town and its bay\n      point strongly to Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - Hanga Roa is the town, and it sits on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    - Easter Island is over 2,000 km from the inhabited Pitcairn Islands.\n    - While the bay itself is not a caldera, the island is famously volcanic with a prominent caldera,\n      making this the best fit for the riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
