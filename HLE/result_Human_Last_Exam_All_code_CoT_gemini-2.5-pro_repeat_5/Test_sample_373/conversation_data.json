    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (`K_5`), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Analyze the Gossiping Process:** In randomized uniform gossiping, the process for sampling an edge involves two steps:\n    a. A node is selected from the entire graph uniformly at random. The probability of selecting any single node is `1 / Total Nodes`.\n    b. The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random. The probability of this is `1 / Degree of the Chosen Node`.\n3.  **Identify the Target Edge:** Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` in the first clique and node `v` in the second clique.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck (`u` and `v`) is crucial. Each is connected to 4 other nodes within its own `K_5` clique and to 1 node in the other clique via the bottleneck. Therefore, `Degree(u) = Degree(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    a. Node `u` is chosen, and it then chooses `v`.\n    b. Node `v` is chosen, and it then chooses `u`.\n6.  **Sum the Probabilities:** The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
