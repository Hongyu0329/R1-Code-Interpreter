# The problem is to find the global labeling number of the graph K_{1,n} where n=100.
n = 100

# As derived in the reasoning, the global labeling number of K_{1,n} is given by the
# n-th term of a minimal sequence where no term is a sum of a subset of the others.
# This sequence is 2^(k-1) for the k-th term.
# For n=100, we need the 100th term.
base = 2
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to determine the global labeling number.
# We print the final calculation and its result.
print(f"The global labeling number for K(1,{n}) is the result of the equation: {base} ** ({n} - 1)")
print(f"So we calculate: {base} ** {exponent}")
print(f"The result is: {result}")
