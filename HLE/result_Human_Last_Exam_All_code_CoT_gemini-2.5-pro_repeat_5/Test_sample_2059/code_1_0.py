    Calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.
    Let P(x) = product_{i=0 to 19} (1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i)) = sum_k a_k * x^k.
    We want to find S = sum_k a_k^2.
    This sum S is the constant term of P(x)P(x^-1).
    This can be found using a matrix method, leading to a calculation involving two linear recurrence relations.

    The final sum is given by S = (A_20 + C_20) / 2, where A_n and C_n are defined as:
    A_n: A_0 = 2, A_1 = 6, A_k = 6*A_{k-1} - 2*A_{k-2}
    C_n: C_0 = 0, C_1 = 2, C_k = 6*C_{k-1} - 2*C_{k-2}
