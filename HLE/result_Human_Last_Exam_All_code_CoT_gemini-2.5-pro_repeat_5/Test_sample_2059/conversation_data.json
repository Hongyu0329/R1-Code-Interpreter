    "To find the sum of the squares of the coefficients, denoted by $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$, we can use a common technique in polynomial analysis. This sum is equal to the constant term of the Laurent polynomial $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nLet's outline the plan:\n1.  Define the polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\n2.  Construct the product $Q(x) = P(x)P(x^{-1})$. The sum we are looking for, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is the constant term (the coefficient of $x^0$) in $Q(x)$.\n3.  The product $Q(x)$ can be written as $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} g_i(x)$, where $g_i(x)$ is the factor corresponding to index $i$:\n    $g_i(x) = \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\n    Expanding this, we get $g_i(x) = \\sum_{j=-3}^{3} (4-|j|) (x^{3^i})^j$.\n4.  The constant term of $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} g_i(x)$ is the sum of all terms $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} C_i$ where the exponent of $x$ is zero. A term in the expansion of $Q(x)$ has the form $\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (4-|j_i|)\\right) x^{\\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i 3^i}$, where $j_i \\in \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n5.  We need to find all integer sequences $(j_0, j_1, \\dots, j_{19})$ that satisfy the condition $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i 3^i = 0$. This is a base-3 representation problem. The uniqueness of such representations implies a recursive structure on the coefficients $j_i$.\n6.  This problem can be modeled using a state-transition system with 3 states, corresponding to a carry in the base-3 arithmetic. The sum of the products of coefficients for all valid sequences can be calculated using a transition matrix $M$.\n    $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n7.  The desired sum is the central component of the vector $v_{20} = M^{20} v_0$, where $v_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n8.  By diagonalizing the matrix $M$, we find the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1=2$, $\\lambda_{2,3}=3\\pm\\sqrt{7}$. The final sum can be expressed as $S = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{20} + C_{20})$, where $A_n$ and $C_n$ are sequences defined by the same linear recurrence relation but with different initial values:\n    -   $A_n = (3+\\sqrt{7})^n + (3-\\sqrt{7})^n$ follows $A_0=2, A_1=6$, and $A_{k} = 6A_{k-1} - 2A_{k-2}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    -   $C_n = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^n - (3-\\sqrt{7})^n}{\\sqrt{7}}$ follows $C_0=0, C_1=2$, and $C_{k} = 6C_{k-1} - 2C_{k-2}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n9.  We can now write a Python script to compute $A_{20}$ and $C_{20}$ using these recurrence relations and find the final sum $S$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.\n    Let P(x) = product_{i=0 to 19} (1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i)) = sum_k a_k * x^k.\n    We want to find S = sum_k a_k^2.\n    This sum S is the constant term of P(x)P(x^-1).\n    This can be found using a matrix method, leading to a calculation involving two linear recurrence relations.\n\n    The final sum is given by S = (A_20 + C_20) / 2, where A_n and C_n are defined as:\n    A_n: A_0 = 2, A_1 = 6, A_k = 6*A_{k-1} - 2*A_{k-2}\n    C_n: C_0 = 0, C_1 = 2, C_k = 6*C_{k-1} - 2*C_{k-2}\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We need to compute A_20 and C_20.\n    # Initialize A_n sequence\n    a_prev = 2  # A_0\n    a_curr = 6  # A_1\n\n    # Initialize C_n sequence\n    c_prev = 0  # C_0\n    c_curr = 2  # C_1\n\n    # Loop from 2 to 20 to compute the 20th terms.\n    for _ in range(2, 21):\n        # Calculate the next term for A\n        a_next = 6 * a_curr - 2 * a_prev\n        # Update previous terms for A\n        a_prev = a_curr\n        a_curr = a_next\n\n        # Calculate the next term for C\n        c_next = 6 * c_curr - 2 * c_prev\n        # Update previous terms for C\n        c_prev = c_curr\n        c_curr = c_next\n    \n    # At the end of the loop, a_curr is A_20 and c_curr is C_20.\n    A_20 = a_curr\n    C_20 = c_curr\n\n    # The final result is (A_20 + C_20) / 2.\n    # Since A_n and C_n are always even, the division results in an integer.\n    result = (A_20 + C_20) // 2\n\n    # Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The recurrence relation calculation yields:\")\n    print(f\"A_20 = {A_20}\")\n    print(f\"C_20 = {C_20}\")\n    print(f\"The sum of squares is S = (A_20 + C_20) / 2\")\n    print(f\"S = ({A_20} + {C_20}) / 2 = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2218130310224136>>>"
