    # Step 1: Define the context of the parental cross.
    print("1. The Cross:")
    print("   - In Calvin Bridges' experiments, a white-eyed female (genotype XwXw) is crossed with a red-eyed male (genotype X+Y).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Describe the unexpected offspring in question.
    print("2. The Unexpected Offspring:")
    print("   - An exceptional male is observed with red eyes and a chromosomal makeup of X0.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Trace the origin of the chromosomes for the X0 male.
    print("3. Tracing the Chromosomes:")
    print("   - The male has red eyes, a trait linked to the X+ allele. The father (X+Y) is the only parent with this allele.")
    print("   - Therefore, the offspring must have received the X+ chromosome from the father's sperm.")
    print("   - The '0' in the X0 genotype means the offspring received NO sex chromosome from the mother.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 4: Determine the required maternal gamete.
    print("4. The Maternal Gamete:")
    print("   - To produce an X+0 zygote, the mother (XwXw) must have produced an egg with no X chromosome (a 'nullo-X' egg).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 5: Identify the meiotic error that produces a nullo-X egg.
    print("5. The Causal Event:")
    print("   - A nullo-X egg results from a meiotic error called non-disjunction.")
    print("   - Option A: Non-disjunction in Meiosis I. The homologous Xw chromosomes fail to separate. This produces one secondary oocyte with XwXw and another with '0'. The '0' oocyte matures into a nullo-X egg. This works.")
    print("   - Option B: Non-disjunction in Meiosis II. Sister chromatids fail to separate. This can also produce a nullo-X egg. This also works.")
    print("   - However, Bridges' discovery of 'primary non-disjunction' classically refers to the Meiosis I error, as this single type of event also produces the XwXw eggs that lead to the other class of exceptional offspring (XwXwY white-eyed females).")
    print("   - Other options (C, D, E) are incorrect as they do not explain the X+0 genotype.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 6: Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The event that explains the formation of a nullo-X egg, which is then fertilized by an X+ sperm to create a red-eyed X0 male, is non-disjunction of the X chromosome in the female. The most fundamental event explaining Bridges' overall results is non-disjunction during Meiosis I.")
