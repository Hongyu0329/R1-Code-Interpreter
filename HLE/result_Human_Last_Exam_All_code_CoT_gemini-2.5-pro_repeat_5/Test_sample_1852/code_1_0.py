# The solution to the problem is based on reasoning in set theory,
# specifically using cardinal characteristics on the uncountable cardinal omega_1
# and the assumption that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.

# The cardinals are represented as strings for clarity.
omega_2 = "omega_2"

# Based on the mathematical derivation, we found that the set X,
# containing all possible regular cardinal lengths of a tower,
# has only one element.
# X = {omega_2}

# delta_1 is the supremum of X.
delta_1 = omega_2

# delta_2 is the infimum of X.
delta_2 = omega_2

# The sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic, where for any
# infinite cardinal k, k + k = k.
result = omega_2

# Print the values and the final equation as requested.
print(f"delta_1 = {delta_1}")
print(f"delta_2 = {delta_2}")
print(f"{delta_1} + {delta_2} = {result}")
