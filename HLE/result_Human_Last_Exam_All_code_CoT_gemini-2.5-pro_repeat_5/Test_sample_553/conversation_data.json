    "This is a music theory question. The term \"minor fifth chord\" is a bit ambiguous, but in this context, it most likely refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (a \"v\" chord, pronounced \"minor five\"). A major key normally has a major chord on its fifth degree (a \"V\" chord). Using a minor chord instead is a common technique called \"modal interchange,\" borrowing from the parallel minor key.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Establish the key of the song. Let's assume a major key for the tonic.\n2.  Identify the tonic chord (the \"I\" chord).\n3.  Identify the fifth degree of that key's scale.\n4.  Check if the chord built on that fifth degree is a minor chord (the \"v\" chord).\n5.  Search through my knowledge of The Beatles' discography for a song whose opening progression matches I -> v.\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" is a perfect example. The verse is in the key of F major.\n- The **Tonic (I)** chord is **F Major**.\n- The song's first chord change is to a **C minor** chord. C is the fifth note in the F major scale, so a C minor chord is the **minor fifth (v)** chord.\n\nThis I -> v (F Major -> C minor) progression is a very distinctive part of the song's opening. The following Python code will print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes and identifies the Beatles song that starts with a\n    progression from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is: {song}\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"The first chord, the tonic (I), is: {tonic_chord.split(' ')[0]}\")\n    print(f\"The second chord, the minor fifth (v), is: {minor_fifth_chord.split(' ')[0]}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe progression is {tonic_chord} -> {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
