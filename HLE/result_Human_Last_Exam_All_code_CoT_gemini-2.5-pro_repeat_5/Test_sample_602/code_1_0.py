    """
    Calculates the value of l(n) based on the derived analytical formula.

    The problem defines a sequence of functions applied to matrices M(n) and P(n).
    l(n) = f^(1)( f_M^(2)( f^(3)(P) ) )

    My analysis simplified the expression for l(n) as follows:
    1. f^(3)(P(n)) is the pseudoinverse of P(n). The matrix P(n) is constructed such
       that its inverse, Z, is a simple tridiagonal matrix with 2s on the
       diagonal and 1s on the first off-diagonals.
    2. f_M^(2)(Z) is the orthogonal projection of Z onto the tangent space at M(n).
       The formula for this projection is U = Z - M * mdiag(M^T * Z).
    3. f^(1)(U) is the sum of the first and last rows of U.

    Through symbolic manipulation and using the fact that the columns of M(n) are
    unit vectors (a^2 + (n-1)b^2 = 1), the final expression for l(n) was
    derived to be:
    l(n) = 2 + 2*b^2 - 2*(2n-1)*a*b
    where a and b are the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of M(n), respectively.

    This script implements this final, simplified formula.
