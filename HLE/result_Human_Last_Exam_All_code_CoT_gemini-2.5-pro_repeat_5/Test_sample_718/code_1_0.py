def solve_functor_resolution():
    """
    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.

    The solution is based on a key theorem in the representation theory of posets.

    1.  A functor f: J -> Vect_K (where J is a poset) is called 'tame' if for every object j in J,
        the canonical map from the colimit of f over all predecessors of j to f(j) is a monomorphism (injective).

    2.  A functor is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of length n. The smallest such n
        is its projective dimension.

    3.  A fundamental theorem states that a functor f is tame if and only if its projective dimension
        is less than or equal to 1.

    4.  Having a projective dimension of at most 1 means the functor admits a projective resolution of length 1:
        0 -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0
        where P_1 and P_0 are projective functors.

    5.  Therefore, by the definition of n-resolvability, a tame functor is 1-resolvable.
