    "In this problem, we need to determine the value of `n` for which a tame functor is `n`-resolvable. I will follow these steps to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: First, I will clarify the definitions of an upper semilattice `J`, a tame functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K`, and what it means for a functor to be `n`-resolvable.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem**: I will state the core theorem from the representation theory of posets that connects the property of being \"tame\" to a functor's projective dimension.\n3.  **Draw the conclusion**: Using this theorem, I will deduce the length of the projective resolution for a tame functor. This length directly gives us the value of `n`.\n4.  **Generate the code**: I will write a Python script that prints out the explanation and the final answer for `n`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_functor_resolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.\n\n    The solution is based on a key theorem in the representation theory of posets.\n\n    1.  A functor f: J -> Vect_K (where J is a poset) is called 'tame' if for every object j in J,\n        the canonical map from the colimit of f over all predecessors of j to f(j) is a monomorphism (injective).\n\n    2.  A functor is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of length n. The smallest such n\n        is its projective dimension.\n\n    3.  A fundamental theorem states that a functor f is tame if and only if its projective dimension\n        is less than or equal to 1.\n\n    4.  Having a projective dimension of at most 1 means the functor admits a projective resolution of length 1:\n        0 -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0\n        where P_1 and P_0 are projective functors.\n\n    5.  Therefore, by the definition of n-resolvability, a tame functor is 1-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The value of n for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.\n    n = 1\n    \n    print(\"A tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable for n based on its projective dimension.\")\n    print(\"A key theorem states that a functor is tame if and only if its projective dimension is at most 1.\")\n    print(\"This means a tame functor has a projective resolution of length 1.\")\n    print(\"By definition, this makes it 1-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the value of n is:\")\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n\nsolve_functor_resolution()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
