    print("Analyzing the statements about Saint Augustine's concept of 'free will':")

    # Statement A Analysis
    print("\nA. Some later discussions of Augustine's concept of 'free will' argued that his approach was, in fact, Calvinist in nature, because there is a suggestion that destiny was predetermined from the point of creation.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. Augustine's later writings against Pelagianism heavily emphasize God's grace and predestination. This has led many, including John Calvin himself, to see his work as a precursor to their own, suggesting a form of determinism.")

    # Statement B Analysis
    print("\nB. Medieval historian R. A. Markus argued that Augustine's view of freedom was asymmetrical, while ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace.")
    print("   Analysis: INCORRECT. While R. A. Markus did argue that Augustine's view of freedom is 'asymmetrical' (i.e., the freedom before the Fall is different from the freedom after grace), he did not ignore predestination and grace. In fact, his entire argument about this asymmetry is built upon Augustine's concepts of the Fall, grace, and predestination. The claim that he ignored these central tenets is false.")

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("\nC. Augustine, in his discussion of the concept of 'bonae voluntatis,' echoing Seneca, determined that the 'voluntas' was a part of the human psyche.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. In works like 'On Free Choice of the Will,' Augustine analyzes the 'good will' (bona voluntas). The concept of the 'will' (voluntas) as a core faculty of the human mind or psyche is central to his psychology, and his educated background meant he was familiar with and built upon classical philosophers, including Stoics like Seneca.")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("\nD. For Augustine it can be argued that it is impossible to mark the separation between philosophy and theology, due to the fact that philosophical question, such as the existence of a 'free will,' operate differently when discussing a theological concept such as 'grace.'")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. This is a standard and accurate characterization of Augustine's thought. For him, faith seeks understanding ('fides quaerens intellectum'). Philosophical inquiries are always intertwined with theological truths, and one cannot be understood without the other. The problem of free will is a prime example.")

    # Statement E Analysis
    print("\nE. Etiene Gilson, in discussing 'grace' in relationship to 'free will' argued that Augustine's idea was rooted in a sense of the 'irresistibility' of God's grace, but not in the Jansenist form.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. Ã‰tienne Gilson, a renowned scholar of medieval philosophy, did make this argument. He asserted that for Augustine, grace is efficacious and ultimately cannot be thwarted, but he carefully distinguished this from the more rigid and fatalistic interpretation later developed by the Jansenists.")

    # Statement F Analysis
    print("\nF. Augustine argued against Evodius on the cause of 'free will' in several ways, including that though man is born with a 'voluntas,' in the end he himself 'wills' and thus is responsible for his own acts.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. This accurately summarizes a key argument from Augustine's dialogue 'On Free Choice of the Will.' He argues with Evodius that God is not the cause of evil; rather, evil stems from the misuse of the free will that God gave to humans, making humans responsible for their sinful acts.")

    print("\nConclusion: The incorrect statement is B.")

# The final answer is B. It is incorrect because the scholar R. A. Markus's analysis of Augustine's
# asymmetrical freedom is fundamentally dependent on the concepts of grace and predestination, not ignorant of them.
