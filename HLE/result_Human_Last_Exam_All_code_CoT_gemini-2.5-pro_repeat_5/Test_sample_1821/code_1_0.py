# This script calculates the number of cardinalities in the specified interval
# based on the interpretation of the problem and the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).

# Step 1: Define the interval based on the number of branches.
# The minimum number of branches |B(T_1)| is ω (aleph_0).
# The maximum number of branches |B(T_2)| is 2^ω₂ (2^aleph_2).
min_cardinality_str = "ℵ₀"
max_cardinality_str_without_gch = "2^ℵ₂"

print(f"The minimum cardinality for the set of branches is |B(T_1)| = {min_cardinality_str}.")
print(f"The maximum cardinality for the set of branches is |B(T_2)| = {max_cardinality_str_without_gch}.")
print(f"The interval of cardinalities is [{min_cardinality_str}, {max_cardinality_str_without_gch}].")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Apply the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) to get a concrete answer.
# GCH states that 2^ℵ_α = ℵ_{α+1}.
# Therefore, 2^ℵ₂ = ℵ₃.
max_cardinality_str_with_gch = "ℵ₃"
print("To find a specific number, we assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).")
print(f"Under GCH, 2^ℵ₂ = {max_cardinality_str_with_gch}.")
print(f"The interval becomes [{min_cardinality_str}, {max_cardinality_str_with_gch}].")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: List and count the cardinals in the interval [ℵ₀, ℵ₃].
# The cardinals are ℵ₀, ℵ₁, ℵ₂, ℵ₃.
# The indices of these aleph numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3.
start_index = 0
end_index = 3

# The number of cardinalities is the number of integers in the range [start_index, end_index].
count = end_index - start_index + 1

print("The cardinalities in this interval are:")
for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
    print(f"  ℵ_{i}")

print("-" * 20)
print("The final calculation is based on the indices of the aleph numbers.")
print(f"Number of cardinalities = (end_index) - (start_index) + 1")
print(f"Number of cardinalities = {end_index} - {start_index} + 1 = {count}")

print("-" * 20)
print(f"The total number of cardinalities in the interval is {count}.")
