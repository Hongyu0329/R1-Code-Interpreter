    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`, with the membership grade of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. This combination is performed using a t-norm operation, which models the fuzzy logical AND.\n\nThe most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Define variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values.\n3.  The result will be the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the rule\n# Firing level of the antecedent part of the rule\nphi_k = 0.7\n# Membership grade of the consequent part of the rule\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation\n# to the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership grade.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum (min) operator.\n# Activation Level = t-norm(phi_k, mu_G)\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
