    This function analyzes the significance of 'opals' in the poem and prints the reasoning and the final answer.
    
    1.  **Analyze the Gemstone:** An opal is known for its play-of-color, a phenomenon where shifting, iridescent colors appear from within the stone. This gives it a sense of depth and complexity.
    
    2.  **Analyze the Context in the Poem:** The woman's "keepsake eyes are opals." The word "keepsake" connects the opals directly to her stored memories. Her past is described as multifaceted, with dreams ("velvet rooms"), tawdry performance ("cheap theatricals"), secrets ("fixing cards"), and fears.
    
    3.  **Synthesize the Metaphor:** The opal's shifting, internal colors are a perfect metaphor for the woman's memories. While her present state is "cold" and "silver," her inner life, viewed through her "eyes," is still full of the varied, deep, and dynamic flashes of her past. The memories are not static; they shift and return, much like the light within an opal.
    
    4.  **Conclusion:** The best choice is the one that captures this dynamic quality. "The shifting depth of memories" (E) precisely describes the function of the opal metaphor in the poem.

The gemstone 'opal' is significant because of its unique physical properties which serve as a metaphor for the woman's inner world.
An opal is defined by its 'play-of-color,' meaning it has a deep, complex, and shifting array of colors within it.
In the poem, the woman's 'keepsake eyes are opals,' directly linking the quality of the stone to her memories. Her memories are not simple or static; they are a complex mix of vibrant dreams, crass experiences, and deep secrets that return to her in her 'bedbound years.'
While her exterior is now 'cold' and 'silver,' her inner life, as seen through her 'opal' eyes, retains this shifting, colorful depth. Therefore, the opals symbolize the dynamic and multifaceted nature of her memories.
