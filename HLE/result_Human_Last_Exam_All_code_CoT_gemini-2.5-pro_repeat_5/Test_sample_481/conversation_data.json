    "Based on information from drug identification databases, the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the numbers \"3105\" and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with \"3106\". My plan is to write a Python script that will:\n\n1.  Define two sets of numbers, one for each capsule's imprint.\n2.  Compare these two sets to find the numbers that are not shared between them.\n3.  Print the full list of numbers for each capsule.\n4.  Print the numbers that are different.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the different numbers on Teva 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numbers found on the 10mg capsule imprint (Teva 3105)\n    imprint_10mg = {3, 1, 0, 5}\n\n    # Numbers found on the 20mg capsule imprint (Teva 3106)\n    imprint_20mg = {3, 1, 0, 6}\n\n    # Find the numbers that are not common to both imprints\n    # The symmetric_difference method returns a set with elements in either set, but not both\n    different_numbers = sorted(list(imprint_10mg.symmetric_difference(imprint_20mg)))\n\n    # --- Final Equation Output ---\n    # As requested, outputting each number involved in the comparison.\n    print(\"Numbers on the 10mg capsule:\", ' '.join(map(str, sorted(list(imprint_10mg)))))\n    print(\"Numbers on the 20mg capsule:\", ' '.join(map(str, sorted(list(imprint_20mg)))))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"The different numbers are:\", ' and '.join(map(str, different_numbers)))\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n<<<5 and 6>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
