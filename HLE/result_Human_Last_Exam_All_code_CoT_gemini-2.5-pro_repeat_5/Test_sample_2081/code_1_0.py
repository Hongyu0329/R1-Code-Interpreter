    # Step 2: State the derived solvability condition.
    # From perturbation theory, the solvability condition for the system is:
    # (x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2) * (1 - e^(-T)) = alpha
    #
    # This simplifies to an equation for the initial values (x_0, y_0, z_0):

    #
    # This is the equation of a sphere. The problem asks for R, which is the
    # radius of this sphere. Thus, R^2 = 0.5 * (e^(2T) + e^T).

    # Step 3: Calculate R^2.
    # Note: In standard floating-point arithmetic, 10^68 + 10^34 is evaluated as 10^68
    # because the second term is too small to affect the mantissa of the first.

    # The final equation for the initial values is 1*x_0^2 + 1*y_0^2 + 1*z_0^2 = R^2.
