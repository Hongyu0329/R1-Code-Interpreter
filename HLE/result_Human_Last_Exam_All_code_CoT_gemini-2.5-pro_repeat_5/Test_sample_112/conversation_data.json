    "Of course. I will provide the answer to your question in the format you requested.\n\nMy plan is to identify the specific version of the \"Sir Launfal\" story you're referring to, which is the Middle English romance by Thomas Chestre. Then, I will identify the historical manuscript in which this poem is preserved and list its contents to find the accompanying \"book of manners.\" Finally, I will write a Python script to store this information in variables and print the answer in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem is the Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre.\n    poem_title = \"Sir Launfal\"\n    \n    # This poem is famously preserved in a specific medieval manuscript.\n    manuscript_name = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    \n    # Within this same manuscript, there is a well-known poem on etiquette.\n    book_of_manners_title = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n    \n    # Print the answer clearly.\n    print(f\"The Middle English romance '{poem_title}' is preserved in the manuscript known as {manuscript_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it in that collection is the book of manners titled '{book_of_manners_title}' (The Book of Courtesy).\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
