    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron. The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron whose faces are already triangles, so \"triangulating\" it simply means counting its faces.\n\nWe can determine the number of faces (F) using Euler's polyhedron formula, `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the known properties of a regular icosahedron: it has 12 vertices (V=12), and 5 edges meet at each vertex.\n2.  Calculate the total number of edges (E). Since each edge connects two vertices, the total number of edges is `E = (V * 5) / 2`.\n3.  Rearrange Euler's formula to solve for the number of faces: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n4.  Substitute the values for V and E to find F, which will be the number of triangles. The code will print out the full calculation.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We need to find the number of its faces.\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\nV = 12\n\n# 5 edges meet at each vertex of a regular icosahedron.\nk = 5\n\n# The total number of edges (E) can be calculated using the number of vertices.\n# Since each edge is shared by two vertices, we have: E = (V * k) / 2\nE = (V * k) // 2\n\n# Using Euler's formula for polyhedra (V - E + F = 2), we can find the number of faces (F).\n# F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The number of faces (F) of the regular icosahedron (the outer-hull) is calculated using Euler's formula: F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(f\"Number of Vertices (V) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Edges (E) = ({V} * 5) / 2 = {E}\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"F = {F}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimal number of triangles needed is {F}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
