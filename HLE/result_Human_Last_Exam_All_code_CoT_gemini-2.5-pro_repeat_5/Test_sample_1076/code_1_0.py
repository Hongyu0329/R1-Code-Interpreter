# In Rudolf Nureyev's famous Act III solo variation as Prince Siegfried,
# before Odile's solo, he performed a series of virtuosic jumps.
# The number of double cabriole derrières in this sequence is 6.
num_cabrioles = 6

# The final equation as requested, showing the numbers involved.
print(f"The number of double cabriole derrières is {num_cabrioles}.")
