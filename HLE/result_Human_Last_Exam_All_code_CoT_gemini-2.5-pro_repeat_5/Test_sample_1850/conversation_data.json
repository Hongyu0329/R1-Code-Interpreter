    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of historical saints mentioned in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\nFirst, I will create a definitive list of candidate names. Given John Milton's Protestant beliefs and his focus on biblical sources, it is highly improbable that he would mention saints canonized by the Catholic Church after the biblical era. Therefore, my search will focus on major figures from the Old and New Testaments who are also considered saints in major Christian traditions.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to perform the following actions:\n1.  Fetch the complete text of *Paradise Lost* from the Project Gutenberg public library.\n2.  Iterate through my list of candidate saints.\n3.  For each name, conduct a case-insensitive, whole-word search on the text to confirm their presence.\n4.  Compile a list of all the names that are successfully found within the poem.\n5.  Finally, print the total count of the found saints, along with an equation showing each individual name that contributes to the total.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport requests\n\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the text of Paradise Lost and counts the number of historical\n    saints mentioned by name.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1. Fetch the full text from Project Gutenberg\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20/20-0.txt\"\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching the text: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # 2. Define a list of candidate historical/biblical saints\n    # This list includes major figures who are venerated as saints.\n    # Post-biblical saints are excluded due to Milton's theology.\n    # The main apostles are included to confirm their absence by name.\n    saints_to_check = [\n        \"Adam\", \"Eve\", \"Abel\", \"Enoch\", \"Noah\", \"Abraham\",\n        \"Isaac\", \"Jacob\", \"Joseph\", \"Moses\", \"Joshua\", \"David\",\n        \"Solomon\", \"Mary\", \"Peter\", \"Paul\", \"John\"\n    ]\n\n    found_saints = []\n    # 3. Iterate and search for each name\n    for saint in saints_to_check:\n        # Use regex for a case-insensitive, whole-word search\n        # This ensures \"Eve\" isn't found in \"Evening\", for example.\n        if re.search(r'\\b' + re.escape(saint) + r'\\b', text, re.IGNORECASE):\n            found_saints.append(saint)\n\n    # 4. Print the final count and the equation\n    count = len(found_saints)\n    if count > 0:\n        # Format the names for the equation, showing each counts as 1\n        names_equation = \" + \".join([f\"1 ({name})\" for name in found_saints])\n        print(f\"{count} historical saints are mentioned by name in Paradise Lost.\")\n        print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n        print(f\"{names_equation} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No historical saints were found by name in Paradise Lost.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n<<<11>>>"
