    print(f"[Factor: Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) | Value: {hba1c}%] -> Significance: Indicates poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, which poses a high risk for infection, poor wound healing, and complications with any surgical procedure.")
    print(f"[Factor: Time Since Trauma | Value: {time_post_trauma_hrs} hours] -> Significance: The long delay means the periodontal ligament cells on the avulsed teeth are non-viable. Replantation is not an option.")
    print(f"[Factor: SNB Angle | Value: {snb_angle} degrees] -> Significance: An angle of 88° (normal ≈ 80°) indicates a prognathic mandible (skeletal Class III). This affects the bite and must be accounted for in the prosthetic design.\n")


    # Section 2: Specific Procedures and Management Considerations
    print("--- 2. Appropriate Management Considerations ---")
    print("The management would be multi-staged, prioritizing systemic health:")
    print(" a) Immediate Medical Management: Urgent referral to a physician to begin management of the uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c of 7.5%). This is critical before most dental procedures.")
    print(" b) Acute Dental Management: Cleaning and debridement of the tooth sockets, suturing for proper healing, and management of pain and infection.")
    print(" c) Definitive Prosthetic Management: Once systemic health is stable, planning for tooth replacement would begin. Options include a removable partial denture, a fixed bridge, or dental implants.\n")

    # Section 3: Cells of Interest
    print("--- 3. Cells of Interest in Healing ---")
    print("The key cells involved in the healing of the tooth sockets are:")
    print(" - Osteoblasts: Bone-forming cells that will rebuild the socket.")
    print(" - Osteoclasts: Bone-resorbing cells that clean up damaged bone.")
    print(" - Fibroblasts: Connective tissue cells that form the scar tissue in the gum.")
    print(" - Inflammatory Cells (e.g., Neutrophils, Macrophages): The first responders to trauma and potential infection.\n")

    # Section 4: Denture Replacement Details
    print("--- 4. Denture Replacement Example (If a Removable Denture is Chosen) ---")
    print(" - Type of Denture: A Removable Partial Denture (RPD) would be a conservative and practical initial choice, especially given the systemic health concerns.")
    print(" - Material: A Cobalt-Chromium cast metal framework with acrylic saddles and teeth. This is durable, hygienic, and provides excellent support.")
    print(" - Abutment Teeth: The teeth adjacent to the space would be used for support. For the lost left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar, the abutments would be:")
    print("   * Mesial Abutment: Left Central Incisor")
    print("   * Distal Abutment: Left Second Premolar")
    print(" - Reason for Choice: These teeth are strategically positioned to provide the best support and retention for the RPD. Their own health would need to be thoroughly assessed first.\n")
