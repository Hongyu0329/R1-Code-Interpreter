    Calculates the maximum possible number of digits for the integer N based on the given property.

    The problem requires that every consecutive subsequence of digits in N has at least one digit
    that appears exactly once. N can use at most 5 distinct digits.

    This can be framed as a problem in combinatorics on words. Let L(k) be the maximum length of a
    string (representing the digits of N) using k distinct symbols, where every substring has a
    character that appears exactly once.

    A known result in this field states that the maximum length is given by the formula:
    L(k) = 2^k - 1

    To find the maximum possible number of digits in N, we need to maximize L(k) for the allowed
    number of distinct digits, k. The problem states N uses at most 5 distinct digits, so k can be
    1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

    The function L(k) = 2^k - 1 is an increasing function of k. Therefore, to achieve the maximum
    length, we should use the maximum number of distinct digits allowed, which is k=5.

    The script will now calculate L(5).
