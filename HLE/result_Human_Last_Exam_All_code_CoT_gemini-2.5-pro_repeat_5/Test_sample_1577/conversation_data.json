    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem asks for the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code. The GSD of a topological phase like the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined.\n2.  **Relate GSD to Topology:** The GSD is given by the formula `GSD = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The number of logical qubits is determined by the number of independent, non-trivial logical operators.\n3.  **Define the Surface:** The problem specifies a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. In this context, \"holes\" refer to boundaries or punctures on an otherwise simple surface, which we can assume to be a sphere (genus `g=0`).\n4.  **Count Logical Operators:**\n    *   The toric code has two types of logical operators: logical-X (strings of Pauli-Z operators) and logical-Z (strings of Pauli-X operators).\n    *   Strings of logical-Z operators must terminate on **smooth** boundaries. With `n` smooth boundaries, one can create `n-1` independent string operators connecting them. Each of these corresponds to a logical qubit.\n    *   Strings of logical-X operators must terminate on **rough** boundaries. With `m` rough boundaries, one can create `m-1` independent string operators connecting them. These also correspond to a separate set of logical qubits.\n5.  **Calculate Total Logical Qubits (`k`):** The logical qubits from smooth boundaries are independent of those from rough boundaries. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each type of boundary.\n    *   `k = (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes)`\n    *   `k = (n - 1) + (m - 1) = n + m - 2`\n    *   This formula is valid for the general case where both `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`.\n6.  **Final GSD Formula:** Substituting `k` back into the GSD formula gives `GSD = 2^(n + m - 2)`.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** Create a script that takes `n` and `m` as inputs, calculates `k`, and then computes the GSD. The script will print the final equation with the specific numbers for `n` and `m` plugged in, making the calculation clear.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a surface with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    This calculation assumes the surface has genus g=0 and that n>=1 and m>=1.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (boundaries).\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (boundaries).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        print(\"This formula GSD = 2^(n+m-2) is derived for the case where n>=1 and m>=1.\")\n        return\n\n    # The number of logical qubits, k, is the sum of qubits from\n    # smooth boundaries (n-1) and rough boundaries (m-1).\n    k = n + m - 2\n\n    # The ground state degeneracy is 2 to the power of k.\n    gsd = 2**k\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with the numbers substituted.\n    print(f\"Given n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes:\")\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits (k) is calculated as: k = (n - 1) + (m - 1)\")\n    print(f\"k = ({n} - 1) + ({m} - 1) = {n + m - 2}\")\n    print(f\"The ground state degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{k} = {gsd}\")\n\n# --- User-configurable values ---\n# Set the number of smooth and rough holes here\nnum_smooth_holes = 4\nnum_rough_holes = 3\n# --- End of configuration ---\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(num_smooth_holes, num_rough_holes)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
