    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the remaining fraction. To answer your question, we need to compare two key metrics:\n\n1.  **Per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p):** This is the proportional reduction in the probability of infection per exposure for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this isn't a single value for everyone; a fraction of people have a `VE_p` of 1 (100% protection), and the rest have a `VE_p` of 0. The population-level `VE_p` is therefore the average efficacy across all vaccinated individuals, which is equal to the fraction of people who are fully protected.\n2.  **Vaccine efficacy estimated from the Incidence Rate Ratio (1 - IRR):** This is a common measure of overall vaccine efficacy in a population, calculated as `1 - (Incidence Rate in Vaccinated / Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated)`.\n\nLet's see if these two quantities are equal.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Model the Scenario:** We will define a hypothetical population with vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. We will set a true efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine (e.g., 80% of vaccinated people are fully protected).\n2.  **Calculate Theoretical Incidence Rates:** Based on the model, we'll calculate the expected number of infections and the incidence rates (`IR_v` and `IR_u`) in both groups.\n3.  **Calculate 1 - IRR:** Using the calculated incidence rates, we will compute the value of `1 - IRR`.\n4.  **Compare:** We will compare the calculated `1 - IRR` with the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`).\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, we will determine if `1 - IRR` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates `VE_p`.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this scenario to demonstrate the relationship. It calculates `1 - IRR` based on the properties of an all-or-nothing vaccine and compares it to the true efficacy.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect print to a string buffer to avoid asking user to copy paste\nimport io\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = mystdout = io.StringIO()\n\ndef analyze_all_or_nothing_vaccine():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1-IRR correctly estimates per-exposure VE for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
