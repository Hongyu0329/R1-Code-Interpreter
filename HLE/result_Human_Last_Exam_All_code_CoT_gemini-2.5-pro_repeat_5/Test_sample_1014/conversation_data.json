    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will write a Python script that performs prime factorization.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will implement a standard prime factorization algorithm.\n2.  The algorithm will start by checking for divisibility by 2.\n3.  Then, it will iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) as potential divisors, up to the square root of the number. This is an efficient way to find prime factors.\n4.  Whenever a divisor is found, the number is divided by it, and the divisor is stored in a list of factors. This is repeated until the number is no longer divisible by the current divisor.\n5.  If, after the loop, the remaining number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n6.  Finally, the script will print the prime factorization in an equation format and then output the largest factor from the list. If the number is prime, it will be its own largest prime divisor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor of a number and prints the prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors\n    # We check divisors up to the square root of the remaining n\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n = n // d\n        d += 2\n\n    # This condition is crucial for cases where the number itself is prime\n    # or the last remaining factor is a prime larger than the square root.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(int(n))\n\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"{original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct and print the equation\n    equation = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(f\"{equation} = {original_n}\")\n\n    # The largest prime factor is the last one in the list\n    largest_prime = factors[-1]\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n\n# The number we want to factor\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
