    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to compute the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ is defined by the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the dimension of the $k$-th homology group.\n2.  **Use Lie Algebra Cohomology**: The homology groups are related to the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ by Poincaré duality, which states that $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong H^{n-k}(\\mathfrak{g})^*$ for an $n$-dimensional Lie algebra. This implies that their dimensions are equal: $b_k = b^{n-k}$, where $b^k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n3.  **Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**: The cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The dimension $b^k$ is given by $b^k = \\dim(\\ker d_k) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_{k-1})$, where $d_k$ is the coboundary operator acting on $k$-forms.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n    *   The script will represent the basis of exterior forms (e.g., $e^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge e^{i_k}$) using sorted tuples of indices.\n    *   It will define the coboundary operator `d` based on the given commutation relations.\n    *   For each degree $k$ from 0 to 6, the script will:\n        *   Construct the matrix representation of the operator $d_k: \\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\Lambda^{k+1} \\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n        *   Compute the rank of this matrix using `numpy`, which gives $\\dim(\\text{im } d_k)$.\n        *   Calculate $\\dim(\\ker d_k)$ using the rank-nullity theorem.\n    *   The script will then compute the cohomology Betti numbers $b^k$.\n    *   Finally, it will determine the homology Betti numbers $b_k$ and construct the Poincaré polynomial string.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef get_wedge_sign(t1, t2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the sign change when reordering `t1` and `t2` into a single sorted tuple.\n    Example: wedge(e2, e1) = -e1^e2.
