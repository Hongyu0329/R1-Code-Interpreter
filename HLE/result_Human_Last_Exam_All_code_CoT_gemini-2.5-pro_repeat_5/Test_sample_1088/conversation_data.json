    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atom. I will provide a Python script that can calculate this for any atom from Hydrogen (H) to Argon (Ar).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals. Each core atomic orbital is represented by one function, which is a sum (contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`-311`**: This describes the valence orbitals. They are \"triple-split,\" meaning each valence orbital is described by three functions. The first is a contraction of **3** PGFs, the second is **1** PGF, and the third is **1** PGF. So, each valence orbital uses `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` PGFs in total.\n    *   **`G`**: This just stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n    *   **`**` (or G-star-star)**: These are polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding.\n        *   The first `*` adds one set of **d-type** polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (any atom other than H or He). A set of d-functions consists of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The second `*` adds one set of **p-type** polarization functions to light atoms (H and He). A set of p-functions consists of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n\n2.  **Atom-Specific Calculation:**\n    *   The total count depends on how many core and valence orbitals an atom has. For example, Carbon (1s², 2s², 2p²) has one core s-orbital and valence s- and p-orbitals. Argon (1s², 2s², 2p⁶, 3s², 3p²) has core s- and p-orbitals and valence s- and p-orbitals.\n    *   The script will store the electron configurations for elements H through Ar.\n\n3.  **Python Script:**\n    *   The script will prompt you to enter an atomic symbol (e.g., 'C' for Carbon).\n    *   Based on the symbol, it will retrieve the number of core/valence s- and p-orbitals.\n    *   It will then calculate the number of primitives for each type of orbital according to the 6-311G** rules.\n    *   Finally, it will print a detailed breakdown of the calculation and the total number of primitive Gaussians.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_primitives_6_311G_star_star():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set\n    for a given atom (H to Ar).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Electron configurations: (core s-orbitals, core p-orbital sets, valence s-orbitals, valence p-orbital sets)\n    # A \"p-orbital set\" refers to the group of (px, py, pz) orbitals.\n    atom_configs = {\n        # Row 1\n        'H' : (0, 0, 1, 0), 'HE': (0, 0, 1, 0),\n        # Row 2\n        'LI': (1, 0, 1, 0), 'BE': (1, 0, 1, 0),\n        'B' : (1, 0, 1, 1), 'C' : (1, 0, 1, 1), 'N' : (1, 0, 1, 1),\n        'O' : (1, 0, 1, 1), 'F' : (1, 0, 1, 1), 'NE': (1, 0, 1, 1),\n        # Row 3\n        'NA': (2, 1, 1, 0), 'MG': (2, 1, 1, 0),\n        'AL': (2, 1, 1, 1), 'SI': (2, 1, 1, 1), 'P' : (2, 1, 1, 1),\n        'S' : (2, 1, 1, 1), 'CL': (2, 1, 1, 1), 'AR': (2, 1, 1, 1),\n    }\n\n    # Get user input\n    try:\n        symbol = input(\"Enter an atomic symbol (e.g., C for Carbon, H for Hydrogen): \").strip().upper()\n        if symbol not in atom_configs:\n            print(f\"Error: Atom '{symbol}' is not supported or is an invalid symbol.
