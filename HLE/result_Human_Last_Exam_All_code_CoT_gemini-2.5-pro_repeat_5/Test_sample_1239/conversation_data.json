    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant and count the number of independent parameters for these transformations.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** The Navier-Stokes equations possess several fundamental symmetries due to the nature of physical laws. We will list each type of symmetry.\n2.  **Determine the Dimension of Each Symmetry:** For each symmetry transformation (like translation or rotation), we will count the number of free parameters it has. For example, translation in 3D space has 3 parameters (one for each direction x, y, z).\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of all independent symmetries.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** A Python script will be created to list these symmetries, their dimensions, and then calculate and print the final sum in the form of an equation.\n\nThe known symmetries are:\n*   **Time Translation:** The laws of physics are the same at all times. (1 dimension)\n*   **Spatial Translations:** The laws of physics are the same at all points in space. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The laws of physics are the same in all directions (isotropy). (3 dimensions)\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant. This is a single-parameter family of transformations. (1 dimension)\n*   **Pressure Shift:** The pressure term only appears as a gradient, so adding a constant to the pressure does not change the equations. (1 dimension)\n\nThe Python script below will now perform the summation of these dimensions.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    This is done by summing the dimensions of each independent symmetry\n    transformation that leaves the equations invariant.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary mapping each symmetry to its dimension (number of parameters)\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation (t -> t + a)\": 1,\n        \"Spatial translations (x -> x + b)\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations (x -> Rx)\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts (x -> x + vt, u -> u + v)\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (t,x,u,p -> a^2*t, a*x, a^-1*u, a^-2*p)\": 1,\n        \"Pressure shift (p -> p + c)\": 1,\n    }\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is calculated by summing the dimensions of its independent symmetry subgroups:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    total_dimension = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} dimension(s)\")\n        total_dimension += dim\n        equation_parts.append(str(dim))\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Format the final equation string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"The total dimension is the sum of these dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_dimension}\")\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
