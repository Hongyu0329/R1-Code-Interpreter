    "This problem asks for the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which a given polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This is a classic application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Understand the condition:** The condition that the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo a prime $p$ is related to the structure of its Galois group, $G$. By the Frobenius-Dedekind theorem, this condition is equivalent to the Frobenius element, Frob$_p$, acting as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 7, this means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\n2.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The core of the problem is to identify the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This specific polynomial is a known example in algebraic number theory, and its Galois group is the dihedral group of order 14, denoted as $D_7$.\n3.  **Analyze the Galois Group $D_7$:** The group $D_7$ represents the symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has 14 elements and is generated by a rotation `r` of order 7 and a reflection `s` of order 2. Its elements are:\n    *   The identity element.\n    *   6 rotations of order 7 ($r, r^2, \\ldots, r^6$). These act as 7-cycles on the vertices of the heptagon (and thus on the roots of the polynomial).\n    *   7 reflections of order 2 ($s, sr, \\ldots, sr^6$). These do not act as 7-cycles.\n4.  **Count the relevant elements:** We need to count the number of elements in $G=D_7$ that are 7-cycles. As determined in the previous step, there are 6 such elements.\n5.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** This theorem states that the natural density of primes $p$ for which Frob$_p$ lies in a certain set of conjugacy classes $C \\subseteq G$ is given by the ratio $|C|/|G|$. In our case, $C$ is the set of all 7-cycles in $G$.\n6.  **Calculate the density:** The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group.\n    *   Number of 7-cycles in $D_7$: 6\n    *   Order of the group $D_7$: 14\n    *   The density is the fraction 6/14, which simplifies to 3/7.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to formalize this calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Galois group of the polynomial is the dihedral group D_7.\n    # We need its order.\n    group_order = 14\n    \n    # For the polynomial to be irreducible mod p, the Frobenius element Frob_p\n    # must be a 7-cycle in the Galois group.
