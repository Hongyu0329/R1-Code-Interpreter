    # --- Part 1: Determination of beta ---
    # We enforce the condition that the variation of the super-cosmological constant
    # term, delta(L_cos), is zero by itself.
    # We focus on the terms in delta(L_cos) that are linear in the auxiliary field S.

    # The S-linear terms arise from two places:
    # 1. variation of 'e' in the first term: alpha * (delta_e) * S
    #    delta_e_mu^m = 1/2 * kappa * epsilon_bar * gamma^m * psi_mu
    #    This gives a term proportional to: alpha * kappa/2 * S * (fermion bilinear)
    #
    # 2. S-dependent part of delta_psi in the second term:
    #    delta_psi_mu = ... + 1/6 * gamma_mu * S * epsilon
    #    This gives a term proportional to: alpha*kappa*beta * S * (fermion bilinear)

    # coefficients must be zero for invariance.
