    This script solves the two-part question about the C code.
    
    a. Is this program correct on two given examples (Y/N)?
    b. Is it correct for every input? If no then answer the length of the shortest input 
       making it incorrect. Otherwise answer value of s when input is localization.
    
    The analysis concludes:
    a. Yes (Y), the program works for the examples due to bugs canceling each other out on
       a little-endian system.
    b. Yes, the program is correct for all inputs on a little-endian system.
       Therefore, we must calculate the value of the 's' variable.
