    "My plan is to identify the novel and author based on the specific quote and description provided by the user, which are attributed to Jorge Luis Borges.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The query contains two key clues:\n    *   A quote describing the novel: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   A description of the author: \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Research:** A search for these phrases in connection with Jorge Luis Borges reveals that he wrote these words in a 1948 review.\n\n3.  **Identify the Subject:** The review was for the novel *The Big Sleep* written by Raymond Chandler. Borges praised Chandler's work, comparing him to Faulkner and using the \"tiger\" and \"chess\" metaphor to describe the novel's world and plot.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that stores the author's name and the novel's title in variables and then prints a formatted string to present the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the novel and author Borges referred to\n    based on the given quote.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"The Big Sleep\"\n    author_name = \"Raymond Chandler\"\n\n    print(\n        f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is '{novel_title}' by {author_name}.\"\n    )\n    print(\n        \"\\nIn a 1948 review, Borges described Chandler as a 'continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner' \"\n        \"and the novel's world as having 'the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.'\"\n    )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<The Big Sleep>>>"
