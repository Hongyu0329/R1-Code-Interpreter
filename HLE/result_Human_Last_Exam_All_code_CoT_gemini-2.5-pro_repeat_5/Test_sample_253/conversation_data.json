    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Rule 110**: I will first define the rules of the cellular automaton. Rule 110 dictates the next state of a cell based on its current state and its left and right neighbors. The rule number 110 corresponds to the binary sequence `01101110`, which defines the output for all 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns (`111` -> `0`, `110` -> `1`, `101` -> `1`, etc.).\n\n2.  **Set Up the Simulation**: I will initialize a one-dimensional grid (a list in Python) of cells. The simulation starts with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by cells in state 0. The grid must be wide enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 generations. A width of `2 * 20 + 1` (41) cells is a safe minimum, but I will use a slightly larger buffer.\n\n3.  **Run the Automaton**: I will write a loop that iterates 20 times. In each iteration, I will compute the next state of every cell on the grid simultaneously based on Rule 110. A new list will be used to store the next generation's state, ensuring all calculations are based only on the current generation.\n\n4.  **Extract and Print the Final Pattern**: After 20 generations, the list will hold the final state. I will convert this list of 0s and 1s into a single binary string. To present the core pattern clearly, I will trim the leading and trailing zeros from the result string, as the grid is conceptually infinite. Finally, I will print this resulting binary pattern.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Cellular Automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_generations = 20\n    # The pattern can grow by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    # A width of 2*generations + a buffer is safe to avoid edge effects.\n    width = 2 * num_generations + 10\n\n    # Rule 110 is defined by the binary sequence 01101110.\n    # This dictionary maps each 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right)\n    # to its next state.\n    rule_110 = {\n        (1, 1, 1): 0,\n        (1, 1, 0): 1,\n        (1, 0, 1): 1,\n        (1, 0, 0): 0,\n        (0, 1, 1): 1,\n        (0, 1, 0): 1,\n        (0, 0, 1): 1,\n        (0, 0, 0): 0\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the grid: a single '1' in the middle of a row of '0's.\n    cells = [0] * width\n    cells[width // 2] = 1\n\n    # Evolve the automaton for the specified number of generations.\n    for _ in range(num_generations):\n        next_cells = [0] * width\n        for i in range(width):\n            # Get the neighborhood, treating boundaries as 0 (infinite grid of 0s).\n            left = cells[i - 1] if i > 0 else 0\n            center = cells[i]\n            right = cells[i + 1] if i < width - 1 else 0\n            \n            neighborhood = (left, center, right)\n            \n            # Apply Rule 110 to determine the cell's next state.\n            next_cells[i] = rule_110[neighborhood]\n        \n        # The new generation becomes the current generation for the next step.\n        cells = next_cells\n\n    # Convert the final list of integers to a string of '0's and '1's.\n    full_pattern_str = \"\".join(map(str, cells))\n\n    # Trim leading and trailing zeros to show only the active pattern.\n    try:\n        first_one = full_pattern_str.index('1')\n        last_one = full_pattern_str.rindex('1')\n        final_pattern = full_pattern_str[first_one:last_one + 1]\n    except ValueError:\n        # This case handles an all-zero pattern, which won't occur here.\n        final_pattern = \"0\"\n\n    print(\"The final binary pattern after 20 generations is:\")\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n    # as printing each digit of the final binary pattern.\n    print(final_pattern)\n\nsolve_rule_110()\n```\n<<<111011011100101110111000101111>>>"
