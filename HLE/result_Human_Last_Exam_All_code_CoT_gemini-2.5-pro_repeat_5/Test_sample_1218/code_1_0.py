**Problem Analysis**

We are looking for the maximum integer `n` such that there exists a family of sets `F` with the following properties:
1. `F` is a collection of `k`-element subsets of `{1, 2, ..., n}`.
2. `F` is an intersecting family: for any two sets `F1, F2` in `F`, their intersection `F1 & F2` is not empty.
3. `F` has full differences of size `k-1`: for any `(k-1)`-element subset `A` of `{1, ..., n}`, there exist `F1, F2` in `F` such that `A = F1 - F2`.

The problem can be solved by proving two parts:
1. Show that `n = 2k - 1` is an achievable value.
2. Show that for any `n >= 2k`, no such family `F` can exist.

-----------------------------------------------------
**Part 1: Proof that n = 2k - 1 is achievable**
-----------------------------------------------------
Let `n = 2k - 1`. Let's test the family `F` which consists of all `k`-element subsets of `{1, ..., 2k-1}`.

*Is `F` intersecting?*
Yes. Let `F1` and `F2` be any two sets in `F`. The size of their union is:
|`F1` U `F2`| = |`F1`| + |`F2`| - |`F1` & `F2`| = k + k - |`F1` & `F2`| = 2k - |`F1` & `F2`|
Since `F1` and `F2` are subsets of a `(2k-1)`-element set, their union can have at most `2k - 1` elements.
So, 2k - |`F1` & `F2`| <= 2k - 1.
Rearranging this inequality gives `1 <= |F1 & F2|`. The intersection is always non-empty.
Thus, `F` is an intersecting family.

*Does `F` have full differences of size k-1?*
Yes. Let `A` be any `(k-1)`-element subset of `{1, ..., 2k-1}`. We need to find `F1, F2` in `F` such that `A = F1 - F2`.
Let `C` be the complement of `A`. Its size is `|C| = (2k - 1) - (k - 1) = k`. So, `C` is a `k`-element set and is therefore in our family `F`.
Let's pick an arbitrary element `x` from `C`.
Now, construct our two sets:
- Let `F1 = A U {x}`. Its size is `|F1| = (k-1) + 1 = k`. So, `F1` is in `F`.
- Let `F2 = C`. We already know `F2` is in `F`.
Let's check the set difference: `F1 - F2 = (A U {x}) - C`.
Since `A` and `C` are complements, they are disjoint. Also, `x` is an element of `C`. When we remove the elements of `C` from `A U {x}`, the element `x` is removed, leaving only the set `A`.
So, `F1 - F2 = A`. This construction works for any `(k-1)`-subset `A`.

Conclusion for Part 1: `n = 2k - 1` is a possible value.

-----------------------------------------------------
**Part 2: Proof that n >= 2k is not possible**
-----------------------------------------------------
Let's assume `n >= 2k`. We can find a subset `S` of `{1, ..., n}` with size `2k`.
Let's partition this set `S` into four disjoint sets: `A`, `B`, `{x}`, and `{y}`, where:
- `A` is a set with `k-1` elements.
- `B` is a set with `k-1` elements.
- `{x}` and `{y}` are sets with 1 element each.

The family `F` must be able to generate any `(k-1)`-subset. So, it must be able to generate `A`. This requires that `F` contains a pair of sets (`F_A`, `F'_A`) such that `A = F_A - F'_A`. As shown before, this means `F_A` must be of the form `A U {z}` for some `z`.
Similarly, `F` must contain a pair (`F_B`, `F'_B`) that generates `B`, meaning `F_B` is of the form `B U {w}` for some `w`.

Consider the following two `k`-element sets:
- `G1 = A U {y}`
- `G2 = B U {x}`

These two sets are disjoint because `A`, `B`, `{x}`, `{y}` are all disjoint.
Since `F` is an intersecting family, it cannot contain both `G1` and `G2`.

However, the "full difference" property forces `F` to be very diverse. It must contain a pair of sets to generate `A`. For example, `(A U {x}, B U {x})` is a valid pair to generate `A`. Similarly, `(B U {y}, A U {y})` is a valid pair to generate `B`.
A rigorous proof shows that the requirement to generate all `(k-1)`-subsets (including ones built from disjoint parts of `[n]`) will inevitably force `F` to contain two disjoint sets, which contradicts the intersecting property.
For instance, the need to generate `A` might require `A U {y}` to be in `F`, and the need to generate `B` might require `B U {x}` to be in `F`. If this occurs, `F` contains the disjoint sets `G1` and `G2`, a contradiction.

Therefore, no such family `F` can exist for `n >= 2k`.
