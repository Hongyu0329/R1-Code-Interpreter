    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is a Python script that walks through the reasoning to answer your question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the key physical requirement for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), which is related to a material's optical properties.\n2.  Next, I will discuss the relevant property of a material's crystal structure that determines this optical characteristic.\n3.  Then, I will apply this knowledge to the specific case of free-standing boron nanosheets.\n4.  Finally, I will use a simple equation to formalize the conclusion and print a summary.\n\nThis script will execute this plan to provide a clear answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit SPDC\n    by checking the physical requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in Boron Nanosheets...\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the primary requirement for SPDC.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Requirement for Second-Order Nonlinearity\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must have a significant, non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ^(2) (chi-2).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 2: Connect the optical requirement to crystal symmetry.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Role of Crystal Symmetry\")\n    print(\"A fundamental principle in optics is that a material can only possess a non-zero χ^(2) if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion.\")\n    print(\"Materials with a center of inversion are called 'centrosymmetric', and they have a χ^(2) of zero in the electric-dipole approximation.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 3: Assess the symmetry of boron nanosheets.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\")\n    print(\"Common, stable phases of ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are known to be centrosymmetric.\")\n    print(\"This means they possess a center of inversion.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 4: Draw the conclusion using the governing equation.\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Conclusion and Governing Equation\")\n    print(\"The second-order nonlinear polarization P^(2), which drives effects like SPDC, is given by:\")\n    print(\"\\n\\tP^(2) = ε₀ * χ^(2) * E²\\n\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"\\t- P^(2) is the second-order polarization.\")\n    print(\"\\t- ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\")\n    print(\"\\t- E is the electric field of the incident light.\")\n    print(\"\\t- χ^(2) is the second-order susceptibility.\")\n    \n    # Define the value for the material in question.\n    chi_2_value_for_borophene = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor ideal boron nanosheets, since the material is centrosymmetric:\")\n    print(f\"\\tThe value of χ^(2) is {chi_2_value_for_borophene}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlugging this into the equation:\")\n    final_polarization = 0\n    print(f\"\\tP^(2) = ε₀ * {chi_2_value_for_borophene} * E² = {final_polarization}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBecause the second-order polarization P^(2) is zero, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n\n    print(\"\\nNOTE: This conclusion can change if the material's symmetry is broken by external factors like applied strain, structural defects, or strong electric fields.\")\n\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n```\n<<<No, ideal free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric, which results in a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
