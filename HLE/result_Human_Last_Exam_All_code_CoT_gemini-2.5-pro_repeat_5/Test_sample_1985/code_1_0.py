    # For index k, N_k is e^(-2^k). We'll handle this symbolically.
    
    # Step 3: Solve for x_k(1) using the boundary conditions.
    # The boundary conditions are:
    # 1) M_k * x_k(0) - N_k * x_k(1) = alpha_k

    # 0.5 - 1 = N_k * x_k(1)
    # -0.5 = N_k * x_k(1)

    # Substitute N_k = e^(-2^k):
    # x_k(1) = -0.5 / e^(-2^k) = -0.5 * e^(2^k)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the squared L2 norm ||x(1)||^2.
    # Since x_n(1) = 0 for n != k, the norm is just the square of x_k(1).
    # ||x(1)||^2 = (x_k(1))^2 = (-0.5 * e^(2^k))^2
    #            = 0.25 * (e^(2^k))^2
    #            = 0.25 * e^(2 * 2^k)
