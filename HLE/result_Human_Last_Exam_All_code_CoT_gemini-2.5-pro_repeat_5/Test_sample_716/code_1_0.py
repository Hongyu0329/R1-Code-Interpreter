# The given curve is parameterized by the vector function:
# r(t) = (sin(pi*t), sin(t), cos(2*t))

# To find the Hausdorff dimension, we check the smoothness of the curve.
# We compute the derivative of the vector function:
# r'(t) = (pi*cos(pi*t), cos(t), -2*sin(2*t))

# The components of r'(t) are all continuous functions, which means the curve
# is continuously differentiable (a C^1 curve).
# Such a curve is a 1-dimensional manifold.

# A key theorem in fractal geometry states that the Hausdorff dimension
# of a k-dimensional manifold is k.

# Since our curve is a 1-dimensional manifold, its Hausdorff dimension is 1.
# The final "equation" is: Hausdorff Dimension = 1.
# We will print the number from this equation as requested.

hausdorff_dimension = 1
