    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Representations and Partitions:** The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider all partitions of the integer 25. A partition of 25 is a way of writing 25 as a sum of positive integers, like `[25]`, `[24, 1]`, `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, etc.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of an irrep associated with a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula. This formula states that the dimension $d_\\lambda$ is $n!$ divided by the product of the hook-lengths of all cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Computational Strategy:** My Python script will perform the following actions:\n    *   It will systematically generate every unique partition of the number 25.\n    *   For each partition, it will calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula. Python's ability to handle arbitrarily large integers is crucial here, as $25!$ is a very large number.\n    *   It will check if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    *   It will keep a count of how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will then print the total count of these irreps. To adhere to the specific instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", the code will also display the summation that leads to the final count (i.e., `Count = 1 + 1 + ... + 1`).\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_s25_irreps_below_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric\n    group S_25 with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    dim_limit = 500000\n    \n    # Pre-calculate n! for efficiency.
