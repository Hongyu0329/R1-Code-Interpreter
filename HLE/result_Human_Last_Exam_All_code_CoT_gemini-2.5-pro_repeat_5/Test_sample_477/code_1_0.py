    Explains the role of LIG1 in CTG repeat instability in Myotonic Dystrophy.

    print("1. Myotonic Dystrophy (DM) is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat sequence.")
    print("2. This repeat is unstable in somatic cells and tends to expand further over an individual's lifetime, a phenomenon called somatic instability.")
    print("3. This expansion is believed to occur via pathways involved in DNA replication and repair.")
    print("4. LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is a key enzyme that seals breaks in DNA, particularly during the joining of Okazaki fragments in DNA replication.")
    print("5. The expansion pathway requires the action of several enzymes, including LIG1, to incorporate the extra repeats and finalize the process.")
    print("6. Therefore, when LIG1 is absent (knocked out), a critical step in the expansion pathway is blocked.")
    print("7. This disruption of the expansion mechanism leads to a significant decrease in the rate of CTG repeat expansion.")
    print("\nConclusion: Knocking out LIG1 results in reduced somatic instability.")
    print("\nAnswer choice C is the correct conclusion.")
