# The user wants me to analyze three explanations for fear acquisition.
# Explanation 1: Folk Psychology - "I became afraid."
# Explanation 2: Behavioral Psychology - Classical conditioning, learned association.
# Explanation 3: Neuroscience - Changes in neural connectivity in the PAG.
# These are not competing explanations but are explanations at different levels of analysis (Marr's levels).
# 1. Phenomenological/Folk level
# 2. Algorithmic/Psychological Process level
# 3. Implementational/Neural level
# They are consistent and complementary. The neural changes (3) are the physical basis for the psychological process (2), which is the scientific explanation for the subjective experience (1).
# Therefore, they are different hypotheses (tested with different methods), but they are not independent. If one is true, they must all be true because they describe the same event.
# This corresponds to option D.

# Final Answer Selection
final_answer = 'D'
