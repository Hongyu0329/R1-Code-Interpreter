    # Step 1: Define "transient set" and state the key theorem.

    print("A set A is called 'transient' if a random walk, starting at the origin, visits A only a finite number of times almost surely.")

    print("THEOREM: A set A is transient if and only if the probability of hitting A tends to 0 as the starting point x moves to infinity.")
    print("Mathematically: A is transient <=> lim_{|x|->infinity} P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 0\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the given property of set A.
    print("Step 2: Analyze the property of set A given in the problem.")
    print("The problem states that there is an infinite set of points, let's call it X, such that for any point x in X, the walk is certain to hit A.")
    print("PROPERTY: For all x in X (where X is an infinite set), P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1.\n")

    # Step 3: Connect the property to the theorem.
    print("Step 3: Connect the property to the limit in the theorem.")
    print("Because X is an infinite subset of Z^d, it must be unbounded. This means we can find a sequence of points {x_1, x_2, x_3, ...} in X whose distance from the origin increases to infinity.")
    print("That is, there exists a sequence {x_n} in X such that |x_n| -> infinity as n -> infinity.\n")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the limit for this sequence.
    print("Step 4: Evaluate the limit of the hitting probability along this sequence.")
    print("For every point x_n in our sequence, the hitting probability is 1, according to the given property.")
    print("So, P_{x_n}(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for all n.")
    print("The limit of this sequence of probabilities is therefore:")
    print("lim_{n->infinity} P_{x_n}(tau_A < infinity) = lim_{n->infinity} 1 = 1.\n")

    # Step 5: Identify the contradiction.
    print("Step 5: Identify the contradiction.")
    print("The theorem in Step 1 requires the limit of the hitting probability to be 0 for ANY path to infinity for the set A to be transient.")
