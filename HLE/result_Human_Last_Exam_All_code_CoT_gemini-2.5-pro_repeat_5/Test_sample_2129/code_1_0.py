    # N is the number of integers n for which y1(x) and y2(x) intersect at most once.

    # h(0) = y2(0) - y1(0) = 0 - 1 = -1.
    # As x -> inf, y1(x) = exp(x/2) grows faster than the cubic y2(x), so h(x) -> -inf.
    # h'(0) = y2'(0) - y1'(0) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 > 0.
    # Since h(0) is negative and h(x) initially increases, there must be at least one root.
    # For there to be "at most once" root, there must be exactly one root.
    # This happens if the curves are tangent, i.e., h(x)=0 and h'(x)=0 for some x.
    # This means y1(x) = y2(x) and y1'(x) = y2'(x).
    # Since y1'(x) = y1(x)/2, the condition becomes y2'(x) = y2(x)/2.
    # As shown in the thought process, this leads to a system of equations for x and n.
    # Our analysis showed that integer candidates for n (like -60, -120) arise from the condition y2(x)=2y2'(x),
    # but these pairs (x, n) do not satisfy the original y1(x)=y2(x) condition.
    # For example, for n=-60, x=2, y2(2)=4/3 but y1(2)=e. Not equal.
    # For n=-120, x=3, y2(3)=3/2 but y1(3)=e^(3/2). Not equal.
    # This exhaustive analysis suggests there are no integer values of n for which tangency occurs.
