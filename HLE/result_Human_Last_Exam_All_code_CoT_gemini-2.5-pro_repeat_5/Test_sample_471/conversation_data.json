    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal number of critical points a smooth function $f$ on the 2-torus ($T^2$) can have. This is a classic question in differential topology.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the right mathematical tool.** While Morse theory, which relates critical points to the Betti numbers of a manifold, is a powerful tool, it strictly applies to \"Morse functions\" where all critical points are non-degenerate. The question asks about any \"smooth function,\" which may include degenerate critical points. The correct tool for this more general case is the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category.\n2.  **State the main theorem.** A fundamental theorem states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$.\n3.  **Find the LS category of the 2-torus.** There is a known formula for the LS category of an n-dimensional torus, $T^n$. The formula is $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$.\n4.  **Calculate the lower bound.** By applying the formula for the 2-torus (where $n=2$), we can find the minimum number of critical points required.\n5.  **Confirm the bound is achievable.** The value calculated is a lower bound. To confirm it's the minimum, one must show that a function exists that achieves this bound. Indeed, functions with this minimal number of critical points have been constructed. For instance, $f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$ on a flat torus has exactly 3 critical points.\n6.  **Write the code.** The Python code will perform the simple calculation from step 4 and print the result along with the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem is to find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R.\n    # The 2-torus T^2 is a 2-dimensional manifold.\n    n = 2\n\n    # A theorem from topology, based on the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category,\n    # provides a lower bound on the number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact manifold.\n    # Let M be a compact manifold.
