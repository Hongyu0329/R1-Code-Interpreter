    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the value of a(4).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the problem:** The value `a(n)` represents the maximal number of prime implicants that a Boolean function with `n` variables can have. We need to find this value for `n=4`.\n2.  **Find the formula:** This is a known problem in Boolean logic. The formula for `a(n)` was established by I. G. Rosenberg and is given by the sum:\n    `a(n) = Î£ (from k=0 to n) [ C(n, k) * C(k, floor(k/2)) ]`\n    where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n3.  **Apply the formula for n=4:** We will calculate `a(4)` by summing the terms for `k` from 0 to 4:\n    `a(4) = C(4,0)C(0,0) + C(4,1)C(1,0) + C(4,2)C(2,1) + C(4,3)C(3,1) + C(4,4)C(4,2)`\n4.  **Write the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates each of these five terms, sums them up, and prints the result in the requested format, showing the full equation with all its components.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_a4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n    The formula for a(n) is:\n    a(n) = sum_{k=0 to n} C(n, k) * C(k, floor(k/2))\n    where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n    We will compute this for n = 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Loop from k=0 to n to calculate each term in the summation\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate C(n, k)\n        c_n_k = math.comb(n, k)\n        \n        # Calculate C(k, floor(k/2))\n        floor_k_div_2 = k // 2\n        c_k_floor = math.comb(k, floor_k_div_2)\n        \n        # The term is the product of the two binomial coefficients\n        term = c_n_k * c_k_floor\n        terms.append(term)\n        total_sum += term\n\n    # Construct the final equation string as requested\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, terms))\n    final_output = f\"{equation_str} = {total_sum}\"\n\n    print(\"To find a(4), we calculate the sum of C(4,k) * C(k, floor(k/2)) for k from 0 to 4.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is the sum of these terms:\")\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve_a4()\n```\n<<<35>>>"
