The conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point to exist and be unique are that (A) the domains X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces, and (B) the functions F, G, H are contraction mappings, which translates to a set of inequalities on their Lipschitz constants: (alpha1 + beta2 + gamma3 < 1), (alpha2 + beta1 + beta3 + gamma2 < 1), and (alpha3 + gamma1 < 1).
