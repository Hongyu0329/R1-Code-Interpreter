    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem you've described falls into the domain of fixed-point theory, specifically for coupled or tripled systems. To find the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point, we can use the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem on a product space.\n\nHere is my plan to derive the conditions:\n1.  First, I will clearly define what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" means based on the function signatures you provided. I will assume the second function `G` in your prompt is a separate function, which I will call `H`, for clarity.\n2.  Next, I will introduce the mathematical framework. We will assume that `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces. This allows us to use powerful tools from analysis.\n3.  I will then define a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. A fixed point of this operator `T` will correspond exactly to the FGH-tripled fixed point you are looking for.\n4.  The core of the solution is to find conditions that make `T` a \"contraction mapping.\" According to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, if `T` is a contraction, it is guaranteed to have a unique fixed point.\n5.  These conditions on `T` will translate back to specific requirements on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`, usually in the form of Lipschitz continuity conditions.\n6.  Finally, I will present these conditions in a Python script that prints them out symbolically, including the numerical indices of the variables as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and prints the conditions for the existence and\n    uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the FGH-tripled fixed point\n    print(\"An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet (x, y, z), where x is in X, y is in Y, and z is in Z,\")\n    print(\"that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"1.
