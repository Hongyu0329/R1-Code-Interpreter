    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** First, I will examine the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Look for a pattern:** I will test for common patterns, such as arithmetic progression, geometric progression, or a combination of multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n3.  **Identify the rule:** I will try to establish a consistent rule that applies to all known terms in the sequence. A possible pattern is `x_next = 3 * x_current - y`. I will calculate the value of `y` for each step.\n    *   For 23: `3 * 11 - y = 23` -> `33 - y = 23` -> `y = 10`.\n    *   For 51: `3 * 23 - y = 51` -> `69 - y = 51` -> `y = 18`.\n    *   For 119: `3 * 51 - y = 119` -> `153 - y = 119` -> `y = 34`.\n4.  **Analyze the secondary pattern:** The sequence of subtracted numbers `y` is {10, 18, 34}. I will find the pattern in this new sequence.\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is 8.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is 16.\n    *   The difference is doubling each time (8, 16). The next difference will be 32.\n5.  **Calculate the next term:** Using the discovered patterns, I will calculate the next term in the `y` sequence and then the next term in the main sequence.\n    *   The next `y` term is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n    *   The next term in the main sequence is `3 * 119 - 66`.\n6.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by finding the underlying pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # Step 1: Find the secondary sequence 'b' based on the pattern x_n+1 = 3*x_n - b_n\n    b = []\n    for i in range(1, len(seq) - 1):\n        b_i = 3 * seq[i] - seq[i+1]\n        b.append(b_i)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in the secondary sequence 'b'\n    # The differences in sequence 'b' are 18-10=8, 34-18=16.\n    # The difference doubles each time.
