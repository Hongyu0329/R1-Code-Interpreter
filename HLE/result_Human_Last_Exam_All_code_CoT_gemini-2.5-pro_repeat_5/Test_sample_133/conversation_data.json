    "An optimal move in Connect 4 is one that leads to a win in the minimum number of turns. We must first check if there's a move for player 'O' that wins immediately. If not, we look for a move that sets up a guaranteed win on the next turn.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Represent the Board**: The current game state will be stored in a 6x7 2D list (a grid).\n2.  **Check for Immediate Win**: We will iterate through all valid moves for 'O' (any column that is not full). For each move, we'll place an 'O' piece and check if this creates a line of four 'O's (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n3.  **Analyze the board for immediate wins**:\n    *   A systematic check of all possible moves (`a4`, `b4`, `c4`, `d3`, `e3`, `f4`, `g4`) reveals that none of them result in an immediate four-in-a-row for 'O'.\n4.  **Check for Guaranteed Win on Next Turn**: Since there is no immediate win, the fastest way to win is to force a win on the next turn. This is typically done by creating two threats simultaneously that the opponent ('X') cannot block with a single move. An \"open-ended three-in-a-row\" (like `_OOO_`) is a perfect example of such a dual threat.\n5.  **Identify Winning Moves**:\n    *   **Move `c4`**: Placing an 'O' in column 'c' (at position `c4`) creates a horizontal line of three `O`'s (`c4`, `d4`, `e4`). This creates an open-ended row `b4-c4-d4-e4-f4`. 'O' now threatens to win by placing a piece at `b4` or `f4`. Player 'X' can only block one of these spots on their turn. 'O' will then place a piece in the unblocked spot on the following turn and win.\n    *   **Move `f4`**: Similarly, placing an 'O' in column 'f' (at position `f4`) creates a horizontal line of three `O`'s (`d4`, `e4`, `f4`). This creates the open-ended row `c4-d4-e4-f4-g4`. 'O' threatens to win at `c4` or `g4`. Again, 'X' can only block one, guaranteeing a win for 'O' on the next turn.\n6.  **Conclusion**: No other moves create such an unstoppable threat. Therefore, the optimal moves for 'O' to win as fast as possible are `c4` and `f4`.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically verify this logic by checking all possible moves and identifying those that create a guaranteed win.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\nclass Connect4Solver:\n    def __init__(self, initial_board):\n        self.initial_board = initial_board\n        self.rows = 6\n        self.cols = 7\n        self.player = 'O'\n        self.opponent = 'X'\n\n    def get_valid_moves(self, board):\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of column indices that are not full.\"\"\"\n        return [c for c in range(self.cols) if board[0][c] == '.']\n\n    def get_next_open_row(self, board, col):\n        \"\"\"Returns the row index where a piece would land in the given column.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(self.rows -
