def solve():
    """
    This function contains the solution to the algebraic problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The initial condition is Psi(k;l;m) = Phi(k) + Phi(l) + Phi(m) - Phi(klm) = 0.
    2. Using the given rule Phi(ab) = Phi(a) + a.Phi(b), the condition becomes Phi(l) + Phi(m) = k.Phi(l) + (kl).Phi(m).
    3. Through algebraic manipulation and exploiting the symmetry of the condition in k, l, m, a key consequence can be derived: x.Phi(y) = 0 for any x, y in the set {k, l, m}.
    4. Additionally, some properties are universally true, derived from the definitions of the monoid M and the function Phi. These are:
       - Idempotency: m*m = m for all m in M.
       - A key property of Phi: m.Phi(m) = 0 for all m in M.
    5. Each of the 12 given identities is then tested against the derived consequence and the universal properties.
       - Identities that are true only as a result of the Psi(k;l;m)=0 condition are considered to follow necessarily.
       - Identities that are universally true also follow necessarily from any assumption.
    6. The analysis shows that identities 1, 5, and 9 are not necessarily true, as they would imply Phi(k)=0, for which a counterexample can be constructed.
    7. All other identities (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12) are found to be necessarily true, either as a direct result of the key consequence or because they are universally true identities within the given algebraic structure.
