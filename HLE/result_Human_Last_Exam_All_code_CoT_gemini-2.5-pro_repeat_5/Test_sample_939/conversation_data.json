    "Here is a plan to determine which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Space Conversion**: ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a wider gamut (range of colors) than sRGB. To check if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must convert it to the sRGB color space. If the resulting sRGB values fall outside the valid range, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented.\n\n2.  **Linearization**: The given ROMM RGB values are gamma-corrected. The first step in any color space conversion is to convert these non-linear values to linear values. For ROMM RGB, this is done by raising the component values (which are between 0 and 1) to the power of its gamma, which is 1.8.\n    *   `linear_value = original_value ^ 1.8`\n\n3.  **Matrix Transformation**: Next, we convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This is a linear algebra operation involving a 3x3 conversion matrix. This matrix accounts for the change in primary colors and the change in white point from D50 (for ROMM) to D65 (for sRGB). We will use the standard, academically-accepted matrices for this transformation.\n\n4.  **Check Gamut**: After the matrix multiplication, we get the color's coordinates in the linear sRGB space. A color is representable (in gamut) if and only if all three of its linear sRGB components (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of gamut.\n\n5.  **Execution**: We will apply these steps to each of the five given colors using a Python script. The script will print the conversion result for each color and then list the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Standard matrix to convert linear ProPhoto RGB (D50) to CIE XYZ (D50).\n    M_ROMM_TO_XYZ = np.array([\n        [0.7976749, 0.1351917, 0.0313534],\n        [0.2880402, 0.7118741, 0.0000857],\n        [0.0,       0.0,       0.8252100]\n    ])\n\n    # Standard Bradford chromatic adaptation matrix to convert from D50 illuminant to D65.\n    M_CAT_D50_TO_D65 = np.array([\n        [0.9555766, -0.0230393, 0.0631636],\n        [-0.0282895, 1.0099416, 0.0210077],\n        [0.0122982, -0.0204830, 1.3299098]\n    ])\n\n    # Standard matrix to convert CIE XYZ (D65) to linear sRGB.\n    M_XYZ_TO_sRGB = np.array([\n        [ 3.24096994, -1.53738335, -0.49861076],\n        [-0.96924363,  1.8759675,   0.04155506],\n        [ 0.05563001, -0.20397696,  1.05697151]\n    ])\n\n    # Combine matrices for a single-step conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB.\n    M_conversion = M_XYZ_TO_sRGB @ M_CAT_D50_TO_D65 @ M_ROMM_TO_XYZ\n\n    colors = [\n        np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    ]\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n    \n    # Define the gamma for ROMM RGB\n    gamma = 1.8\n\n    for i, color in enumerate(colors):\n        color_num = i + 1\n        print(f\"Checking color {color_num}: RGB({color[0]}, {color[1]}, {color[2]})\")\n\n        # 1.
