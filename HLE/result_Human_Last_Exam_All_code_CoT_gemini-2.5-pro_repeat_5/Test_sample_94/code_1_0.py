def find_physicist():
    """
    This function identifies the physicist based on the provided historical clues.
    
    The clues are:
    1. Known for work in microscopy.
    2. Discovered an optical effect in real imagery.
    3. The effect was accidentally observed by a custodial worker.
    4. The observation involved cleaning concave mirrors.
    
    These details point to the story of Paul Kirkpatrick at Stanford University in the 1940s.
    While working on an X-ray microscope, a janitor reportedly noticed that a distorted reflection
    from a cylindrical mirror became sharp at a very shallow (grazing) angle. This principle of
    grazing incidence was key to the design of the Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray microscope.
