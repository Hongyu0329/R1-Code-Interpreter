    "My plan is to identify the physicist based on the historical details provided in the query. The key clues are the physicist's work in microscopy, the discovery of an optical effect, and the specific anecdote about a custodial worker observing the effect while cleaning concave mirrors. This story is famously associated with the development of a type of X-ray microscope. I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this physicist.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on the provided historical clues.\n    \n    The clues are:\n    1. Known for work in microscopy.\n    2. Discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\n    3. The effect was accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\n    4. The observation involved cleaning concave mirrors.\n    \n    These details point to the story of Paul Kirkpatrick at Stanford University in the 1940s.\n    While working on an X-ray microscope, a janitor reportedly noticed that a distorted reflection\n    from a cylindrical mirror became sharp at a very shallow (grazing) angle. This principle of\n    grazing incidence was key to the design of the Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray microscope.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
