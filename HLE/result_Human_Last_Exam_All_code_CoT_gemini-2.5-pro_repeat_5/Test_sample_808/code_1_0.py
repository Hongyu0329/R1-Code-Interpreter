    This script identifies which Platonic solid graphs become non-planar after a specific modification.

    The modification involves turning a face (a cycle C_s) into a complete graph (K_s).
    A graph is non-planar if it contains a K_n subgraph where n >= 5.
    Thus, if a graph has face degree s >= 5, it will become non-planar.
