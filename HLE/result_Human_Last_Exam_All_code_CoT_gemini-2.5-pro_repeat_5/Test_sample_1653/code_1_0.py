    This function calculates the asymptotic behavior of h_k.
    The problem is theoretical, and its solution relies on concepts from potential theory
    for 2D random walks rather than a direct numerical simulation.

    Method Explanation:
    1.  Let h_k = P[tau(B_k) > t | tau(C_k) > t]. We are interested in the limit of ln(h_k)/ln(k) as k -> infinity.
    2.  The conditioning on avoiding the set C_k for a very long time means the random walk is effectively repelled from C_k. This can be described by a potential field V_C(x) that is large near C_k and decays with distance.
    3.  For a 2D random walk, this potential is logarithmic. The potential kernel between two points x and y is a(x,y) ~ (1/pi) * ln|x-y|.
    4.  The set C_k consists of two points, c1 = (0,0) and c2 = (0, k^3). The potential created by the conditioning event at a point x can be modeled as a superposition of the potentials from these two points: V_C(x) ~ a(x,c1) + a(x,c2).
    5.  The logarithm of the probability of avoiding another distant set B_k, given this conditioning, is proportional to the interaction energy. This energy is related to the potential V_C evaluated at the location of B_k.
    6.  The set B_k is located around y=k^2. The distance from B_k to c1 is ~k^2, and to c2 is ~k^3.
    7.  The potential at B_k is dominated by the sum of the logarithms of these distances:
        V_C(B_k) ~ (1/pi) * ln(k^2) + (1/pi) * ln(k^3) = (2/pi) * ln(k) + (3/pi) * ln(k) = (5/pi) * ln(k).
    8.  Therefore, ln(h_k) is expected to be proportional to -ln(k). This implies that the limit ln(h_k)/ln(k) is a constant.
    9.  The precise value of this constant exponent is a subtle matter. In the theory of random walks and potential theory, such exponents are often simple numbers related to the charges (cardinalities) of the sets or the dimension of the space.
    10. A plausible conjecture is that the exponent is equal to the negative of the number of points in the conditioning set C_k. Since C_k contains two points, this leads to an exponent of -2.
