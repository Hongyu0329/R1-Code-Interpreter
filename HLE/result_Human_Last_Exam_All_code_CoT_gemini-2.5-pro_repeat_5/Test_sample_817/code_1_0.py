A 2022 paper (van der Wegen et al.) showed that HR4 is required for the function of the RPW8.2 gene, which confers broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildews.

While it is required for the function of the EHM-localized RPW8.2 protein, HR4 itself has not been shown to localize to the Extrahaustorial membrane (EHM).

(2010) paper demonstrated that HR4 is required for the proper accumulation of the PAD4 protein during an immune response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm), which is a form of regulation.

The seminal paper identifying HR4's role in immunity (Kim et al., 2010) discovered it through a screen for interactors of PAD4 (Phytoalexin Deficient 4), a central hub in plant defense.
