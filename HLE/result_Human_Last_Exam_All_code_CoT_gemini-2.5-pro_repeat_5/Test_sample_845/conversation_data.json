    "The value you are referring to is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This is the fundamental measurement used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). While HRV is a measure of the *variation* in these intervals, the interval itself is most commonly called the \"R-R interval,\" named after the R-wave, which is the most prominent peak in an Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Even when using PPG, this term is widely adopted.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print the name of this value.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_interval_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the fundamental value used to compute HRV.\n  HRV is calculated from the variations in the time between successive heartbeats.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The term for the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n  # This term originates from ECG readings (R-peak to R-peak) but is\n  # the standard term used for beat-to-beat intervals from any source, including PPG.\n  interval_name = \"R-R interval\"\n  \n  print(f\"The value representing the time between heartbeats, used to compute HRV, is called the: {interval_name}\")\n\nget_hrv_interval_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
