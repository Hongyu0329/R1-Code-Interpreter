# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for a Tate-style program-expression graph for the variable 'a'. This can be represented as a single, functional expression.
# 2. The code snippet is a loop where the variables `a` and `i` are updated in each iteration.
# 3. We model the state of the loop using a state vector `(a, i)`.
# 4. We use the `μ` (mu) operator for the loop, `λ` (lambda) for the update function, and `π₁` (pi-one) for projection.
# 5. The problem specifies using `a` and `b` as bound variables for the state vector.
# 6. The initial state is `(a=1, i=1)`.
# 7. The state update rule is `a_new = a_old * i_old` and `i_new = i_old + 1`, which translates to the expression `(a * b, b + 1)` in the lambda body.
# 8. Combining these elements yields the final expression for the value of `a`.
# 9. The python script will print this final expression as a string, ensuring all numbers from the equation are included in the output.

# Using Unicode characters for the special symbols pi, mu, lambda, and subscript one
pi_1 = "\u03c0\u2081"
mu = "\u03bc"
lambda_char = "\u03bb"

# The update expression for the state vector (a, i) using bound variables (a, b)
# The update is (a' = a * i, i' = i + 1), which corresponds to (a * b, b + 1).
# The numbers in the equation are 1 (from b+1).
update_expression = "(a * b, b + 1)"

# The initial state vector (a, i) is (1, 1).
# The numbers in the equation are 1, 1.
initial_state = "(1, 1)"

# The lambda expression defines the state update function.
lambda_func = f"{lambda_char}(a, b). {update_expression}"

# The mu expression represents the loop's transformation.
mu_expression = f"{mu}({lambda_func})"

# The final expression applies the loop transformation to the initial state
# and projects the first component (the final value of 'a').
final_tate_expression = f"{pi_1}( ({mu_expression}) {initial_state} )"

# Print the final expression. This string contains each number from the equation.
print(final_tate_expression)
