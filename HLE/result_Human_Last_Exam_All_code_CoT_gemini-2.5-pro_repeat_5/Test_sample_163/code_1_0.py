    # Key Principles of Surveillance:
    # 1. Modality: Use the most sensitive non-invasive test. Duplex ultrasound is superior to
    #    Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) for detecting in-stent restenosis.
    # 2. Timing: Focus surveillance during the period of highest risk, which is the
    #    first 12-24 months post-procedure.
