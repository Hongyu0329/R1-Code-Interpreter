    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as time $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we denote as $P_i$. This implies that their time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero.\n\nThe given system of differential equations then transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (This is the normalization condition)\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  From the first four equations, we can express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n    *   From (1): $\\lambda_{01}P_{0} = \\lambda_{10}P_{1} \\implies P_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} P_1$\n    *   From (3): $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} \\implies P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} P_1$\n    *   From (4): $\\lambda_{31}P_{3} = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} \\implies P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} P_2$. Substituting the expression for $P_2$, we get $P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) P_1$.\n\n2.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation (5) to solve for $P_1$.\n    *   $P_1 \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 1 + \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} + \\frac{\\lambda_{23}\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{31}(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})} \\right) = 1$\n\n3.  Once we find $P_1$, we can calculate $P_0$ using the relationship from step 1.\n\n4.  Finally, we can compute the desired sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the numerical values and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# We can solve this system using two methods.\n# Method 1: Algebraic substitution (as planned above)\n\n# Express P0, P2, P3 in terms of P1\n# P0 = c0 * P1\n# P2 = c2 * P1\n# P3 = c3 * P1\nc0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\nc2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\nc3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * c2\n\n# The normalization equation is P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n# (c0*P1) + P1 + (c2*P1) + (c3*P1) = 1\n# P1 * (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3) = 1\ntotal_coeff = c0 + 1 + c2 + c3\nP1 = 1 / total_coeff\n\n# Calculate P0\nP0 = c0 * P1\n\n# Calculate the final sum\nresult = P0 + P1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"The steady-state probabilities are P0(+inf) = {P0:.6f} and P1(+inf) = {P1:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"The required sum is P0(+inf) + P1(+inf):\")\nprint(f\"{P0:.6f} + {P1:.6f} = {result:.6f}\")\n\n# Method 2: Using numpy's linear algebra solver for verification\n# The system of equations is:\n# -l01*P0 + l10*P1 + 0*P2 + 0*P3 = 0\n# 0*P0 + l12*P1 - (l21+l23)*P2 + 0*P3 = 0\n# 0*P0 + 0*P1 + l23*P2 - l31*P3 = 0\n# P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n# This can be written as A*P = b\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve for P = [P0, P1, P2, P3]\nP = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\nP0_np, P1_np = P[0], P[1]\nresult_np = P0_np + P1_np\n\n# print(\"\\nVerification using numpy:\")\n# print(f\"P0 = {P0_np:.6f}, P1 = {P1_np:.6f}\")\n# print(f\"P0 + P1 = {result_np:.6f}\")\n```\n<<<0.946252>>>"
