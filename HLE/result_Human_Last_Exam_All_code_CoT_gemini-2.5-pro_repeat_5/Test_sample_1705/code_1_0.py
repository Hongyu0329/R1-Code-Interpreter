# The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S of points x_0
# for which the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values.

# As explained in the reasoning above, for a sequence to have a finite number of values,
# it must be eventually periodic. The set of all eventually periodic points for an
# analytic function like f(x) can be shown to be a countable set.
# A countable set has a Lebesgue measure of zero.

# Let mu_S be the Lebesgue measure of the set S.
# Our mathematical derivation shows that mu_S = 0.

# The problem asks to calculate mu_S * 10^6.
measure_S = 0
multiplier = 10**6
result = measure_S * multiplier

# The final equation is measure_S * 10^6 = result.
# We print the numbers in this equation.
print(f"The Lebesgue measure of S is {measure_S}.")
print(f"The requested value is the measure multiplied by 10^6.")
print(f"{measure_S} * {multiplier} = {result}")
