    "To solve this problem, we need to find a specific type of module over the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$. Let's break down the terminology and the plan.\n\n### **Thinking Steps**\n\n1.  **Understand the Algebra and its Modules:** The algebra $A$ is the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. This is a well-studied hereditary algebra. Its indecomposable modules correspond to intervals $[i, j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules. Let's name them:\n    *   $S_1 = [1,1]$: The simple module at vertex 1. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$.\n    *   $S_2 = [2,2]$: The simple module at vertex 2. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$.\n    *   $S_3 = [3,3]$: The simple module at vertex 3. Representation: $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n    *   $I_2 = [1,2]$: The injective envelope of $S_2$. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$.\n    *   $P_2 = [2,3]$: The projective cover of $S_2$. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n    *   $P_1 = [1,3]$: The projective cover of $S_1$. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n2.  **Clarify \"Slice Module\" and \"$\\tau$-tilting Module\"**:\n    *   A **slice module** is the direct sum of all indecomposable modules in a \"slice\" of the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. For hereditary algebras, slice modules are equivalent to **classical tilting modules** with pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. A classical tilting module $T$ is defined by the properties: (i) $|T|=n$ (where $n=3$ is the number of simple modules), and (ii) $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$.\n    *   A **$\\tau$-tilting module** (in the modern, narrow sense) is a module $T$ such that $|T|=n$ and $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$, where $\\tau$ is the AR translation.\n    *   For hereditary algebras like our $A$, the two conditions $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$ are equivalent. This means that $\\tau$-tilting modules (narrow sense) are the same as classical tilting modules. If we assume they must have distinct summands (as \"slice\" implies), then the question \"which $\\tau$-tilting module is not a slice?\" would have no answer.\n\n3.  **Resolve the Terminology**: The question likely uses \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" in a broader sense that is equivalent to the classical definition of a tilting module by Brenner and Butler, which *does not* require the indecomposable summands to be distinct. Under this interpretation, the task is to find a module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^3 M_i$ such that $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$, but at least two of the summands $M_i$ are isomorphic. This module would be a \"tilting module\" but not a \"slice module\".\n\n4.  **The Plan**: We will systematically search for such a module. A module $T = M_1 \\oplus M_2 \\oplus M_3$ is a tilting module if $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(M_i, M_j)=0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. We can check this condition for all combinations of three indecomposable modules (with repetitions allowed). The first one we find that has repeated summands will be our answer. The uniqueness is confirmed by the exhaustive search.\n\n5.  **Tools for Calculation**:\n    *   **AR translation $\\tau$**: For the quiver $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$, the action of $\\tau$ on non-projective indecomposables is: $\\tau(S_3) = S_2$, $\\tau(S_2) = S_1$, $\\tau(P_2) = I_2$, $\\tau(I_2) = S_1$. For projectives, $\\tau P=0$. However, $S_3=P_3$ and $S_1$ is injective, so $\\tau S_3=S_2$, $\\tau S_2=S_1$, $\\tau P_2=I_2$, and $\\tau M=0$ for $M \\in \\{S_1, I_2, P_1, P_3 \\}$. Wait, $S_1$ is injective, $P_3$ is projective. The correct values are: $\\tau(P_1)=0, \\tau(P_2)=I_2, \\tau(P_3)=S_2$. Since $S_1, I_2$ are injective, they are not in the image of $\\tau$. Thus $\\tau(S_2)=S_1$ is incorrect. From the AR quiver, $\\tau(S_2)=S_1$ and $\\tau(S_3)=S_2$. Let's use the standard result: $\\tau S_1=0$ (injective), $\\tau S_2=S_1$, $\\tau S_3=S_2$, $\\tau I_2=S_1$, $\\tau P_2=I_2$, $\\tau P_1=0$ (injective).\n    *   **Ext formula**: For a hereditary algebra, $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(M, N) \\cong D\\operatorname{Hom}_A(N, \\tau M)$, where $D$ is the standard duality. The Ext group is zero if and only if the Hom group is zero.\n    *   **Hom-spaces**: For this algebra, $\\dim \\operatorname{Hom}_A([i,j], [k,l]) = 1$ if $k \\le i$ and $j \\le l$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this search.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique tilting module over A_3 that is not a slice module.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Indecomposable modules represented as intervals [i, j]\n    S1 = (1, 1)\n    S2 = (2, 2)\n    S3 = (3, 3)\n    I2 = (1, 2)\n    P2 = (2, 3)\n    P1 = (1, 3)\n\n    # All indecomposable modules and their names\n    indecomposables = [S1, S2, S3, I2, P2, P1]\n    module_names = {\n        S1: \"S1\", S2: \"S2\", S3: \"S3\",\n        I2: \"I2\", P2: \"P2\", P1: \"P1\"\n    }\n\n    # Auslander-Reiten translation tau for non-projective modules\n    # S1 is injective, P1 is projective-injective, P2, P3 are projective\n    # tau(M) = 0 if M is projective.
