    "Of course, I can help with that. My plan is to query the ChEMBL database, a large, open-access database of bioactive drug-like small molecules. I will write a Python script that uses the official `chembl_webresource_client` library to find all recorded activities for the target you specified, `CHEMBL4803817` (which is the 3C-like proteinase of SARS-CoV-2).\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Import the necessary client from the `chembl_webresource_client` library.\n2.  Define the ChEMBL ID for the target protein.\n3.  Initialize the activity client to search for bioactivity data.\n4.  Filter the activities to find those that are specifically for our target and have a measured pChEMBL value. A pChEMBL value (-log(molar IC50, XC50, EC50, AC50, Ki, Kd, Potency)) is a good indicator of a significant, measured interaction.\n5.  From the results, I will extract the unique ChEMBL IDs of the interacting small molecules.\n6.  Finally, I will print the list of these small molecule ChEMBL IDs.\n\nHere is the Python script to accomplish this:\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary library installed:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client pandas\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for small molecules that interact with target: {target_id}\")\n    try:\n        # Initialize the client for the 'activity' endpoint\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # Query for activities related to the target protein.\n        # We filter for activities that have a pChEMBL value, which ensures\n        # a quantitative interaction has been measured.\n        res = activity.filter(\n            target_chembl_id=target_id,\n            pchembl_value__isnull=False\n        ).only(['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No interacting small molecules with a pChEMBL value were found for {target_id}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Convert the list of dictionaries to a pandas DataFrame\n        activities_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(res)\n\n        # Get the unique molecule ChEMBL IDs\n        unique_molecule_ids = activities_df['molecule_chembl_id'].unique()\n\n        print(f\"\\nFound {len(unique_molecule_ids)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_id}.\")\n        print(\"Here is a list of their ChEMBL IDs:\")\n        \n        # Print each unique molecule ID\n        for molecule_id in unique_molecule_ids:\n            print(molecule_id)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have an active internet connection and the 'chembl_webresource_client' library is installed correctly.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The ChEMBL ID for the target protein\n    target_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL4803817'\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id)\n```"
