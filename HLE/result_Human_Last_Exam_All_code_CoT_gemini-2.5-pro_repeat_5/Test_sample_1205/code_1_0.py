    A virtual function call, such as `a->foo()`, requires two memory accesses at minimum if the call cannot be devirtualized:
    1.  **vptr load**: The pointer to the virtual table (vptr) is loaded from the object's memory.
    2.  **vfunction load**: The address of the correct virtual function is loaded from the vtable using the vptr and a fixed offset for that function.

    Let's analyze the execution of the `foo` function step-by-step, assuming a perfectly optimizing compiler.

    **Step 1: The first call `a->foo()`**
    This is a standard virtual call on an object of an unknown dynamic type. The compiler must perform a full virtual dispatch.
    - vptr loads: 1 (to get the vtable for `a`)
    - vfunction loads: 1 (to get the address of `foo` from the vtable)

    **Step 2: The opaque function `escape(a)`**
    The function `escape()` is not visible to the compiler. The comment `// this can potentially modify dynamic type of a` is a hint that the compiler must assume the worst: the object at the memory address `a` has been replaced (e.g., via placement `new`). This invalidates any cached information about the object, such as its vptr. `escape()` acts as a strong optimization barrier.

    **Step 3: The second call `a->bar()`**
    Because all assumptions about the object at `a` are invalidated by `escape()`, the compiler cannot reuse any information. It must perform another full virtual dispatch.
    - vptr loads: 1 (a new load from memory is required)
    - vfunction loads: 1 (to get the address of `bar` from the new vtable)
    A perfectly optimizing compiler would now keep this newly loaded vptr in a register for potential reuse.

    **Step 4: The laundered call `b->foo()`**
    `std::launder(a)` creates a new pointer `b` that can safely access the (potentially new) object in the storage pointed to by `a`. It is a compile-time directive and doesn't generate runtime code. Importantly, between the call to `a->bar()` and `b->foo()`, no code that could modify the object is executed. A perfect compiler understands that `b` points to the same object that `a` pointed to during the `a->bar()` call.
    - **vptr load**: The compiler can reuse the vptr it loaded for `a->bar()`, which it has cached in a register. Therefore, no new vptr load from memory is needed.
    - **vfunction load**: The call is to `foo()`, which is a different function than `bar()`. The compiler must use the cached vptr to look up the address of `foo()` in the vtable. This requires a new load of a function pointer.

    **Final Calculation:**
