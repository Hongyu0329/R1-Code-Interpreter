    "My plan is to identify the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization. This involves researching archaeological findings related to Mesoamerican writing and calendar systems.\n\n1.  I will investigate the major Mesoamerican civilizations known for their writing, such as the Maya, Zapotec, and Olmec.\n2.  I will search for the oldest artifacts that contain calendar dates, focusing on the Maya Long Count system and the 260-day sacred calendar (tzolk'in).\n3.  Key archaeological sites like San Bartolo (Guatemala), Chiapa de Corzo (Mexico), and Tres Zapotes (Mexico) are important to this search.\n4.  I will compare the dates from these findings. The discovery announced in 2022 from the San Bartolo murals provides the current earliest evidence.\n5.  The Python script will then print this information, including the specific date notation, its location, its estimated age, and for context, the previously known earliest Long Count date.\n\n```python\ndef earliest_precolumbian_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The earliest known calendar notation\n    date_notation = \"7 Deer\"\n    civilization = \"Maya\"\n    location = \"the Las Pinturas pyramid at San Bartolo, Guatemala\"\n    time_period = \"3rd century BCE\"\n\n    # The earliest known Long Count date (for context)\n    long_count_stela = \"Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\"\n    long_count_date_mayan = \"7.16.3.2.13\"\n    long_count_date_gregorian = \"December 10, 36 BCE\"\n\n    print(\"The earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is the '7 Deer' glyph.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Details of the Earliest Finding ---\")\n    print(f\"Date Notation: {date_notation}\")\n    print(f\"Civilization: {civilization}\")\n    print(f\"Location: Found on painted mural fragments from {location}\")\n    print(f\"Estimated Age: The finding is dated to the {time_period}, making it the oldest known calendar record from the Americas.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Previous Record Holder (for context) ---\")\n    print(f\"For many years, one of the oldest known dates was a Long Count date from {long_count_stela}.\")\n    print(f\"Mayan Long Count: {long_count_date_mayan[0]}.{long_count_date_mayan[2:5]}.{long_count_date_mayan[6]}.{long_count_date_mayan[8]}.{long_count_date_mayan[10:]}\")\n    print(f\"Gregorian Equivalent: {long_count_date_gregorian}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    earliest_precolumbian_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date recorded is \"7 Deer\", found at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala and dated to the 3rd century BCE.>>>"
