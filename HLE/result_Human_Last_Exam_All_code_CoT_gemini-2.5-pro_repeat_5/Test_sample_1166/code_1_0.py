# This script identifies and prints the letters corresponding to the function types
# that are necessarily Lebesgue integrable based on standard measure theory.

# A function f is Lebesgue integrable if:
# 1. f is measurable.
# 2. The integral of the absolute value of f is finite.

# The analysis of the options leads to the following conclusions:
# F: Correct. A continuous function on a compact set [a,b] is measurable and bounded. The integral over a finite measure domain is finite.
# L: Correct. This is the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function.
# M: Correct. A continuous function is measurable, it is given as bounded, and the domain (a,b) has finite measure. The integral is therefore finite.

# The other options fail because they do not guarantee one or both of these conditions.
# For example, they might not be measurable, or they could be unbounded, or their domain could have infinite measure.
