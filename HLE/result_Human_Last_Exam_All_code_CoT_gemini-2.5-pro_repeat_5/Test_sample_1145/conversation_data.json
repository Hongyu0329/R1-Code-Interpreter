    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a given interval within a one-dimensional box.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval.\n    `P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n\n2.  **Define the wave function:** For a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wave function `ψ_n(x)` for the n-th energy state is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)`\n\n3.  **Determine the probability density:** The probability density is the square of the wave function:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)`\n\n4.  **Set up the specific integral:** We are given:\n    *   Energy state `n = 2`\n    *   Interval `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`\n\n    The integral to solve is:\n    `P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2 * π * x / a) dx`\n\n5.  **Calculate the integral:** We will use a Python script with the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically compute the value of this definite integral. For the calculation, we can set the box length `a=1` as the probability is a dimensionless quantity and the result is independent of the value of `a`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_particle_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a specific interval for a given energy state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constants for the problem\n    n = 2\n    x1_norm = 0.495\n    x2_norm = 0.505\n    \n    # The length of the box 'a' can be set to 1.0 for simplicity,\n    # as the final probability is independent of 'a'.\n    a = 1.0\n    \n    # Define the integration limits\n    x1 = x1_norm * a\n    x2 = x2_norm * a\n\n    # Define the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², to be integrated\n    # |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # Calculate the definite integral using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # The result is a tuple (value, estimated_error)\n    probability, _ = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n    # Print the equation and the numbers involved\n    print(\"The probability P is found by integrating the probability density |ψ_n(x)|² over the interval [x1, x2].\")\n    print(f\"The equation for n = {n} from x1 = {x1_norm}a to x2 = {x2_norm}a is:\")\n    print(f\"P = integral from {x1_norm}a to {x2_norm}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating this integral gives the probability:\")\n    print(f\"P = {probability}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_particle_probability()\n<<<6.579709664358983e-06>>>\n```"
