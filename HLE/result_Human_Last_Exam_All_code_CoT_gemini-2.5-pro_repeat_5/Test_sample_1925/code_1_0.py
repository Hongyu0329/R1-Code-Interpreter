def solve_ordinal_problem():
    """
    This function explains the steps to solve the set theory problem
    and prints the final result of the ordinal arithmetic.

    The problem asks for gamma * omega_1 + gamma, where gamma is the
    order type of the set X.

    Step 1: Determine the set X.
    Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the bounding number b is equal to omega_1.
    The set X consists of cardinals lambda such that any family of functions
    of size omega_1 has a bounded subfamily of size lambda. This holds
    if and only if lambda < b.
    So, X = {lambda in Cardinals | lambda < omega_1}.

    Step 2: Find the order type gamma.
    X = {0, 1, 2, ...} U {aleph_0}.
    The order type of this set is omega + 1. So, gamma = omega + 1.

    Step 3: Perform the ordinal arithmetic.
    We need to compute (omega + 1) * omega_1 + (omega + 1).
    - (omega + 1) * omega_1 = (omega * omega_1) + (1 * omega_1)
                             = omega_1 + omega_1
                             = omega_1 * 2
    - (omega_1 * 2) + (omega + 1) = (omega_1 * 2 + omega) + 1
                                  = omega_1 * 2 + 1

    The final result is omega_1 * 2 + 1.
