# This is a chess puzzle that requires logical deduction rather than complex computation.
# The plan is to find the fastest forced checkmate sequence for White.

# 1. Analyze the starting position from the FEN: 9k/5c1pb1/10/10/10/3Q6/PP5A2/K9 w - - 0 1
#    White has a Queen (d3) and an Archbishop (h2) poised for an attack on the Black King (j8).
#    Black's main defender is the Chancellor (f7).

# 2. Search for a checkmate. A mate in 1 is not possible as the Black King can always escape or the checking piece can be captured.

# 3. Search for a mate in 2. A forcing sequence is initiated by a sacrifice.
#    - White's move 1: Queen to d8, check (Qd8+).
#    - Black's move 1: Chancellor must capture the Queen (Cxd8). This is Black's only legal move.
#    - White's move 2: Archbishop to c7, checkmate (Ac7#).
#      - The Archbishop attacks the King on j8 (like a Bishop).
#      - The King cannot move to j7 or i7 (attacked by the Archbishop as a Bishop).
#      - The King cannot move to i8 (attacked by the Archbishop as a Knight).
#      - The Archbishop cannot be captured or blocked.

# 4. This sequence is a forced mate in 2 moves.
