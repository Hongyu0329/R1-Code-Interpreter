    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the figure's bounding box. This involves finding the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates.\n\n**1. Analyze the parametric equations:**\nThe curve is defined by $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = b\\sin(t)$.\n\n*   For the x-coordinate, $x = \\cos(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of the cosine function over this interval is $[-1, 1]$. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n\n*   For the y-coordinate, the definition is piecewise:\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$, so $y = \\sin(t)$. In this interval, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from 0 to 1. So, the y-values cover the range $[0, 1]$.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$, so $y = 5\\sin(t)$. In this interval, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0). Thus, $5\\sin(t)$ ranges from -5 to 0. The y-values cover the range $[-5, 0)$.\n\n*   Combining both pieces, the total range for the y-coordinate is the union of $[0, 1]$ and $[-5, 0)$, which is $[-5, 1]$. So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n**2. Determine the bounding box:**\nThe width of the bounding box is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of the bounding box is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**3. Find the smallest enclosing square:**\nThe smallest square that can enclose a rectangle of size $W \\times H$ must have a side length equal to the maximum of its dimensions.\nSide length $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**4. Calculate the area:**\nThe area of this square is $S^2$.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square enclosing the parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the extents of the curve.\n    # The x-coordinate is x = cos(t). For t in [0, 2pi), its range is [-1, 1].\n    x_min = -1.0\n    x_max = 1.0\n\n    # The y-coordinate has two parts.\n    # For t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [0, 1].\n    y_range1_min = 0.0\n    y_range1_max = 1.0\n\n    # For t in (pi, 2pi), y = 5 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [-1, 0).\n    y_range2_min = 5.0 * -1.0\n    y_range2_max = 0.0\n\n    # The total range for y is the union of the two ranges.\n    y_min = min(y_range1_min, y_range2_min)\n    y_max = max(y_range1_max, y_range2_max)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the extents of the curve.\")\n    print(f\"The range for x is [{int(x_min)}, {int(x_max)}].\")\n    print(f\"The range for y is [{int(y_min)}, {int(y_max)}].\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.\")\n    print(f\"Width = {int(x_max)} - ({int(x_min)}) = {int(width)}\")\n    print(f\"Height = {int(y_max)} - ({int(y_min)}) = {int(height)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\")\n    print(f\"Side length = max({int(width)}, {int(height)}) = {int(side_length)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the final area.\")\n    print(f\"Area = {int(side_length)}^2 = {int(area)}\")\n\nsolve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
