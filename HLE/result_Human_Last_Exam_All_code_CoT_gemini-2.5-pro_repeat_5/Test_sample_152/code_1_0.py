# Step 1: Analyze the pattern for SHAPE
# The shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle) appear in groups of three.
# Cells 1-3 are Circle, 4-6 are Square, so 7-9 must be Triangle.
cell_9_shape = "Triangle"
print("Pattern Analysis:")
print(f"1. Shape: The shapes are grouped in threes. Cells 7, 8, and 9 are Triangles. The shape for Cell 9 is {cell_9_shape}.")

# Step 2: Analyze the pattern for DOTS and ARROW POSITION
# We focus on the Triangle group (cells 7, 8, 9).
# We observe that the dots and angle follow an arithmetic progression.
# The group starts with 0 dots and a 'straight up' (0 radians) arrow position.

# Properties of the first cell in the Triangle group (Cell 7)
base_dots = 0
base_angle_rad = 0.0
print(f"\n2. Dots and Arrow Position Pattern (for the Triangle group):")
print(f"   - The sequence starts with Cell 7: {base_dots} dots, Arrow at 0.0 radians (straight up).")

# Properties of the second cell in the Triangle group (Cell 8)
# Cell 8: Triangle. 3 dots. Arrow is in the π radians position.
next_dots = 3
next_angle_rad = math.pi
print(f"   - Cell 8 has {next_dots} dots and the arrow is at π radians.")

# Calculate the increment per step for the Triangle group
dot_increment = next_dots - base_dots
angle_increment_rad = next_angle_rad - base_angle_rad
print(f"   - The increment per step is therefore {dot_increment} dots and π radians for the arrow.")

# Step 3: Calculate the properties for Cell 9
# Cell 9 is the third cell in the group (index 2, if the first is index 0).
index_in_group = 2
cell_9_dots = base_dots + index_in_group * dot_increment
cell_9_angle_rad = base_angle_rad + index_in_group * angle_increment_rad

print(f"\n3. Calculating properties for Cell 9 (the 3rd item in the group):")
print(f"   - Dots Equation: {base_dots} + {index_in_group} * {dot_increment} = {int(cell_9_dots)}")
print(f"   - Angle Equation: {base_angle_rad:.1f} + {index_in_group} * π = {cell_9_angle_rad/math.pi:.1f}π radians")

# Step 4: Format the final description
# Format dots
dots_str = f"{int(cell_9_dots)} dots"

# Format position
# An angle of 2π is equivalent to 0, which is "straight up".
pos_str = "Arrow is straight up."
print(f"   - Note: An angle of 2.0π radians is equivalent to the 'straight up' position.")
