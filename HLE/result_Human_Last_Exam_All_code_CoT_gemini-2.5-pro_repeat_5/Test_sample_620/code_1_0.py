    print("Problem Analysis:")
    print("1. The 'Product vs. Time' plot is non-linear, suggesting the reaction rate is not constant.")
    print("2. The enzyme is an 'obligate dimer', meaning it requires two subunits to be active.")
    print("3. The assay is pre-chilled on ice, which can cause cold-induced dissociation of protein subunits.")

    print("\nHypothesis:")
    print("The chilling step is causing the active dimer to dissociate into inactive monomers.")
    print("This leads to a 'lag phase' as the monomers slowly re-associate at the start of the reaction, causing a non-linear curve.")

    print("\nThe chemical equilibrium for the enzyme is:")
    monomer_coefficient = 2
    dimer_coefficient = 1
    print(f"{monomer_coefficient} Inactive-Monomers <=> {dimer_coefficient} Active-Dimer")

    print("\nEvaluating the Options:")
    print("A. Increase Temperature: Risky, may not solve the root cause (dissociation on ice) and could cause heat denaturation.")
    print("B. Decrease Temperature: Would likely worsen cold-induced dissociation and slow the reaction.")
    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: According to Le Chatelier's principle, this shifts the equilibrium towards the active dimer, counteracting the dissociation and reducing the lag phase.")
    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: Would shift equilibrium towards inactive monomers, making the problem worse.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most logical troubleshooting step is to increase the enzyme concentration to favor the formation of the active dimer.")
