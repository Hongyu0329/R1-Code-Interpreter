    # A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    print("--- Analysis of Statement A ---")
    print("CA thrives on a raffinose-rich diet, while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet. Since raffinose is an RFO, this directly implies CA is better equipped to metabolize RFOs.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    # B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    print("--- Analysis of Statement B ---")
    print("This is a direct summary of the experimental diet results given in the text (CA on 3:8 sucrose:raffinose, MA on sucrose only).")
    print("Conclusion: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    # C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    print("--- Analysis of Statement C ---")
    print("CA is transferred from watermelon (inferred high raffinose) to cotton (inferred low raffinose). Raffinose is the substrate for galactosidase. A lower amount of substrate naturally leads to decreased enzyme activity. The reason provided ('lower raffinose levels') is the direct and most logical cause.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement C is TRUE.\n")

    # D. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    print("--- Analysis of Statement D ---")
    print("The effect (decreased galactosidase activity) is correct, as explained for C. The proposed cause is 'higher glucose levels in cotton'. Cotton is sucrose-rich, so metabolizing it would yield high glucose. While high glucose can sometimes inhibit other metabolic pathways (a mechanism called catabolite repression), the text provides no evidence for this specific mechanism here.")
    print("The most direct cause for the decreased activity is the lack of the enzyme's specific substrate (raffinose), as stated in C. Attributing the effect to glucose levels is an unsupported assumption in the context of the given text.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement D is NOT supported by the text.\n")
    
    # E. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    print("--- Analysis of Statement E ---")
    print("MA is transferred from cotton (low raffinose) to watermelon (high raffinose). An increase in the substrate (raffinose) would likely trigger an increase in the activity of the corresponding enzyme (galactosidase) through a process called substrate induction. The reason provided ('higher raffinose levels') is the direct cause.")
