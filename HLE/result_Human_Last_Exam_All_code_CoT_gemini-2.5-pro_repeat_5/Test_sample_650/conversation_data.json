    "To find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size, which is determined by `n`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a₀ := x — qc;`\n    *   This step consists of a fixed number of assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. These are all considered constant time operations. Therefore, the time complexity of the initialization step is **O(1)**.\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which runs as long as `q > 0`. We need to determine how many times this loop executes.\n    *   Let's trace the value of the variable `q`. It starts as `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `x` is set to the current `q`, and then `q` is updated to `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in each iteration, the value of `q` is divided by `c` (integer division).\n    *   The loop will continue until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm `log_c(n)`.\n    *   For example, after 1 iteration, `q` is approximately `n/c²`. After `k` iterations, `q` is approximately `n/c^(k+1)`. The loop stops when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which means `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n    *   More formally, the number of iterations is equal to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`, minus one. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. So, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n3.  **Inside the loop (Step 2.1):**\n    *   `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; aᵢ := x — qc`\n    *   The operations inside the loop are assignments, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Just like the initialization, this block of operations takes constant time. The complexity of the loop's body is **O(1)**.\n\n4.  **Total Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the product of the number of loop iterations and the complexity of the work done in each iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity of Loop Body)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = **O(log_c(n))**\n\n5.  **Final Simplification:**\n    *   In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class, because `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `1/log(c)` is also a constant factor that is ignored in Big O notation.\n    *   Thus, the complexity is commonly written as **O(log n)**.\n\nThe following Python code implements the algorithm. It also constructs and prints a final equation to verify the result, which demonstrates how the digits `(a_i, ..., a_0)` represent the number `n`.\n\n```python\ndef imag_base_converter(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the IMAG(n, c) algorithm to represent number n in base c.\n    This function also prints the verification equation.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The non-negative integer to convert.\n        c (int): The base to convert to (must be >= 2).\n\n    Returns:\n        None.
