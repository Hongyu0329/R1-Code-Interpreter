        "B. Bat": "Bats specialize in ultrasound (20,000 Hz to 200,000 Hz) for echolocation. Their hearing is not adapted for detecting the very faint, low-frequency sounds of muscle activity.",
        "C. Herring": "Some fish have remarkably sensitive hearing. Herring possess a special connection between their swim bladder and inner ears, which can amplify pressure changes in the water. This exceptional auditory system makes it plausible they can detect the minute vibrations caused by the muscle movements of nearby animals.",
        "D. Whale": "Baleen whales excel at hearing very low-frequency sounds (infrasound) over immense distances. However, this is different from detecting the extremely faint, localized sound of a muscle twitch.",
        "E. Human": "Humans have a hearing range of about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The sounds from our own muscle contractions are far too quiet (low amplitude) for our ears to perceive."
