    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: First, I will break down the user's request. The goal is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Concept**: I'll show that if a graph `G` contains an induced clique of a certain size `k_max`, it must also contain induced cliques of all smaller sizes from 1 to `k_max`. This is because any subset of vertices from the `k_max`-clique will also form a clique.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: This key insight simplifies the problem significantly. The set of all possible induced clique sizes in any given graph is always `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in that graph. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is simply `k_max`.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum**: The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible value of `k_max` for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n5.  **Determine the Upper Bound**: The size of any clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices. For a graph with `n=128` vertices, the maximum possible clique size is 128.\n\n6.  **Provide a Constructive Proof**: I'll demonstrate that this maximum is achievable by considering the complete graph `K_128`. In this graph, any subset of `k` vertices forms an induced clique of size `k`, for any `k` from 1 to 128.\n\n7.  **Finalize the Answer**: This confirms that the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n8.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that prints this entire line of reasoning and outputs the final numerical answer, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution and an \"equation\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n    on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph, as specified by the problem.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the problem.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the maximum number of different values 'k' such that a clique of size k (K_k)\")\n    print(f\"can be found as an induced subgraph in a single graph G with n = {n} vertices.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the property of induced cliques.\")\n    print(\"Let's assume a graph G has an induced clique of size k_max.
