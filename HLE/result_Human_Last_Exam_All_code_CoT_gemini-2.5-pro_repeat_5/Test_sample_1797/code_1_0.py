    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect ones.

    Based on the analysis:
    - Statement A is correct. It describes the fundamental graph structure and analysis techniques.
    - Statement B is correct. It accurately describes the state explosion problem.
    - Statement C is correct. The problem is at least NP-hard (it is PSPACE-complete), justifying the need for heuristics.
    - Statement D is correct. It points out the dynamic nature of attack graphs and the need for incremental updates.
    - Statement E is correct. It describes the valid application of model checking for formal verification.

    Since all statements are correct, the correct response according to the instructions is 'N'.
