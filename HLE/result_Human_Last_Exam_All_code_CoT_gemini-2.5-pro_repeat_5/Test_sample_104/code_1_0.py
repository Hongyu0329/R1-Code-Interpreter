    min_expected_F = 1 / relative_bias_threshold

    # Step 2: Relate the expected F-statistic to the concentration parameter (μ²), a measure of instrument strength.
    # The asymptotic relationship for L instruments is E[F] ≈ 1 + μ² / L.
    # For L=1, E[F] ≈ 1 + μ².
    # The condition E[F] > 10 implies a minimum concentration parameter: μ² > 9.

    # Step 3: Find the critical value for the hypothesis test H0: μ² <= 9 vs H1: μ² > 9.
    # The critical value is the 95th percentile of the F-statistic's distribution when μ²=9.
    # Asymptotically, the F-statistic with 1 instrument follows a non-central chi-squared distribution
    # with 1 degree of freedom and a non-centrality parameter equal to μ².

    # the critical value for a 5% test is 16.38.
