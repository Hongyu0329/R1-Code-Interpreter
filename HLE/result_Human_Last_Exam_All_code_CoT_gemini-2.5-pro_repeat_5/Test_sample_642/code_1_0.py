# The problem is to compute the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k approaches infinity.
# f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing machine to recognize
# the language of binary strings where the count of '1's is a multiple of k.

# Step 1: Determine the form of f(k).
# A Turing machine can use its tape to count the number of '1's.
# A constant number of states (C) are needed for control flow and scanning the input.
# To check if the count N is divisible by k, the machine can simulate a
# k-state finite automaton on the unary representation of N stored on the tape.
# This requires k states.
# So, the minimal number of states is f(k) = k + C.

# Step 2: Set up the equation for the difference.
# The expression is f(k+1) - f(k).
# Substituting our formula for f(k):
# Difference = ((k+1) + C) - (k + C)

# Step 3: Simplify the equation.
# Difference = k + 1 + C - k - C
# Difference = 1
difference = 1

# Step 4: Compute the limit.
# The limit of a constant is the constant itself.
final_limit = 1

# The final equation is lim_{k->inf} (1) = 1.
# The numbers in this final equation are 1 and 1.
