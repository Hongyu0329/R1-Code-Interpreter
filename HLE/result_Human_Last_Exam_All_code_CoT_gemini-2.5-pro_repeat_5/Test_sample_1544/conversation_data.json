    "Based on the provided FEN string, I will analyze the chess position to determine the optimal move for White.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** I will examine the board state for both White and Black. The key features are the locations of the kings, queens, and pawns. White's advanced `d6` pawn is a major asset, while Black's queen on `c5` poses the main threat.\n2.  **Identify Candidate Moves:** I will list and evaluate the most promising moves for White. The most obvious candidate is a move that deals with Black's queen.\n3.  **Evaluate Outcomes:** For each candidate move, I will consider Black's likely responses and determine the resulting position, aiming to find the move that leads to a winning endgame for White.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script that uses the `python-chess` library and the Stockfish chess engine to programmatically verify the analysis and find the best move. The script will set up the board from the FEN, have the engine analyze it, and then print the best move.\n\n### Analysis:\n*   **White's Position:** King on g1, Queen on f2, Pawn on a4, and a very strong passed pawn on d6.\n*   **Black's Position:** King on b6, Queen on c5, Pawns on d7, a5, c6.\n*   **White to Move:** White's goal is to neutralize Black's queen and promote the d6-pawn.\n\nThe most forcing and powerful move for White is **1. Qxc5+**. Let's examine Black's responses:\n*   If Black plays **1... Kxc5**, White responds with **2. d7**. The d-pawn is now unstoppable and will promote to a new queen, leading to an easy win for White.\n*   If Black plays **1... Ka7** (or 1... Kb7), White can simply play **2. Qxc6**. This removes Black's dangerous c-pawn and leaves White with a decisive advantage. The d-pawn remains a huge threat, and Black has no way to create counterplay.\n\nOther moves for White are significantly weaker. For example, `Qf7+` allows Black to start a series of checks with `...Qf8+` after White takes the d7-pawn.\n\nTherefore, `Qxc5+` is the decisive, winning move. The following Python code will confirm this by using the Stockfish engine.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.engine\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef find_best_chess_move():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a chess position using the Stockfish engine to find the best move.\n\n    This script requires the Stockfish chess engine.
