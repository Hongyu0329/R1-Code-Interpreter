    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Create a list of notable French ships that were sunk during the early period of World War II. This data will include the ship's name, type, displacement, date of sinking, and the cause.\n2.  Define the cut-off date, which is the French Armistice on June 22, 1940.\n3.  Filter this list to include only ships sunk by a German U-boat before this armistice date.\n4.  From the filtered list, find the ship with the highest displacement.\n5.  Finally, print the details of this ship.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_largest_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice\n    from a predefined list of ships.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on French ships sunk during WWII.\n    # Displacement is in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) for merchant vessels\n    # and standard displacement for warships.\n    ships = [\n        {'name': 'Bretagne', 'type': 'Battleship', 'displacement': 22189, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 7, 3), 'cause': 'British Royal Navy'},\n        {'name': 'Sheherazade', 'type': 'Freighter', 'displacement': 13467, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 6, 11), 'cause': 'U-boat U-48'},\n        {'name': 'Brazza', 'type': 'Passenger ship', 'displacement': 10387, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 5, 28), 'cause': 'U-boat U-37'},\n        {'name': 'Bretagne', 'type': 'Freighter', 'displacement': 10108, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 14), 'cause': 'U-boat U-45'},\n        {'name': 'Navarra', 'type': 'Freighter', 'displacement': 10108, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 12, 30), 'cause': 'U-boat U-32'},\n        {'name': 'La Roseline', 'type': 'Tanker', 'displacement': 8266, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 3, 21), 'cause': 'U-boat U-32'},\n        {'name': 'Atene', 'type': 'Freighter', 'displacement': 6672, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 3), 'cause': 'U-boat U-26'}\n    ]\n\n    # The Armistice of 22 June 1940 is the cutoff date.\n    armistice_date = datetime.date(1940, 6, 22)\n\n    largest_ship_found = None\n    max_displacement = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the list to find the qualifying ship\n    for ship in ships:\n        # Condition 1: Sunk by a U-boat\n        is_sunk_by_uboat = 'U-boat' in ship['cause']\n        \n        # Condition 2: Sunk before the armistice\n        is_before_armistice = ship['sunk_date'] < armistice_date\n        \n        if is_sunk_by_uboat and is_before_armistice:\n            # Check if this ship is the largest one found so far\n            if ship['displacement'] > max_displacement:\n                max_displacement = ship['displacement']\n                largest_ship_found = ship\n\n    if largest_ship_found:\n        name = largest_ship_found['name']\n        displacement = largest_ship_found['displacement']\n        print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the '{name}'.\")\n        print(f\"Its displacement was {displacement} tons.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No ship matching the criteria was found in the dataset.\")\n\nfind_largest_ship()\n```\n<<<Sheherazade>>>"
