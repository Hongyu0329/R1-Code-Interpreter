    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we need to follow a systematic approach. A graph is called \"2-vertex-connected\" if it has more than 2 vertices and it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property is measured by \"node connectivity,\" so we are looking for graphs whose node connectivity is 2 or more.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem using Python:\n1.  First, we need a list of all simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices. Generating these from scratch is complex, so we will use the `networkx` library, which provides a pre-computed \"Atlas of Graphs\".\n2.  We will load all graphs from the atlas and filter them to keep only those with exactly 5 vertices. There are 34 such unique graphs.\n3.  Next, we will iterate through each of these 34 graphs.\n4.  For each graph, we will calculate its node connectivity using the `networkx.node_connectivity()` function.\n5.  We will count how many of these graphs have a node connectivity of 2 or greater.\n6.  Finally, to meet the output requirements, we will display the result as a sum of 1s for each graph found, which adds up to the total count.\n\nThis method is reliable because it leverages the well-tested `networkx` library for both graph generation and connectivity analysis.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_2_vertex_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple \n    nonisomorphic graphs with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Get all nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices from the NetworkX graph atlas.\n    # The atlas contains all non-isomorphic graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    all_graphs_from_atlas = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    graphs_with_n_vertices = [g for g in all_graphs_from_atlas if g.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices]\n    \n    num_total_graphs = len(graphs_with_n_vertices)\n    print(f\"There are {num_total_graphs} simple nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices.\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through each graph and check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or more.\n    # We will build a list of 1s for each graph that satisfies the condition.\n    contributions = []\n    for g in graphs_with_n_vertices:\n        # The node_connectivity function returns the vertex connectivity of the graph.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(g) >= 2:\n            contributions.append(1)\n\n    # Step 5 & 6: Sum the contributions and print the final equation.\n    total_count = len(contributions)\n    \n    print(f\"Found {total_count} graphs that are 2-vertex-connected.\")\n    print(\"The final count is derived from the following equation:\")\n    \n    if total_count > 0:\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, contributions))\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0 = 0\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\ncount_2_vertex_connected_graphs()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
