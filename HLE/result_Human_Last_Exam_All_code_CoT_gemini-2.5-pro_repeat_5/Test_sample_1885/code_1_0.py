    print("Step 2: Formulating a strategy.")
    print("To show that something is not a necessary truth, we can show that a counterexample is possible.")
    print("This is achieved by constructing a counterexample within a model of set theory that is consistent with the standard axioms (ZFC).")
    print("We will use the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) as an additional axiom to construct this counterexample.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Constructing the counterexample (assuming GCH).")
    print("Assume GCH. A consequence is that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.")
    print("This allows us to list all functions h: omega_1 -> omega_1 in a sequence of length omega_2, let's call it {g_alpha : alpha < omega_2}.")

    print("Step 4: The proof by contradiction.")
    print("Now, assume for the sake of contradiction that the statement in the question holds for our constructed sequence.")
    print("This would mean there exists an uncountable set X (a subset of omega_2) and a function g such that for all beta in X, f_beta is pointwise bounded by g.")
    print("\nSince our list {g_alpha} contains all possible functions, this bounding function g must be one of them. Let's say g = g_a for some ordinal 'a' < omega_2.")
    print("The set X is uncountable. Because 'a' is just one specific ordinal, we can certainly find another ordinal 'b' in the uncountable set X such that b > a.")
    print("\nLet's compare f_b with our supposed bound g_a.")
    print("By the very definition of f_b, it was constructed to be greater than g_a. Specifically, f_b(gamma) > g_a(gamma) for all gamma.")
    print("This means f_b is *not* bounded by g_a.")
