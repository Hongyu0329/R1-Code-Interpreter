# The problem asks for the maximal probability p that Alice can design a strategy
# to win, guaranteed for any input sequence of 20 distinct non-negative numbers.

# Let N be the total number of boxes.
N = 20

# Alice's goal is to guess a number in a closed box using a bounded interval.
# The key insight is that it's impossible to guarantee a win if the number
# to be guessed is the absolute minimum or absolute maximum of all 20 numbers.
# This is because the information from the opened boxes is one-sided (all numbers
# are larger than the minimum, or all are smaller than the maximum), which prevents
# forming a guaranteed winning bounded interval against a clever adversary.

# Therefore, Alice's best strategy is to maximize the chance of guessing an
# "interior" number (not the min or max).

# The optimal strategy for Alice is as follows:
# 1. Choose one box out of the 20 uniformly at random to leave closed.
# 2. Open the remaining N-1 = 19 boxes.
# 3. Find the minimum (v_min) and maximum (v_max) of the numbers in the opened boxes.
# 4. Guess that the number in the closed box is within the interval (v_min, v_max).

# Let's analyze the success of this strategy. Let the sorted numbers be y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_20.
# Alice wins if her interval contains the number in the closed box.

# There are two losing cases:
# - Case 1 (Loss): The closed box contains the global minimum (y_1).
#   The opened boxes contain {y_2, ..., y_20}. The interval is (y_2, y_20). This does not contain y_1.
# - Case 2 (Loss): The closed box contains the global maximum (y_20).
#   The opened boxes contain {y_1, ..., y_19}. The interval is (y_1, y_19). This does not contain y_20.

# There is one winning case:
# - Case 3 (Win): The closed box contains an interior number (y_m for m in {2, ..., 19}).
#   The opened boxes contain y_1 and y_20. The interval is (y_1, y_20). This contains y_m.

# Since the box is chosen uniformly at random, each number y_m has a 1/20 chance
# of being in the closed box.
# The number of losing cases corresponds to the two extrema.
# The number of winning cases corresponds to the N-2 interior numbers.
