    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts about adult Raphidiopterans.
    # Fact 1: They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects.
    # Fact 2: They are known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.
    # Fact 3: Raphidioptera are not native to New Zealand.
    fact_predatory = "Adult snakeflies prey on soft-bodied insects like aphids."

        'B. M훮hoe pollen': 'Incorrect. M훮hoe is a New Zealand plant, and snakeflies are not found there.',
        'C. Fungus': 'Incorrect. They are not known to be fungivores.',
        'D. Karam큰 leaf tissue': 'Incorrect. Karam큰 is a New Zealand plant, and snakeflies are not herbivores.',
        'E. Totara Aphids': 'Partially correct. They eat aphids, but the mention of Totara (a NZ tree) is misleading. However, "Aphids" as a food type is correct.',
