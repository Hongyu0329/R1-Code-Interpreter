    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  **Analyze the organism**: I will first research the diet of the adult stage of insects in the order Raphidioptera (snakeflies).\n2.  **Evaluate food sources**: I will check scientific sources to determine if they are known to consume the items listed in the answer choices.\n    *   **Predatory Behavior**: Snakeflies are well-known predators. I will verify if their prey includes soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n    *   **Supplementary Diet**: I will check if adults also consume non-prey items like nectar or pollen for energy.\n    *   **Geographic Range**: I will consider the geographic distribution of Raphidioptera. The presence of species native to New Zealand (Māhoe, Karamū, Tōtara) in the options is a critical clue, as snakeflies are not native to New Zealand.\n3.  **Synthesize the findings**: Based on the research, I will determine which of the choices (A-G) is the most accurate description of the adult snakefly diet. Both A (Nectar) and E (Aphids, a general food type) are known food sources.\n4.  **Construct Python code**: I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this analysis and prints the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts about adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Fact 1: They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects.\n    # Fact 2: They are known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n    # Fact 3: Raphidioptera are not native to New Zealand.\n    fact_predatory = \"Adult snakeflies prey on soft-bodied insects like aphids.\"\n    fact_supplementary = \"Adult snakeflies also feed on nectar and pollen.\"\n    fact_geographic = \"Snakeflies are not found in New Zealand.\"\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices based on these facts.\n    analysis = {\n        'A.

Totara Aphids': 'Partially correct. They eat aphids, but the mention of Totara (a NZ tree) is misleading. However, \"Aphids\" as a food type is correct.',\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.\n    # Both Nectar (A) and Aphids (a key part of E) are correct food sources.\n    # Therefore, the option combining both is the most accurate.\n    conclusion = \"Based on the analysis, adult Raphidiopterans feed on both nectar and aphids.
