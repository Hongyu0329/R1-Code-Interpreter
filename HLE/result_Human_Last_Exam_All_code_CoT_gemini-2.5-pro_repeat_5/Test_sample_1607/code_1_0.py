    Analyzes a series of statements about quantum mechanics to identify the true ones.

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:

    A) The eigenvalues of τ̂ are necessarily quantized.
       - False. A generator of a continuous symmetry can have a continuous spectrum. For example, the momentum operator p̂, which generates spatial translations, has a continuous spectrum for a free particle.

    B1) "If τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ and [τ̂,Ĥ] = 0, then the potential V(r) must be of form V(r) ∝ 1/r² (if it exists)"
       - False. For a Hamiltonian of the form Ĥ = p̂²/2m + V(r) with V(r) ∝ 1/r², one can calculate the commutator to be [τ̂, Ĥ] = 4iħĤ. For this commutator to be zero, the Hamiltonian Ĥ itself must be zero, which is a trivial case. The premise and the condition are contradictory for non-trivial systems.

    B2) "If τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂, then the transformation Ŝ(θ) = e^{-iθτ̂} scales position and momentum as x̂ → e^θx̂, p̂ → e^{-θ}p̂"
       - False. Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula to find the transformed operator x̂' = e^{iθτ̂}x̂e^{-iθτ̂}, one finds that the scaling factor is e^(2ħθ), not e^θ.

    C) [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0.
       - False. If [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = [e^{-iθτ̂}, Ĥ] = 0 for all values of the continuous parameter θ, this is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the generator's commutator [τ̂, Ĥ] to be zero.

    D) For any energy eigenstate |ψ⟩, τ̂|ψ⟩ is also an energy eigenstate.
       - True. The condition [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 implies [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0. If Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, then applying Ĥ to τ̂|ψ⟩ gives Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂Ĥ|ψ⟩ = τ̂(E|ψ⟩) = E(τ̂|ψ⟩). This shows τ̂|ψ⟩ is an eigenstate with the same energy E.

    E) If τ̂ = L̂_z, then Ŝ(θ) represents rotation about z-axis by angle θ.
       - False. The operator for a rotation by a physical angle θ about the z-axis is e^{-iθL̂_z/ħ}. The statement implies a relationship where the parameter of the exponential is the angle, which is only true if ħ=1. Since ħ is used elsewhere, this is strictly false.

    F) The expectation value ⟨τ̂⟩ is conserved if and only if [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
       - True. This is a cornerstone of conservation laws in quantum mechanics, derived from the Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator: d⟨τ̂⟩/dt = (i/ħ)⟨[Ĥ, τ̂]⟩. The rate of change is zero for all states if and only if the commutator [τ̂, Ĥ] is zero.

    G) If [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 for all θ₁,θ₂, then τ̂ must be Hermitian.
       - True. The premise [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 is always true for a one-parameter group generated by a single operator τ̂. The conclusion follows from the fact that Ŝ is a unitary operator, and for Ŝ(θ) = e^{-iθτ̂} to be unitary, its generator τ̂ must be Hermitian.

    H) The spectrum of Ŝ is always continuous if τ̂ is unbounded.
       - False. An operator can be unbounded but still have a discrete spectrum. For example, the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator is unbounded, but its energy eigenvalues are discrete.

    I) If [τ̂₁, τ̂₂] = iτ̂₃, then e^{-iθ₁τ̂₁}e^{-iθ₂τ̂₂} ≠ e^{-i(θ₁τ̂₁ + θ₂τ̂₂)}.
       - True. According to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, e^A e^B = e^(A+B) only if the operators commute ([A,B]=0). Since the generators τ̂₁ and τ̂₂ do not commute, the equality does not hold.

    J) If |ψ⟩ is eigenstate of Ĥ with energy E, then Ŝ|ψ⟩ has same energy E.
       - True. This is a fundamental property of a symmetry. Since [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 is given, Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜĤ|ψ⟩ = Ŝ(E|ψ⟩) = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).
