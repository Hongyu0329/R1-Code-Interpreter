# Analysis of statements based on the code output and theory:
# A) P(n) is true for 1 <= n <= 4. False. The code shows P(4) is false.
# B) P(n) is true for all n. False.
# C) If P(n) is false, then I_n < pi/2. True. The code shows this for n=4,5,6,7,8.
# D) The first n where P(n) is false is n = 5. False. It's n=4.
# E) lim_{n→∞} I_n = π/4. False. This is true for the 'odd' Borwein integral, not this one.
# F) For n = 5, |I_n - pi/2| < 10^-5. False. The code shows a difference of ~ -0.003.
# G) The sequence {I_n} is monotonically decreasing. False. I_1 = I_2 = I_3.
# H) For any false P(n), I_n is irrational. True. The exact form is pi * (a rational number).
# I) Numerical evaluation of I_5 suffices to disprove P(5). True. The difference is ~ -0.003, which is large enough to be detected numerically.
# J) The function under the integral is always positive for n <= 4. False. sinc(x) becomes negative for x > pi.
# K) If P(n) is false, then P(k) is false for all k > n. True. The condition sum(1/k) > 1 only becomes stronger for larger n.
# L) The first four values being π/2 is coincidental. False. It is a direct consequence of the underlying mathematical structure. Also, only the first three values are pi/2.
#
# The correct statements are C, H, I, K.
