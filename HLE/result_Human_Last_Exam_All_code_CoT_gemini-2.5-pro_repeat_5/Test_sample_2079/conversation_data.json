    "To answer your question, I need to consult historical records. This is a knowledge-based query, not a computational one. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  I will search my internal knowledge base, which includes historical data and encyclopedic information, for the records of the city of Bártfa (the historical Hungarian name for Bardejov) for the year 1461.\n2.  I will specifically look for the title 'iudex' (Latin for judge, which was the title for the head of the town council, similar to a mayor).\n3.  Once I identify the name associated with that title in that year, I will provide a simple Python script to print the answer, as requested by the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    city = \"Bártfa (now Bardejov)\"\n    judge_name = \"Jakab\"\n    \n    print(f\"The judge of {city} in {year} was: {judge_name}\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Jakab>>>"
