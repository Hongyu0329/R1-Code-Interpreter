    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.
    Let G be a graph with the given properties.
    1. G is a connected, 3-regular graph with 2000 vertices.
    2. G has an adjustable perfect matching M.

    The adjustable property means that for any two edges (v,u) and (v',u') in M,
    an edge (v,v') exists if and only if an edge (u,u') exists.

    Let's partition the vertices of G into V1 and U1 based on the matching M.
    Let M = {v_i u_i | i = 1, ..., 1000}. Let V1 = {v_1, ...} and U1 = {u_1, ...}.
    The adjustable property implies that the subgraph G_V induced by V1 is isomorphic
    to the subgraph G_U induced by U1.

    The 3-regularity of G implies that the sum of degrees for any vertex v_i
    from edges within G_V and from non-matching edges to U1 must be 2.
    d_GV(v_i) + k_i = 2, where k_i is the number of non-matching edges from v_i to U1.

    The connectivity of G imposes strong constraints. If G_V contains a cycle, say C_k,
    then the vertices of that cycle have degree 2 in G_V. This means they have no
    non-matching edges to U1 (k_i = 0). This forces the subgraph built on the cycle
    and its matching partners in U1 (a graph C_k x K_2) to be a separate connected
    component of G.

    Since G is connected, this component must be the whole graph.
    So, G must be isomorphic to C_k x K_2.
    The number of vertices is 2k = 2000, so k = 1000.
    Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the prism graph C_1000 x K_2.

    A similar analysis for the case where G_V has no cycles (it's a forest of paths)
    also leads to the conclusion that the only way to make a connected graph is to
    form a structure isomorphic to C_1000 x K_2.

    The graph C_1000 x K_2 satisfies all the properties: it is connected, 3-regular,
    has 2000 vertices, and has an adjustable perfect matching.

    Thus, there is only one such non-isomorphic graph.
