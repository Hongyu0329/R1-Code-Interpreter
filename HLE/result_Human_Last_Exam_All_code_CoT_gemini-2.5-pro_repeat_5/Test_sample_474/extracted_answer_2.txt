No, this approach is not ecologically valid because the warning signals of mimicry syndromes are directed at natural predators, not humans. The visual systems and perceptual criteria of predators (e.g., the ability to see UV light) are different from those of humans. Therefore, using human judgment of similarity is not a reliable way to assess the ecological function of the mimicry.
