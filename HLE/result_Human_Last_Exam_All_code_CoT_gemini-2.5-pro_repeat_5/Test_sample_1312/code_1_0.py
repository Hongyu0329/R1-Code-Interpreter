    print("The core problem is 'genetic deterioration' due to 'limited recombination'.")
    print("In genomes with limited recombination (e.g., in asexual species), deleterious mutations can accumulate in a process called Muller's Ratchet, as there is no way to separate good genes from bad genes on the same chromosome.")
    print("We are looking for a feature that can counteract this process.\n")
    
    print("Let's evaluate the options:\n")

    print("A. Tandem repeats: These are simple repetitive sequences. They do not provide functional backups for essential genes.")
    
    print("B. Chromosomal inversions: These are rearrangements that actually suppress recombination in heterozygotes. They contribute to the problem, not solve it, by locking alleles together.")

    print("C. Transposable elements: These are 'jumping genes' that can cause mutations. Their accumulation is often a negative consequence of inefficient selection in low-recombination regions.")

    print("D. Multigene families: These are groups of genes that arise from duplication. This is a powerful compensatory mechanism for two reasons:")
    print("   1. Redundancy: If one gene copy accumulates a harmful mutation, other copies can still perform the essential function, providing a buffer against deterioration.")
    print("   2. Innovation: The extra gene copies are free from strong selective pressure and can evolve new functions, providing a source of genetic novelty that is otherwise lacking without recombination.")

    print("E. Polyploidy: This is the duplication of the entire genome. While it does provide gene redundancy, 'multigene families' is a more specific and widely cited mechanism that operates at the gene level to counteract deterioration.")

    print("\nConclusion: Multigene families are the most fitting answer as they directly provide functional redundancy and evolutionary potential to compensate for the absence of recombination.")
