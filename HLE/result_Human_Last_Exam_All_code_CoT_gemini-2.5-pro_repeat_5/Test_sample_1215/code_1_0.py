    print("The number of variables that φ must depend on is k = n - 1.")
    print("Since any logically equivalent formula ψ must depend on the same set of variables, the minimum number of variables required for ψ is also k.")
    print("The fact that ψ can be constructed using only conjunction and negation is guaranteed because these connectives are functionally complete.\n")
