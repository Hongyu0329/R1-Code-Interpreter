    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of isomers formed in the reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Predict the Product:** The reaction involves `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` (cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)) and the ligand `L` (2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole). The `[Ru(bpy)2]^2+` core is chemically very robust and stable. Therefore, the most plausible reaction is the substitution of the two relatively labile chloride (`Cl-`) ligands by the incoming ligand `L`. For `L` to replace two adjacent (`cis`) chloride ligands, it must act as a bidentate (two-toothed) chelating ligand. The ligand `L` has two identical bidentate chelating sites, each consisting of a pyridyl nitrogen and an adjacent thiazole nitrogen (`py-tz`). The product will thus be `[Ru(bpy)2(L')]^2+`, where `L'` represents one of the `py-tz` bidentate coordinating units of the full ligand.\n\n2.  **Identify the Isomer Type:** The resulting complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L')]^2+`, is an octahedral metal complex with three bidentate ligands. This is a tris-chelate complex. It has the general formula `[M(AA)2(BC)]`, where:\n    *   `M` = Ru (Ruthenium)\n    *   `AA` = bpy (bipyridine), a symmetric bidentate ligand.\n    *   `BC` = L' (the pyridyl-thiazole unit), an unsymmetric bidentate ligand, as the pyridyl nitrogen (B) and thiazole nitrogen (C) donors are different.\n\n3.  **Count the Stereoisomers:** We need to determine the number of stereoisomers (geometric isomers and enantiomers) for a complex of type `[M(AA)2(BC)]`.\n    *   **Geometric Isomers:** Due to the different possible arrangements of the three chelate ligands (two `bpy` and one `L'`) around the central Ru atom, two distinct geometric isomers can be formed. These are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Optical Isomers):** We must check if these geometric isomers are chiral (non-superimposable on their mirror images).\n        *   An analysis of the point group symmetry for both geometric isomers of `[M(AA)2(BC)]` reveals that neither has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n        *   Therefore, both geometric isomers are chiral.\n        *   Each chiral isomer exists as a pair of enantiomers (a \"left-handed\" Δ version and a \"right-handed\" Λ version).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Isomers:**\n    *   Number of geometric isomers = 2.\n    *   Number of enantiomers for each geometric isomer = 2.\n    *   Total number of isomers = (Number of geometric isomers) × (Number of enantiomers per geometric isomer) = 2 × 2 = 4.\n\nThe reaction starts with a racemic mixture of `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` and reacts with the achiral ligand `L`, resulting in the formation of all four possible stereoisomers of the product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of isomers formed from the reaction of\n    cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) with\n    2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the type of the final complex.\n    # The reaction is a substitution of two Cl- ligands by the new ligand (L)\n    # acting as a bidentate, unsymmetrical chelate (BC).\n    # The starting complex has two bipyridine (bpy) ligands, which are\n    # symmetrical bidentate chelates (AA).\n    # The resulting complex type is [M(AA)2(BC)].\n    complex_type = \"[M(AA)2(BC)]\"\n    print(f\"The analysis is for a complex of type: {complex_type}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of geometric isomers for this type.\n    # For a tris-chelate complex [M(AA)2(BC)], there are two possible\n    # arrangements of the ligands around the central metal atom.\n    num_geometric_isomers = 2\n    print(f\"Number of geometric isomers: {num_geometric_isomers}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine if the geometric isomers are chiral.\n    # Both geometric isomers of the type [M(AA)2(BC)] lack improper rotation axes\n    # (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).
