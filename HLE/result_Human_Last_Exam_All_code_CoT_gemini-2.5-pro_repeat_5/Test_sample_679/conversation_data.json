    "This is a chemical structure elucidation problem. I will solve it by systematically analyzing the provided data.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C7H14):** I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to determine if the compound contains rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** Compare the number of signals (6) to the number of carbon atoms (7) to check for molecular symmetry.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** Use the chemical shift values (e.g., 145, 112 ppm) to identify the types of carbons present (e.g., alkene, alkane).\n    *   **Multiplicities (s, t, d, q):** Use the splitting patterns (singlet, triplet, doublet, quartet) to determine the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (>C, -CH₂, -CH, -CH₃).\n3.  **Deduce Structural Fragments:** Combine the information from step 2 to build a list of structural pieces of the molecule.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:** Connect the fragments in a chemically logical way to form a complete structure that matches the molecular formula.\n5.  **Verify and Name:** Check if the proposed structure is consistent with all the data. Finally, provide the correct IUPAC name for the compound. I will also show which signal corresponds to which carbon in the final structure, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the IUPAC name of C7H14 given its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Input Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', # singlet\n        112: 't', # triplet\n        48: 't', # triplet\n        27: 'd', # doublet\n        22: 'q', # quartet\n        21: 'q'  # quartet\n    }\n\n    # --- Step-by-step Deduction ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    # For a hydrocarbon CnHm, Degree of Unsaturation = (2n + 2 - m) / 2\n    # For C7H14, DBE = (2*7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1\n    print(\"The degree of unsaturation is 1.
