    # --- Step 1: Solve Question 1 ---
    # The sequence A, A, D, A, C, A, D, D, A represents the correct multiple-choice answers
    # given by the protagonist in the final round of the game show in this Oscar-winning film.
    answer1 = "Slumdog Millionaire"

    # --- Step 2: Solve Question 2 ---
    # In Soviet propaganda films, Stalin ordered that enemies ('vragi') should enter from the left.
    # In medieval diagrams of the Last Judgment, sinners or enemies of God are depicted at the bottom, in Hell.
    answer2 = "Enemies"
    first_letter2 = answer2[0]

    # --- Step 3: Solve Question 3 ---
    # "Cheshire" and "Siamese" are famous breeds of cats. The joke is that the favorite dishes
    # are "Cheshire Cat Salad" and "Siamese Cat Hotpot" for a character famous for trying to eat cats.
    # That character is the titular alien from the TV series 'Alf'.
    answer3 = "Alf"

    # --- Step 4: Solve Question 4 ---
    # The TV show 'Little Britain' (X) was removed from streaming services in Great Britain (X)
    # due to controversial content. This fits the "X was banned from showing on X" clue.
