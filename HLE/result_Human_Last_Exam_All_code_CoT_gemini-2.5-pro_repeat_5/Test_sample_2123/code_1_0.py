def solve_riddle():
    """
    This function solves a wordplay riddle based on the Russian language.

    The riddle describes a scene in Vienna with wide boulevards and asks for the
    surname of an English poet mentioned in the Russian translation. The solution
    is a pun based on phonetic similarity.

    The English poet is John Gay. His surname, "Gay," is the key to the riddle.
    In Russian, his name is written "Гей" (Gey). This sounds similar to Russian
    words that might be used to describe the boulevards, creating the wordplay.
    This is a classic literary puzzle.
    """
    # The surname of the English poet.
    poet_surname = "Gay"

    # The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation", which does not apply here.
    # Instead, I will print the resulting name clearly.
    print(poet_surname)
