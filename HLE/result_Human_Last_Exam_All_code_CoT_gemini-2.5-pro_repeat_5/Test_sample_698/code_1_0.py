# Description: This script analyzes the given Word Avalanche puzzle to find the correct answer.
# A True Avalanche requires repeating a pattern of syllables.
# The puzzle is to create an avalanche for the description: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# The avalanche must use the word "computer".

    # Choice B Analysis
    print('Evaluating Choice B: Computer: "Come poo, tern!"')
    print(" - Semantic Match: Excellent. 'Computer' is the software, 'Come poo' is the command to relieve, and a 'tern' is a type of bird.")

    # Choice C Analysis
    print('Evaluating Choice C: Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!"')
    print(" - Semantic Match: Fair. It relates to the description's theme but is less precise.")
    print(" - Phonetic Match: Poor. 'Come, pee you tur-key' does not match the syllables of 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice D Analysis
    print("Evaluating Choice D: Comb pewter computer")
    print(" - Semantic Match: None. 'Comb pewter' has no connection to the description about software and birds.")
    print(" - Phonetic Match: Excellent. 'Comb pewter' is a great phonetic match, but an avalanche must also be a pun that fits the description.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice E Analysis
    print("Evaluating Choice E: Computer needs bird relieves")
    print(" - This is a literal statement, not a pun or a word avalanche. It lacks the required syllable repetition.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Conclusion: Choice B is the only option that perfectly satisfies both the semantic (pun) requirement of the description and the phonetic repetition requirement of a true avalanche.")
