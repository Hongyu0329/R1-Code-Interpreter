def solve():
    """
    This function analyzes the graph process and determines the complexity bounds.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Analyze the update rule for a vertex's life.
        - Life loss for vertex u in step i:  ΔL_u = Σ_{v ∈ N_i(u)} min(1/d_u^i, 1/d_v^i).
    2.  Identify a key property of the process.
        - A vertex `v` with the maximum degree `Δ_max` in the current graph has `d_v >= d_u` for all its neighbors `u`.
        - Its life loss is ΔL_v = Σ_{u ∈ N(v)} min(1/d_v, 1/d_u) = Σ_{u ∈ N(v)} 1/d_v = d_v * (1/d_v) = 1.
        - This means any vertex with the current maximum degree is removed in that step.
    3.  Bound the number of steps `T`.
        - Since the maximum degree of the graph of alive vertices decreases in each step, the number of steps `T` is at most the initial maximum degree `Δ`. So, `T <= Δ`.
    4.  Establish a lower bound for `T`.
        - Construct a family of trees (called "degree-chain" trees) where the number of steps is proportional to the maximum degree. In these trees, degrees are structured as `d(v_i) = i` for `i=1..Δ`.
        - Analyzing the process on these trees shows that the number of steps `T` is approximately `Δ/2`.
    5.  Conclude the overall bound.
        - From `T <= Δ` and `T >= Δ/2`, we get `T = Θ(Δ)`.
    6.  Apply this `T = Θ(Δ)` bound to the three specific cases.
        - Case 1: Max degree Δ <= sqrt(log n).
          f_1(n) = Θ(sqrt(log n)). This is ω(log log n) and O(log^0.9 n).
          Comparing log(sqrt(log n)) = 0.5*log(log n) with log(2^sqrt(log log n)) = sqrt(log log n), we see sqrt(log n) is larger.
          This falls into category 6.
        - Case 2: Max degree Δ <= log n.
          f_2(n) = Θ(log n). This falls into category 8.
        - Case 3: Any forest. Max degree can be up to n-1.
          f_3(n) = Θ(n). This is ω(log n), so it falls into category 9.
    7.  Combine the digits for the final answer.
