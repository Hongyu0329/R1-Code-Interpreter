    "The theologian who first developed a sophisticated framework and terminology to explain how miracles, such as the virgin birth, are not so much \"against nature\" as they are \"against nature *as we know it*\" was Augustine of Hippo. He argued in works like *The City of God* that God, as the author of nature, can work within it in ways that are beyond our limited human comprehension of its laws. God does not violate the natural order He created; rather, He actualizes potentials (which Augustine sometimes called *rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons\") that He embedded within creation from the beginning. This framework could be applied to both a unique event like the virgin birth and the broader changes to the natural world and human nature that occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
