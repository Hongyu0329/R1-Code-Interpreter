    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we can use a known formula derived from the group's structure and properties of its elements.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group and Involutions:** The group is PSU(n, q) with n=4 and q=997. An involution is a non-identity element `x` such that `x^2=1`. In PSU(n,q), these elements arise from elements `g` in the special unitary group SU(n,q) where `g^2` is in the center of SU(n,q), but `g` itself is not.\n2.  **Determine the Center:** The center of SU(4, 997), Z(SU(4, 997)), has order `gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. This means the center consists of the identity matrix `I` and its negative `-I`.\n3.  **Identify Pre-images:** We need to count elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I` (and `g` is not `I` or `-I`).\n4.  **Count the Pre-images:** The number of such elements can be calculated based on conjugacy classes and centralizer sizes. The problem can be broken down into two main cases:\n    *   **Type 1:** Elements `g` such that `g^2 = I`. The number of non-central involutions is `q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Elements `g` such that `g^2 = -I`. Since q=997 is a prime of the form 4k+1, the number of such elements is `q^2(q^3+1)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The total number of these pre-images in SU(4, 997) is the sum of the counts from Type 1 and Type 2. Since each involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to a pair of elements `{g, -g}` from SU(4, 997), we must divide the total count by 2.\n6.  **The Formula:** Combining and simplifying these counts gives a final formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for `q â‰¡ 1 (mod 4)`:\n    `(q^8 - q^7 + 2*q^6 + q^4 + q^2) / 2`\n7.  **Execute Calculation:** We will use a Python script to compute this value for `q=997`. The script will show the values of each term in the formula before printing the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q=1 mod 4 is given by the formula:\n    # (q^8 - q^7 + 2*q^6 + q^4 + q^2) / 2\n    # We will calculate each term and then the final result.\n\n    q2 = q**2\n    q4 = q**4\n    q6 = q**6\n    q7 = q**7\n    q8 = q**8\n\n    numerator = q8 - q7 + 2 * q6 + q4 + q2\n    result = numerator // 2\n\n    print(\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"(q^8 - q^7 + 2*q^6 + q^4 + q^2) / 2, where q = 997.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the powers of q:\")\n    print(f\"q^2 = {q}^2 = {q2}\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = {q}^4 = {q4}\")\n    print(f\"q^6 = {q}^6 = {q6}\")\n    print(f\"q^7 = {q}^7 = {q7}\")\n    print(f\"q^8 = {q}^8 = {q8}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Plug these values into the numerator of the formula:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = q^8 - q^7 + 2*q^6 + q^4 + q^2\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = {q8} - {q7} + 2*{q6} + {q4} + {q2}\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = {numerator}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Divide by 2 to get the final answer:\")\n    print(f\"Number of involutions = {numerator} / 2\")\n    print(f\"Number of involutions = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<488623771940184841659428>>>"
