    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific historical event and battle where Ming General Mu Sheng suffered his first significant defeat during the Lam Sơn uprising in Vietnam.\n2.  I will then research the historical location of this battle.\n3.  Finally, I will map this historical location to its corresponding modern-day Vietnamese province and present this information in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's\n    first major defeat in Vietnam.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    leader = \"Lê Lợi\"\n    uprising = \"Lam Sơn uprising\"\n    year = 1425\n    battle = \"Khả Lưu - Bồ Ải\"\n    modern_province = \"Nghệ An\"\n\n    print(f\"During the {uprising}, {general} was tasked with suppressing the Vietnamese forces led by {leader}.\")\n    print(f\"In the year {year}, his army was ambushed and decisively defeated in the battle of {battle}.\")\n    print(f\"The site of this battle is located in the present-day Vietnamese province of {modern_province}.\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An>>>"
