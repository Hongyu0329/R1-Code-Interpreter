# Step 1: Analyze the function and find the eigenvalues.
# The function is g(x) = (2/pi) * K(x) * exp(x).
# The Taylor series is g(x) = c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + ...
# The first coefficient, c0, is g(0).
# We know K(0) = pi/2 and exp(0) = 1.
# So, c0 = (2/pi) * (pi/2) * 1 = 1.
#
# S_n is an n x n upper triangular Toeplitz matrix with the first row [c0, c1, ..., c_{n-1}].
# Its diagonal entries are all c0.
# The eigenvalues of S_n are its diagonal entries. So, all eigenvalues are 1.
#
# W_n is the Weyr decomposition of S_n. It has the same eigenvalues as S_n.
# So, the eigenvalues of W_n are all 1.
eigenvalues = np.ones(1) # We only need the value of the eigenvalue, which is 1.

# Step 2: Define f(n) and find the smallest n where f(n) > 10.
# f(n) is the sum of the absolute cubes of the eigenvalues of W_n.
# f(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} |lambda_i|^3 = sum_{i=1 to n} |1|^3 = n.
# We need to find the smallest integer n such that f(n) > 10.
# n > 10
# The smallest integer n satisfying this is 11.
n = 11

# Step 3: Determine the structure of W_n and find its infinity norm.
# For an upper triangular Toeplitz matrix S_n with a single eigenvalue lambda=1 and c1 != 0,
# the Weyr form W_n is a lower bidiagonal matrix with 1s on the main diagonal
# and 1s on the subdiagonal.
# For n=11, W_11 is an 11x11 matrix:
# [[1, 0, 0, ...],
#  [1, 1, 0, ...],
#  [0, 1, 1, ...],
#  ...]
# The infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
# Row 1 sum = |1| = 1
# Row 2 sum = |1| + |1| = 2
# ...
# Row 11 sum = |1| + |1| = 2
# The maximum row sum is 2.
Wn_inf_norm = 2

# Step 4: Calculate the final requested value.
final_result = n * Wn_inf_norm

# Step 5: Print the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The determined value of n is: {n}")
print(f"The infinity norm ||W_n||_inf is: {Wn_inf_norm}")
print("The final calculation is:")
print(f"{n} * {Wn_inf_norm} = {final_result}")
