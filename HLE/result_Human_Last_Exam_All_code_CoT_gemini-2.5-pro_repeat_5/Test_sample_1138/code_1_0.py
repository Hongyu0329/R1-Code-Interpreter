    print("--- Step 1: Clarifying the Premise ---")
    print("The question starts with 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)'.")
    print("This premise is confusing because 'existentially forgeable' implies a scheme is insecure, but ECDSA is designed to be secure and 'existentially UNFORGEABLE'.")
    print("We will assume this is a common typo and the question meant to ask about the properties of an 'existentially UNFORGEABLE' scheme like ECDSA.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Evaluating Each Option ---\n")

    print("Option A: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This describes the property of 'Strong Existential Unforgeability'. Secure schemes like ECDSA are designed to prevent an adversary from creating a new, valid signature even for a message they've already seen signed. The probability of doing so is negligible.")
    print("Result: Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    print("Option B: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is the core security guarantee of public-key cryptography. The security of ECDSA is based on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Recovering the secret key from public data is computationally infeasible.")
    print("Result: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    print("Option C: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: Based on our assumption of analyzing a secure (unforgeable) scheme, this is false by definition. If a scheme is unforgeable, an adversary cannot create a valid signature with non-negligible probability.")
    print("Result: Statement C is FALSE.\n")

    print("Option D: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is about message recovery. The statement is false because of the 'For all' clause. While many schemes (like ECDSA signing a hash) don't reveal the message, some signature standards are explicitly designed with message recovery as a feature.")
    print("Result: Statement D is FALSE.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Both statements A and B are true properties of ECDSA.")
    print("Since more than one option is correct, the answer is E.")
