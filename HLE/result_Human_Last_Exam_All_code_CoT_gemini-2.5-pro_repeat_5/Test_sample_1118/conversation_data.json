    "I will first research the specific 1933 self-portrait by Curt Querner to identify the object he is holding. Then, I will investigate the historical and political context of that object to understand its significance as a symbol of resistance against the Gestapo and the Nazi regime. Finally, I will present this information in a Python script that prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    context = \"Self-portrait after escaping from Gestapo\"\n    \n    # Research indicates the painting is titled \"Self-Portrait with Poppy\".\n    # The red poppy was a symbol of the Rote Frontk√§mpferbund (Red Front Fighters' League),\n    # the paramilitary organization of the Communist Party of Germany, which was banned by the Nazis.\n    symbol = \"a red poppy\"\n    \n    print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait painted after his release from Gestapo custody, {artist} holds {symbol} in his hand.\")\n    print(f\"The red poppy was a political symbol of the Communist-affiliated Red Front Fighters' League, signifying his continued resistance to the Nazi regime.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a red poppy>>>"
