# --- Setup of the scenario ---
# We are in the reference frame of mass 1.
# Mass 1 is at position (0, y1).
# Mass 2 moves along the x-axis with velocity v.
# We calculate the field at mass 1 at the moment (t=0) when mass 2 crosses the y-axis.
# All units are SI units (meters, seconds, etc.).

# Constants
c = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s
k = 1.0         # Proportionality constant for the hypothetical force law

# Parameters of the system
v = 0.5 * c      # Velocity of mass 2 (50% of the speed of light)
y1 = 1.0e9       # Perpendicular distance of mass 1 from mass 2's path in meters

# --- Step-by-step calculation based on the principles ---

# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma, for the relative motion.
gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))

# 2. Calculate the propagation time (Δt_prop) for the gravitational field.
# This is the time it takes for the field emitted from the retarded position
# to reach mass 1 at t=0.
# The formula derived from relativistic kinematics is: Δt_prop = gamma * y1 / c
delta_t_prop = gamma * y1 / c

# 3. Apply Assumption C: Field strength varies inversely with apparent propagation time.
# The equation is: F = k / Δt_prop
F = k / delta_t_prop

# --- Output the results ---
