# Define the radius of the circle
R = 500

# Let's analyze the number of vertical lines crossed.
# The result is independent of the center's position (x_c, y_c),
# as long as it meets the problem's conditions.
# Let's pick an arbitrary valid fractional part for x_c, for example 0.3.
# The integer part of x_c does not affect the calculation.
f_x = 0.3

# V_L is the number of vertical grid lines crossed by the circle.
# The formula is floor(x_c + R) - floor(x_c - R). We analyze it for the fractional part f_x.
# V_L = floor(f_x + R) - floor(f_x - R)
# With R=500 being an integer, this simplifies to:
# V_L = R + floor(f_x) - floor(f_x - R)
V_L = 500 + math.floor(f_x) - math.floor(f_x - 500)

# By the same logic, H_L, the number of horizontal lines crossed, is also constant.
f_y = 0.7 # another arbitrary valid fractional part
H_L = 500 + math.floor(f_y) - math.floor(f_y - 500)


# N_x is the total number of crossings with vertical lines. Each line is crossed twice.
N_x = 2 * V_L

# N_y is the total number of crossings with horizontal lines.
N_y = 2 * H_L

# The total number of cells crossed is the sum of all crossings.
N_cells = N_x + N_y
