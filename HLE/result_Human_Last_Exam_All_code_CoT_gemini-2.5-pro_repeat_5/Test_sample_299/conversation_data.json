    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the properties that any continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ must have. This involves checking for injectivity and monotonicity.\n2.  A key property of continuous injective functions on $\\mathbb{R}$ is that they must be strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing). I will analyze these two cases separately.\n3.  For the strictly decreasing case, I will demonstrate that it leads to a contradiction, meaning no such solutions exist.\n4.  For the strictly increasing case, I will show that solutions can be constructed. I will outline a method for this construction. The number of possible solutions can be determined by analyzing the \"degrees of freedom\" in the construction process.\n5.  This analysis will show that there is an entire family of solutions, and the size of this family (its cardinality) can be determined.\n6.  Since the task requires a coded solution, and the answer is a concept (a transfinite cardinal number) rather than a simple numerical value, I will provide a Python script that programmatically prints out the step-by-step logical argument to arrive at the solution and states the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to finding the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This program will determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function f ---\")\n    print(\"Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nProperty (a): Injectivity\")\n    print(\"If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which implies exp(x1) = exp(x2).\")\n    print(\"Since the exponential function exp(x) is one-to-one, we must have x1 = x2.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, any function f in S must be injective (one-to-one).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nProperty (b): Monotonicity\")\n    print(\"A function that is continuous and injective on the entire real line (R) must be strictly monotonic.\")\n    print(\"This means f must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Analyze the case where f is strictly decreasing ---\")\n    print(\"If f is strictly decreasing, then the composition f(f(x)) must be strictly increasing.\")\n    print(\"(If x1 < x2, then f(x1) > f(x2), and thus f(f(x1)) < f(f(x2))).
