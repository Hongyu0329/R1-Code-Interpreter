    # We established a lower bound for w_C based on L and k.
    # Let A_i be the clusters for the (k-1)-clustering, and B_j for the (k+1)-clustering.
    # For any cluster B_j, |B_j| >= L.
    # Also, B_j is the union of its disjoint intersections with the A_i clusters.
    # |B_j| = sum(|B_j intersect A_i|) for i=1 to k-1.
    # Let w_C = max(|A_i intersect B_j|).
    # Then |B_j| <= (k-1) * w_C.
    # Combining these, we get L <= (k-1) * w_C.

    # We argue that the instances in Q (which have minimum size N) will have the smallest possible k.
    # The local-max property requires k>=2. So, let's test k=2.
    k = 2

    # The overlap w_C = max(|S intersect B_j|) = max(|B_j|).
    # It is possible to construct an instance where the largest of these clusters has size L.
    # For example, with clusters of size L, L, and L. Then w_C = L.
    
    # Thus, the minimum possible value for w_C is L.
