Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations:

**Step 1: Starting Material to Product A**

*   **Reaction:** The starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene (also known as (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane), is a secondary alkyl halide. It is treated with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong and sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.
*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann Rule):** Because the base is sterically hindered, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically crowded position. In this case, the protons on the terminal methyl group are more accessible than the protons on the internal methylene group (C2). This type of elimination, which yields the less substituted alkene, is known as Hofmann elimination.
*   **Product A:** The major product is **4-phenylbut-1-ene**. The original stereocenter at C3 is lost during the formation of the double bond, so product A is achiral.

**Step 2: Product A to Product B**

*   **Reaction:** Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) undergoes hydroboration-oxidation. This involves treatment with borane in THF (BH3Â·THF), followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Regioselectivity (Anti-Markovnikov):** This two-step process results in the net addition of water across the double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene, and a hydrogen atom adds to the more substituted carbon.
*   **Product B:** The product is the primary alcohol, **4-phenylbutan-1-ol**. This product is also achiral.

**Step 3: Product B to Product C**

*   **Reaction:** Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).
*   **Mechanism:** This is a standard method for converting a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide. The reaction proceeds through an SN2 mechanism, where the hydroxyl group is converted into a good leaving group and subsequently displaced by a bromide ion.
*   **Product C:** The final product is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**Identity and Chirality of the Final Product (C)**

*   **IUPAC Name:** The systematic IUPAC name for the final product C is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.
*   **Chirality:** The final product is **achiral**. The original chiral center in the starting material was destroyed in the first elimination reaction. The subsequent reactions did not create any new chiral centers. A molecule is achiral if it does not have a chiral center (i.e., a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, no such carbon atom exists.
