    This function identifies the correct answer to the provided multiple-choice question.

    The question asks how the dissolution of ammonium sulfate aerosols enables a normally
    non-spontaneous reaction (sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation). This points to a
    catalytic effect at the aerosol-water interface that lowers the reaction's energy barrier.

    Let's analyze the choices:
    A. Plausible, but general. It describes catalysis without specifying the mechanism.
    B. Unlikely. Weakening ion pairing via hydration would likely separate the reactants.
    C. Insufficient. High concentration increases reaction rate but doesn't overcome a fundamental energy barrier.
    D. Plausible, but vague compared to other options.
    E. This is the most specific and chemically sound mechanism. The unique environment at the
       aerosol surface allows for altered ion pairing, leading to the formation of special
       'transient complexes'. These complexes can act as intermediates in a new reaction
       pathway with a lower activation energy, thus enabling the reaction. This provides the
       specific 'how' for the general statement in A.

    Therefore, E is the best answer.
