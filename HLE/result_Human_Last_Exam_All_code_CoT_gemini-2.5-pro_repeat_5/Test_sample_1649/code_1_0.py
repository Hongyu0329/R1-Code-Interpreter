    This function demonstrates that the smallest possible size of the limit is 1.
    
    The reasoning is twofold:
    1. A theorem in category theory proves the limit under these conditions is non-empty, so its size is >= 1.
    2. We can construct a simple example satisfying the conditions where the limit has exactly one element.
    
    This script implements the second part.
