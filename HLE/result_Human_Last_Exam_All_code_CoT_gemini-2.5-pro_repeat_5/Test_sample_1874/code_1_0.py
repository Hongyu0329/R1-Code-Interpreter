    print(f"The condition '|x_beta \\ x_alpha| < {omega_2}' for alpha < beta means the sequence is a non-decreasing chain under the 'almost subset' relation (subseteq^*).")
    print("The condition that no single omega_2-sized set y is 'almost above' all x_alpha means the tower is 'unbounded'.")

    print("The smallest possible length 'delta' for such an unbounded tower is known as the tower number.")

    # Step 4: Formulate the condition on delta

    print("An unbounded tower of length 'delta' can exist if and only if the cofinality of 'delta' is at least the tower number.")
    print(f"So, the condition on 'delta' is: cf(delta) >= t({omega_2}), which means cf(delta) >= {omega_3}.")

    print(f"The smallest cardinal delta satisfying cf(delta) >= {omega_3} is {omega_3} itself, because {omega_3} is a regular cardinal, so cf({omega_3}) = {omega_3}.")
    print(f"The second smallest cardinal 'delta' must be the smallest cardinal greater than {omega_3} that also satisfies the condition.")
    print(f"The successor cardinal of {omega_3} is {omega_4}. Let's check if delta = {omega_4} works.")
    print(f"The cofinality of {omega_4} is cf({omega_4}) = {omega_4}, as it is also a regular cardinal.")
    print(f"The condition cf({omega_4}) >= {omega_3} becomes {omega_4} >= {omega_3}, which is true.")
    print(f"Since {omega_4} is the smallest cardinal greater than {omega_3}, it is the second smallest cardinal for which such a tower can exist.")
