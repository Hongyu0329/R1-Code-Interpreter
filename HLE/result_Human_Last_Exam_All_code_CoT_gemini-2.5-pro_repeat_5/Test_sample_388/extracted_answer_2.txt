The pharmacist should advise Allison about the potential interaction between her Fluoxetine (an SSRI) and the aspirin in Excedrin (an NSAID). Taking these two medications together significantly increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend that Allison use a safer alternative, such as a product containing only acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), for any future headaches and advise her to consult her doctor.
