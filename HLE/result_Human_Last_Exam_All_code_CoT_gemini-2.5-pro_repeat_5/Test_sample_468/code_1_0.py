    Provides the common name and the year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.

    The common name "Fairy bees" was effectively coined in the 1996 book
    "The Forgotten Pollinators" by Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan.
    In the book, they described Perdita minima, the world's smallest bee,
    as "a fairy bee if there ever was one," popularizing this now widely used term.
