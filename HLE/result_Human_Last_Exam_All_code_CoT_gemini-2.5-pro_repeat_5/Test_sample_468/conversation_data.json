    "I will find the common name for the genus \"Perdita\" and the year it was coined. My plan is to:\n1.  Research the common name for the bee genus *Perdita*. I will consult entomological resources and guides.\n2.  Investigate the origin of this common name to find the publication and year it was first introduced or popularized. My research indicates the name \"Fairy bees\" was evocatively used in the highly influential 1996 book \"The Forgotten Pollinators.\"\n3.  Write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the final answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the common name and the year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.\n\n    The common name \"Fairy bees\" was effectively coined in the 1996 book\n    \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Stephen L.
