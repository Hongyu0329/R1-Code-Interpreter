m = 10.0  # mass of the rope in kg
l = 20.0  # length of the rope in meters
v = 5.0   # final speed of the rope in m/s

# --- Physical constant ---
g = 9.8   # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2

# --- Explanation of the formula ---

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the component of the force needed to overcome gravity
force_gravity_component = (m * g) / 2
# Calculate the component of the force needed to provide kinetic energy
force_kinetic_component = (m * v**2) / (2 * l)
# The total force is the sum of the two components
F_total = force_gravity_component + force_kinetic_component

# --- Output the result ---
