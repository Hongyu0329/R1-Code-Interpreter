    "To answer your question, we first need to break down the fundamental structures of both polysaccharides and polynucleotides.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the monomer (the basic repeating unit) for a polysaccharide.\n2.  Define the monomer for a polynucleotide.\n3.  Compare the components of these two monomers. A polysaccharide's monomer is a simple sugar (monosaccharide). A polynucleotide's monomer (a nucleotide) is more complex, containing a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n4.  Write a Python script to represent these structures and print a clear comparison. The script will highlight that a nucleotide has **3** key components while a polysaccharide monomer is just **1** type of unit (a sugar).\n5.  Based on this comparison, the script will print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef compare_biopolymers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the structures of polysaccharides and polynucleotides to determine\n    if they are structurally the same.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the structural characteristics of a polysaccharide\n    polysaccharide = {\n        \"polymer_name\": \"Polysaccharide (e.g., Starch, Cellulose)\",\n        \"monomer_name\": \"Monosaccharide\",\n        \"monomer_components_count\": 1,\n        \"monomer_components\": [\"Simple Sugar\"],\n        \"example_monomer_formula\": \"C6H12O6 (Glucose)\",\n        \"backbone_bond\": \"Glycosidic Bond\"\n    }\n\n    # Define the structural characteristics of a polynucleotide\n    polynucleotide = {\n        \"polymer_name\": \"Polynucleotide (e.g., DNA, RNA)\",\n        \"monomer_name\": \"Nucleotide\",\n        \"monomer_components_count\": 3,\n        \"monomer_components\": [\"Phosphate Group\", \"5-Carbon Sugar\", \"Nitrogenous Base\"],\n        \"example_monomer_formula\": \"C10H14N5O7P (Adenosine Monophosphate)\",\n        \"backbone_bond\": \"Phosphodiester Bond\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Structural Comparison: Polysaccharide vs. Polynucleotide ---\\n\")\n\n    # Print Polysaccharide details\n    print(f\"1.
