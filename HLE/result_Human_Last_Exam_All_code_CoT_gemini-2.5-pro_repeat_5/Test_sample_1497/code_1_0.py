def solve_violin_puzzle():
    """
    This function determines the parameter group changes for different violin playing variations.

    The variations are:
    (1) sul ponticello: Primarily changes the harmonic content of the string vibration, controlled by nu. (Group ii)
    (2) with a bridge mute: Primarily changes the body resonance profile by damping the bridge, affecting higher resonances. (Group iv)
    (3) in a room filled with helium: Primarily changes the air resonance frequency (f1) due to the higher speed of sound. (Group iii)
    (4) on the E string: Primarily changes the fundamental frequency of the open string, F. (Group i)

    For variation (2), a mute adds mass to the bridge, which lowers the resonant frequencies of the body.
    The last parameter of group iv is f2, so the direction of change for f2 is 'down'.
