    Solves the problem about the number of homeomorphism classes for a space X.

    The problem states that X is a compact connected metric space, and for some n >= 2,
    the configuration space C_n(X) is disconnected.
    C_n(X) is the set of n-tuples of distinct points from X.

    1. Let X be a space satisfying the given conditions. The question is to find the number
       of distinct homeomorphism classes for X.

    2. Consider the case where X is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
       An element of the configuration space C_n(X) is an n-tuple of distinct points.
       Since points on an interval are ordered, for any (x_1, ..., x_n) in C_n(X),
       the coordinates have a unique ordering.
       For n=2, the space C_2(X) can be partitioned into two disjoint open sets:
       U_a = {(x_1, x_2) | x_1 < x_2}
       U_b = {(x_1, x_2) | x_2 < x_1}
       Since C_2(X) is the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets, it is disconnected.
       This is true for any n >= 2. Thus, the class of spaces homeomorphic to the
       closed interval is a valid solution.

    3. Consider the case where X is NOT homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
       A key theorem in topology states that for a compact, connected metric space X,
       its second configuration space C_2(X) is connected if and only if X is not
       homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
       Furthermore, it can be shown that if C_2(X) is connected, then C_n(X) is
       connected for all n >= 2.

    4. Conclusion: The condition that 'C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2' is
       a defining characteristic of spaces homeomorphic to the closed interval.
       Therefore, any space X that satisfies the problem's condition must belong to
       this single homeomorphism class.
