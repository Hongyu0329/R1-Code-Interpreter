    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of submatrices that define the structure of a single Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix and then account for the fact that a matrix multiplication involves two such matrices.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, we will calculate the number of **diagonal submatrices**. In an HSS tree of depth `d`, the matrix is hierarchically partitioned. At the leaf level (level `d`), the diagonal blocks are stored explicitly. The number of leaf nodes in a binary tree of depth `d` is `2^d`.\n2.  Second, we will calculate the number of **off-diagonal submatrices**. For each non-leaf node in the tree, its children form a `2x2` block structure. The two off-diagonal blocks in this structure are represented in a compressed form. We need to count how many such pairs of off-diagonal blocks exist across all non-leaf levels (from level 0 to `d-1`). At any given level `l`, there are `2^l` nodes, each corresponding to `2` off-diagonal submatrices.\n3.  Third, we sum the diagonal and off-diagonal submatrices to find the total number of component submatrices in a single HSS matrix representation.\n4.  Finally, during a matrix multiplication `C = A * B`, the algorithm to construct the HSS matrix `C` needs to access the component submatrices of both `A` and `B`. Therefore, the total number of accessed submatrices is double the amount from a single matrix.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan for a tree of depth 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_multiplication_access():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two matrices represented by a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the HSS tree.\n    d = 4\n\n    # 1.
