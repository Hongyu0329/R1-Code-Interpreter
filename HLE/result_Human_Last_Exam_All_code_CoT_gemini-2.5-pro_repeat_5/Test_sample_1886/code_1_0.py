        'C': (False, "This is an inaccurate description of a function. The circumflex on 'o' (ô) does indicate a closed [o] sound, often in words from Latin, but its function is to mark a historical change (like a lost 's' in 'hôpital' or a vowel contraction in 'rôle'), which *results* in that sound. It does not simply mark any [o] from Latin."),
        'D': (True, "Historically, and still in some dialects (e.g., Belgian, Quebec French), it marks a long vowel sound."),
        'F': (False, "This describes a sociolinguistic motivation, not an orthographic function. An orthographic function is a role a symbol plays within the rules of the writing system (e.g., representing a sound, marking etymology). Prestige might have motivated the adoption of certain spellings by humanists, but it is not a systemic function of the circumflex itself."),
        'G': (True, "Marks the historical reduction of a diphthong into a single vowel, for example, Old French 'seür' became Modern French 'sûr'."),
        'H': (True, "This is its most well-known etymological function: it often indicates a sibilant (usually an 's') that has disappeared from the word, e.g., 'forêt' < 'forest', 'château' < 'chastel'."),
        'I': (True, "Indicates the contraction of two adjacent vowels that were in hiatus, e.g., Old French 'aage' became Modern French 'âge'.")
