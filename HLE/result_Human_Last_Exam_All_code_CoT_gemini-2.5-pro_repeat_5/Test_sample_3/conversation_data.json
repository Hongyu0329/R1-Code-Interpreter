    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the problem domain:** The question is about the group structure of points of finite order on elliptic curves over a specific number field, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a well-studied area in number theory.\n\n2.  **Consult known classification results:** There are complete classifications of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. We will use the known list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n3.  **List the possible non-cyclic groups:** Based on the classification theorems (e.g., by Najman, 2016), the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m|n$ and $m>1$. For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possibilities are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the order of each group:** The order of a group $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply the product $m \\times n$. We will compute this product for each group in the list.\n\n5.  **Determine the maximum order:** By comparing the orders calculated in the previous step, we can identify the largest one.\n\nThe following Python code implements steps 3 through 5 to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The calculation is based on the known classification of possible\n    torsion structures over this field.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples (m, n) representing the non-cyclic groups Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    # The structure of these groups is a known result from number theory.\n    non_cyclic_groups = []\n\n    # Add groups of the form Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, ..., 7}\n    for N in range(1, 8):\n        non_cyclic_groups.append((2, 2 * N))\n\n    # Add groups of the form Z/3Z x Z/3NZ for N in {1, 2, 3}\n    for N in range(1, 4):\n        non_cyclic_groups.append((3, 3 * N))\n\n    # Add the group Z/4Z x Z/4Z\n    non_cyclic_groups.append((4, 4))\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the maximum order and the corresponding group\n    max_order = 0\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the order for each possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of groups, calculate their orders, and find the max\n    for m, n in non_cyclic_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"Group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z has order {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest order among these non-cyclic torsion subgroups is {max_order}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
