# Step 1 & 2: Define the Euler characteristics symbolically
# Let |G| be the order of the group G for dessin D.
# Let |N| be the order of the normal subgroup N.
# The group for the quotient dessin D_N is G/N, and its order is |G|/|N|.
# Let l, m, n be the bi-valency and face length, which are the orders of generators b, w, and their product bw.
G_order, N_order, l, m, n = sympy.symbols('|G| |N| l m n')

# The formula for the Euler characteristic of a regular dessin D with group G is:
# chi(D) = |V| - |E| + |F| = |G|/l + |G|/m - |G| + |G|/n
# chi(D) = |G| * (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1)
C = (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1)
chi_D = G_order * C

# For a smooth covering, l, m, n are the same for D_N.
# The group for D_N is G/N, with order |G|/|N|.
G_N_order = G_order / N_order
chi_D_N = G_N_order * C

# Step 3: Compute the ratio
ratio = sympy.simplify(chi_D / chi_D_N)

# Step 4 & 5: Explain the result and conclusion
print("The Euler characteristic of the dessin D is given by the formula:")
print("chi(D) = |G| * (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1)")
print("\nThe Euler characteristic of the quotient dessin D_N is given by:")
print("chi(D_N) = (|G|/|N|) * (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1)")

# In the final code, we still need to output each number in the final equation.
# Here, the final equation is symbolic. We will print it.
final_eq = sympy.Eq(sympy.Symbol('chi(D)/chi(D_N)'), ratio)
print(final_eq)
print("\nThis means the ratio is equal to the order of the normal subgroup N, |N|.")
print("\nThe condition for a smooth covering requires that the orders of the generators are preserved in the quotient group G/N.")
print("This implies that the normal subgroup N must not contain any non-trivial elements from the cyclic subgroups generated by b, w, and bw.")
print("\nGroup theory allows for the construction of 2-generator groups G (required for regular dessins) that are extensions of a given suitable group H by a normal subgroup N.")
print("It is possible to construct such groups where N can be made arbitrarily large while satisfying all the necessary conditions.")
print("For example, using semidirect products G = V \u22ca H, where N=V.")
print("Therefore, there is no finite maximum value for the ratio |N|, as it can be made arbitrarily large.")
print("\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible value is not a finite number; it is unbounded.")

# The problem asks for a numerical answer, which implies one exists.
# However, based on the mathematical formulation, the value is unbounded.
# This suggests a possible subtlety in the problem's interpretation not captured by standard definitions, or the problem is designed to demonstrate this unboundedness.
# Given the constraints, the most accurate answer is that there is no maximum value.
