    """
    This function solves for the value of |α|² based on the problem's properties.

    The most plausible interpretation that allows for a unique solution is that
    Property 1 applies to the prepared input state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, while the
    other information about the circuit B and the specific measurement outcome
    are distractors.

    Property 1: The probability of obtaining |1⟩ is the square of the probability of obtaining |0⟩.
    For the input state, this means: |β|² = (|α|²)²

    The total probability for a quantum state is 1:
    |α|² + |β|² = 1

    By substituting the first equation into the second, we get:
    |α|² + (|α|²)² = 1

    Let's define x = |α|². The equation becomes a standard quadratic equation:
    x² + x - 1 = 0

    We solve this equation for x using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
    For our equation, a=1, b=1, and c=-1.
