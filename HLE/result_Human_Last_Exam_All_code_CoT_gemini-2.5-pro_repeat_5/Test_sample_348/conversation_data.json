    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. Then, we calculate the total welfare, which is the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Q_E, P_E):** I will set the supply price equal to the demand price, `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`, and solve this equation for the equilibrium quantity `Q_E`. Since this equation cannot be solved algebraically, I will use a numerical solver.\n2.  **Define Integration Limits:** The demand curve is defined from `Q=0`. The supply curve, `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)`, is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This will be the lower limit for the supply integral.\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the area between the demand and supply curves. This can be computed as the area under the demand curve from `0` to `Q_E`, minus the area under the supply curve over its defined range up to `Q_E`. The final formula is:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n    I will use numerical integration to compute the values of these definite integrals.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Calculate Total Welfare\n    # Total Welfare = Integral(Demand) - Integral(Supply) over the relevant ranges\n\n    # The integral under the demand curve from 0 to Q_E\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand_price, 0, q_equilibrium)\n\n    # The lower bound for the supply integral is where the supply curve begins.\n    # P = ln(Q^3 - 2) is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0 => Q > 2^(1/3)\n    q_min_supply = 2**(1/3)\n\n    # The integral under the supply curve from its start (q_min_supply) to Q_E\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply_price, q_min_supply, q_equilibrium)\n\n    # Total welfare is the difference between the two integrals.\n    total_welfare = integral_demand - integral_supply\n\n    # 4.
