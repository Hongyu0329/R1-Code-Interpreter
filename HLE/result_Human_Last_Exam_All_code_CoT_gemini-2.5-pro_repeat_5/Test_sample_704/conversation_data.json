    "My plan is to solve this by referencing Isaac Newton's color wheel, which maps the seven colors of the visible spectrum to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale.\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** First, I need to determine the specific colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The starting color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In subtractive color mixing (like pigments or paint), yellow and blue combine to make **green**.\n    *   The ending color is simply **blue**.\n\n2.  **Map Colors to Notes:** Next, I will use the standard mapping from Newton's color circle:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   **Green -> F**\n    *   **Blue -> G**\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n\n3.  **Determine the Note for the Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range *between* green and blue. In Newton's model, each color segment is assigned a specific note. The range from green to blue encompasses the transition from the \"F\" segment to the \"G\" segment. The note that represents the upper boundary of this range, blue, is **G**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that defines this mapping in a dictionary, identifies the colors, and prints the logic and the final resulting note.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_color_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the musical note corresponding to a color range on Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping of Newton's seven spectrum colors to musical notes.\n    newton_color_music_map = {\n        'Red': 'C',\n        'Orange': 'D',\n        'Yellow': 'E',\n        'Green': 'F',\n        'Blue': 'G',\n        'Indigo': 'A',\n        'Violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the start and end colors from the problem description.\n    # The subtractive mixing of yellow and blue (like pigments) produces green.\n    start_color = 'Green'\n    end_color = 'Blue'\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding notes for the start and end of the range.\n    note_for_start_color = newton_color_music_map[start_color]\n    note_for_end_color = newton_color_music_map[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the logic and print the result.\n    # The question asks for the note corresponding to the range from Green to Blue.\n    # On Newton's circle, the note for the Blue segment is G.\n    print(f\"The colour produced by combining yellow and blue is green.\")\n    print(f\"The specified range is from '{start_color}' to '{end_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"On Newton's color circle, the color '{start_color}' is associated with the note '{note_for_start_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"The color '{end_color}' is associated with the note '{note_for_end_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe musical note corresponding to the end of this range, Blue, is: {note_for_end_color}\")\n\nsolve_newton_color_music()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
