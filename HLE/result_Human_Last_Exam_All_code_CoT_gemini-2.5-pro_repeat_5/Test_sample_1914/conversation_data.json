    "Answering this question requires a careful, step-by-step enumeration of all possible structures for a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, followed by grouping them into isomorphism classes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Basic Constraints**: A category with 2 objects (let's call them `A` and `B`) must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. With a total of 4 morphisms, this leaves 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to be placed.\n2.  **Enumerate Distributions**: We classify the possible categories based on how these two non-identity morphisms are distributed among the four possible `Hom-sets`: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`.\n3.  **Define Compositions**: For each distribution, we determine the composition rules for the morphisms. These rules must be consistent with the axioms of category theory, particularly associativity.\n4.  **Count Non-Isomorphic Categories**: We count the number of unique structures, ensuring we don't double-count categories that are isomorphic (i.e., structurally identical, just with different labels for objects and morphisms).\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total count is the sum of the counts from all non-isomorphic cases.\n\nThe problem can be divided into two main scenarios:\n*   **Disconnected Categories**: There are no morphisms between objects `A` and `B`.\n*   **Connected Categories**: There is at least one morphism between `A` and `B`.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan, calculating the number of categories for each case and summing them up to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The logic proceeds by classifying categories as either 'disconnected' or 'connected'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Disconnected Categories\")\n    print(\"No morphisms exist between the two objects A and B.\")\n    print(\"The 4 morphisms are distributed between Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B).\")\n    print(\"This includes 2 identity morphisms, leaving 2 non-identity morphisms.\")\n\n    # Subcase 1.1: 2 non-identity morphisms on object A, 0 on object B.\n    # This means Hom(A,A) has 3 morphisms, which must form a monoid of order 3.\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7.\n    count_3_1 = 7\n    print(f\"  - Case 1a: Hom(A,A) has 3 morphisms, Hom(B,B) has 1.\")\n    print(f\"    This requires Hom(A,A) to be a monoid of order 3.
