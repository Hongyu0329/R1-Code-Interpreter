    "To answer this question, we first need to understand the definitions of the two key terms:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the proportion of variation in a trait (phenotype) that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is a theoretical upper limit on how much of the trait's variance can be predicted using only genetic information from these SNPs, assuming we know their true effects.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** A PGS is a score calculated for an individual, typically by summing up their alleles at many different genetic loci, weighted by effect sizes estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability, measured by R², is the proportion of variance in the trait that the PGS can explain when applied to a *new, independent sample* (i.e., a sample not used to estimate the weights).\n\nThe core of the issue is the difference between a *theoretical limit* and a *practical implementation*. SNP heritability is the theoretical limit. A PGS is a practical implementation that attempts to approach this limit. However, the effect sizes used to build a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS with a finite sample size, not the *true* effect sizes. This estimation process introduces noise and error.\n\nBecause the PGS is built with imperfect, noisy weights, its predictive power (R²) in a new sample will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum possible (h²_SNP). The predictive ability of a PGS can only approach the SNP heritability as the size of the GWAS sample used for its creation approaches infinity, which is practically impossible.\n\nTo demonstrate this principle, the following Python code simulates the process. It defines a \"true\" heritability, then simulates a GWAS to estimate SNP effects, builds a PGS, and finally tests its predictive power, showing it to be lower than the true heritability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_vs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
