def solve_dissection_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the five-way square dissection puzzle.

    The problem asks for the smallest number of connected pieces (k) a square can be
    cut into such that these pieces can be reassembled in exactly five distinct
    (non-isomorphic) ways to form the original square.

    This is a famous problem in recreational mathematics. The solution is not found
    by computation, but through geometric insight. The minimal number of pieces
    required was found to be 6 by Wallace J. Manheimer.

    # The smallest value for k is 6.
    k = 6
    
    # The final equation is simply k = 6. We will print the number.
