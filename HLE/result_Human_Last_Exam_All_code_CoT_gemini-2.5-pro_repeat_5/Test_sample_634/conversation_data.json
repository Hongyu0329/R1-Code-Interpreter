    "Of course, I can help with that. Finding the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices can be done using the Euclidean algorithm, which is similar to Gaussian elimination.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will represent the polynomial matrices `P1` and `P2` using Python's `sympy` library, which is excellent for symbolic mathematics.\n2.  I'll form a composite matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n3.  Then, I will perform elementary row operations on `M` to reduce it to a form where the lower rows are all zeros. The elementary row operations allowed are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n4.  The remaining non-zero rows will form the GCRD matrix, `G(s)`.\n5.  The provided Python script will carry out these steps and print the resulting GCRD.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the GCRD:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial\n    matrices, P1 and P2, using the Euclidean algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given polynomial matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2] for the Euclidean algorithm.\n    # The rows of M are indexed 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    M = P1.vstack(P2)\n    print(\"\\nStarting the reduction process on the composite matrix M = [P1; P2]:\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Create a simple pivot row ---\n    # Operation: R3 -> R3 + R4 (M[2,:] -> M[2,:] + M[3,:])\n    # This creates the pivot row [-1, 1]\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + M[3, :]\n\n    # --- Step 2: First round of eliminations ---\n    # Use the new R3 = [-1, 1] as a pivot to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2 + s) * M.row(2)\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - (s**2 + 1) * M.row(2)\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] - (s + 1) * M.row(2)\n    \n    # Simplify the matrix after the operations\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Second round of eliminations ---\n    # At this point, M has rows [0, s**2], [0, -1], [-1, 1], [0, -s].\n    # We will use R2 (now [0, -1]) as the next pivot to eliminate the second element in other rows.\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2) * M.row(1)\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + M.row(1)\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] - s * M.row(1)\n\n    # Simplify the final matrix\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Extract the GCRD ---\n    # The non-zero rows of the final matrix form the GCRD.\n    gcrd_rows = [row for row in M.tolist() if not all(x == 0 for x in row)]\n    GCRD = sympy.Matrix(gcrd_rows)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final reduced matrix (with zero rows removed) is the GCRD:\")\n    sympy.pprint(GCRD)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe elements of the GCRD matrix G(s) are:\")\n    print(f\"G = [ {GCRD[0,0]}, {GCRD[0,1]} ]\")\n    print(f\"    [ {GCRD[1,0]}, {GCRD[1,1]} ]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[0, -1], [-1, 0]]>>>"
