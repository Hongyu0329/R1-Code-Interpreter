# The user wants to know what legal advice a lawyer would give Lewis.
# Based on the analysis of the Sale of Goods Act and its application to the scenario,
# we have determined the most accurate legal conclusion.

# Answer A is incorrect because the goods were not fit for their stated purpose.
# Answer B is incorrect because a contract for a custom-made item to be transferred is considered a sale of goods.
# Answer C is incorrect because the contract was for a specific type of painting, not a generic one.
# Answer E is incorrect because the conditions in the Sale of Goods Act are implied by law and do not need to be expressly stated in the contract.
# Answer D is correct because the painting breached the implied condition of fitness for purpose,
# entitling Lewis to reject the goods and recover the price.
