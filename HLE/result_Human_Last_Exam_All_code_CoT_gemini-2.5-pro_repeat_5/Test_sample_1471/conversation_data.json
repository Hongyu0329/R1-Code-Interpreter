    "Of course, I can help you solve this equation.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Decode the Numerals:** I will first translate the numerals from the given equation into modern Arabic numerals.\n    *   `四` is the Chinese character for 4.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋` is composed of three Babylonian cuneiform symbols for 10 (`𒌋`), so it represents 3 * 10 = 30.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` consists of two symbols for 10 (`𒌋`) and three symbols for 1 (`𒁹`), so it represents (2 * 10) + (3 * 1) = 23.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** Using the decoded numbers, the equation becomes `4 / 30 - 23`.\n3.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation along with the result.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the numbers from the equation\nnum1 = 4  # Represents the Chinese numeral '四'\nnum2 = 30 # Represents the Babylonian numeral '𒌋𒌋𒌋' (10 + 10 + 10)\nnum3 = 23 # Represents the Babylonian numeral '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' (10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1)\n\n# 2. Perform the calculation\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# 3. Print the equation in modern numbers and the result\nprint(f\"The equation in modern numbers is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-22.866666666666667>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
