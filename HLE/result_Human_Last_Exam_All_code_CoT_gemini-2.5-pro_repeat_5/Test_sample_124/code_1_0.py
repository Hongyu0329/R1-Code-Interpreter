    # Based on the analysis of probabilistic graphical models and the junction tree algorithm:
    # A is false: It's not always the most efficient, especially vs. approximate methods on high-treewidth graphs.
    # B is false: It's the opposite; it's very sensitive to high treewidth.
    # C is true: The nodes are cliques, and the algorithm manipulates their joint distributions (potentials).
    # D is false: The premise ("resilient to high treewidth") is false.
    # E is true: This is the primary limitation of the junction tree algorithm.
    # F is false: Same as D.
    # G is true: This correctly links the mechanism (joint distributions in nodes) to the drawback (impracticality for high treewidth).
    # H is false: The cost increases exponentially, not linearly.
    # I is true: The complexity is exponential in the size of the largest clique.
    # J is false: The cost is highly dependent on the clique size.
    # L is true: This is a correct definition of the running intersection property.
