    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core with three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments in the central core and in a single substituent arm.\n2.  **Count Peaks from the Central Core and Linkers:**\n    *   Identify the signals from the methyl groups on the central benzene ring.\n    *   Identify the signals from the methylene (-CH2-) groups that link the central ring to the substituents. We must consider the effect of the molecule's overall chirality on these protons.\n3.  **Count Peaks from One Substituent Arm:**\n    *   Analyze one of the `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` groups.\n    *   This group is a rigid, chiral structure. We will count every proton that is in a unique chemical environment.\n4.  **Sum the Peaks:** Add the number of peaks from the core/linkers and the substituent arm to get the total.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this logic to calculate the total number of peaks.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for\n    1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    based on chemical equivalence and molecular symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the molecule to determine the number of non-equivalent proton signals...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Part 1: Central Core (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene) and Linkers (-CH2-)\n    # The molecule has C3 symmetry, making the three arms equivalent.\n    \n    # The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) are equivalent.\n    mesityl_methyl_peaks = 1\n    \n    # The three -CH2- linker groups are equivalent.
