    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step explanation of the metabolic pathway followed by the Python code to demonstrate the outcome.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Trace the Labeled Carbons in Glucose:** We start with a glucose molecule where carbons at position 1 and position 4 are the heavy isotope, ¹³C.\n2.  **Follow through Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. We will track the position of the ¹³C labels through this process.\n    *   Glucose (C1-C6) is converted to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\n    *   Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two different 3-carbon molecules: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, from C1-C3) and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P, from C4-C6).\n    *   DHAP is then converted into G3P.\n    *   This results in two molecules of G3P, which are then converted to two molecules of pyruvate.\n3.  **Analyze the Decarboxylation Step:** No CO₂ is released during glycolysis itself. The first step where CO₂ is released is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This reaction removes the C1 carbon (the carboxyl group) of pyruvate as CO₂.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** By tracking which pyruvate molecule contains a ¹³C label at the C1 position, we can determine how many labeled CO₂ molecules are released.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will programmatically follow these steps to provide a clear demonstration and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_decarboxylation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation to find the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the initial labeled glucose molecule.\n    # Carbons are numbered 1 through 6.
