def solve_functor_problem():
    """
    This function solves for the value of n based on the properties of the functor F.

    The problem statement contains seemingly contradictory information:
    1. F is a "tame functor", which in many contexts implies infinite projective dimension.
    2. The existence of an exact "discretizing" functor f^k implies that F has a finite projective dimension.

    To resolve this, we must consider a context where tame representation type coexists with
    a universal bound on projective dimension. A prominent example is the theory of
    cluster-tilted algebras, which are tame and are known to have a global dimension of at most 2.
    
    This implies that any representation F in such a category has a projective dimension of at most 2.
    Therefore, F is 2-resolvable. We conclude that n=2.
