    # The key observation is "the outer portions of the weld pool flow inwards".
    # Let's evaluate the candidate forces:

    print("\nA. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Driven Flow):")
    print("   - This force is caused by a gradient (a change) in surface tension across the weld pool surface.")
    print("   - Surface tension is highly dependent on temperature and the presence of surface-active elements (like sulfur and oxygen).")
    print("   - In stainless steels, these elements cause the surface tension to be higher in the hot center of the pool than at the cooler edges.")
    print("   - Fluid on the surface is pulled from the region of lower surface tension (the cooler outer portions) to the region of higher surface tension (the hotter center).")
    print("   - This results in the observed inward flow, which is a classic sign of the Marangoni effect.")

    print("\nB, C. Arc Drag and Arc Pressure Forces:")
    print("   - The pressure and shear from the plasma jet (arc) tend to depress the center of the pool and push the molten metal outwards, not inwards.")

    print("\nD. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force:")
    print("   - This force is generated by the interaction of the welding current with its own magnetic field. It creates an inward and downward 'pinch' effect.")
    print("   - While it drives fluid down in the center and contributes to a deep weld, the specific phenomenon of *surface fluid* flowing inwards from the edge is primarily driven by surface tension gradients.")

    print("\nE. Buoyancy Force:")
    print("   - This force is due to density differences caused by temperature gradients. It is generally considered a much weaker force in welding compared to the Marangoni and Lorentz forces.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The described inward flow from the cooler edges to the hotter center on the surface of the weld pool is the defining characteristic of the Marangoni effect in steels containing surface-active elements.")
