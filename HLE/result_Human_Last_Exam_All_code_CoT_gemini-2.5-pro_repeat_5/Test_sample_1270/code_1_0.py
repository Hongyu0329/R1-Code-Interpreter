# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" suggests a chemical structure
# based on a benzene ring and the three-pointed star of the Mercedes-Benz logo.

# 1. A benzene ring has a fixed number of carbon atoms.
carbons_in_benzene_ring = 6

# 2. The three-pointed star suggests three identical substituents on the ring.
number_of_substituents = 3

# 3. Assuming the simplest carbon-based substituent, the methyl group (-CH3),
#    each substituent adds one carbon atom.
carbons_per_substituent = 1

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbons.
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene_ring + (number_of_substituents * carbons_per_substituent)

# Print the explanation and the final equation
print("The calculation is based on a benzene ring with three methyl groups attached.")
print("Number of carbons in a benzene ring: 6")

print(f"The final equation is: {carbons_in_benzene_ring} + {number_of_substituents * carbons_per_substituent} = {total_carbons}")
