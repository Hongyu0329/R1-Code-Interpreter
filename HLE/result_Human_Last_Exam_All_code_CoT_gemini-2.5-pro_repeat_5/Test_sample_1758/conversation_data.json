    "This task requires us to apply the known phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish to an English borrowing, \"shock absorber\". We need to determine how the sounds and structure of the English phrase would be adapted by a typical speaker from Puerto Rico.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze \"shock\"**:\n    *   The English \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/) does not exist in Spanish. It is most commonly adapted as the \"ch\" sound (/tʃ/).\n    *   The English vowel /ɑ/ (as in \"hot\") will be mapped to the closest Spanish vowel, which is /o/.\n    *   To fit Spanish word structure (which disfavors ending in a hard 'k' sound), the borrowing is often adapted with a final vowel, making it `choque`.\n    *   Therefore, \"shock\" becomes phonetically `['tʃo.ke]`.\n\n2.  **Analyze \"absorber\"**:\n    *   **Initial `abs-`**: In Caribbean Spanish, syllable-final consonants are often weakened. The `/b/` in the `abs-` cluster is typically elided (dropped), and the `/s/` is aspirated, sounding like a soft English 'h'. So, `abs-` becomes `[ah]`.\n    *   **Middle `-sor-`**: The `/s/` here is at the beginning of a syllable, so it is pronounced clearly as `[s]`. The English `/ɔːr/` sound maps to the Spanish `[oɾ]`, with the `r` being a standard Spanish tap, `[ɾ]`.\n    *   **Final `-ber`**: The `b` sound, now between vowels (or vowel-like sounds), is softened to a voiced bilabial fricative, `[β]`. The most distinct feature for the final part is the lateralization of `/r/`, where the `r` sound at the end of a syllable or word is pronounced as an `[l]`. This is a hallmark of Puerto Rican Spanish. The unstressed vowel sound becomes `[e]`. So, `-ber` becomes `[βel]`.\n    *   **Stress**: The stress in the borrowed word naturally falls on the final syllable, `[bel]`, which is consistent with Spanish stress rules for words ending in `-l`.\n    *   Therefore, \"absorber\" becomes phonetically `[ah.soɾ.ˈβel]`.\n\n3.  **Combine and Format**: We will combine the two transcribed parts into a single string and present it using a Python script that clearly shows how the final result is constructed from its components.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_shock_absorber():\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies Puerto Rican Spanish phonological rules to transcribe\n    the English phrase \"shock absorber\" and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Transcription of \"shock\"\n    # English /ʃ/ (sh) -> Spanish /tʃ/ (ch)\n    # The word is adapted to Spanish phonotactics as 'choque'.\n    shock_transcription = \"['tʃo.ke]\"\n\n    # Part 2: Transcription of \"absorber\"\n    # Initial 'abs-' -> /s/ aspiration -> [ah]\n    # Intervocalic 'b' -> fricative [β]\n    # Final 'r' -> lateralization -> [l]\n    # Stress shifts to the final syllable.\n    absorber_transcription = \"[ah.soɾ.ˈβel]\"\n\n    # Combine the parts to form the final transcription\n    final_transcription = f\"{shock_transcription} {absorber_transcription}\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"This script applies Puerto Rican Spanish phonology to 'shock absorber'.\")\n    print(\"\\n1. 'Shock' is adapted to 'choque':\")\n    print(f\"   Phonetic transcription: {shock_transcription}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2. 'Absorber' is adapted based on key dialectal features:\")\n    print(\"   - Aspiration of syllable-final /s/: 'abs-' -> [ah]\")\n    print(\"   - Lateralization of final /r/: '-er' -> [el]\")\n    print(f\"   Phonetic transcription: {absorber_transcription}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Final combined transcription:\")\n    print(f\"{shock_transcription} + {absorber_transcription} = {final_transcription}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n\ntranscribe_shock_absorber()\nprint(\"<<<['tʃo.ke] [ah.soɾ.ˈβel]>>>\")\n```"
