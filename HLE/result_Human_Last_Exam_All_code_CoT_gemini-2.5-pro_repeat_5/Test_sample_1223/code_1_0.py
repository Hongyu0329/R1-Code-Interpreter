    # The problem is to find the maximum number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder
    # of X \ {x}. A theorem by Bellamy allows this remainder to be any continuum K.
    # To maximize the number of composants, we choose K to be an indecomposable
    # continuum where the number of composants equals its cardinality.
    # A canonical example is the remainder of the half-line, beta[0,inf) \ [0,inf).

    # Step 1: Define the base cardinal, Aleph-nought (aleph_0), which is the
    # cardinality of the set of natural numbers. We use a string for clarity.

    # Step 3: The maximum number of composants is 2^c. This is the cardinality
    # of the chosen remainder and also its number of composants.
    final_base = base_cardinal_val
    final_exponent = c_symbol

    # Step 4: Print the final equation, showing all the components.
    # The final answer is 2^c, which expands to 2^(2^aleph_0).

    print("The final equation, expressed in terms of the base cardinal aleph_0, is:")

    # Final Equation: 2^c = 2^(2^aleph_0)
