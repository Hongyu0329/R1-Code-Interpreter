    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **State the constants:** We need the value for the Bohr radius (radius of the first Bohr orbit, `r₁`) and the reduced Planck constant (`ħ`).\n2.  **Use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`) using the formula `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`, where `Δx` is the given uncertainty in position.\n3.  **Calculate Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit:** The momentum (`p`) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`) is given by the Bohr model's quantization of angular momentum: `p = ħ / r₁`.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Find the ratio `Δp / p`. Notice that `ħ` cancels out, simplifying the final calculation to `ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to define the constants, perform the calculations, and print the final ratio along with the intermediate values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum to its momentum\n    in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    # Bohr radius (r1) in meters\n    bohr_radius = 5.29177e-11\n    # Reduced Planck constant (h-bar) in J·s\n    hbar = 1.05457e-34\n    # Given uncertainty in position (delta_x) in picometers\n    delta_x_pm = 10\n    # Convert delta_x from picometers to meters\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n    # delta_p * delta_x >= hbar / 2\n    # We use the minimum uncertainty: delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n    delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit\n    # From Bohr's model, Angular Momentum L = p * r = n * hbar.
