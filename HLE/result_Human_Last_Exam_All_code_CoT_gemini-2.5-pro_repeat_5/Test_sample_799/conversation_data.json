    "This is a problem from mathematical analysis, specifically in the area of fractal geometry and combinatorial number theory. The answer is not found by a direct computation but by citing established mathematical theorems.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Define a Sidon Set:** First, I'll clarify what a Sidon set of real numbers is. A set $S$ is a Sidon set if for any four elements $a, b, c, d$ in $S$, the equality $a+b = c+d$ implies that the pair $\\{a, b\\}$ is the same as the pair $\\{c, d\\}$.\n2.  **Explain Hausdorff Dimension:** This is a concept that generalizes our usual notion of dimension to complex sets, like fractals. It quantifies how densely a set occupies the space it's in.\n3.  **State the Relevant Theorems:** The solution to this problem relies on two key results from mathematical literature:\n    *   An **upper bound**: A theorem establishes that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in the reals cannot exceed a certain value. This value is known to be 1/2. This result is attributed to Jean-Pierre Kahane.\n    *   A **lower bound**: A separate result shows that it is possible to construct a Sidon set that actually achieves this maximum possible dimension. A construction by Steve Astels in 2000 demonstrated the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1/2.\n4.  **Conclusion:** By combining the upper bound (it can't be more than 1/2) and the lower bound (it can be 1/2), we can conclude that the maximum Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that presents this explanation and prints the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_sidon_hausdorff_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the solution to the problem of finding the\n    maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: What is the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1?\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-Step Explanation ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
