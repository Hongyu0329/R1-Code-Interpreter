    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS), we need to understand how the 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions x, y, and one spectral dimension λ) is encoded onto a 2D detector.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Goal of CTIS:** The goal is to capture a 3D data cube (x, y, λ) using a single 2D snapshot.\n2.  **Explain the Role of Diffraction Gratings:** Gratings disperse light by wavelength, creating multiple copies of the input scene on the detector. These dispersed copies act as the \"projections\" needed for the tomographic reconstruction.\n3.  **Analyze a 1D Grating:** A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis. This means it convolves the spectral information (λ) with only one of the spatial dimensions (e.g., x). The other spatial dimension (y) is not spectrally dispersed. This creates an ill-posed problem, as there isn't enough information to uniquely separate the three variables (x, y, λ) during reconstruction.\n4.  **Analyze a 2D Grating System:** To uniquely encode the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector, the light must be dispersed along two non-parallel (typically orthogonal) axes. This ensures that both spatial dimensions (x and y) are multiplexed with the spectral dimension (λ), providing a set of projections with sufficient angular diversity for a stable reconstruction. This requires the functionality of two gratings.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The minimum functional requirement is two gratings (or two dispersion axes). These can be physically implemented as two separate 1D gratings or as a single, monolithic 2D \"crossed\" grating, but the underlying principle requires two.\n\nThe following Python code will print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for Computed Tomography\n    Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a 2D image.\n    # This requires tomographic reconstruction from multiple projections.\n    # The diffraction gratings create these projections.\n\n    # Case 1: Using one 1D diffraction grating.\n    # A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis.\n    # This mixes spectral information with only one spatial dimension.\n    # This is not enough information to uniquely reconstruct the full 3D data cube.\n    # It leads to an ill-posed mathematical problem.\n    num_gratings_1d = 1\n    is_sufficient_1d = False\n\n    # Case 2: Using two orthogonal 1D diffraction gratings.\n    # To solve the problem, we need to disperse light along two different axes.\n    # This is achieved by using two gratings, typically oriented at 90 degrees to each other.\n    # One grating disperses along x, the other along y.\n    # This multiplexes both spatial dimensions with the spectral dimension, providing\n    # sufficient information for a stable tomographic reconstruction.\n    # Note: These two gratings can be fabricated as a single physical component\n    # called a \"2D crossed grating\", but functionally, it provides two axes of dispersion.\n    num_gratings_2d = 2\n    is_sufficient_2d = True\n\n    # The question asks for the minimum number necessary to construct the volume.\n    # Since 1 is not sufficient and 2 is, the minimum is 2.\n    minimum_number = num_gratings_2d\n\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"1.
