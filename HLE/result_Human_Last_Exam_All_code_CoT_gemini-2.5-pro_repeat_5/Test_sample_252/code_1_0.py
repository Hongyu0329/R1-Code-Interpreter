    # A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis.
    # This mixes spectral information with only one spatial dimension.

    # This is achieved by using two gratings, typically oriented at 90 degrees to each other.
    # One grating disperses along x, the other along y.
    # This multiplexes both spatial dimensions with the spectral dimension, providing
    # sufficient information for a stable tomographic reconstruction.

    # called a "2D crossed grating", but functionally, it provides two axes of dispersion.
