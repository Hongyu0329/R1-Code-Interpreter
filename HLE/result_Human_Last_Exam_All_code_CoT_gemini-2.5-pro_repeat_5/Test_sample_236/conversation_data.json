    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all knots with four or fewer crossings, determine which integer surgeries on them result in homology 3-spheres, and then count how many distinct elements these spheres represent in the homology cobordism group Θ³_H.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **List the Knots:** The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). We must also consider their mirror images if they are chiral (like the trefoil).\n2.  **Condition for Homology Sphere:** An integral p-surgery on a knot K results in a homology 3-sphere if and only if the resulting manifold has a trivial first homology group.\n    *   For the **unknot**, p-surgery yields the lens space L(p,1), which is a homology sphere if and only if `|p| = 1`.\n    *   For a **knotted knot K** with Seifert matrix V, the p-surgery manifold is a homology sphere if and only if `|det(pV - Vᵀ)| = 1`.\n3.  **Calculate Valid Surgeries:** Apply these rules to each knot to find the integer values of `p` that produce homology spheres.\n4.  **Count Distinct Elements:** Count the number of unique elements these homology spheres represent in Θ³_H. We must account for mirror images (which represent inverse elements) and elements of order 2 (which are their own inverses).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from integral surgery\n    on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines the number of elements of the homology cobordism group\")\n    print(\"that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\")\n    print(\"We also consider the mirror of the trefoil, but the figure-eight is amphichiral (its own mirror).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: The Unknot (0_1) ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the unknot (0_1)\")\n    print(\"Integer p-surgery on the unknot results in the lens space L(p,1).\")\n    print(\"The first homology group is H1(L(p,1)) = Z/|p|Z.\")\n    print(\"For this to be a homology sphere, H1 must be trivial, so we need |p| = 1.\")\n    print(\"This gives p = 1 and p = -1.\")\n    print(\"Both S^3_1(0_1) and S^3_-1(0_1) are diffeomorphic to S^3, the 3-sphere.\")\n    print(\"S^3 represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\")\n    unknot_elements = 1\n    print(f\"Contribution from the unknot: {unknot_elements} element (the identity).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Knotted Knots (Trefoil and Figure-eight) ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing knotted knots using their Seifert matrix V.\")\n    print(\"A p-surgery on a knot K results in a homology sphere if |det(p*V - V^T)| = 1.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Trefoil Knot ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the trefoil knot (3_1):\")\n    # V is a Seifert matrix for the right-handed trefoil.\n    V_trefoil = np.array([[1, 1], [0, 1]])\n    V_T_trefoil = V_trefoil.transpose()\n    # The determinant of (p*V - V^T) for the trefoil gives the polynomial p^2 - p + 1.\n    # We need |p^2 - p + 1| = 1.\n    # Case 1: p^2 - p + 1 = 1  => p(p-1) = 0 => p=0 or p=1.\n    # Case 2: p^2 - p + 1 = -1 => p^2 - p + 2 = 0 => No integer solutions.\n    print(\"The condition |det(p*V - V^T)|=1 leads to the equation |p^2 - p + 1| = 1.\")\n    print(\"This gives integer solutions p=0 and p=1.\")\n    print(\"However, p=0 surgery on a knot K is a homology sphere only if the knot determinant is +/-1.\")\n    print(\"The determinant of the trefoil is 3, so p=0 is excluded.\")\n    print(\"The only valid surgery is p=1, giving the Poincare homology sphere, P.\")\n    print(\"The mirror knot (-3_1) also yields a single element for p=1, the mirror manifold -P.\")\n    print(\"The Poincare sphere has order 2 in the group, so [P] = [-P].\")\n    trefoil_elements = 1\n    print(f\"Contribution from the trefoil knot and its mirror: {trefoil_elements} element.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Figure-eight Knot ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the figure-eight knot (4_1):\")\n    # V is a Seifert matrix for the figure-eight knot.\n    V_fig8 = np.array([[1, -1], [0, -1]])\n    V_T_fig8 = V_fig8.transpose()\n    # The determinant of (p*V - V^T) for the figure-eight gives -p^2 + 3p - 1.\n    # We need |-p^2 + 3p - 1| = 1.\n    # Case 1: -p^2 + 3p - 1 = 1 => p^2-3p+2=0 => (p-1)(p-2)=0 => p=1, 2.\n    # Case 2: -p^2 + 3p - 1 = -1 => -p^2+3p=0 => -p(p-3)=0 => p=0, 3.\n    print(\"The condition |det(p*V - V^T)|=1 leads to the equation |-p^2 + 3p - 1| = 1.\")\n    print(\"This gives integer solutions p=0, 1, 2, 3.\")\n    print(\"The determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5, so p=0 is excluded.\")\n    valid_p_values = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(f\"The valid non-zero integer surgeries are p = {valid_p_values}.\")\n    print(\"These give 3 distinct, non-trivial homology spheres: Y_1, Y_2, Y_3.\")\n    print(\"Their mirror images (-Y_1, -Y_2, -Y_3) are also representable.\")\n    print(\"These 6 elements {Y_1, -Y_1, Y_2, -Y_2, Y_3, -Y_3} are all distinct and non-trivial.\")\n    fig8_elements = 2 * len(valid_p_values)\n    print(f\"Contribution from the figure-eight knot: {fig8_elements} elements.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Final Calculation ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Final Calculation\")\n    total_elements = unknot_elements + trefoil_elements + fig8_elements\n    print(\"The total number of elements is the sum of contributions from each distinct knot type:\")\n    print(f\"{unknot_elements} (from unknot) + {trefoil_elements} (from trefoil) + {fig8_elements} (from figure-eight) = {total_elements}\")\n\n    return total_elements\n\nfinal_answer = solve_homology_cobordism()\n<<<8>>>\n```"
