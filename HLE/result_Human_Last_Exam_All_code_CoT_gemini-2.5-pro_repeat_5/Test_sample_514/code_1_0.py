Step 1: Analyze the space X
The space is X = (Q x D) U ((K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D)).
Let C be a connected subset of X. The projection of C onto the first coordinate is a connected subset of the Cantor set K.
Since K is totally disconnected, its only connected subsets are single points. This means C must be contained within a vertical line {{x_0}} x [0,1] for some fixed x_0 in K.
- If x_0 is in Q, then C is a subset of {{x_0}} x D.
- If x_0 is in K \\ Q, then C is a subset of {{x_0}} x ([0,1] \\ D).
Both D (a countable dense set) and [0,1] \\ D are totally disconnected.
Therefore, any connected set C must be a single point.
This proves that X is a totally disconnected space.

Step 2: Analyze the quotient space Y
The space Y is obtained by taking X and identifying the subset S = Q x {{1}} to a single point.
We use the theorem: A quotient of a regular, totally disconnected space by a map with closed fibers is also totally disconnected.
- X is a metric space, so it is regular. We showed X is totally disconnected.
- The map is the quotient map pi: X -> Y.
- The fibers of pi are singletons (which are closed) and the set S.
- We must check if S is closed in X. A sequence in S converging in X must have its limit in X. Let (q_n, 1) -> (x, 1), where x is in K. For (x, 1) to be in X, given that 1 is in D, x must be in Q. Therefore, any limit point of S in X must belong to S, which means S is closed in X.
The theorem applies, so Y is totally disconnected.

Step 3: Count the components
Since Y is totally disconnected, its connected components are its individual points. The number of components is the cardinality of Y, |Y|.
The number of points in Y is |X \\ S| + 1.

Step 4: Calculate the cardinality of Y
We use cardinal arithmetic.
Let |Q| = |D| = {aleph_0}.
Let |K| = |[0,1]| = {c}.

|A| = |Q x D| = {aleph_0} * {aleph_0} = {aleph_0}
|K \\ Q| = {c} - {aleph_0} = {c}
|[0,1] \\ D| = {c} - {aleph_0} = {c}
|B| = |(K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D)| = {c} * {c} = {c}

|X| = |A| + |B| = {aleph_0} + {c} = {c}
|S| = |Q x {{1}}| = {aleph_0}

The number of points in Y is |Y| = |X \\ S| + 1.
The final equation for the number of components is:
Number of components = |X| - |S| + 1
Number of components = {c} - {aleph_0} + 1
Number of components = {c} + 1
Number of components = {c}

The number of components is the cardinality of the continuum.
