    # Let m be the number of mantissa bits.
    # Let B be the exponent bias.

    # The problem is to find the minimum number of random bits to generate a
    # floating-point number in the range [0, 1]. This is equivalent to finding
    # the information content (in bits) of the set of all valid representations.
    
    # The number of bits required is log2(N), where N is the number of valid
    # floating-point representations in [0, 1].
    
    # A floating point number is V = (-1)^s * 2^(E - B) * (1 + M).
    # For V in [0, 1]:
    # 1. The sign bit 's' must be 0.
    # 2. The value 2^(E - B) * (1 + M) must be <= 1.
    
    # We count the number of valid (E, M) pairs.
    # Case 1: M > 0. This means 1 + M > 1. So, we need E < B.
    #   Number of M values = 2^m - 1.
    #   Number of E values = B (from 0 to B-1).
    #   Combinations = (2^m - 1) * B
    #
    # Case 2: M = 0. This means 1 + M = 1. So, we need E <= B.
    #   Number of M values = 1.
    #   Number of E values = B + 1 (from 0 to B).
    #   Combinations = 1 * (B + 1)
    #
    # Total number of representations N = ((2^m - 1) * B) + (B + 1)
    # N = B * 2^m - B + B + 1 = B * 2^m + 1
    
    # The number of bits required is log2(N) = log2(B * 2^m + 1).
    # For large B and m, this can be approximated:
    # log2(B * 2^m + 1) â‰ˆ log2(B * 2^m)
    #                   = log2(B) + log2(2^m)
    #                   = m + log2(B)

    # Let's illustrate with the IEEE 754 64-bit example:
    m = 52
    e = 11
    B = 1023
    
    # The exact number of bits would be log2(B * 2^m + 1)
    # Using python's math.log2:
    bits_exact = math.log2(B * (2**m) + 1)
    
    # The approximate formula is m + log2(B)
    bits_approx = m + math.log2(B)
