    "My plan is to address the user's philosophical question by generating a Python script. This approach adheres to the prompt's instructions to provide a solution in the form of code. The script will clearly define and explain two fundamental problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, while ignoring Gettier problems as requested.\n\n1.  **Problem 1: The Regress of Justification.** I will explain the infinite regress problem that arises from the \"Justification\" component. If every justification itself requires justification, we face an endless chain. I will frame this problem within the user's specified constraint that the only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" creating a dilemma where the justification is either too weak (a mere belief) or leads to a circular definition (it must be knowledge itself).\n\n2.  **Problem 2: The Necessity of the Belief Condition.** I will challenge the \"Belief\" component of JTB. I will argue that it's possible for someone to possess knowledge (i.e., reliably hold true information) without having the corresponding psychological state of conviction or belief. The classic example of the insecure student who answers correctly but lacks confidence will be used to illustrate this point.\n\nThe Python code will use `print()` statements to output these two problems as a clear, formatted explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier problems and assuming only two epistemic states:\n    Knowledge and Belief.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of Knowledge are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Problem 1: The Regress of Justification ---\n    print(\"1. The Regress of Justification\")\n    print(\"\\n   The JTB model requires a belief to be justified. The problem arises when we ask what status the justification itself has.\")\n    print(\"   Under the constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, the justification must be one or the other.\")\n    print(\"\\n   - DILEMMA:\")\n    print(\"     a) If the justification is merely a 'Belief', it seems too weak. It would mean that a 'Knowledge' claim could be supported by a justification that is itself unjustified or even false.\")\n    print(\"     b) If the justification must be 'Knowledge', the definition becomes circular and leads to an infinite regress. To know proposition 'P', you would need to know its justification 'J1'. To know 'J1', you would need to know its justification 'J2', and so on, forever.\")\n    print(\"\\n   JTB itself provides no way to stop this regress, making the 'Justification' condition problematic.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Problem 2: The Necessity of the Belief Condition ---\n    print(\"2. The Necessity of the Belief Condition\")\n    print(\"\\n   JTB asserts that for someone to know a proposition, they must believe it. This condition can be challenged.\")\n    print(\"\\n   - COUNTEREXAMPLE: The Insecure Student\")\n    print(\"     Imagine a student who has studied and learned that Paris is the capital of France. On a test, they write 'Paris' as the answer. However, they are so nervous and lacking in confidence that they feel they are just guessing and would not say they 'believe' it is the correct answer.\")\n    print(\"\\n   According to JTB, the student does not know the answer because they lack the required state of 'Belief'. Yet, intuitively, the student does know itâ€”they have successfully learned the information and can reproduce it correctly. This suggests that knowledge may not require a conscious psychological state of belief, but rather something like the reliable possession of true information.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n\n```\n<<<The Regress of Justification and the Necessity of the Belief Condition>>>"
