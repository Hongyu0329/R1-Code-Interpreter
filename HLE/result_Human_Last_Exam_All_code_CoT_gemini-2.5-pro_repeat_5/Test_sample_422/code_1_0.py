    print("\n   According to JTB, the student does not know the answer because they lack the required state of 'Belief'. Yet, intuitively, the student does know itâ€”they have successfully learned the information and can reproduce it correctly. This suggests that knowledge may not require a conscious psychological state of belief, but rather something like the reliable possession of true information.")
