    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to jam all-in with:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Poker Situation:**\n    *   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1). This is an early position, meaning you act before most players at the table. Shoving from here requires a stronger hand range because several opponents are left to act who could wake up with a monster hand.\n    *   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (16bb). This stack size is in the \"push/fold\" zone. It's generally not deep enough to raise and then fold to a 3-bet, so the best plays are to either go all-in (jam) or fold.\n    *   **Tournament Stage:** Near the money bubble. This is a critical factor. Most players will tighten up their calling ranges to avoid busting out before making the money. This \"ICM pressure\" increases your \"fold equity,\" meaning your shoves are more likely to get through without being called.\n\n2.  **Establish a Shoving Range:**\n    *   Based on standard poker strategy for this position and stack size, a typical shoving range from UTG+1 is relatively tight. A common, fundamentally sound range for 16bb in this spot is something like `88+, ATs+, KJs+, AKo`. This means any pair of 8s or better, Ace-Ten suited or better, King-Jack suited or better, and Ace-King offsuit.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices Against the Range:**\n    *   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This hand is not in the `KJs+` range. It's a decent hand, but generally too weak to shove from early position as it can be dominated by many hands that will call you.\n    *   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** This hand is in the `88+` range. It's a strong pair and a standard, profitable shove in this scenario.\n    *   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** This hand is often considered slightly too weak. While some looser charts might include it, it's a borderline decision at best, and many players would fold it given the early position and bubble pressure. It's weaker than `AKo`.\n    *   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand and is at the top of any standard shoving range. It dominates most other hands and has excellent equity even when called. This is a mandatory, clear-cut shove.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   Both 99 and AKo are correct shoves according to standard strategy. However, multiple-choice questions often look for the *best* or most unambiguous answer.\n    *   AKo is a stronger hand than 99 overall. It will always be included in any reasonable shoving range for this spot, no matter how tight. While 99 is also a standard shove, AKo is a premier, top-tier holding. Given the choice, AKo is the most powerful and non-debatable shove.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the best course of action.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
