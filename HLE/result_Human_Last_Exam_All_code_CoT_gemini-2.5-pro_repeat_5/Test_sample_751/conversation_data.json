    "To solve this problem, we will reduce the given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The main steps are:\n\n1.  **Understand Duality and Canonical Forms**: The problem of finding the observer canonical form for a system (A, C) is dual to finding the controller canonical form for the system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). The structure of these canonical forms depends on the system's observability/controllability indices.\n\n2.  **Determine Observability Indices**: For a multi-output system, we need to find the observability indices (µ₁, µ₂, ...). These indices determine the structure of the canonical form. We find them by checking the linear independence of the rows of the observability matrix, taken in a specific order:\n    - Rows from C: c₁, c₂\n    - Rows from CA: c₁A, c₂A\n    - ... and so on, until we have n=3 linearly independent vectors.\n\n3.  **Construct the Canonical Matrix C**: Once the observability indices (µ₁, µ₂) are known, the new matrix `C_o` in the Luenberger observer canonical form has a specific, defined structure. This structure has ones at positions corresponding to the start of each observability chain in the transformed state vector.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python code will first calculate the vectors needed (c₁, c₂, c₁A) and verify their linear independence to find the indices. Then, it will construct and print the resulting canonical matrix `C_o`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n              [2, 1, 1],\n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\n# Get the dimension of the state space\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# Get the rows of C, which are the output vectors\nc1 = C[0, :]\nc2 = C[1, :]\n\nprint(\"Original system matrices:\")\nprint(\"A =\\n\", A)\nprint(\"C =\\n\", C)\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 1: Determine the observability indices (mu_1, mu_2)\n# We check for linear independence of the rows of the observability matrix\n# taken in the order: c1, c2, c1*A, c2*A, ...\n\nprint(\"Checking for linear independence to find observability indices:\")\n# Vector 1: c1\nv1 = c1\nprint(\"v1 = c1 =\", v1)\n\n# Vector 2: c2\n# Check if c2 is linearly independent of {v1}\n# Since v1 and c2 are not scalar multiples, they are independent.\nv2 = c2\nprint(\"v2 = c2 =\", v2)\n\n# Vector 3: c1*A\n# We need to find a third vector to form a basis for R^3\nv3 = c1 @ A\nprint(\"v3 = c1*A =\", v3)\n\n# Check if {v1, v2, v3} are linearly independent by checking the determinant\n# of the matrix formed by these vectors.\nM = np.vstack([v1, v2, v3])\ndet_M = np.linalg.det(M)\n\nprint(\"\\nMatrix of vectors to test for independence:\")\nprint(\"M =\\n\", M)\nprint(\"Determinant of M =\", det_M)\n\nif abs(det_M) > 1e-9:\n    print(\"\\nThe vectors are linearly independent.\")\n    # We found 3 independent vectors.\n    # We used c1 and c1*A from the first output's chain.\n    mu1 = 2\n    # We used c2 from the second output's chain.\n    mu2 = 1\n    print(f\"The observability indices are mu_1 = {mu1} and mu_2 = {mu2}.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The vectors are linearly dependent.
