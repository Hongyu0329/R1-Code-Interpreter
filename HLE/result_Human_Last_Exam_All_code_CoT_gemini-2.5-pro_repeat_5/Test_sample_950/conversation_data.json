    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\n2.  **Identify the object of study**: We are interested in the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i \\ge 0} H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each individual cohomology group $H^i$.\n\n3.  **Find the structure of the cohomology groups**: Instead of computing from first principles, which is very complex, I will use known results from algebraic topology regarding the structure of these groups. The integral cohomology of real Grassmannians has been fully computed. According to results (for example, by A. Kozlowski, and presented in papers by other authors like Korbaš and Lörinc), the only torsion present is 2-torsion (meaning elements of order 2).\n\n4.  **Determine the specific torsion subgroups**: For $Gr(3, 5)$, the cohomology groups that contain non-trivial torsion are $H^2$, $H^3$, and $H^4$. In each of these cases, the torsion subgroup is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. All other cohomology groups are torsion-free.\n\n5.  **Construct the total torsion subgroup**: The total torsion subgroup, let's call it $T$, is the direct sum of these individual torsion parts. Therefore, $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This forms the \"final equation\" describing the group structure.\n\n6.  **Calculate the rank**: The term \"rank\" for a finite abelian group typically refers to the minimum number of generators. For a group that is a direct sum of cyclic groups, this is simply the number of summands. In this case, for $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the rank is 3.\n\n7.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to present this information, construct the final description of the torsion subgroup, and print the required numbers and the final rank.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cohomology_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral\n    cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is the\n    Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of H*(Gr(3, 5); Z).\n    # From established results in algebraic topology, we know the additive\n    # structure of the integral cohomology groups for this space.\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the cohomology groups with non-trivial torsion.\n    # For Gr(3, 5), these are H^2, H^3, and H^4.\n    torsion_components = {\n        2: \"Z_2\",\n        3: \"Z_2\",\n        4: \"Z_2\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: The total torsion subgroup T is the direct sum of these parts.\n    # We form the equation describing the structure of T.\n    equation_rhs = \" \\u2295 \".join(torsion_components.values())\n    equation = f\"T = {equation_rhs}\"\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the numbers in the final equation as requested.\n    # The equation T = Z_2 \\u2295 Z_2 \\u2295 Z_2 involves the number 2, which is\n    # the order of each cyclic group component.\n    numbers_in_equation = [2, 2, 2]\n\n    # Step 4: The rank of this group is the number of its direct summands.\n    rank = len(torsion_components)\n\n    print(\"The space is the Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).
