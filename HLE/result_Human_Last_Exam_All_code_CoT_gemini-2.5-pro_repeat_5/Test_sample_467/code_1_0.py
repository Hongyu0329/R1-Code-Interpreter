# Define the parameters based on the problem description.

# d is the degree of the Gauss map g(z) = z/(z^3+2).
# The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 3.
# The degree of the map is the maximum of these two values.
d = 3

# k is the number of ends of the surface.
# The surface is conformally equivalent to C, which means it has one end.
k = 1

# Calculate the Morse index using the Fujimoto formula: Ind(M) = 2d - k - 1.
index = 2 * d - k - 1

# Print the calculation, showing each number in the final equation.
