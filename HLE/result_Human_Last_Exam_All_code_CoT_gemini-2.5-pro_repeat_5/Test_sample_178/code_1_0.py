    # The longest program has n=90 statements. This value fits within a
    # signed 8-bit integer (-128 to 127).

    # 2. Determine the memory required for the variable 'x' (the result).

    # within a signed 8-bit integer.

    # 3. Determine the memory for a temporary variable to handle input.
    # The standard C function getchar() returns an int to handle EOF correctly.
    # The problem specifies that an 'int' is 32 bits.

    # The minimal set of variables for the C program are n, x, and a character
    # holder. No other data structures are needed.
