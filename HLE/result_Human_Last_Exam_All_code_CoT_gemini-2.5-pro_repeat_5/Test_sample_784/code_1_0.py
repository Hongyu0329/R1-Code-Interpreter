    # The problem defines an 8-choice question with two types of answers.
    # 1. Four answers consisting of a single output token.
    # 2. Four answers consisting of more than one output token (i.e., length >= 2).

    # The number of forward passes is determined by the number of unique prefixes 
    # across all possible answers that the model must evaluate. A forward pass on a 
    # prefix gives the probability distribution for the next token.
    
    # We need to find the MINIMAL number of passes. This means we assume the most 
    # efficient structure for the multi-token answers. The most efficient structure 
    # maximizes prefix sharing.
    
    # Let's model this scenario:
    
    # Pass 1: The initial forward pass on the prompt (represented by an empty prefix).
    # This pass is required for ALL answers. It is sufficient to fully score the 
    # single-token answers. It also provides the probability for the first token of 
    # every multi-token answer.

    # For the multi-token answers, we need more passes. To minimize these, we assume:
    # a) All four have the minimum possible length (2 tokens).
    # b) All four share the same first token.
    # e.g., ("Tea", "time"), ("Tea", "cup"), ("Tea", "leaf"), ("Tea", "bag")
    # This means we only need one additional forward pass for the shared prefix ("Tea",).
    # This second pass gives us the probabilities for "time", "cup", "leaf", and "bag",
    # which is all we need to complete the scoring for the multi-token answers.
    
    pass_for_shared_prefix = 1
    
    # The total minimal number of passes is the sum of these.
