    """

    explanation = """
    Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer.

    1. Understanding the Problem
    Let κ be an infinite cardinal. We are searching for a function 'f' that maps every 2-element set of ordinals from κ⁺ (the successor cardinal of κ) to an ordinal in κ.
    The condition is that for ANY set 'x' of ordinals within κ⁺ that has the same order structure as the ordinal κ+1, the set of values f({α,β}) for pairs {α,β} from 'x' must have cardinality exactly κ.

    2. Key Mathematical Tool: The Erdos-Rado Canonization Theorem
    This problem can be resolved by applying a powerful result from set theory called the Erdos-Rado Canonization Theorem (or Canonical Ramsey Theorem). This theorem deals with how colorings of pairs behave on large sets.

    3. Statement of the Canonization Theorem
    The theorem states that for any infinite cardinal κ and any function f: [κ⁺]² -> S (where S is any set of "colors"), there exists a large subset A ⊆ κ⁺ (with cardinality |A| = κ⁺) where the function 'f' behaves in one of four "canonical" ways.

    4. The Four Canonical Forms
    For any pairs {α, β} and {γ, δ} from the canonical set A (with α < β and γ < δ), the behavior of f is one of the following:

    a) Constant: f({α, β}) is a constant value 'c'.
       Equation: f({α, β}) = c

    b) Depends on min: f({α, β}) depends only on the smallest element of the pair.
       That is, f({α, β}) = f({γ, δ}) if and only if α = γ.

    c) Depends on max: f({α, β}) depends only on the largest element of the pair.
       That is, f({α, β}) = f({γ, δ}) if and only if β = δ.

    d) Injective: f is one-to-one on the pairs from A.
       That is, f({α, β}) = f({γ, δ}) if and only if {α, β} = {γ, δ}.

    5. Analyzing the Cases for our Problem
    Our function is f: [κ⁺]² -> κ. Let A be the canonical set of size κ⁺ guaranteed by the theorem. Let's examine each case:

    - Case (d) - Injective: If f were injective on the pairs from A, the size of its image would be the number of pairs in A. The number of pairs is |[A]²|, which is the cardinality of 2-element subsets of A.
      Final Equation: |[A]²| = κ⁺
      However, the codomain of f is κ, so the image size can be at most κ. This leads to a contradiction:
      Final Equation: κ⁺ ≤ κ
      This is false for any cardinal κ. So, this case is impossible.

    - Case (a) - Constant: If f is constant on A, we can choose any subset x ⊆ A with order type κ+1 (such a set exists since |A|=κ⁺). For this set x, the image of all pairs is a single element.
      Final Equation: |f''[x]²| = 1
      Since κ is an infinite cardinal, 1 < κ. This violates the required condition |f''[x]²| = κ.

    - Case (b) - Depends on min: On the set A, f({α, β}) depends only on α. This defines a function g(α) = f({α, β}) for any β > α in A. So, we have g: A -> κ.
      We have a function 'g' mapping a set A of size κ⁺ to a set κ of size κ. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be some value c ∈ κ such that the set A' = {α ∈ A | g(α) = c} has size κ⁺.
      Now, we can choose our set x ⊆ A' with order type κ+1. For any pair {α, β} from x (with α < β), the color is f({α, β}) = g(α) = c. So f is constant on x.
      Final Equation: |f''[x]²| = 1
      This again violates the condition.

    - Case (c) - Depends on max: This case is symmetric to case (b). We can define a function h(β) = f({α, β}) and, by the same pigeonhole argument, find a large subset A' of size κ⁺ on which h is constant. Taking our set x from A', we again find that f is constant on x.
      Final Equation: |f''[x]²| = 1
      This also violates the condition.

    6. Conclusion
    For any function f: [κ⁺]² -> κ, we can always find a set x ⊆ κ⁺ of order type κ+1 where the size of the image f''[x]² is 1, which is not equal to κ. This is the logical opposite of the property required in the question.

    Therefore, such a function can never exist, regardless of the choice of the infinite cardinal κ.
