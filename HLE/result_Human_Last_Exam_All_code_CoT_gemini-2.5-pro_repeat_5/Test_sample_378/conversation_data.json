    "Here is my plan to address your request:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Query:** The user is asking for a specific year when the former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\".\n2.  **Fact-Check the Name:** I will verify the full, official name of Goodluck Jonathan. According to all public records, his name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n3.  **Identify the Name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria. It appears the query combines the names of two different Nigerian leaders.\n4.  **Formulate a Conclusion:** Since \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name, there is no record of him ever using it publicly. Therefore, a year cannot be provided because the event never occurred.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that prints a clear explanation of this finding, as a numerical answer is not possible.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query about Goodluck Jonathan\n    and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    # Factual information based on public records.\n    fact_check_statement = (\n        f\"The full name of the former Nigerian President is {person_in_question}. \"\n        f\"The name '{name_in_question}' is not part of his publicly known name.\"\n    )\n    \n    context_statement = (\n        f\"The name '{name_in_question}' is associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, \"\n        \"the first President of Nigeria.\"\n    )\n    \n    conclusion = (\n        \"Therefore, there is no record of a year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan \"\n        f\"publicly identified himself as '{name_in_question}'.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(fact_check_statement)\n    print(context_statement)\n    print(conclusion)\n\ncheck_name_and_year()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying with the name \"Azikiwe\", as it is not part of his name.>>>"
