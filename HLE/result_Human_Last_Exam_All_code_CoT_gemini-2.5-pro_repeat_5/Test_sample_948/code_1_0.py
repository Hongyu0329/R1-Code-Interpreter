def solve_fermi_hubbard_properties():
    """
    This function determines and prints the properties of a 1D Fermi-Hubbard system
    with on-site two-body losses in the infinite time limit.

    The properties are:
    1) Zero tunneling
    2) Zero particles
    3) Zero losses
    4) Spin entanglement
    5) Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations
    6) Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations

    As reasoned in the text, the final state is the vacuum, which implies
    properties 1, 2, and 3. The dynamics leading to this state favor states
    with anti-ferromagnetic correlations, making property 5 also relevant to
    the long-time behavior.
