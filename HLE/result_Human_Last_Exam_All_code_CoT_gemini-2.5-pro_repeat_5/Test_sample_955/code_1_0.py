    Solves for the grid size 'n' based on the given probability.

    The core of the problem lies in the probability equation:
    R / n^2 = 0.66
    where R is the number of reachable cells and n is the grid size.

    Rewriting the equation:
    R / n^2 = 66 / 100 = 33 / 50
    50 * R = 33 * n^2

    Since 50 and 33 are coprime, n^2 must be a multiple of 50.
    n^2 = 50 * k = 2 * 25 * k
    For n^2 to be a perfect square, k must be a multiple of 2.
    The smallest k that makes n^2 a perfect square is k=2.
    n^2 = 50 * 2 = 100
    n = 10

    This means the simplest solution for n is 10.
    Let's verify the number of reachable cells for this n.
