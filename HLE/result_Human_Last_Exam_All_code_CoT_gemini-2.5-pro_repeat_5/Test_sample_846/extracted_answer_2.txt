To be functionally accurate, the table must undergo photoisomerization. When the sun rises, the UV light in the sunlight should cause the table to change from its stable, straight *trans*-isomer shape into a bent *cis*-isomer shape. When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, the table should relax back into its straight *trans*-isomer shape.
