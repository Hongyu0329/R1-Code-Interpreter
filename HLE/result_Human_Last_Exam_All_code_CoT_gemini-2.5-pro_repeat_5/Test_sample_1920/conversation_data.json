    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor $d$**: First, we find the prime factorization of $d$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if its conductor is exactly $d$. For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi \\pmod d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the order condition**: The order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that this order must be $6$.\n\n3.  **Set up the counting problem**: The problem is now reduced to counting the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that:\n    *   Each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo a prime factor $p_i$ of $d$.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_i$, let's call it $g_i$, must divide $p_i - 1$.\n    *   $\\text{lcm}(g_1, \\dots, g_k) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Solve using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: The condition $\\text{lcm}(g_1, \\dots, g_k) = 6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ means that the set of orders $\\{g_1, \\dots, g_k\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3. Also, every $g_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    We can count the total number of tuples of characters whose orders divide 6, and then subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n    *   Let $S$ be the set of tuples where each $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is a non-trivial divisor of 6.\n    *   Let $A_2$ be the subset of $S$ where no order is divisible by 2 (i.e., all orders divide 3).\n    *   Let $A_3$ be the subset of $S$ where no order is divisible by 3 (i.e., all orders divide 2).\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is $|S| - |A_2| - |A_3| + |A_2 \\cap A_3|$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this strategy to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a set of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = {1}\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        divs.add(n)\n    return divs\n\n_phi_cache = {}\ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n in _phi_cache:\n        return _phi_cache[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        _phi_cache[1] = 1\n        return 1\n    factors = prime_factorize(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    _phi_cache[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    d_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n    g_factors = prime_factorize(g)\n\n    # Check for square-free conductor\n    if any(a > 1 for a in d_factors.values()):\n        print(\"The conductor d is not square-free.
