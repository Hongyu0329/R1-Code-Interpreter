    "To identify the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** This is a sound rule where a long vowel in a base word becomes a short (lax) vowel when it ends up in the third-to-last syllable of a longer, derived word (e.g., `sane` /seɪn/ → `sanity` /ˈsænɪti/). A key condition is that the derived word must have at least three syllables.\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:** I will examine each word from the list against this rule.\n    *   I'll check its syllable count. If it's less than three, it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   For words with three or more syllables, I'll check if they show the characteristic vowel shortening from a related base word.\n3.  **Filter the Candidates:** I will filter the list to find the word(s) that do not meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing.\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** If there are multiple candidates, I'll apply a tie-breaking rule. The word whose historical sound development is most distinct from the typical pattern of trisyllabic laxing will be chosen as the answer.\n\nI will now write a Python script to automate this analysis and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect print to a string to capture it for the final output, if needed for a specific format.\n# This approach is flexible for different output requirements.\n# However, for this task, direct printing is sufficient.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the linguistic data for each word.\n    # This data includes syllable count, the base word, vowel changes, and whether it fits the TSL pattern.\n    words_data = {\n        'southern': {\n            'syllables': 2,\n            'base_word': 'south',\n            'vowel_change': '/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': False,\n            'reason': \"Word has only 2 syllables, not 3 or more.\"\n        },\n        'derivative': {\n            'syllables': 4,\n            'base_word': 'derive',\n            'vowel_change': '/aɪ/ -> /ɪ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': True,\n            'reason': \"Long vowel in 'derive' laxes in the 3rd-to-last syllable of 'derivative'.\"\n        },\n        'serenity': {\n            'syllables': 4,\n            'base_word': 'serene',\n            'vowel_change': '/iː/ -> /ɛ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': True,\n            'reason': \"Long vowel in 'serene' laxes in the 3rd-to-last syllable of 'serenity'.\"\n        },\n        'pleasant': {\n            'syllables': 2,\n            'base_word': 'please',\n            'vowel_change': '/iː/ -> /ɛ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': False,\n            'reason': \"Word has only 2 syllables, not 3 or more.\"\n        },\n        'gratitude': {\n            'syllables': 3,\n            'base_word': 'grate',\n            'vowel_change': '/eɪ/ -> /æ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': True,\n            'reason': \"Long vowel in 'grate' laxes in the 3rd-to-last syllable of 'gratitude'.\"\n        },\n        'shadow': {\n            'syllables': 2,\n            'base_word': 'shade',\n            'vowel_change': '/eɪ/ -> /æ/',\n            'undergoes_tsl': False,\n            'reason': \"Word has only 2 syllables, not 3 or more.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Each Word ---\")\n    candidates = []\n    for word, data in words_data.items():\n        print(f\"\\nWord: {word}\")\n        # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as showing the data.\n        print(f\"  Syllables: {data['syllables']}\")\n        print(f\"  Base Word: '{data['base_word']}'\")\n        print(f\"  Vowel Change: {data['vowel_change']}\")\n        print(f\"  Undergoes Trisyllabic Laxing: {data['undergoes_tsl']}\")\n        print(f\"  Reason: {data['reason']}\")\n        if not data['undergoes_tsl']:\n            candidates.append(word)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The words that have not undergone trisyllabic laxing are: {candidates}\")\n    print(\"This is because they do not have the required three or more syllables for the rule to apply.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply a tie-breaker if there are multiple candidates.\n    final_answer = \"southern\"\n    print(\"\\nTo select a single answer, we must find the most distinct case.\")\n    print(\"While 'pleasant' and 'shadow' also haven't undergone TSL, their vowel shortening patterns are phonologically similar to true TSL examples.\")\n    print(f\"The sound change in '{final_answer}' (from 'south') is part of an older, native English pattern distinct from the Latinate-based trisyllabic laxing rule.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, 'southern' is the best answer as its development is least related to the TSL phenomenon.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {final_answer}\")\n    # The final answer format as requested by the user prompt.\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
