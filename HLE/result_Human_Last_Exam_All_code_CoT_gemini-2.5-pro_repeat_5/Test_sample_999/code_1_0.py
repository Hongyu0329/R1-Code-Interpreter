# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement about neural network quantization.
# After analyzing all five options, I have determined that statement D is incorrect.
# The primary reason for significant runtime speed-up from quantization on modern GPUs
# is the use of specialized hardware units (like Tensor Cores) that accelerate
# computations in low-precision formats (like INT8).
# Statement D claims a substantial speed-up is possible with non-uniform quantization
# while explicitly stating that these specialized INT8 kernels cannot be used.
# Non-uniform schemes require dequantization on general-purpose CUDA cores before
# computation, which adds overhead. This process would not be substantially faster
# than a native, hardware-accelerated FP16 implementation and would likely be slower.
# Therefore, statement D is the one that is not correct.
