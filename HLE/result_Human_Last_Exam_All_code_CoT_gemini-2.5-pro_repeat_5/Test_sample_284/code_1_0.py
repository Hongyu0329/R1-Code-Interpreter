# This script calculates the largest possible value of p based on a well-known
# result in harmonic analysis concerning Fourier restriction to curves.

# The problem is set in R^3 and concerns the moment curve gamma(t) = (t, t^2, t^3).
# The highest power of t in the components of the curve determines the parameter 'n'
# in the general formula. In this case, the highest power is 3, so n = 3.
n = 3

# The largest value of p for which the uniqueness property holds is given by the
# critical exponent from the theory of Fourier transforms of measures on curves.
# The formula for this critical exponent is p = n * (n + 1) / 2.

# We calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula separately.
p_numerator = n * (n + 1)
p_denominator = 2

# Calculate the final value of p.
p_value = p_numerator / p_denominator

# Print the explanation and the calculation step-by-step as requested.
