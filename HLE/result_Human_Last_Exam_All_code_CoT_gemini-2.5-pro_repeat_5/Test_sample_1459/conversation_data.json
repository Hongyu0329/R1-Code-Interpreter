    "The user wants to find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $[0,1]$ and the unit circle. I will solve this by applying a known formula from metric geometry.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Identify the spaces:** The first space is the interval $X = [0,1]$ with the standard metric. Its length is $a=1$. The second space is the unit circle $Y = S^1$. Its metric is the intrinsic (geodesic) distance. The radius of the unit circle is 1, so its circumference is $L = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi$.\n2.  **Find the relevant formula:** The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between an interval of length $a$ and a circle of circumference $L$, denoted $d_{GH}([0,a], S^1_L)$, has been calculated. A paper by Ivanov, Nikolaeva, and Turevskaya (2016), \"Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a circle and a segment,\" provides a formula that depends on the relative sizes of $a$ and $L$.\n3.  **Check the conditions:** The formula has different cases. I need to check which case applies to our parameters, $a=1$ and $L=2\\pi$. The relevant condition is whether $2a < L/2$.\n    *   $2a = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    *   $L/2 = 2\\pi / 2 = \\pi \\approx 3.14159$.\n    *   Since $2 < \\pi$, the condition $2a < L/2$ is met.\n4.  **Apply the formula:** For the case where $2a < L/2$, the formula given in the paper is $d_{GH} = L/4$.\n5.  **Calculate the result:** By substituting $L=2\\pi$ into the formula, I will find the distance.\n6.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that performs these steps: defining the parameters, checking the condition, applying the formula, and printing the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gromov_hausdorff_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]\n    and the unit circle.\n    \n    This is based on the analytical formula from the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff \n    distance between a circle and a segment\" by Ivanov, Nikolaeva, Turevskaya (2016).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
