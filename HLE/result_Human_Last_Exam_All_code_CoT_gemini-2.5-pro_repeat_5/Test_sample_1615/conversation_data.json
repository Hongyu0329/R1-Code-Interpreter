    "This problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This number is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices, so $n = 12345$.\n2.  The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n3.  The problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n4.  To determine if $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to check if there exists a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n5.  Consider the graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex that is not connected to any other vertex. This graph, $G = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$, has $n$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the added vertex is isolated.\n6.  The chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components, which are $K_{n-1}$ and $K_1$. We have $\\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1$ and $\\chi(K_1) = 1$. Thus, $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n7.  Since we have found a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires $n-1$ colors, and we know that no such graph can require more than $n-1$ colors, the maximum number of colors is $n-1$.\n8.  For $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colours needed to properly colour the vertices\n    of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # For a graph G with n vertices, chi(G) <= n.\n    # Equality holds if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the graph is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # So, chi(G) <= n - 1.\n    # We can construct a graph that achieves this bound. For example, a graph\n    # consisting of a complete graph on n-1 vertices and one isolated vertex\n    # is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of n-1.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors is n - 1.\n    \n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
