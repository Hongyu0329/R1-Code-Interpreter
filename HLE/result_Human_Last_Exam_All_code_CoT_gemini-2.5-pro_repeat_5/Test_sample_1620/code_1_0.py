    Analyzes a legal ethics scenario regarding client confidentiality
    and the public safety exception.

    # The scenario involves a lawyer, James, whose client, Eric, threatens
    # to kill his ex-wife and himself "tonight".
    # The question is whether James's subsequent disclosure of confidential
    # information to the police was professionally permissible.

    # The correct answer is determined by applying the "public safety exception"
    # to the rule of solicitor-client confidentiality. This exception allows a lawyer
    # to disclose confidential information if there is a reasonable belief of an
    # imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.

    correct_choice = 'E'

    options = {
        'A': "No, because, although there may have been a threat of death or serious bodily harm, this threat was not imminent and therefore was not the type of threat that would permit disclosure.",
        'B': "No, because a lawyer is prohibited from disclosing confidential client information regardless of the circumstances.",
        'C': "No, because, even though James may have had a reasonable belief that there was an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, James did not disclose the appropriate information.",
        'D': "Yes, because a lawyer must disclose client information, including confidential information, if such information is requested by a police agency.",
        'E': "Yes, because James reasonably believed that there was an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure was necessary to prevent the possible harm."
    }

    justification = """
    The correct answer is based on the 'public safety exception' to the duty of confidentiality.
    
    1.  **Reasonable Belief:** Eric's statement was specific and credible ("I bought a gun... going to my wife's apartment tonight").
    2.  **Imminent Threat:** The threat was for "tonight," which is clearly imminent.
    3.  **Serious Harm:** The threat was of death to two people.
    4.  **Necessary Disclosure:** Informing the police was necessary to prevent the tragedy. The information provided (names, addresses, and other locations) was all relevant to helping the police find Eric and his ex-wife to ensure their safety.
    
    Therefore, James's actions were justified and in accordance with his professional obligations.
