    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, we will use the first-order epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a cornerstone of the renormalization group theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Model and Upper Critical Dimension (`d_c`)**: The problem describes a general system undergoing a phase transition. The appropriate framework is the O(n) model, for which the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. We will assume the most common case, the Ising model, where the number of order parameter components `n = 1`.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (`ϵ`)**: The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the difference between the upper critical dimension and the spatial dimension of interest: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Formula for α**: The specific heat exponent `α` can be expressed as a series in `ϵ`. We will use the well-established first-order result for the O(n) model: `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n4.  **Calculate the Value**: We will substitute the values `d = 3`, `d_c = 4` (which gives `ϵ = 1`), and `n = 1` into the formula to calculate `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be provided to perform this calculation and print out each step of the process, ensuring all numbers in the final equation are shown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_alpha_epsilon_expansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the Ising model in d=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
