    This program solves a problem in topological group theory by logical deduction

    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of the topology.
    # Let T be a group topology on the integers (Z, +).

    # Property 1: T is 'totally bounded'.
    # A key theorem in topological groups states that a group is totally bounded if and only if
    # every open neighborhood of the identity (0 in our case) contains a subgroup of finite index.
    # The subgroups of Z are of the form nZ = {k*n | k is an integer}, for n >= 0.
    # For n > 0, the subgroup nZ has a finite index of n. The subgroup 0Z = {0} has infinite index.
    # Therefore, for T to be totally bounded, every neighborhood of 0 must contain a subgroup nZ for some n > 0.
    # This means the collection of some subgroups {nZ | n in S} forms a basis for the neighborhoods of 0.

    # Property 2: T has 'no nontrivial convergent sequences'.
    # A sequence (x_k) is nontrivial if it is not eventually constant.
    # This property means that if a sequence converges to a limit, it must be eventually constant.
    # For example, if x_k -> 0, then it must be that x_k = 0 for all k greater than some K.

    # Step 2: Combine the properties and find a test sequence.
    # Let's see if we can find a sequence that must converge in ANY totally bounded topology.
    # A sequence (x_k) converges to 0 if for any neighborhood U of 0, x_k is eventually in U.
    # Since U must contain some subgroup nZ, this means x_k must eventually be a multiple of n.

    # Consider the factorial sequence: x_k = k!
    # The sequence is x_1=1, x_2=2, x_3=6, x_4=24, ...

    # Step 3: Test the convergence of the factorial sequence.
    # Let T be any totally bounded group topology on Z. Let U be any open neighborhood of 0.
    # From Property 1, U must contain a subgroup nZ for some integer n > 0.
    # For our sequence x_k = k!, whenever k >= n, k! contains n as a factor.
    # For example, if n=4, then for k>=4, k! (4!, 5!, etc.) is a multiple of 4.
    # So, for any n > 0, the sequence (k!) is eventually in the subgroup nZ.
    # This means the sequence (k!) converges to 0 in ANY totally bounded group topology on Z.

    # Step 4: Check if the sequence is nontrivial.
    # The sequence (k!) is 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, ...
    # The terms are not eventually constant, so it is a nontrivial sequence.

    # Step 5: Conclusion.
    # We have found a nontrivial sequence (k!) that converges to 0 in every possible
    # totally bounded group topology on the integers.
    # This contradicts Property 2, which requires that there be no such sequences.
    # Therefore, no topology can satisfy both properties simultaneously.

    # The number of such topologies is 0.
