    explanation_A = "A. Transitivity: This is a fundamental conceptual requirement. It means you can make an indirect comparison (A vs C) through a common comparator (B) because the studies are similar in all important aspects besides the treatments being compared. It is absolutely necessary, but not sufficient. For instance, you could have transitivity, but the direct and indirect evidence might still contradict each other (violating consistency)."
    
    explanation_B = "B. Consistency: This is the statistical manifestation of transitivity. It means direct evidence (from A vs C trials) and indirect evidence (from A vs B and B vs C trials) agree. This is also necessary, but not sufficient. The network could be consistent but be based on flawed comparisons that violate the underlying transitivity assumption (e.g., all trials are systematically biased in the same way)."

    explanation_C = "C. Homogeneity: This assumes that the true treatment effect is the same across all studies within a specific comparison (e.g., all A vs. B trials). While desirable, this assumption is often violated. Heterogeneity is common and can be addressed with random-effects models. Therefore, homogeneity is neither strictly necessary (if modeled) nor sufficient for overall NMA validity."

    explanation_D = "D. Similarity of Effect Modifiers: This is a more detailed way of stating the transitivity assumption. Effect modifiers (like patient age or disease severity) must be distributed similarly across trials. This is necessary, but as with transitivity, it is not sufficient on its own."

    explanation_F = "F. Exchangeability: This is a broader statistical assumption, often used in Bayesian NMA, that encompasses the ideas of homogeneity and consistency. It implies that we believe all studies are estimating effects from a common distribution. It is necessary but not sufficient on its own."
