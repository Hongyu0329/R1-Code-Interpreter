    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and for a system composed of two non-interacting or weakly coupled subsystems, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. When they are connected laterally to form a junction, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\n\n-   Chern number of the first insulator, C₁ = 1\n-   Chern number of the second insulator, C₂ = 1\n-   Total Chern number of the junction, C_total = C₁ + C₂\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n# The Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the\n# Chern numbers of its constituent parts, assuming negligible interaction\n# that would alter the bulk topology.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction (C_total) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers (C1 and C2).\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
