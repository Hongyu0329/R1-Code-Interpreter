    print("   - Biotic pressure from herbivores and parasites is highest in the tropics (low latitudes) and decreases towards the poles (high latitudes).")
    print("   - To defend against a wider array of specialized enemies in the tropics, individual plants are selected to produce a more complex and diverse mixture of defensive VOCs.")

    print("2. Effect on β-diversity (VOC diversity among plants at a site):")
    print("   - In the tropics, high pressure from specialist enemies favors chemical dissimilarity among neighboring plants. This is an evolutionary strategy to avoid being easily found and consumed.")
    print("   - If all plants at a site have the same chemical profile, an adapted enemy could decimate the population. High variation (turnover) in VOC profiles among plants makes the community more resilient.")
