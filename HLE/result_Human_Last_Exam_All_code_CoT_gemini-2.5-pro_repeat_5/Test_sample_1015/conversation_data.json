    "My plan is to first understand the core principles of the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods, specifically as they apply to a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend). Then, I will evaluate each multiple-choice option to determine the most significant and defining difference between the two techniques for this specific movement.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method Analysis:** The Vaganova method, rooted in Russian classical tradition, emphasizes precision, strength, and a harmonious, expressive upper body. For a *cambré derrière*, the training focuses on a pure bend from the upper and middle back. A key rule is to maintain perfectly square and stable hips, keeping them aligned directly over the supporting legs. The movement is controlled and originates from the spine.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method Analysis:** The Balanchine method, a neoclassical American style, is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often off-balance lines. When performing a *cambré derrière* in the Balanchine style, it is common for the dancer to push the hips forward. This forward displacement of the hips serves as a counterbalance to the backward bend, allowing for a deeper, more dramatic angle and creating a visually distinct, angular line that is a hallmark of the technique.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A. Arm placement: While arm styles differ, this is not the most fundamental structural difference in the cambré itself.\n    *   B. Placement of hip: This is a core difference. Vaganova requires stable, aligned hips, while Balanchine incorporates a forward-pushed hip. This changes the entire mechanic and aesthetic of the pose.\n    *   C. Speed: Speed is a general characteristic of Balanchine's style but a cambré can be done slowly or quickly in either method depending on the exercise.\n    *   D. Degree of backbend: Dancers in both traditions strive for flexibility. The potential degree of the bend is more about the individual dancer than a rule of the method.\n    *   E. Placement of head: Head placement is specific in both, but it follows the line created by the spine and hips. The hip placement is the cause, and the head position is the effect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The most defining and widely recognized difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the use of the hips. Therefore, 'Placement of hip' is the correct answer. The Python code below will print this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the differences between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of Cambré Derrière in Vaganova vs. Balanchine Methods:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"1.
