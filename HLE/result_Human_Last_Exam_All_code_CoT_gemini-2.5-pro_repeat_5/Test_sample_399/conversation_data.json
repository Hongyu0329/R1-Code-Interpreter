    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the initial value problem and the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the ODE Type**: The given differential equation is $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. It is also a separable equation.\n2.  **Separate Variables**: Rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and rearrange the terms to have all $x$ variables on one side and all $t$ variables on the other:\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n3.  **Integrate Both Sides**: Integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    This yields:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n    where C is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Apply Initial Condition**: Use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n5.  **Find the Particular Solution**: Substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this IVP:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n6.  **Solve for x(t)**: Rearrange the equation to get an explicit formula for $x(t)$:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}{8} $$\n    $$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\n7.  **Calculate x(1)**: Substitute $t=1$ into the formula for $x(t)$ to find the final answer. The following Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# We have derived the particular solution for x(t) as:\n# x(t) = 8 / (-4t^2 + 8t - 1)\n# We need to find the value of x(1).\n\n# Set the value of t for the calculation\nt = 1\n\n# Define the components of the final equation\nnumerator = 8\ndenominator_term1 = -4 * (t**2)\ndenominator_term2 = 8 * t\ndenominator_term3 = -1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = denominator_term1 + denominator_term2 + denominator_term3\n\n# Use the Fraction class for an exact result\nresult = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n\nprint(f\"We are calculating x(1) using the formula x(t) = 8 / (-4t^2 + 8t - 1).\")\nprint(f\"First, substitute t = {t} into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / (-4*({t})^2 + 8*({t}) + ({denominator_term3}))\")\nprint(f\"Breaking down the denominator calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = {denominator_term1} + {denominator_term2} + {denominator_term3} = {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"So, the equation becomes:\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The final value is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
