    "This problem requires us to find the rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. After analyzing the examples, it becomes clear that the output value of a cell depends on its initial value and the values of its neighbors.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Hypothesize a Rule:** I'll start by hypothesizing a transformation rule. The most common type of rule for such puzzles involves the cell itself and its immediate neighbors (the Von Neumann neighborhood: North, South, East, West).\n2.  **Define the Rule:** Let's define `I(r, c)` as the value of the input cell at row `r` and column `c`. Let `S(r, c)` be the sum of the values of its four Von Neumann neighbors.\n3.  **Test Hypotheses:** I'll test several potential rules against the provided examples.\n    *   *Hypothesis A:* The output is simply the parity of the neighbor sum: `O(r, c) = S(r, c) % 2`. This often fails.\n    *   *Hypothesis B:* The output is based on flipping the input based on the neighbor sum's parity. There are two versions:\n        1.  Flip if `S` is even, keep if odd.\n        2.  Flip if `S` is odd, keep if even.\n4.  **Verify the Correct Rule:** After testing, the rule that consistently works across all examples is: The new value of a cell is its original value XORed with the parity of the sum of its neighbors. In other words, `Output = Input XOR (NeighborSum % 2)`.\n    *   This is equivalent to: if the sum of neighbors is odd, flip the cell's value. If the sum is even, keep the cell's value.\n5.  **Apply to the Test Grid:** I will apply this confirmed rule to the sixth test grid to generate the final output. I'll write a Python script to perform this calculation systematically to avoid errors. The script will:\n    a.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    b.  For each cell, calculate the sum of its four neighbors.\n    c.  Apply the rule `Output = Input XOR (NeighborSum % 2)`.\n    d.  Store the result in a new grid.\n    e.  Print the final grid.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid transformation puzzle.\n    The rule is: O(r, c) = I(r, c) XOR (S(r, c) % 2)\n    where I is the input value and S is the sum of Von Neumann neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            neighbor_sum = 0\n            # North neighbor\n            if r > 0:\n                neighbor_sum += input_grid[r - 1, c]\n            # South neighbor\n            if r < rows - 1:\n                neighbor_sum += input_grid[r + 1, c]\n            # West neighbor\n            if c > 0:\n                neighbor_sum += input_grid[r, c - 1]\n            # East neighbor\n            if c < cols - 1:\n                neighbor_sum += input_grid[r, c + 1]\n\n            # Apply the transformation rule\n            parity = neighbor_sum % 2\n            new_value = input_grid[r, c] ^ parity\n            output_grid[r, c] = new_value\n\n    # Print the output grid as a flat binary string\n    flat_string = \"\".join(map(str, output_grid.flatten()))\n    print(flat_string)\n\n# The 6th test input grid\ntest_input_grid = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_grid(test_input_grid)\n```"
