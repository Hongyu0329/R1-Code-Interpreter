    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 scheme, we need to analyze its region of absolute stability.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The boundary of the stability region for a BDF method is given by the function $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. For BDF4, the stability region is the area outside the curve traced by $z(\\theta)$.\n2.  The A($\\alpha$)-stability angle $\\alpha$ is the largest angle such that the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$ is contained within the stability region. This angle is determined by the line from the origin that is tangent to the stability boundary in the left-half plane.\n3.  The angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan(M)$, where $M$ is the maximum value of the ratio $|\\text{Im}(z(\\theta))| / (-\\text{Re}(z(\\theta)))$ for values of $\\theta$ where $\\text{Re}(z(\\theta)) < 0$.\n4.  We will express $\\text{Re}(z)$ and $\\text{Im}(z)$ in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. Finding the maximum of the ratio $M$ involves taking a derivative with respect to $c$ and setting it to zero. This leads to a polynomial equation for the optimal value of $c$, let's call it $c_0$.\n5.  The derivation shows that $c_0$ is the unique real root in the interval $(-1/3, 1)$ of the cubic equation:\n    $4c^3 + 7c^2 + 6c - 1 = 0$.\n6.  The value of $M^2 = \\tan^2(\\alpha)$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{4(1+c_0)(3c_0^2-c_0+2)^2}{(1-c_0)^3(3c_0+1)^2}$.\n7.  The following Python code will solve for $c_0$ numerically, then compute the value of $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$, and finally present the numbers that define the exact angle $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the coefficients of the cubic polynomial for c_0 = cos(theta).\n    # The equation is 4*c^3 + 7*c^2 + 6*c - 1 = 0.\n    poly_coeffs = [4, 7, 6, -1]\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the roots of the polynomial.\n    roots = np.roots(poly_coeffs)\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify the correct root c0.
