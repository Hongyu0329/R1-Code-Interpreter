    # The problem boils down to how many pieces of information (discovered monsters)
    # Turbo needs to guarantee a connected safe path from the first to the last row.

    # location of n-1 monsters. These n-1 monsters are in n-1 distinct columns.
    # To guarantee a safe path, Turbo must have enough known columns so the
    # adversary can no longer block all of them at a single boundary.
    # This happens when the number of discovered monsters is greater than the
    # number of rows available for blocking at a boundary.

    # We need to find the smallest n such that n-1 > max_monsters_to_block_a_boundary.
    # Let required_discovered_monsters = n - 1.
    # The equation is: required_discovered_monsters > 2
    # So, n - 1 > 2
    # which simplifies to n > 3.
