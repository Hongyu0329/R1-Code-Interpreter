    Analyzes meteorological data to find the single value that most inhibits tornadogenesis.
    
    In the provided dataset, the environment is extremely favorable for supercells and tornadoes,
    as indicated by high CAPE, very strong shear (SRH), and low LCL heights. However, one
    parameter stands out as a critical inhibitor.
    
    The 'Enhanced Stretching Potential' (ESP) parameter measures the environment's ability
    to stretch low-level vorticity, a key process for tornado formation. An ESP value of 0.0
    suggests this crucial mechanism is absent. Despite a powerful supercell likely forming,
    it would struggle to produce a tornado.
    
    Therefore, the ESP value is the most significant negative factor.
