    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the classical strategies of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) are extended to a continuous space of quantum strategies. By entangling the players' initial states, it's possible to achieve a new Nash Equilibrium that resolves the classic dilemma.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Model Setup**: We use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. The players' qubits are prepared in a maximally entangled state using an operator `J`. Players then apply their local strategies (unitary operators `U_A` and `U_B`). Finally, the state is disentangled by `J†` before measurement.\n2.  **Strategies**: A player's strategy `U(θ, φ)` is a unitary operator from SU(2), parameterized by two angles.\n    *   Classical Cooperate (C) corresponds to `U(0, 0)` (Identity).\n    *   Classical Defect (D) corresponds to `U(π, 0)`.\n    *   A key quantum strategy is `Q = U(0, π/2)`, often called the \"miracle move\".\n3.  **Equilibrium Analysis**: We will find a symmetric Nash Equilibrium `(S*, S*)` where neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. We'll show that `(Q, Q)` is such an equilibrium.\n4.  **Payoff Calculation**: We'll derive the payoff for one player (Alice) assuming the other (Bob) plays the quantum strategy `Q`. Then we will find the strategy for Alice that maximizes her payoff.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through the derivation of the payoff function and find the equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma to find its equilibrium point.\n\n    The analysis shows that a new Nash Equilibrium (Q, Q) emerges in the quantum game,\n    where Q is a specific quantum strategy.
