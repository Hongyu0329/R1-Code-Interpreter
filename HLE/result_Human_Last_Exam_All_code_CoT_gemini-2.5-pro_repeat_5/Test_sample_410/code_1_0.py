# Step 1: Define the function f(x) based on the derived coefficients.
# The coefficients are a_coeff = 1/4, b_coeff = 1, c_coeff = -3.
def f(x):
    return 0.25 * math.exp(2*x) + math.exp(x) - 3

# Step 2: Solve for the parameters a and b from the integral equation.
# The problem is ambiguous. We assume the parameter 'b' in the integral equation
# is the same as the coefficient 'b' of e^x in f(x), which is 1.
b = 1

# The condition derived from the integral equation is a = f(ln(b)).
# We calculate 'a' using this condition.
# Since b=1, ln(b) = ln(1) = 0.
a = f(math.log(b))

# Step 3: Calculate the sum a + b.
sum_val = a + b

# Step 4: Print the results.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is a + b.
print(f"The value of the parameter 'a' is: {a}")
print(f"The value of the parameter 'b' is: {b}")
print(f"The final sum a + b is: {a} + {b} = {sum_val}")
