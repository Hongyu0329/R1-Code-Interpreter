    explanation = """
High temperature exposure (29ºC) causes oxidative stress in Microcystis aeruginosa by increasing the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) within the cells. To counteract this, the organism activates its antioxidant defense systems.

The question asks for the 'initially activated' defense. The first line of defense against a sudden burst of ROS is the enzymatic antioxidant system. This system involves enzymes that catalyze the detoxification of ROS with high efficiency and specificity.

The key enzymes initially activated are:
1.  **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD):** This enzyme rapidly converts the highly reactive superoxide radical (O₂•−) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).
2.  **Catalase (CAT) and Ascorbate Peroxidase (APX):** These enzymes then break down the hydrogen peroxide into harmless water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂).

While other antioxidants like hydrosoluble (e.g., ascorbic acid, glutathione) and liposoluble (e.g., tocopherols, carotenoids) are crucial for the overall defense, the enzymatic system is the primary and most immediate response to be activated. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
