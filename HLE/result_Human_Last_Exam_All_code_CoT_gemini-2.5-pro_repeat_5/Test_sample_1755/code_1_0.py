    print("1. The C code uses `scanf(&ss, &c)`. The constant `ss` (0x6425) is cleverly used so that its memory address `&ss` acts as the format string `\"%d\"` on little-endian systems.")
    print("2. Therefore, the effective call is `scanf(\"%d\", &c)`. The format specifier `%d` expects the address of an integer variable.")
    print("3. However, on line 5, the variable `c` is declared as a `char`, which is only 1 byte long, whereas an `int` is typically 4 bytes.")
    print("4. This type mismatch causes `scanf` to write 4 bytes into a 1-byte memory location, resulting in a stack buffer overflow and undefined behavior. This is the critical error.")

    print("\nProposed Fix:")
    print("The smallest change is to correct the type of the variable `c` to match its usage. Changing the declaration on line 5 from `char c;` to `short int c;` fixes the memory corruption. This is a single edit on one line.")
