        'A': "Correct. Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. It competes with calcium for entry into vascular smooth muscle cells. By reducing calcium influx, magnesium promotes smooth muscle relaxation, leading to the widening of blood vessels (vasodilation). This reduces systemic vascular resistance and thereby lowers blood pressure.",
        'B': "Incorrect. While magnesium can help prevent arterial calcification over the long term, this is considered a secondary benefit for arterial stiffness rather than the primary, direct mechanism for lowering blood pressure.",
        'C': "Incorrect. Magnesium is essential for neurologic health, but there is no established primary mechanism linking it to blood pressure reduction via an increase in brain matter.",
        'D': "Incorrect. Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. An inflammatory response is generally associated with an increase, not a decrease, in blood pressure.",
        'E': "Incorrect. Magnesium is a calcium antagonist; it does not raise systemic calcium levels. High calcium would tend to increase, not lower, blood pressure."
