def solve_k_matching_complexity():
    """
    This function determines and prints the maximum integer k such that counting
    k-matchings is solvable in subcubic time in the number of vertices, based on
    current knowledge in fine-grained complexity theory.

    - Upper Bounds (Algorithms):
      - k=1, 2: Solvable in O(n^2).
      - k=3: Solvable in O(n^ω) where ω ≈ 2.373.
      - k=4, 5: Specific subcubic algorithms exist.
      - k=6: Solvable in O(n^ω) (Brand, Dell, Husfeldt 2018).
      All these are subcubic (O(n^c) for c < 3).

    - Lower Bounds (Hardness):
      - For k=7, counting k-matchings is conjectured to require n^(⌈7/3⌉ - o(1)) = n^(3 - o(1)) time
        (Björklund, Kaski, Kowalik 2019). This is not subcubic.

    The threshold where the problem transitions from being subcubic to likely requiring
    cubic time is between k=6 and k=7.
