# This script calculates the volume of the space enclosed by a cone and an ellipsoid,
# following the interpretation that this is the volume of the intersection of the two solids
# in the region y > 0.

# Based on our analysis, this volume is equivalent to the volume of the upper half of the ellipsoid.
# The ellipsoid is defined by: x^2/3 + y^2/4 + z^2/3 = 1.
# The upper half extends from y=0 to y=2.

# We calculate the volume using the disk method:
# V = integral from y_lower to y_upper of A(y) dy
# A(y) = pi * R_ellipsoid^2 = pi * (3 * (1 - y^2/4))
# V = integral from 0 to 2 of pi * (3 - (3*y^2)/4) dy

# The antiderivative of (3 - (3*y^2)/4) is 3y - y^3/4.
# We evaluate this at the integration bounds.
