# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A graph of countries and borders is a planar graph. The Four-Color Theorem states that the chromatic number of any planar graph is at most 4.
# The Asian map before 1991 was sufficiently complex to require 4 colors.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution (chi_before) was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The dissolution added new countries but the map remained a planar graph.
# The graph's complexity did not decrease, so the chromatic number remained the maximum required for a complex map.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"After the dissolution, the graph remained planar, so the chromatic number (chi_after) was still {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change delta_soviet = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine the planarity change factor, beta.
# The graph of countries was planar before and after the event. Subdividing a country preserves planarity.
# Since the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The dissolution did not change the graph's planarity, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
