    This function derives and prints the analytical solution for the density profile
    of a Mach sqrt(3) shock wave in a monatomic ideal gas with Pr = 3/4.

    The final solution is an implicit equation relating the dimensionless density
    rho' = rho / rho_0 to the dimensionless position x' = x / L.
    The origin x'=0 is defined at the point where rho' = 1.5.

    The equation has the general form:
