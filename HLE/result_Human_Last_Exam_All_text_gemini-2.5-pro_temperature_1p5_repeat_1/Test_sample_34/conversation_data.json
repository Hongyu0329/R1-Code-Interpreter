    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Scenario**\n\n*   **Hand type:** We are looking for a specific \"suited jack\" (a Jack and another card of the same suit). The possible hands are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. (AJs, KJs, and QJs are premium hands and would not be considered \"worst\").\n*   **Action:** The action is an \"open\" raise, meaning we are the first player to voluntarily enter the pot.\n*   **Position:** We are on the \"button\" (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker, as we are guaranteed to act last post-flop. This allows us to open the widest range of hands profitably.\n*   **Sizing:** The open size is 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard size that balances risk and reward, aiming to steal the blinds (1.5bb) while not risking too much if we get 3-bet.\n*   **Game Conditions:** \"100BB rake-free cash game.\"\n    *   **100BB:** This is the standard stack depth, for which pre-flop strategies are well-established.\n    *   **Rake-free:** This is a key theoretical detail. Rake is the fee taken by the house from each pot. In a real game, the rake makes it less profitable to play marginal hands. In a rake-free environment, we can play even more hands profitably because we keep 100% of every pot we win, no matter how small. This incentivizes opening a wider range than in a typical raked game.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Evaluate the Button Opening Range.** The button is the best position to steal the blinds from. Standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts recommend opening a very wide range of hands, often 40-50% or more. The goal is to frequently win the 1.5bb in the pot uncontested.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand Hand Value.** The value of a suited hand comes from two main sources:\n    1.  **High Card Value:** The ability to make strong pairs. The Jack provides good high-card value. The second card, or \"kicker,\" also contributes. A Ten is a much better kicker than a deuce.\n    2.  **Connectivity:** The ability to make straights. The closer the two cards are in rank (e.g., JTs), the higher the straight potential. As the gap between the cards increases (e.g., J8s, J5s), the straight potential decreases significantly.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Suited Jacks.** Let's rank the suited jacks from best to worst based on the principles above.\n    *   **JTs:** A suited connector. Excellent playability, making strong flushes and straights. A premium opening hand from the button.\n    *   **J9s:** A one-gapper. Still very strong with good straight and flush potential.\n    *   **J8s:** A two-gapper. Playability starts to decrease but is still a very solid hand.\n    *   ... (The value continues to decrease as the kicker gets lower) ...\n    *   **J5s/J4s/J3s:** These hands have very poor connectivity. The lower card doesn't connect well with the Jack to make straights. For example, with J5s, you need 6-7-8-9 for a straight, which doesn't use the Jack.\n    *   **J2s:** This is the hand with the lowest kicker (a deuce) and the worst connectivity. The deuce offers almost no help in making a straight with the Jack. Its value comes almost exclusively from making a flush, a pair of Jacks, or a very weak pair of deuces.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine if the \"Worst\" Hand is an Open.** The question asks for the worst suited jack you *should open*. This implies the hand is still profitable to raise. Given that we are on the button in a rake-free game (the most favorable conditions possible for opening), our range should be extremely wide. GTO solvers show that in a typical *raked* 100bb game, all suited jacks (from JTs down to J2s) are standard opens from the button. In a *rake-free* environment, this becomes even more true, and the profitability of opening J2s increases.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All suited jacks are profitable opens from the button. Therefore, the \"worst suited jack you should open\" is simply the suited jack with the lowest inherent value and expected profitability. Based on its low kicker and poor connectivity, J2s is the clear answer. It is the weakest hand in the JXs category, but still strong enough to be a standard open-raise in this specific scenario.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
