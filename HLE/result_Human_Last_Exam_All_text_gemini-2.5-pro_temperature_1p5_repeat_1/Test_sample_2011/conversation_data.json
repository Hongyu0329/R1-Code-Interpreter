    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` having `n = 128` vertices.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting pairs of vertices. We assume it's a simple, undirected graph.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in `G` where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique with `k` vertices is called a `k`-clique or `K_k`.\n*   **Clique Size:** The number of vertices in a clique, which is `k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S` from `G`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Objective:** We want to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that contains induced subgraphs `K_{k_1}, K_{k_2}, ..., K_{k_m}` for `m` different values of `k_i`. Our goal is to find the maximum possible value of `m`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating \"Clique\" to \"Induced Subgraph K_k\"\n\nA crucial point is the relationship between a graph containing a `k`-clique and it containing an induced `K_k`.\nIf a graph `G` has a `k`-clique, let the set of vertices in this clique be `S`. By the definition of a clique, every pair of vertices in `S` is connected by an edge in `G`.\nNow, consider the subgraph induced by `S`, which is `G[S]`. By definition, `G[S]` includes all edges from `G` between vertices in `S`. Since all such edges exist, `G[S]` is a complete graph on `k` vertices, i.e., `K_k`.\nTherefore, a graph `G` contains a `k`-clique if and only if it contains `K_k` as an induced subgraph. The problem can be rephrased as:\n\n**\"What is the maximum number of different clique sizes that a single graph on 128 vertices can have?\"**\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nLet `G` be any graph with `n=128` vertices. A clique is a set of vertices from `G`. The size `k` of any clique cannot be greater than the total number of vertices in the graph.\nSo, for any clique in `G`, its size `k` must satisfy `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\nThis means the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`. Consequently, the number of *different* clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\nThus, the maximum possible number is at most 128.\n\n### Step 4: Construct a Graph that Achieves the Upper Bound\n\nNow we need to check if this upper bound of 128 can actually be achieved. We need to find a specific graph `G` on 128 vertices that has cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nLet's check the clique sizes present in `K_{128}`:\n*   **Can we find a 1-clique?** Yes, any single vertex is a 1-clique.\n*   **Can we find a 2-clique?** Yes, any pair of vertices is connected, so they form a 2-clique.\n*   **Can we find a `k`-clique for any `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`?** Yes. Choose any `k` vertices from the 128 available vertices. Since `K_{128}` is a complete graph, all these `k` vertices are mutually connected, forming a `k`-clique. As shown in Step 2, this corresponds to an induced subgraph `K_k`.\n\nSince we can find a clique of size `k` for every integer `k` from 1 to 128, the set of all clique sizes that appear in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of different sizes in this set is 128.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We established a theoretical upper bound of 128 for the number of different clique sizes in any graph on 128 vertices.\n*   We found an example, the complete graph `K_{128}`, which achieves this bound.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n***\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The question uses the term \"clique\", not \"maximal clique\". A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. In `K_{128}`, the only maximal clique is the one of size 128. If the question had been about maximal cliques, the answer would be very different (likely 15, based on a disjoint union of cliques `K_1, K_2, ...`).\n*   **Overlapping Subgraphs:** The cliques of different sizes can (and in the optimal solution, do) share vertices. For example, a 5-clique is a subgraph of a 6-clique. The problem does not require them to be disjoint.\n*   **\"Induced Subgraph\" technicality:** The term \"induced\" is important but, in this specific case, does not change the problem from the simpler phrasing \"contains a clique\". This is because any set of vertices that forms a clique automatically induces a complete subgraph.\n\nFinal Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  The problem is to find the maximum number of different values of `k` such that a `K_k` (a clique of size `k`) exists as an induced subgraph in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n2.  A graph contains an induced `K_k` if and only if it contains a set of `k` vertices that are all mutually connected (i.e., a `k`-clique).\n3.  The size of any clique `k` in a graph with 128 vertices cannot exceed 128. So, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n4.  The complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`, is a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n5.  In `K_{128}`, for any integer `k` between 1 and 128, any set of `k` vertices forms a `k`-clique.\n6.  Therefore, `K_{128}` contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n7.  This means `K_{128}` has 128 different clique sizes, achieving the theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<128>>>"
