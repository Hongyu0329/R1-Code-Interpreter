    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific piece and section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\". We need to find the very end of the piece, which is the last measure of the 4th movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n2.  **Locate the relevant instrument's part:** We need to examine the musical score specifically for the \"Violino I\" or \"First Violin\" part.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final measure:** The question states the first violin ends on \"three notes\". Looking at the score, the very last measure contains a single chord played by the first violins. This is a \"triple stop,\" where the violinist plays three notes simultaneously on three different strings. This single chordal event constitutes the \"three notes\" the violin ends on.\n\n4.  **Identify the pitches of the three notes:** By reading the notes in the treble clef for the first violin part in the final measure, we can identify the specific pitches. The notes are written as follows:\n    *   The highest note is **B** (specifically B5, on the space above the staff).\n    *   The middle note is **D♯** (specifically D#5, on the fourth line of the staff).\n    *   The lowest note is **F♯** (specifically F#4, in the first space of the staff).\n\n5.  **Compare the notes to find the lowest one:** The three notes are F#4, D#5, and B5. When comparing their pitches, the note with the lowest frequency (and the lowest position on the musical staff) is F#4.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"three notes\":** The phrase could be ambiguous. It could mean three notes played one after another, or three notes played at the same time. In this context, the standard orchestral finale involves a final, powerful chord, and the score confirms the first violins play a three-note chord (a triple stop).\n*   **Reading the clef and key signature:** The final measure is in the key of B Major. The notes F♯, D♯, and B form a B major chord. It is crucial to read the notes accurately on the treble clef.\n*   **Octave designation:** While not strictly necessary to answer the question, understanding that F#4 is lower than D#5, which is lower than B5, confirms the visual reading from the score. The note lowest on the staff is the lowest in pitch.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the score, the three notes played by the first violin at the very end of the symphony are F♯, D♯, and B. The lowest of these three notes is F♯.\n\n<<<F#>>>"
