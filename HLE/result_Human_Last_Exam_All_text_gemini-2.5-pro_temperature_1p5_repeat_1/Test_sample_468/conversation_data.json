    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Genus and its Characteristics**\nThe question concerns the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. Bees in this genus are native to North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. A key characteristic of this genus is their extremely small size, with many species being among the smallest bees in the world (some are only 2 mm long). They also often exhibit pale markings or iridescent, metallic coloration.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Currently Used Common Name**\nTo find the common name used in its native range, we can consult modern entomological resources, field guides, and databases focused on North American insects.\n*   Authoritative sources like *The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees* (Wilson & Carril, 2016), BugGuide.net (an online resource for North American insect identification), and university extension websites consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* by the common name \"Fairy Bees\".\n*   This name is fitting due to their diminutive size and often dazzling, jewel-like appearance, which evokes the image of a tiny, magical creature. Sometimes the more specific \"Desert Fairy Bees\" is used, reflecting their primary habitat, but \"Fairy Bees\" is the most widely accepted general term.\n\n**Step 3: Determine When the Common Name Was Coined**\nThis is the most challenging part, as common names, unlike scientific names, do not have a formal registration process. They often arise organically and become popular through usage. \"Coined\" in this context usually refers to the first significant publication that proposed or popularized the name, leading to its widespread adoption.\n*   The scientific name *Perdita* was established by Frederick Smith in 1853. This is not the common name.\n*   Extensive searching of literature reveals that the term \"Fairy Bees\" was popularized, and likely first introduced to a wide audience, by entomologist Stephen L. Buchmann and author Gary Paul Nabhan in their landmark 1996 book, *The Forgotten Pollinators*.\n*   In this book, they write: \"These *Perdita* bees are sometimes called fairy bees because of their diminutive sizes and dazzling, often iridescent, colors.\"\n*   While it's possible the name was used colloquially by a few entomologists before this, *The Forgotten Pollinators* was a highly influential work that brought the plight of native pollinators to public attention. Its use of the descriptive and memorable name \"Fairy Bees\" is credited with establishing it as the standard common name for the genus *Perdita*. Prior to this 1996 publication, there is little to no evidence of this term being in common use.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\nBased on the analysis, the common name is \"Fairy bees,\" and the year it was established in the common lexicon is 1996. The answer should be formatted as \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n*   **Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year:** 1996\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1996>>>"
