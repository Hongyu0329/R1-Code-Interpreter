    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D square grid where points have integer coordinates (x, y). Movement is restricted to four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), i.e., from (x, y) to (x±1, y) or (x, y±1).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of n connected steps on the lattice. The total length of the walk is n.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that does not visit the same lattice point more than once. The path cannot cross itself or reuse any vertex.\n*   **a(n):** The function representing the total number of distinct n-step SAWs, assuming the walk starts from a fixed point (e.g., the origin (0,0)). The starting point is arbitrary and does not affect the total count.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation for Small Values of n\n\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence a(n) to understand the process and its growing complexity. We start the walk at p₀ = (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin, there are 4 possible first steps: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). All are valid SAWs.\n    `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    For each of the 4 initial steps, the second step cannot go back to the origin. This leaves 3 possible directions. For example, if the first step is to (1,0), the second step can be to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). A 2-step walk cannot self-intersect in any other way.\n    `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    For each of the 12 two-step walks, we consider the third step. From the endpoint of a 2-step walk, there are 3 choices that don't immediately backtrack. For a 3-step walk, it's impossible to land on a previously visited point other than by immediate backtracking (the smallest loop on a square lattice has length 4).\n    `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Increasing Complexity for n ≥ 4\n\nFor n=4, a new possibility for self-intersection arises. A walk can form a closed loop.\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    If we continue the previous method, we'd get `a(3) * 3 = 36 * 3 = 108`. However, this counts walks that are not self-avoiding.\n    A walk of the form `p₀ → p₁ → p₂ → p₃ → p₄` is not a SAW if `p₄ = p₀`. This happens if the walk forms a 1x1 square.\n    Let's count how many such walks exist:\n    1.  First step (p₀ → p₁): 4 choices (e.g., to (1,0)).\n    2.  Second step (p₁ → p₂): Must be a turn, 2 choices (e.g., to (1,1)).\n    3.  Third step (p₂ → p₃): Must be a turn towards the origin, 1 choice (e.g., to (0,1)).\n    4.  Fourth step (p₃ → p₄): Must complete the square, 1 choice (e.g., back to (0,0)).\n    The number of such intersecting walks is `4 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 8`.\n    So, the number of 4-step SAWs is the total number of non-backtracking walks minus these 8 intersecting ones.\n    `a(4) = 108 - 8 = 100`\n\n### Step 4: The Recursive Method and Its Difficulties\n\nWe can define a general recurrence relation. The number of n-step walks is roughly `3 * a(n-1)`. We must subtract the walks where the nth step lands on a previously visited point (other than the (n-2)th point).\n\n`a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - (correction terms)`\n\nThe correction terms account for walks that form loops.\n*   For `a(5)`: The new endpoint `p₅` can potentially intersect with `p₀, p₁, p₂, p₃`. Due to the alternating parity of Manhattan distance for each step, `p₅` (odd step) can only be at the same position as previous odd-step points (`p₁`, `p₃`).\n    *   `p₅ = p₃`: This happens if `p₄` is a neighbor of `p₃`, which is true, but the step `p₄ → p₃` is the immediate backtrack, already excluded by the multiplier `3`.\n    *   `p₅ = p₁`: This happens if the endpoint `p₄` is a neighbor of `p₁`. We must count the number of 4-step SAWs where this occurs. A careful count reveals there are 16 such paths.\n    Therefore, `a(5) = 3 * a(4) - 16 = 3 * 100 - 16 = 284`.\n\nAs `n` increases, calculating these correction terms becomes extremely complex because it involves counting the number of `(n-1)`-step SAWs with specific geometric properties. For `a(10)`, we would need to consider intersections `p₁₀=p₀`, `p₁₀=p₂`, `p₁₀=p₄`, `p₁₀=p₆`, and the calculation is not feasible by hand.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nSince a direct manual calculation for `a(10)` is intractable, we turn to established computational results. The sequence `a(n)` for SAWs on a square lattice is a well-known sequence in combinatorics, often denoted as `c₂(n)`. It is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nThe known values for this sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nThese values were found using extensive computer calculations (typically via backtracking algorithms or Monte Carlo methods). The problem is of great interest in statistical physics for modeling polymer chains. Based on these established results, the answer is 44100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
