    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category\nThe simplex category $\\Delta$ can be viewed as a 2-category. Let's break down its structure:\n1.  **Objects**: The objects are the finite ordinals, denoted by $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any integer $n \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets.\n2.  **1-morphisms**: A morphism (or 1-morphism) $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a non-decreasing function. That is, for any $i, j \\in [n]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n3.  **2-morphisms**: $\\Delta$ is a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the category of partially ordered sets. $\\mathsf{Pos}$ can be made into a 2-category where for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: P \\to Q$, a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ exists if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in P$. Since this defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\mathsf{Hom}(P,Q)$, this is a locally posetal 2-category. $\\Delta$ inherits this structure. Thus, for two non-decreasing maps $f, g: [n] \\to [m]$, there is a (unique) 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [n]$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$\nAn internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of:\n*   A pair of 1-morphisms: $L: A \\to B$ (the left adjoint) and $R: B \\to A$ (the right adjoint).\n*   A pair of 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$.\n*   These must satisfy the triangle identities.\n\nIn our case, $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$. So we need:\n*   A non-decreasing map $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   A non-decreasing map $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. By the definition of 2-morphisms in $\\Delta$, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$. This simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. This simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThese two inequalities, $L(R(j)) \\le j$ and $i \\le R(L(i))$, are the standard conditions for an adjunction between posets (also known as a Galois connection). For any pair of posets, these conditions are equivalent to the familiar formulation: $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for an adjunction are always satisfied. Therefore, counting internal adjunctions is equivalent to counting pairs of non-decreasing maps $(L, R)$ that form a poset adjunction.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing adjunctions between finite ordinals\nA key property of adjunctions between posets is that left adjoints preserve all existing joins (suprema) and right adjoints preserve all existing meets (infima).\n*   For a map $L: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a left adjoint, it must be non-decreasing and preserve joins. The joins in $[n]$ are the maximums of subsets and the empty join, which is the minimum element $0$. Any non-decreasing map between totally ordered sets preserves maximums of pairs, and by induction, all finite non-empty joins. The only additional condition is that $L$ must preserve the empty join, which means $L(0) = 0$.\n*   For a map $R: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a right adjoint, it must be non-decreasing and preserve meets. The meets in $[m]$ are the minimums of subsets and the empty meet, which is the maximum element $m$. Similarly, the only additional condition is that $R$ must preserve the empty meet, which means $R(m)=n$.\n\nIt is a known result that a non-decreasing map $L: [n] \\to [m]$ has a right adjoint if and only if $L(0)=0$. Similarly, a non-decreasing map $R: [m] \\to [n]$ has a left adjoint if and only if $R(m)=n$. The correspondence between such $L$'s and $R$'s is one-to-one.\nTherefore, the number of adjunctions is the number of non-decreasing maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the number of valid maps\nWe need to count the number of functions $L: \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\} \\to \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ that satisfy:\n1.  $L(i) \\le L(j)$ for $i \\le j$ (non-decreasing).\n2.  $L(0) = 0$.\n\nA map $L$ is determined by the sequence of its values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$. The conditions mean we are looking for the number of sequences that satisfy:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the values for $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$. This is a non-decreasing sequence of 23 numbers, where each number is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 items (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from 38 categories (the numbers $0, 1, \\dots, 37$), with replacement, and order does not matter as we arrange them non-decreasingly. This is a problem of counting multisets.\n\nThe number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $N$ is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{N \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right)$, which is equal to the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$ (for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   The number of categories to choose from is $N = 38$ (the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe number of such maps $L$ is:\n$\\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, one could count the number of non-decreasing maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing a non-decreasing sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. Here $k=37$ items chosen from $N=24$ categories. The result is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we see that $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Both methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the number of non-decreasing maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$. This corresponds to choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the 38-element set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\"\"\"$\\binom{60}{23}$\"\"\" >>>"
