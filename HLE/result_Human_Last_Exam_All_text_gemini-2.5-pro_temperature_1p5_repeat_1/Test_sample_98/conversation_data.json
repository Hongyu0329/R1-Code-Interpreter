    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Icosahedron's Structure and Orientation:**\n    *   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n    *   The problem states the icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Symmetry:**\n    *   A regular icosahedron has a high degree of symmetry, including a point of central symmetry (or inversion symmetry). This means for any point in the solid, there is an identical point on the opposite side of the center, at the same distance.\n    *   When the icosahedron stands on a face, it also has a face directly opposite the base, parallel to it. The vertical axis passing through the centers of these two faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   The geometric center of the icosahedron lies on this vertical axis, exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces.\n\n3.  **Relating \"Half-Filled\" to the Geometry:**\n    *   \"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n    *   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, a horizontal plane passing through this center will divide the solid into two parts of equal volume.\n    *   Therefore, when the tank is half-filled, the water surface will be a flat, horizontal plane located at the mid-height of the icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Determining the Shape of the Water Surface:**\n    *   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its mid-height.\n    *   We need to determine what this cross-sectional shape is. Let's consider the positions of the 12 vertices when the icosahedron is standing on a face:\n        *   There are 3 vertices forming the triangular base.\n        *   There are 3 vertices forming the parallel triangular top face.\n        *   The remaining 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 vertices are located exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces. They form a \"zig-zag\" belt or equator around the middle of the icosahedron.\n    *   These 6 vertices all lie in the horizontal mid-plane. The cross-section at this level is the polygon formed by connecting these 6 vertices.\n    *   Due to the 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis and the overall symmetry of the icosahedron, these 6 vertices are spaced equally around the center.\n    *   The edges connecting these 6 vertices are all edges of the icosahedron and thus have equal length.\n    *   A six-sided polygon with equal side lengths and vertices equidistant from a central point is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Orientation is Key:** If the icosahedron were standing on a vertex or resting on an edge, the half-full water level and the resulting surface shape would be different. The \"standing on a face\" condition is crucial.\n*   **Symmetry is the Shortcut:** Instead of trying to perform a complex volume integration, recognizing the central symmetry of the icosahedron simplifies the problem immensely. The half-volume level must pass through the center of symmetry.\n*   **Vertex Distribution:** Correctly visualizing or knowing how the vertices of the icosahedron are distributed in layers relative to a base face is essential to identify the shape of the cross-section. The vertices are arranged in four levels: 3 (base), 3 (upper-middle), 3 (lower-middle, forming a hexagon with the upper-middle), and 3 (top). The question asks for the cross section at the middle which contains 6 vertices. In this orientation, there are 3 vertices at the bottom, 6 vertices at the mid-height plane, and 3 vertices at the top. The cross section through the 6 mid-plane vertices is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water reaches its mid-height. The horizontal cross-section at this height is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
