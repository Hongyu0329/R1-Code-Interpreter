    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core task**\nThe user wants to find the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual. Since the matrix \\(A\\) is explicitly provided, we do not need to use the contextual information. The problem is a direct calculation of the determinant of matrix \\(A\\).\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points**\n1.  **Focus on the given matrix:** The primary task is to find the determinant of the matrix \\(A\\).\n2.  **Ignore irrelevant information:** The terminology \"Markov quiver\" and the parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) are not needed for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly defined.\n3.  **Choose a method:** There are several methods to calculate a 3x3 determinant, such as Sarrus' rule, cofactor expansion, or row reduction. Using more than one method can be a good way to verify the result.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-step calculation of the determinant**\n\nWe will use two different methods to ensure the result is correct.\n\n**Method 1: Sarrus' Rule**\nFor a 3x3 matrix \\( M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\), the determinant is \\( \\det(M) = aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - afh - bdi \\).\n\nFor our matrix \\( A \\):\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the products of the forward diagonals:\n*   \\( aei = (2)(2)(2) = 8 \\)\n*   \\( bfg = (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1 \\)\n*   \\( cdh = (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1 \\)\nSum 1 = \\( 8 + (-1) + (-1) = 6 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the products of the backward diagonals:\n*   \\( ceg = (-1)(2)(-1) = 2 \\)\n*   \\( afh = (2)(-1)(-1) = 2 \\)\n*   \\( bdi = (-1)(-1)(2) = 2 \\)\nSum 2 = \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\)\n\nThe determinant is Sum 1 - Sum 2:\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 2: Row Operations**\nA property of determinants is that if we add a multiple of one row to another row, the determinant does not change. Another property is that if a matrix has a row of all zeros, its determinant is 0.\n\nLet's perform the row operation R1 â†’ R1 + R2 + R3 (add the second and third rows to the first row):\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n2+(-1)+(-1) & -1+2+(-1) & -1+(-1)+2 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix} \n= \n\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSince the resulting matrix has a row consisting entirely of zeros, its determinant is 0. Because this row operation does not change the determinant's value, the determinant of the original matrix \\(A\\) is also 0.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result. The determinant of the matrix \\(A\\) is 0. The fact that the determinant is zero implies that the rows (and columns) of the matrix are linearly dependent, which we explicitly showed in Method 2.\n\n<<<0>>>"
