    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n*   **Event:** Junior prom\n*   **Performer Type:** Cardboard cutout\n*   **Performer Role:** Fictional singer\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the specific episode**\nThe episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" revolves around the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior prom, stylized as \"J-prom\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the scene at the Junior prom**\nDuring the prom scene, the characters discuss the entertainment. The dialogue provides the direct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the key line of dialogue**\nCheerleader expresses her excitement about the musical act. She says, \"i can't believe we got an actual cardboard cutout of K. K. Kremling to play at our j-prom!\"\n\n**Step 5: Verify with visual information**\nThe cartoon then shows a cardboard cutout on a stage. The cutout is of a male singer with spiky hair, and the name \"K. K. Kremling\" is written on the base.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifies a *fictional* singer. The name K. K. Kremling is unique to the Homestar Runner universe and is not a real-world performer.\n*   **Spelling:** The spelling is precise: \"K. K. Kremling\". The name is likely a parody or reference, but the name itself is the answer.\n*   **Episode Specificity:** The answer must come from episode #15, as other episodes have different gags. This specific detail is crucial.\n*   **Type of \"Performance\":** The question correctly notes it is a cardboard cutout, which the episode's dialogue and visuals explicitly confirm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the direct dialogue and visual evidence within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is K. K. Kremling.\n\n<<<K. K. Kremling>>>"
