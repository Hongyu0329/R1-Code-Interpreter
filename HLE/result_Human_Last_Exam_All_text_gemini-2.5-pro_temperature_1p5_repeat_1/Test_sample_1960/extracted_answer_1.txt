Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct formulas constructed from the allowed connectives that are not derivable from each other, for instance:
$A = (1 \multimap \bot) \multimap (1 \multimap \bot)$
$B = ((1 \multimap \bot) \otimes (1 \multimap \bot)) \multimap ((1 \multimap \bot) \otimes (1 \multimap \bot))$

The function $f$ maps a natural number $w$ to the linear logic formula:
$f(w) = (B^w) \multimap (A^w)$
where $X^k$ is the formula $X \otimes \dots \otimes X$ ($k$ times), and $X^0=1$.

The linear formula $C$ is defined as:
$C = (B^b \multimap A^b)^m$
which is the formula $(B^b \multimap A^b)$ tensored with itself $m$ times.
