    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve definition**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts based on the parameter `t`:\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=1$.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   These are the standard parametric equations for a unit circle. Since $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, this traces the upper half of the unit circle, starting from $(1, 0)$, passing through $(0, 1)$, and ending at $(-1, 0)$.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=5$.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    *   From these equations, we can write $\\cos t = x$ and $\\sin t = y/5$. Using the identity $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, we get the Cartesian equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    *   Since $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t$ is negative, which means $y$ is also negative. This traces the lower half of the ellipse, starting from $(-1, 0)$, passing through $(0, -5)$, and ending at $(1, 0)$.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall bounds of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` for the entire curve. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **x-coordinates:** In both parts, $x = \\cos t$. As $t$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $\\cos t$ covers all values from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n*   **y-coordinates:** We combine the ranges from the two parts.\n    *   From Part 1, the y-values are in $[0, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, the y-values are in $[-5, 0]$.\n    *   The total range for y is the union of these two intervals, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Find the dimensions of the bounding box**\n\nThe bounding box is a rectangle defined by the minimum and maximum coordinates.\n\n*   **Width of the box:** $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Height of the box:** $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of size 2x6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest circumscribing square**\n\nThe smallest square that can contain a rectangle of width `W` and height `H` must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length `S` is $S^2$.\n\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Piecewise Definition:** It is crucial to recognize that the curve is composed of two different shapes joined together.\n2.  **Finding Bounding Box:** The overall extent of the figure is determined by the absolute minimum and maximum coordinates across both pieces. Do not just analyze one piece.\n3.  **Square outcircling a Rectangle:** The side length of the smallest square containing a rectangle is the maximum of the rectangle's width and height.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe figure's extent is from $x=-1$ to $x=1$ (width 2) and from $y=-5$ to $y=1$ (height 6).\nThe smallest square to contain this shape must have a side length of at least 6.\nThe area of such a square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
