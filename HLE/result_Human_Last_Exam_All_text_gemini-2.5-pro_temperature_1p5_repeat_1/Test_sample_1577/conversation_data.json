    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of the Toric Code and GSD\nThe toric code is a topological stabilizer code. Its Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting local operators. The ground states are the states that are +1 eigenstates of all these stabilizer operators. The number of independent ground states is the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD).\n\nThe GSD of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. Specifically, it is equal to $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits is determined by the number of independent logical operators. Logical operators are operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are not products of stabilizer generators. They transform one ground state into another.\n\nLogical operators correspond to topologically non-trivial loops or paths on the surface. For the toric code, there are two types of logical operators, typically denoted as logical $X$ (strings of Pauli-X operators) and logical $Z$ (strings of Pauli-Z operators). A logical qubit is formed by a pair of a logical $X$ operator and a logical $Z$ operator that anti-commute with each other but commute with all other logical operators in a chosen basis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Topology of the Surface\nThe surface is described as a sphere (genus $g=0$) from which $n$ disks have been removed to create smooth holes (or smooth boundaries) and $m$ disks have been removed to create rough holes (or rough boundaries).\n*   **Smooth boundary:** A boundary where Z-type string operators can terminate. At a smooth boundary, the lattice terminates with plaquettes, and all vertex operators (star operators) are complete.\n*   **Rough boundary:** A boundary where X-type string operators can terminate. At a rough boundary, the lattice terminates with vertices, and some star operators might be modified (e.g., involving 3 qubits instead of 4).\n\nThe number of logical qubits $k$ depends on the genus $g$ and the number and type of boundaries. Our surface has $g=0$, $n$ smooth boundaries, and $m$ rough boundaries.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Logical Qubits by Constructing Logical Operators\nWe can find the number of logical qubits, $k$, by explicitly constructing a basis of logical operators. A logical qubit requires a pair of operators $(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Z})$ that anticommute. This anticommutation occurs if the path of the $\\bar{X}$ operator (a loop or string on the dual lattice) and the path of the $\\bar{Z}$ operator (a loop or string on the direct lattice) intersect an odd number of times.\n\nLet's assume $n \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$, which is implied by the phrasing \"with n smooth holes and m rough holes\".\n\n1.  **Qubits from strings between boundaries of the same type:**\n    *   Consider strings of $\\sigma_z$ operators connecting two different smooth boundaries. Let the smooth boundaries be labeled $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n$. We can form $n-1$ independent logical Z operators by taking strings from a reference boundary $S_1$ to each of the others: $\\bar{Z}_i' = Z_{S_1 \\to S_{i+1}}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n    *   To find the corresponding logical X operator for $\\bar{Z}_i'$, we need an operator that crosses the path $S_1 \\to S_{i+1}$ an odd number of times. An X-loop, $\\bar{X}_i' = X_{S_{i+1}}$, which is a loop of $\\sigma_x$ operators encircling the boundary $S_{i+1}$, fulfills this condition. The string starts outside this loop and ends inside (or vice versa), so it must cross the loop path an odd number of times. One can verify that these pairs form $n-1$ valid, independent logical qubits.\n    *   Symmetrically, we can consider strings of $\\sigma_x$ operators connecting two different rough boundaries. Let the rough boundaries be $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_m$. We can form $m-1$ independent logical X operators, $\\bar{X}_j'' = X_{R_1 \\to R_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, m-1$.\n    *   The corresponding logical Z operator for $\\bar{X}_j''$ is a Z-loop around the boundary $R_{j+1}$, i.e., $\\bar{Z}_j'' = Z_{R_{j+1}}$. This pair anticommutes as required. This gives $m-1$ more logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Total Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    The set of $n-1$ qubits from smooth boundaries and the $m-1$ qubits from rough boundaries can be chosen such that they all commute with each other. Therefore, the total number of independent logical qubits is the sum of these two counts.\n    $k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n + m - 2$.\n    This formula is valid for $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Address the Special Cases (when n=0 or m=0)\n*   **Case 1: $n > 0$ and $m = 0$ (only smooth holes).** The surface is a sphere with $n$ smooth boundaries. We can form $n-1$ independent Z-strings between boundaries. We can also form $n-1$ independent X-loops around boundaries (the product of all $n$ X-loops is a trivial operator). These can be paired to form $k = n-1$ logical qubits.\n*   **Case 2: $m > 0$ and $n = 0$ (only rough holes).** By symmetry, the number of logical qubits is $k = m-1$.\n*   **Case 3: $n=0$ and $m=0$.** This is a sphere with no holes. $k=0$.\n\nThe formula $k = n+m-2$ only works for the case where $n \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$. Let's check the given answer choices.\n\n*   A. $2^{m+n}$\n*   B. $2^{m+n-2}$\n*   C. $2^{m+n+2}$\n*   D. $2^{2m}$\n*   E. $2^{2n}$\n*   F. $2^{(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)}$\n\nNone of the options provides a single formula that correctly covers all cases for $n, m \\ge 0$. However, answer choice B matches the result for the most general case where both types of boundaries are present ($n \\ge 1, m \\ge 1$). In the context of a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that this is the intended scenario, as the simpler cases ($n=0$ or $m=0$) reduce to a less complex problem. The wording of the question \"with n smooth holes and m rough holes\" further suggests that $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nAssuming the question implies that there is at least one of each type of hole ($n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$), the number of logical qubits is $k = n + m - 2$.\nThe ground space degeneracy (GSD) is $2^k$.\nTherefore, GSD = $2^{n+m-2}$.\n\nFinal check:\n- Surface: Sphere ($g=0$) with $n$ smooth and $m$ rough holes.\n- Number of logical qubits $k = 2g + n + m - 2 = 0 + n + m - 2 = n+m-2$ (for $n,m \\ge 1$).\n- GSD = $2^k = 2^{n+m-2}$.\n\nThis matches option B."
