    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code\nFirst, we need to understand how many logical qubits can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with two holes.\n\n*   **Surface Code Basics:** A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Logical qubits are not stored in individual physical qubits but are encoded in the global, topological properties of a 2D lattice of physical qubits.\n*   **Encoding with Holes:** In a planar (or patch) version of the surface code, logical qubits are typically created by introducing defects, commonly referred to as \"holes\" or \"boundaries.\" These are regions where the normal stabilizer checks of the code are intentionally turned off.\n*   **The Formula:** For a single connected planar surface (topologically equivalent to a disk) with `h` holes punched into it, the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded is given by the formula:\n    `k = h - 1`\n*   **Reasoning for the Formula:** To encode a single logical qubit, you need a pair of non-commuting logical operators (like `X_L` and `Z_L`). A pair of holes (`h=2`) allows for the definition of such a pair of operators. For instance, a string operator connecting the two holes can be one logical operator (`X_L`), and a loop operator encircling one of the holes can be the other (`Z_L`). With `h` holes, you can choose one hole as a reference and form `h-1` independent pairs with the other holes, allowing you to define `h-1` logical qubits whose operators all correctly commute with each other.\n*   **Calculation for a Single Patch:** In our case, a single patch has `h = 2` holes. Applying the formula:\n    `k_patch = 2 - 1 = 1`\n    So, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode exactly one logical qubit.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Total System\nNext, we consider the entire system described in the question.\n\n*   **System Components:** The system consists of \"two patches of surface code.\" This implies there are two separate, independent instances of the code. They are not physically connected to form a single larger surface.\n*   **Total Qubit Count:** Since the two patches are independent systems, the total number of logical qubits they can store is simply the sum of the logical qubits each one can store.\n*   **Calculation for the Total System:**\n    *   Qubits from Patch 1: `k_patch1 = 1`\n    *   Qubits from Patch 2: `k_patch2 = 1`\n    *   Total logical qubits `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Patch\":** A \"patch\" is standard terminology for a planar surface code, which is topologically a disk (genus `g=0`).\n2.  **Interpretation of \"with two holes\":** The phrase \"two patches... with two holes\" is most naturally interpreted as each patch having two holes. If it meant a total of two holes distributed among the patches (e.g., one hole in each), no logical qubits could be encoded, as a single hole is insufficient (`k = 1 - 1 = 0`). The question asks for the *maximum* number, which corresponds to the configuration where each patch has the full two holes.\n3.  **Independence:** The problem specifies \"two patches,\" which implies they are separate. If they were connected, they would form a single topological surface with a different qubit capacity. Since they are separate, their capacities add up.\n4.  **Formula `k = h - 1`:** This is the standard result for planar codes, derived from the need to construct a set of valid, mutually commuting logical operators for different qubits.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy analyzing a single patch and then combining the results for the two independent patches, we can determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n*   Each patch has `h=2` holes and can encode `k = 2 - 1 = 1` logical qubit.\n*   Two such independent patches can therefore encode a total of `1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n\n<<<2>>>"
