    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given two matrices, A and B, which define a linear system. We need to find a state feedback gain matrix F such that the closed-loop system matrix, defined as `A_cl = A + BF`, has specific eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define the Given Matrices and the Unknown Gain F**\nThe system matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\nB = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix F is a 2x2 matrix, as the system has 2 states and 2 inputs. Let's define it as:\nF = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial is formed by `(λ - λ1)(λ - λ2) = 0`.\n\np(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))\np(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)\nUsing the difference of squares formula, (a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2:\np(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - (j)^2\np(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)\np(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2\n\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system. For a 2x2 matrix, this polynomial is `λ^2 - (trace)λ + (determinant) = 0`. Therefore, the trace of the closed-loop matrix must be -2, and its determinant must be 2.\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A + BF`**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we add A to get the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)`.\n-   **Trace of A_cl:**\n    trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1\n-   **Determinant of A_cl:**\n    det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)\n    det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)\n    det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4\n    det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4\n\n**6. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nNow we equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n-   **Matching the λ term:**\n    `-(trace(A_cl)) = 2`\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `-f1 - f2 - 2*f3 + 1 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n-   **Matching the constant term:**\n    `det(A_cl) = 2`\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (f1, f2, f3, f4). This indicates that the solution is not unique. We can find a particular solution by making simplifying assumptions. A common approach is to set some elements of F to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This simplifies the equations significantly.\n-   Equation 1 becomes:\n    `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1  =>  f1 + f2 = -1`\n-   Equation 2 becomes:\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3  =>  -f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2) `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nWe have found the values `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, and `f4 = 0`. Therefore, one possible state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]\n\nWe can quickly verify this.\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]] = [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for this `A_cl` is `λ(λ+2) - (-1)(2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`, which has the desired roots `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
