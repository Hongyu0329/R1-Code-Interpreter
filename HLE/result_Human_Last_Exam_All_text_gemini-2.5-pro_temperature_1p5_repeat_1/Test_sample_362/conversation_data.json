    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structures of the reactants.**\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde. The \"pival\" prefix refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a *tert*-butyl group (`(CH₃)₃C-`). Pivalaldehyde is therefore 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n           O\n          //\n        (CH₃)₃C-CH\n        ```\n\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. Let's break down the name:\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This is the phosphorus part, a phosphorus atom bonded to three phenyl groups (`PPh₃`).\n    *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`: This describes the organic part attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" indicates a two-carbon fragment. \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means there is a 2-chlorophenyl group on the second carbon of the ethyl chain. The \"idene\" ending signifies that this group is attached to the phosphorus via a double bond (in the ylide resonance structure).\n    *   The ylide carbon (the carbanion) is C1, so the structure is `PPh₃=C¹H-C²H₂-(2-chlorophenyl group)`.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-Ar      (where Ar = 2-chlorophenyl)\n        ```\n        or its zwitterionic resonance form:\n        ```\n              Ph₃P⁺-CH⁻-CH₂-Ar\n        ```\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism.**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The overall transformation replaces the carbonyl oxygen atom (`=O`) with the alkylidene group of the ylide (`=CR₂`).\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  Nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbanion on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.\n2.  Formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane.\n3.  The oxaphosphetane collapses to form a stable triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`) and the desired alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Reactants to Form the Product.**\n\nWe essentially \"swap\" the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde with the `CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   From Pivalaldehyde: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n*   From the Ylide: `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n\nCombining these two fragments gives the alkene structure:\n`(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n\nThe side product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Alkene (E/Z Isomerism).**\n\nThe new double bond is disubstituted, so E/Z isomers are possible. The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized Ylides:** Have an electron-withdrawing group (like -C=O, -CN) attached to the ylide carbon. They are more stable, the reaction is reversible and thermodynamically controlled, typically favoring the **E-alkene** (trans).\n*   **Non-stabilized Ylides:** Have alkyl or hydrogen substituents on the ylide carbon. They are less stable, the reaction is irreversible and kinetically controlled, typically favoring the **Z-alkene** (cis).\n\nIn our case, the ylide is `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-Ar`. The carbanionic carbon is attached to a `-CH₂-Ar` group. This is an alkyl-type group; there is no resonance stabilization of the carbanion. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\nFor a reaction between a non-stabilized ylide and an aldehyde, the major product is the **Z-isomer**.\n\nLet's assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) around the double bond to confirm the structure of the Z-isomer:\n*   On the carbon from pivalaldehyde: Priority 1 is the *tert*-butyl group (`-C(CH₃)₃`). Priority 2 is the hydrogen atom (`-H`).\n*   On the carbon from the ylide: Priority 1 is the 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group (`-CH₂-Ar`). Priority 2 is the hydrogen atom (`-H`).\n\nIn the **Z-isomer** (from German *zusammen*, meaning together), the high-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n```\n   (CH₃)₃C      CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n          \\     /\n           C = C\n          /     \\\n         H       H\n```\n\n**Step 5: Name the Product.**\n\nTo name the final product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond.\n1.  The chain is: `(2-Cl-Ph)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₃`.\n2.  The longest chain has 5 carbons with the double bond starting at C2. So the parent name is **pent-2-ene**.\n3.  The substituents are: a `2-chlorophenyl` group at C1, and two `methyl` groups at C4.\n4.  Putting it all together: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n5.  Adding the stereochemistry we determined in Step 4, the name of the major product is: **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** Correctly interpreting chemical names is crucial. \"Pivalaldehyde\" for `(CH₃)₃C-CHO` and deciphering the complex ylide name are the first potential pitfalls.\n2.  **Ylide Stability:** Classifying the ylide as stabilized or non-stabilized is the key to predicting the stereochemical outcome. The presence of a `CH₂` spacer between the ylide carbon and the phenyl ring means it is a non-stabilized ylide.\n3.  **Stereochemistry Prediction:** Knowing that non-stabilized ylides typically give Z-alkenes with aldehydes is a fundamental rule of the Wittig reaction.\n4.  **IUPAC Naming:** Correctly identifying the parent chain, numbering it to give the double bond the lowest locant, and correctly placing substituents are essential for the final name.\n5.  **E/Z Assignment:** Applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules correctly to the final structure is necessary to assign the Z or E descriptor.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane yields an alkene. Because the reaction involves a non-stabilized ylide, the major product formed is the Z-isomer. The systematic name for this product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
