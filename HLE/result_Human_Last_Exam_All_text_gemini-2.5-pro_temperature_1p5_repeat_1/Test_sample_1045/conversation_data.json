    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Formula\nThe molecule is toluene, with the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\nThe Pople-style basis set notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. We need to interpret this notation for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen). A contracted Gaussian function (or basis function) is a fixed linear combination of one or more primitive Gaussian functions. The question asks for the total number of these contracted functions.\n\n#### Analysis for a Carbon Atom (C):\nCarbon is a first-row element (atomic number 6). It has core electrons (1s) and valence electrons (2s, 2p).\n*   **\"6-\"**: This part refers to the core orbitals (1s). It means the 1s orbital is represented by a single **contracted** function, which is formed from a linear combination of 6 **primitive** Gaussian functions.\n    *   Contribution: **1 s-type function**.\n*   **\"-31\"**: This part describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p). It indicates a \"split-valence\" basis, meaning the valence shell is represented by two sets of functions: an inner set and an outer set.\n    *   **\"3\"**: This defines the inner valence shell. It is represented by one s-type contracted function and one set of p-type contracted functions (px, py, pz), where each function is a combination of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Contribution: 1 s-type function + 3 p-type functions = **4 functions**.\n    *   **\"1\"**: This defines the outer valence shell. It is represented by another s-type contracted function and another set of p-type contracted functions, where each function is made from a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Contribution: 1 s-type function + 3 p-type functions = **4 functions**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n#### Analysis for a Hydrogen Atom (H):\nHydrogen (atomic number 1) has no core electrons, only a single 1s valence electron. Therefore, only the \"-31G\" part of the notation applies to it.\n*   **\"-31\"**: The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts, an inner and an outer function.\n    *   **\"3\"**: The inner part is described by one s-type contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Contribution: **1 s-type function**.\n    *   **\"1\"**: The outer part is described by one s-type function made from a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Contribution: **1 s-type function**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n*   **Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total number of contracted Gaussian functions:**\n    *   63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
