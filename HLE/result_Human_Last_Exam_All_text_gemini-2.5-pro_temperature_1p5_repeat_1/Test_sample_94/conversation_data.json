    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifying clues.**\nThe question provides several distinct pieces of information about the physicist:\n1.  **Field of Fame:** Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n2.  **Discovery:** Discovered a specific \"optical effect.\"\n3.  **Nature of Effect:** The effect is observed \"in real imagery.\"\n4.  **Discovery Story:** The effect was first noticed after an accidental observation by a custodial worker.\n5.  **Context of Observation:** The observation involved someone \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1: \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"**\nThis narrows the possibilities to physicists who made significant contributions to the theory or practice of microscopy. Key figures include Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), Ernst Ruska (electron microscope), Robert Hooke (early pioneer), and Frits Zernike (phase-contrast microscope).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Clues 2, 4, and 5 together: The discovery of an optical effect related to a custodial worker and concave mirrors.**\nThis is a very specific anecdote. We need to find which of the physicists from Step 2 is associated with this story.\n*   **Frits Zernike's** discovery of the principle of phase contrast is famously linked to an accidental observation. While working with concave gratings (a type of ruled concave mirror) to study spectral lines, he became intrigued by faint \"ghost\" images caused by imperfections in the grating.\n*   The anecdote often told is that the principle became clear when he was observing smears or dust on a concave mirror using an optical test (like the Foucault knife-edge test). The story has been embellished over time, with some versions stating the smears were left by a janitor or custodial worker cleaning the mirror. These nearly invisible smears (phase objects) became visible through Zernike's optical setup. This aligns perfectly with the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3: \"an optical effect in real imagery.\"**\nZernike's discovery was the principle of **phase contrast**. This optical effect converts minute, invisible phase shifts of light (which occur when light passes through a transparent object with varying thickness or refractive index) into visible changes in brightness (amplitude). This allows for the creation of a clear, high-contrast real image of transparent specimens like living cells, which were previously nearly invisible without staining. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the analysis.**\n*   The physicist is **Frits Zernike**.\n*   He is best known for inventing the **phase-contrast microscope**. (Matches Clue 1)\n*   He discovered the optical principle of **phase contrast**. (Matches Clue 2)\n*   This principle is used to create **real images** of transparent objects. (Matches Clue 3)\n*   The discovery is famously associated with an **accidental observation of imperfections (smears) on a concave mirror**, with some popular retellings attributing the observation to a **custodial worker**. (Matches Clues 4 & 5)\n\nAll the points in the question converge on a single historical figure.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
