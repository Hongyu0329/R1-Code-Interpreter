    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Integral**\n\nThe core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nWe must first recognize the form of the integrand, which is `f'(x) / f(x)`. This is a standard integral form. The antiderivative of `f'(x) / f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\n\nIn our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`. Therefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**2. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`∫[a to b] g(x) dx = G(b) - G(a)`, where `G'(x) = g(x)`.\n\nHere, `g(x) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` and `G(x) = ln|F₃(x)|`.\nSo, the value of the integral `V` is:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from `x=0` to `x=1`.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\n`V = ln(|F₃(1) / F₃(0)|)`\n\n**3. Calculate F₃(0)**\n\nWe need to evaluate the function `F₃(x)` at the lower limit `x = 0`. We do this by following the chain of function definitions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`  =>  `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`  =>  `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`  =>  `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`  =>  `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**4. Calculate F₃(1)**\n\nNext, we evaluate `F₃(x)` at the upper limit `x = 1`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`  =>  `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`  =>  `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (Note: The argument of `sin` is in radians)\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`  =>  `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`  =>  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**5. Substitute the Values to Find V**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into our formula for `V`.\n\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` which is approximately 0.693, a positive number.\n*   For `F₃(1)`, `sin(1)` (radian) is approx 0.841, which is positive. `e` raised to a positive power is greater than 1. So `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 2, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is also positive.\n*   Since both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, the absolute value signs are not needed.\n\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ) - ln( ln(2) )`\n`V = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / (ln(2)) ]`\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the numerical value of V and the required result.\n\n*   `sin(1)` ≈ 0.841471\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.841471` ≈ 2.319775\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.319775\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.319775)` ≈ 1.200005\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.693147\n\nNow we calculate V:\n`V = ln[ F₃(1) / F₃(0) ]`\n`V = ln[ 1.200005 / 0.693147 ]`\n`V = ln[1.731235]`\n`V` ≈ 0.548842\n\nFinally, we need to find the closest integer to `10000 * V`:\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548842 = 5488.42`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.42 is 5488.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognizing the integral `∫ f'(x)/f(x) dx = ln|f(x)|` is the crucial first step that simplifies the problem immensely.\n*   Using radians for the trigonometric function `sin(1)`.\n*   Careful step-by-step evaluation of the composite functions `F(x)`.\n*   Maintaining sufficient precision during numerical calculations to ensure the final rounded integer is correct.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
