    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Campaign and Commercial**\nThe question specifies the company (Enron), the year (2000), and the tagline (\"Ask Why\"). The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron to portray itself as an innovative, forward-thinking company that was revolutionizing the market, moving beyond just being an energy company. The commercials were known for their abstract, high-concept style.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Participants in the Specific Commercial**\nResearch into the \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals a specific commercial that featured a discussion between two prominent economists. This was intended to align the Enron brand with intellectual heft and economic expertise. The two individuals featured were Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Nobel Laureate Status of Each Participant**\nThis is a critical step that requires careful attention to the timeline.\n*   **Myron Scholes:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997, along with Robert C. Merton, for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the famous Black-Scholes model). Therefore, at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ironically, Scholes was also a principal at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which suffered a catastrophic collapse in 1998, just two years before he appeared in the ad for Enron, another company destined for a famous collapse.\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He is a very prominent economist and public intellectual. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography.\n    *   **Careful Point:** At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was a famous economist but was not yet a Nobel laureate. However, since he did later win the prize, he fits the description in the question, which asks for \"two Nobel laureates\" without the stipulation that they held the title at the exact moment the commercial was filmed.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who appeared in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial and who are Nobel laureates are Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman. Myron Scholes had the title at the time, while Paul Krugman earned it later. Both are correctly identified as Nobel laureates.\n\n<<<Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman>>>"
