The final answer is composed of two parts corresponding to the two questions asked.

**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Physical Binding):**
The primary interaction hotspots are highly conserved residues within the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain of the human β1 subunit that form a hydrophobic pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the α1 subunit. Based on the canonical sequence (UniProt P54289-1), these residues are:
*   **Leu301** (Leucine at position 301)
*   **Val347** (Valine at position 347)
*   **Phe354** (Phenylalanine at position 354)
*   **Ile379** (Isoleucine at position 379)
*   **Met400** (Methionine at position 400)
*   **Ala412** (Alanine at position 412)
*   **Val415** (Valine at position 415)

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
The key hotspots for modulating the gating properties, specifically for shifting the voltage-dependence of activation, are located in the variable N-terminus of the **β1b isoform** (UniProt P54289-2). These residues are:
*   **K3** (Lysine at position 3)
*   **K5** (Lysine at position 5)
*   **K11** (Lysine at position 11)
*   **K12** (Lysine at position 12)
