    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil (i.e., whether it forms a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat, denoted `a` and `d`. The standard heptad repeat is a seven-amino-acid pattern `(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n`.\n\n*   **Core Positions (`a`, `d`):** These are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. Their size, shape, and polarity dictate how the helices pack together.\n*   **Flanking Positions (`e`, `g`):** These are often charged residues that form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions (`b`, `c`, `f`):** These face the solvent and are less critical for determining the oligomeric state.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Heptad Register**\n\nThe provided sequences are designed peptides. A common design places charged residues like Glutamic acid (E) at the `g` or `e` positions to facilitate electrostatic interactions. Let's test the `g-a-b-c-d-e-f` register, as it places the large hydrophobic residues (like I, L) found in the sequences into the core `a` and `d` positions, which makes the most chemical sense.\n\nRegister: `g-a-b-c-d-e-f`\nPosition: `1-2-3-4-5-6-7`\n\nWe will apply this register to analyze each sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Sequence Individually**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown:** This 28-amino-acid sequence consists of four `EIAxALx` repeats.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   Position `a` (2nd residue): `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position `d` (5th residue): `A` (Alanine)\n*   **Analysis:** The `a=I`, `d=A` pattern places a bulky residue (I) at the `a` position and a small one (A) at the `d` position. This combination packs efficiently into a three-helix bundle.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown:** This sequence is mostly composed of `EIAALKx` repeats but has a key substitution in the third repeat: `ENAALK`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   For the `EIAALK` repeats: `a=I`, `d=L` (Leucine). This `I,L` combination typically favors tetramers.\n    *   For the `ENAALK` repeat: `a=N` (Asparagine), `d=L`.\n*   **Analysis:** The presence of a polar Asparagine (N) residue at a core `a` position is a powerful specificity determinant. The N-H groups in the side chain can form hydrogen bonds with the corresponding `N` on an adjacent helix. This interaction is highly specific and strongly favors a parallel **dimer**, overriding the tetrameric preference of the other repeats.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown:** This sequence is a straightforward repeat of `EIAAIKx`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   Position `a` (2nd residue): `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position `d` (5th residue): `I` (Isoleucine)\n*   **Analysis:** The `a=I`, `d=I` pattern is the canonical signature for a trimer. The bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine side chains at both core positions pack together perfectly in the hydrophobic core of a three-helix bundle.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown:** This sequence is a repeat of `EIQKQLK`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   Position `a` (2nd residue): `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position `d` (5th residue): `Q` (Glutamine)\n*   **Analysis:** Here, a polar residue, Glutamine (Q), is placed in the core `d` position. Such \"polar core\" motifs are key specificity determinants. While a layer of four glutamines can stabilize a tetramer, experimental studies of similar sequences have shown that the `a=I`, `d=Q` combination often results in a **trimer**. This is a known result from coiled-coil design literature.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown:** This sequence is a repeat of `EIAxTLK`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   Position `a` (2nd residue): `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position `d` (5th residue): `T` (Threonine)\n*   **Analysis:** Threonine (T) at a core position is unusual. It is polar (due to the -OH group) and beta-branched (like I and V), which causes steric hindrance. This combination destabilizes tightly packed dimers and trimers. While pentamers are possible, a **tetramer** is a likely outcome, as the four hydroxyl groups of the threonine residues can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network within the core, which helps to offset the steric penalty.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Tetramer (4)**\n\n**Step 3: Final Consolidation**\n\nThe predicted oligomeric states for the sequences are:\n1.  Trimer (3)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Trimer (3)\n4.  Trimer (3)\n5.  Tetramer (4)\n\nThis gives the sequence of numbers `3, 2, 3, 3, 4`. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
