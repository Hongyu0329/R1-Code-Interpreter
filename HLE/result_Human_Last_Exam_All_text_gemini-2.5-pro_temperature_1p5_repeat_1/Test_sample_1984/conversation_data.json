    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium points occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\nFirst, factor the polynomial:\n$$\nf(x) = -x(x^2 - 2x + 1)\n$$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square, $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\nf(x) = -x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$$\nx_1 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = 1\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability, we use the linearization method (Jacobian stability analysis). We compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ is determined by the sign of $f'(x^*)$:\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is needed.\n\nLet's test our two equilibrium points.\n\n*   **Analysis for x = 0:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **Analysis for x = 1:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive. We must analyze the behavior of the solutions near $x=1$ by examining the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n    -   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n        $f(1+\\epsilon) = -(1+\\epsilon)(1+\\epsilon-1)^2 = -(1+\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2$. Since $1+\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\epsilon^2 > 0$, $f(1+\\epsilon) < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves towards 1.\n\n    -   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n        $f(1-\\epsilon) = -(1-\\epsilon)(1-\\epsilon-1)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2$. Since $1-\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\epsilon^2 > 0$, $f(1-\\epsilon) < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves away from 1 (towards 0).\n\n    An equilibrium point is stable only if solutions starting on both sides of the point tend to approach it or stay near it. Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n$$\nm = 1\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
