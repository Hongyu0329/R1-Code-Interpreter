    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct character.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. The key criteria for this character are:\n1.  They have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They describe the religious practices they observed there.\n3.  This description contains a clear allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Novel's Context**\n*The House of the Wolfings* is set during the late Roman Empire and portrays the conflict between a tribe of Goths (the Wolfings) and the invading Roman legions. Most of the Gothic characters would view the Romans as enemies and would not have casually visited a Roman city. A character who has been inside a Roman city must have a special backstory, such as being a former captive.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Characters**\nLet's consider the main characters and their potential to fit the criteria:\n*   **Thiodolf:** He is the war-leader of the Wolfings, wholly dedicated to defending his people. His story is centered on his Gothic heritage and his connection to the supernatural Wood-Sun. It is unlikely he spent time in a Roman city.\n*   **The Wood-Sun:** She is a supernatural being, a valkyrie-like figure. Her domain is the forest and the world of the gods, not Roman cities.\n*   **Otur and Asmund:** They are Thiodolf's foster-sons. Their backstories are not as central as Thiodolf's, which leaves open the possibility of past experiences that differ from the other Wolfings.\n*   **Other Wolfings:** Most are portrayed as members of the tribe with no known history of living among the Romans.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Specific Scene in the Novel**\nThe most likely candidate is a character who has been a captive of the Romans. This background is explicitly given to the character **Otur**. In Chapter IX, titled \"Otur tells of the Wolf and the Wood-woman,\" Otur recounts his past. He explains that he was captured by the Romans as a boy and lived among them as a slave before escaping.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Character's Description**\nIn this chapter, Otur is telling stories to Thiodolf's young daughter. He describes his time in a Roman town and what he saw in their temples. He gives the following specific description of a Roman religious image:\n*\"...in one of their temples I saw the image of a Wolf, and she was giving suck to two man-children, whom they hold to be the first fathers of their Folk.\"*\n\n**Step 6: Connect the Description to the Myth**\n*   **\"the image of a Wolf, and she was giving suck to two man-children\"**: This is a direct and unmistakable description of the famous Roman statue of the Capitoline Wolf nursing the infants Romulus and Remus.\n*   **\"whom they hold to be the first fathers of their Folk\"**: This confirms that the character understands the image represents the foundation myth of the Roman people.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the direct textual evidence from Chapter IX, the character who visited a Roman city (as a captive) and describes their religious practices, specifically mentioning the she-wolf nursing two infants (Romulus and Remus), is Otur.\n\n<<<Otur>>>"
