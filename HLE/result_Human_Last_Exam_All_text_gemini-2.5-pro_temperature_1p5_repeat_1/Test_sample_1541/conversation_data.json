    "Answering this competitive programming problem requires finding the most memory-efficient C solution and calculating the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The goal is to sort the numbers (summands) in a given sum string. The numbers are guaranteed to be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The input is a string like \"3+1+2+4\", and the output should be the sorted sum \"1+2+3+4\".\n\n2.  **Identify Memory Hotspots:** A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array. Given the maximum string length of 1000, this would immediately use `char s[1001]` which is 1001 bytes. Another approach would be to parse the numbers into an integer array, which for a length 999 string (\"1+1+...+1\") would mean 500 numbers. An integer array `int nums[500]` would take `500 * 4 = 2000` bytes. To be \"most memory-efficient\", we must avoid storing the whole string or the list of numbers.\n\n3.  **Devise a Memory-Efficient Strategy (Counting Sort):**\n    *   **Input Processing:** Instead of reading the whole string at once, we can process it character by character using `getchar()`. This function reads a single character from the input stream and avoids the need for a large buffer.\n    *   **Counting:** Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can simply count the occurrences of each. We will use four counter variables.\n    *   **Output Generation:** After counting, we can print the result directly. We loop from 1 to 4. For each number, we print it as many times as we counted it, separating each printed number with a '+'. We must be careful to not print a '+' before the very first number or after the very last one. A simple flag variable can manage this.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Data Type Selection:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest appropriate data type for each variable.\n    *   The maximum string length is ~1000, which means the maximum number of any single digit is `(999+1)/2 = 500`. A `char` (range 0-255) is too small for the counters. A `short int` (range up to 32,767, size 2 bytes) is sufficient.\n    *   The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. So the variable to hold its return value must be an `int` (4 bytes).\n    *   The loop counters for printing will not exceed 500, so a `short int` (2 bytes) is adequate.\n    *   A flag variable (for handling the '+') can be implemented with the `_Bool` type (1 byte).\n\n2.  **Variable Minimization:** The program needs variables for:\n    *   Counting the four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   Reading input characters one by one.\n    *   A flag for proper '+' placement during printing.\n    *   A loop counter for printing.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nLet's calculate the total memory `m` for the variables needed in the most memory-efficient C program. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(short) = 2`, `sizeof(int) = 4`, and `sizeof(_Bool) = 1`.\n\n*   **Counters for numbers:**\n    *   `short count1;` -> 2 bytes\n    *   `short count2;` -> 2 bytes\n    *   `short count3;` -> 2 bytes\n    *   `short count4;` -> 2 bytes\n    *   Sub-total: `4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n*   **Input handling variable:**\n    *   `int c;` (for `getchar()`) -> 4 bytes.\n\n*   **Printing logic variables:**\n    *   `_Bool is_first;` (flag) -> 1 byte.\n    *   `short i;` (loop counter) -> 2 bytes.\n    *   Sub-total: `1 + 2 = 3` bytes.\n\n*   **Total Memory (m):**\n    `m = (memory for counters) + (memory for input) + (memory for printing logic)`\n    `m = 8 + 4 + 3`\n    `m = 15` bytes.\n\nThis is the minimal memory required for variables to solve the problem as described.\n\n<<<15>>>"
