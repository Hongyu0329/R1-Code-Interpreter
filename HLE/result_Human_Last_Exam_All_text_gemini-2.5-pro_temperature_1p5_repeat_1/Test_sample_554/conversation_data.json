    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we must first understand the structure of a standard nanocar and the meaning of the prefix \"perfluoro-\".\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Nanocar:** This refers to a molecule designed to resemble a macroscopic car, operating at the nanoscale. The most famous example is the one developed by the research group of Professor James Tour at Rice University.\n*   **Perfluoro-:** This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means that all the hydrogen (H) atoms in the parent organic molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. For example, methane (CH₄) becomes perfluoromethane (CF₄), also known as carbon tetrafluoride.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Parent Molecule (the Nanocar)**\n\n*   The original and most well-known nanocar, synthesized in 2005, consists of four main components: a chassis, four axles, and four wheels.\n*   **Wheels:** The wheels are spherical fullerene molecules (C₆₀). Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon, meaning they are composed entirely of carbon atoms. Therefore, the wheels contain **zero** hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Chassis and Axles:** The \"body\" of the nanocar is an organic framework made of carbon and hydrogen that connects the four fullerene wheels. To find the number of fluorine atoms in a *perfluoro*nanocar, we must first count the number of hydrogen atoms in this original chassis-axle framework.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Hydrogen Atoms on the Nanocar Framework**\n\nWe need to analyze the specific structure of the chassis and axle assembly of the original nanocar.\n\n*   **Chassis:** The central part of the chassis is a benzene ring that is substituted at four positions (1, 2, 4, and 5). The two unsubstituted positions (3 and 6) each have one hydrogen atom. This gives a total of **2 hydrogens** on the central chassis ring.\n*   **Axles/Arms:** There are four identical arms extending from the chassis to the wheels. Let's analyze one arm:\n    *   Each arm is a chain containing two phenyl (benzene) rings and a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   Each of the two phenyl rings in the arm is substituted at two positions (the points where it connects to the rest of the chain). A benzene ring has 6 positions, so a di-substituted ring has 6 - 2 = 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂-) by definition contains **2 hydrogen** atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogens on a single arm is 4 (first phenyl ring) + 4 (second phenyl ring) + 2 (methylene group) = **10 hydrogens**.\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** With four identical arms, the total number of hydrogens from the arms is 4 arms × 10 hydrogens/arm = **40 hydrogens**.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the entire nanocar molecule is the sum of hydrogens on the chassis and the arms: 2 + 40 = **42 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms in a Perfluoronanocar**\n\n*   According to the definition of \"perfluoro-\", every single hydrogen atom in the parent molecule is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n*   Since we determined that a standard nanocar has 42 hydrogen atoms, a perfluoronanocar would be created by replacing each of these 42 hydrogen atoms with a fluorine atom.\n*   Therefore, a perfluoronanocar would contain **42 fluorine atoms**.\n\n<<<42>>>"
