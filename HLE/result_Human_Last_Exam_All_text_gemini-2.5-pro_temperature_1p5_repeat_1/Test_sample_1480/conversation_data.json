    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This sets the context. In a Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System, membership grades themselves are Type-2 fuzzy sets. In an *Interval* Type-3 system, these membership grades are simplified to Interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. This implies a high level of uncertainty representation. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values, suggesting we are analyzing a specific instance or a simplified cross-section of this complex system.\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`:** This is the firing level (or firing strength) of the k-th rule for a given crisp input `x'`. It represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied. In a full IT3 FLS, `Phi_k(x′)` would be an Interval Type-2 fuzzy set, but here it has been simplified to a single value of 0.7.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`:** This is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k` (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule. Similar to the firing level, this would be a complex set in a true IT3 FLS, but it is given as a single value of 0.9.\n*   **t-norm operation:** This is a class of binary functions used in fuzzy logic to model the logical AND (intersection). The result of a t-norm operation is often used to \"activate\" or \"clip\" the consequent fuzzy set based on the antecedent's firing strength.\n*   **Rule Activation Level:** The question asks for the rule activation level *using* the two provided values and a t-norm. This means we need to combine the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership degree. This operation determines the resulting membership grade for the output of that specific rule.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Appropriate t-norm\n\nThe problem states to use \"a t-norm operation\" without specifying which one. In fuzzy logic, several t-norms exist, but the most common and standard one, especially in the context of Mamdani-style inference, is the **minimum (min) t-norm**. Other common t-norms are the algebraic product and the Łukasiewicz t-norm. In the absence of further information, the `min` operator is the conventional choice.\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n\n### Step 3: Applying the t-norm Operation\n\nWe need to calculate the result of the t-norm applied to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership grade.\n\n*   **Value 1 (Antecedent Firing Level):** `a = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   **Value 2 (Consequent Membership):** `b = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm:\nActivation Level = `min(a, b)`\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\nActivation Level = `0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Simplification:** The most crucial point is recognizing that despite the \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" terminology, the problem is reduced to a simple Type-1 calculation because crisp numbers are provided. One must not get lost in the theoretical complexity of IT3 FS.\n2.  **Operator Choice:** The choice of the t-norm is key. Using the standard `min` operator is the most logical interpretation. If a different t-norm like the algebraic product were used, the result would be `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, `min` is the most common for this type of operation (implication).\n3.  **Terminology:** The \"rule activation level\" is the result of applying the antecedent's firing strength to the consequent set. It's the combined value, not just the antecedent's firing strength alone.\n\n### Conclusion of the Analysis\n\nThe process is to take the antecedent firing strength (`0.7`) and the membership value from the consequent set (`0.9`) and combine them using the standard minimum t-norm. The result of `min(0.7, 0.9)` is `0.7`. This value represents the membership grade of the output `y_j` after the k-th rule has been fired and its consequent \"activated\" or scaled by the firing strength.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
