    "Answering this question requires understanding the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $l=3$. We need to classify all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations and then determine which of them are irreducible.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the algebra and its representations**\nThe algebra is the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ (often just denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$), which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$. For $q$ a primitive $l=3$-rd root of unity, it is generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with relations including $E^3=F^3=0$ and $K^3=1$.\n\nThe category of finite-dimensional representations of this algebra decomposes into blocks. A block is a subcategory that has no extensions to other blocks. For an indecomposable representation, it belongs to exactly one block. We need to classify the isomorphism classes of all indecomposable representations.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the blocks and the indecomposable representations**\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is well-known. The blocks are indexed by the central characters of the algebra. For $l=3$, there are four blocks:\n\n1.  **The Principal Block ($\\mathcal{B}_0$)**: This is the block containing the trivial representation. Its simple objects (irreducible representations) are:\n    *   $L(1)$: The 1-dimensional trivial representation.\n    *   $L(2)$: A 2-dimensional irreducible representation.\n    The principal block contains a countably infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. Apart from $L(1)$ and $L(2)$, all other indecomposable representations in this block are reducible. These include the projective covers $P(1)$ and $P(2)$ of the simples, and infinite families of modules forming \"tubes\" in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n\n2.  **Regular Blocks ($\\mathcal{B}_\\lambda$)**: For each 3rd root of unity $\\lambda \\in \\{1, q, q^2\\}$, there is a block $\\mathcal{B}_\\lambda$. The indecomposable representations in each of these blocks are parametrized by a complex number $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Let's denote them by $V(\\lambda, \\beta)$.\n    *   For a fixed $\\lambda$, the representations $V(\\lambda, \\beta)$ are all 3-dimensional.\n    *   $V(\\lambda, \\beta)$ is **irreducible** if and only if $\\beta \\neq 0$.\n    *   $V(\\lambda, 0)$ is indecomposable but **reducible**.\n    So, for each $\\lambda \\in \\{1, q, q^2\\}$, the block $\\mathcal{B}_\\lambda$ contains a one-parameter family of irreducible representations (parametrized by $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$) and one additional indecomposable representation that is reducible ($V(\\lambda, 0)$).\n\n**Step 3: Address the \"percentage of objects\" question**\nThe set of all indecomposable representations $C$ is the union of indecomposables from all blocks.\n*   Number of irreducible objects: $2$ (from $\\mathcal{B}_0$) + $3 \\times |\\mathbb{C}^*|$ (from the $\\mathcal{B}_\\lambda$'s). This is an infinite number with the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Number of indecomposable objects: $\\aleph_0$ (from $\\mathcal{B}_0$) + $3 \\times (|\\mathbb{C}^*| + 1)$ (from the $\\mathcal{B}_\\lambda$'s). This is also of cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nA simple ratio of the number of objects is not well-defined ($\\mathfrak{c}/\\mathfrak{c}$). The phrasing of the question suggests a more nuanced interpretation. A standard way to approach such problems in representation theory is to consider the geometry of the moduli space of representations.\n\n**Step 4: Geometric interpretation using the moduli space of representations**\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be the space parametrizing the isomorphism classes of all indecomposable representations. The block decomposition of the category implies that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a disjoint union of four components, one for each block:\n$\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{M}_0 \\cup \\mathcal{M}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{M}_q \\cup \\mathcal{M}_{q^2}$.\nThese four components are the irreducible components of the space $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n1.  **Component $\\mathcal{M}_0$ (Principal Block)**: This component consists of a discrete, countably infinite set of points, each corresponding to an indecomposable representation in $\\mathcal{B}_0$. It is a 0-dimensional component.\n2.  **Components $\\mathcal{M}_\\lambda$ (Regular Blocks)**: For each $\\lambda \\in \\{1, q, q^2\\}$, the indecomposable modules are parametrized by $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means $\\mathcal{M}_\\lambda$ is isomorphic to the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1_\\mathbb{C}$. These are three 1-dimensional components.\n\nThe question \"what percentage of the objects of C are irreducible?\" can be interpreted as: what percentage of the irreducible components of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}$ are generically irreducible? A component is \"generically irreducible\" if the representations corresponding to a dense open subset of its points are irreducible.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze each component for generic irreducibility**\n\n*   **Component $\\mathcal{M}_0$**: Out of a countably infinite number of objects in this component, only two are irreducible. The set of irreducible representations is a finite subset, which is not dense. Thus, a generic object in this component is **not** irreducible.\n*   **Components $\\mathcal{M}_\\lambda$**: For each of the three components $\\mathcal{M}_\\lambda \\cong \\mathbb{C}$, the representations are irreducible for all points where the parameter $\\beta \\neq 0$. The set of irreducible representations corresponds to $\\mathbb{C}^* = \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is a Zariski-open dense subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, a generic object in each of these three components **is** irreducible.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final percentage**\nWe have a total of 4 irreducible components in the moduli space of indecomposable representations.\nOut of these 4 components, 3 of them are generically irreducible.\nThe percentage of components that are generically irreducible is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Number of generically irreducible components}}{\\text{Total number of components}} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThis corresponds to 75%."
