Based on the role of interleukin-15 in promoting a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype with enhanced persistence and resistance to exhaustion, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an **enhanced and more sustained release of key effector cytokines**, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15 (e.g., using IL-2). This improved cytokine release profile reflects the superior functional fitness and polyfunctionality of the memory-like CAR T cells.
