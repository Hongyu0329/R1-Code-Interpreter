    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. As of 2002, these included:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) was first synthesized in 2006, so it is not considered for the year 2002. Even if it were, as a synthetic and extremely unstable element, its natural abundance is effectively zero.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to find the noble gas with the lowest total mass across the Earth's atmosphere, crust, and oceans combined. The element with the smallest total mass will inherently have the smallest percentage of the Earth's total mass.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nThe vast majority of noble gases on Earth are found in the atmosphere. Their atmospheric abundance is a very good indicator of their overall abundance.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** Although it is the second most abundant element in the universe, on Earth, much of it has escaped into space due to its low mass. Its atmospheric concentration is about 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer than the above gases, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Among the stable noble gases, Xenon is the rarest. Its atmospheric concentration is only about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Production:** Radon is continuously produced in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.\n*   **Decay:** Because of its short half-life, it decays away very quickly.\n*   **Steady-State Amount:** This means that at any given moment, the total amount of radon present on Earth (the \"steady-state\" amount) is extremely small.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Candidates: Xenon vs. Radon**\nBased on the atmospheric abundance of stable gases, Xenon is the rarest. Now we must compare it with the total amount of Radon.\n\n*   **Mass of Xenon:** The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be over 2 trillion tonnes (2 x 10^12 kg).\n*   **Mass of Radon:** The total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given time is estimated to be only a few thousand tonnes.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAlthough Xenon is the rarest stable noble gas, the total amount of Radon on Earth at any single moment is vastly smaller—by a factor of millions—due to its high radioactivity and very short half-life. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas. The year 2002 does not change this fact, as the natural abundances have remained effectively constant.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to distinguish between stable gases and radioactive gases with short half-lives.\n*   The \"rarest\" refers to the total amount present on Earth at any given time, not the total amount ever produced.\n*   The date 2002 is primarily relevant for excluding the synthetic element Oganesson.\n\nThe final answer is **Radon**.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
