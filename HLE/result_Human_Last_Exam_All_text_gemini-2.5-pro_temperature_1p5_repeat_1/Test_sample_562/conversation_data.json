    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\n\nThe character in question is 謄. We need to break it down into its constituent parts to identify the radical. Visually, 謄 is composed of two parts in a left-right arrangement:\n*   Left side (called a \"hen\"): 月\n*   Right side (called a \"tsukuri\"): 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\n\nIn kanji with a left-right structure, the radical is almost always the left-hand component (the \"hen\"). Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 月.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Correct Name of the Radical**\n\nThis is the most crucial step, as the radical 月 has two distinct origins and names depending on context.\n\n*   **Origin 1: From the character 月 (tsuki, meaning \"moon\").** When the radical comes from \"moon,\" it is typically called `tsuki` (つき) or `tsukihen` (つきへん, \"moon on the left\"). This radical appears in characters related to time, periods, or the moon itself, like 朗 (clear) or 期 (period).\n\n*   **Origin 2: From the character 肉 (niku, meaning \"flesh\" or \"meat\").** This radical, which is a simplified form of 肉, also looks identical to 月. To distinguish it, it is given the specific name `nikuzuki` (にくづき), which literally means \"meat-moon.\" It is found in many characters related to the body, such as 腹 (abdomen), 腕 (arm), and 脳 (brain).\n\n**Careful Point:** Although the character 謄 (meaning \"copy, transcribe\") is not semantically related to the body or flesh, it is standardly classified under this `nikuzuki` variant of the radical. The semantic link in complex kanji is often obscured over time. The key is that it's not the \"moon\" radical. Therefore, the more specific and correct name for the radical in 謄 is `nikuzuki`. While one might also call it `tsukihen` based purely on its shape and position, `nikuzuki` is the more precise technical term used in Japanese lexicography to identify this specific radical form.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\n\nThe Japanese name for the radical is にくづき. We need to convert this into Hepburn romanization.\n*   に = ni\n*   く = ku\n*   づ = zu\n*   き = ki\n\nCombining these parts gives the final transcription.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\n1.  Character: 謄\n2.  Radical component: 月\n3.  Radical specific name: にくづき (Nikuzuki)\n4.  Hepburn Transcription: **Nikuzuki**\n\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
