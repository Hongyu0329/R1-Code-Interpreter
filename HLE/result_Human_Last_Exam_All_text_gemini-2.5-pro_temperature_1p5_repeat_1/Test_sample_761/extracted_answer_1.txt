No. Polynucleotides and polysaccharides are fundamentally different classes of macromolecules. The repeating monomer of a polysaccharide is a monosaccharide (a sugar), while the repeating monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide (composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base). Consequently, their backbone structures, the chemical bonds linking the monomers (glycosidic vs. phosphodiester), and their elemental composition are all distinct.
