Let `σ(x, u) = |x - c| / sqrt(-2 * ln(u))`. The mathematical formulation that characterizes the lower and upper bounds of the vertical cross-sections (`μ_lower_Ã(x, u)` and `μ_upper_Ã(x, u)`) of a Gaussian Interval Type-3 Membership Function at a fixed primary input `x` and for a secondary input `u` is given by the pair of equations: `μ_lower_Ã(x, u) = 2 * [σ(x, u) - σ₁] / (σ₂ - σ₁)` and `μ_upper_Ã(x, u) = 2 * [σ₂ - σ(x, u)] / (σ₂ - σ₁)`. Here, `c` is the center of the Gaussian, and `σ₁` and `σ₂` (with `σ₁ < σ₂`) are the parameters defining the uncertainty interval for the standard deviation.
