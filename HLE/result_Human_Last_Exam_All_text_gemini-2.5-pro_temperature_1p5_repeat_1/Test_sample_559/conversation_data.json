    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the System of Differential Equations**\n    We are given the system:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t)-3u(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n    $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n    This can be written as:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n    $u' = u^3 - u^2$\n    We are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points**\n    Equilibrium points are solutions to $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: u = 0**\n        Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n        $d' = 2d^2 + 0 \\cdot d + 0 = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$.\n        So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n    *   **Case 2: u = 1**\n        Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n        $d' = 2d^2 + (5-3)d + 1-1 = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n        This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n        So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Linearize and Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $V(u, d) = (u^3 - u^2, 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3)$.\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    *   **At (1, 0):**\n        $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 0 + 4-3 & 0+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n    *   **At (1, -1):**\n        $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n    *   **At (0, 0):**\n        $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a degenerate point.\n\n4.  **Identify the Separatrix**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We have a saddle point at $(1, -1)$.\n\n    Let's find the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at $(1, -1)$:\n    *   For $\\lambda_1=1$ (unstable manifold):\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\Rightarrow -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\Rightarrow v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   For $\\lambda_2=-2$ (stable manifold):\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 1-(-2) & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-(-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\Rightarrow 3v_u = 0$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    \n    The stable manifold is tangent to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to the vertical line $u=1$. Indeed, setting $u=1$ gives $u'=0$, so trajectories on this line stay there. This line is a separatrix.\n    The unstable manifold leaves the saddle point tangent to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has a slope of $v_d/v_u = -2$.\n\n5.  **Search for an Invariant Curve**\n    The structure of the $d'$ equation is a Riccati equation in $d$. Let's test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=f(u)$. A common technique for such problems is to try a solution of the form $d=au^k$. Let's try $d=au^2$.\n    If $d=au^2$, then $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(au^2) = 2au \\cdot u' = 2au(u^3-u^2) = 2au^4-2au^3$.\n    Substitute $d=au^2$ into the first ODE:\n    $d' = 2(au^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2) + u^4-u^3$\n    $d' = 2a^2u^4 + 5au^4-3au^3 + u^4-u^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 - (3a+1)u^3$.\n    Equating the two expressions for $d'$:\n    $2au^4-2au^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 - (3a+1)u^3$.\n    For this equality to hold for all $u$, the coefficients of each power of $u$ must be equal.\n    *   Coefficient of $u^3$: $-2a = -(3a+1) \\Rightarrow -2a = -3a-1 \\Rightarrow a = -1$.\n    *   Coefficient of $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2+5a+1$. Let's check if $a=-1$ satisfies this: $2(-1) = 2(-1)^2+5(-1)+1 \\Rightarrow -2 = 2-5+1 \\Rightarrow -2 = -2$. It holds.\n\n    Thus, $d=-u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system (an invariant curve).\n\n6.  **Verify that the Invariant Curve is a Separatrix**\n    Let's check if this curve is related to the saddle point.\n    *   The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1, -1)$. It connects a degenerate point to the saddle point.\n    *   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At the saddle point $(1,-1)$, the slope is $-2(1) = -2$.\n    *   This slope matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ at the saddle point.\n    *   Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ (for one branch).\n\n    The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix. It divides the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behaviors. The question asks for \"the\" separatrix, and this non-linear invariant curve connected to the saddle point is the most significant one.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
