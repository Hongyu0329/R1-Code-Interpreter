    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring\n\nKnot coloring is a method used to create a knot invariant. To color a knot diagram, we assign an integer (a \"color\") from a set `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` to each arc of the knot. The coloring must follow a specific rule at every crossing.\n\nThe standard rule for an *n*-coloring is:\nAt any crossing, let the color of the over-arc be `c`, and the colors of the two under-arcs be `a` and `b`. The colors must satisfy the equation:\n`a + b ≡ 2c (mod n)`\n\nA coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs are assigned the same color. This is always a valid solution for any knot and any `n`. A knot is said to be *n*-colorable if it admits a \"nontrivial\" coloring, meaning at least two different colors are used.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the \"Algebraic Structure\"\n\nThe set of `n` colors `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` together with the operation derived from the coloring rule forms an algebraic structure known as a **quandle**. The quandle operation `▷` can be defined as `a ▷ c = b`, where `b` is the color of the resultant arc when arc `a` passes under arc `c`. From our coloring rule `a + b = 2c`, we can solve for `b`: `b = 2c - a`.\n\nSo, the operation is `a ▷ c = 2c - a (mod n)`. The set of `n` colors with this operation is called the **dihedral quandle**, denoted `R_n`.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the smallest such structure that allows a nontrivial coloring of the figure eight knot. This means we are looking for the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure eight knot is `n`-colorable.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Coloring Equations for the Figure Eight Knot\n\nThe figure eight knot (also known as knot 4₁) has 4 crossings and 4 arcs. Let's label the arcs `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`. By examining a standard diagram of the figure eight knot, we can write a system of linear equations based on the coloring rule.\n\nFor a standard diagram, the equations are:\n1.  At crossing 1: `x₁ + x₃ ≡ 2x₂ (mod n)`\n2.  At crossing 2: `x₃ + x₄ ≡ 2x₁ (mod n)`\n3.  At crossing 3: `x₂ + x₄ ≡ 2x₃ (mod n)`\n4.  At crossing 4: `x₁ + x₂ ≡ 2x₄ (mod n)`\n\nRearranging these into a standard form `(Coefficient Matrix) * (Vector of variables) ≡ 0`, we get:\n1.  `x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃      ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n2.  `-2x₁      + x₃ + x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n3.  `     x₂ - 2x₃ + x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n4.  `x₁ + x₂      - 2x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n\n### Step 4: Determining Colorability using the Knot Determinant\n\nA knot `K` has a nontrivial `n`-coloring if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and the **determinant of the knot**, `det(K)`, is greater than 1. That is, `gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`.\n\nThe determinant of the knot is found by taking the absolute value of the determinant of any `(m-1) x (m-1)` submatrix (or minor) of the `m x m` coefficient matrix from the coloring equations. For the figure eight knot, `m=4`.\n\nLet's use the submatrix formed by deleting the last row and last column of the coefficient matrix:\n`A' = [[ 1, -2,  1], [-2,  0,  1], [ 0,  1, -2]]`\n\nNow, we calculate the determinant of this matrix `A'`:\n`det(A') = 1 * (0 * (-2) - 1 * 1) - (-2) * ((-2) * (-2) - 1 * 0) + 1 * ((-2) * 1 - 0 * 0)`\n`det(A') = 1 * (-1) - (-2) * (4) + 1 * (-2)`\n`det(A') = -1 + 8 - 2`\n`det(A') = 5`\n\nSo, the determinant of the figure eight knot is `det(K) = |5| = 5`.\n(Note: This value can also be obtained by evaluating the knot's Alexander polynomial, `Δ(t) = t² - 3t + 1`, at `t = -1`, giving `|(-1)² - 3(-1) + 1| = |1 + 3 + 1| = 5`.)\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` such that the figure eight knot is `n`-colorable. Using the condition from the previous step:\n`gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`\n`gcd(n, 5) > 1`\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, the only integers `n` that have a common divisor with 5 (other than 1) are multiples of 5. The smallest integer `n > 1` that is a multiple of 5 is `n = 5`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of colors required for a nontrivial coloring of the figure eight knot is 5.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure eight knot is the dihedral quandle `R₅`. This structure consists of the set of colors `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The number of elements in this set is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
