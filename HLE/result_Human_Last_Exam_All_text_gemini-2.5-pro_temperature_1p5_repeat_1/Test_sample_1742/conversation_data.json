    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Indecomposable Modules**\n\nThe algebra $A$ corresponds to the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a path algebra of a Dynkin quiver of type $A_3$. It is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra of finite representation type.\n\nThere are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2}=6$ non-isomorphic indecomposable $A$-modules. We can denote them by their composition factors or by their corresponding interval representations $M(i,j)$. Let's list them with their dimension vectors:\n1.  $S_1 = M(1,1) = (1,0,0)$. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = M(2,2) = (0,1,0)$.\n3.  $S_3 = M(3,3) = (0,0,1)$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $P_2 = M(2,3) = (0,1,1)$.\n5.  $I_2 = M(1,2) = (1,1,0)$.\n6.  $P_1 = M(1,3) = (1,1,1)$. This is also the injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe indecomposable projective modules are $P_1, P_2, P_3$.\nThe indecomposable injective modules are $I_1, I_2, I_3$.\nNote that $P_3=S_3$, $I_1=S_1$, and $P_1=I_3$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting Modules**\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of tilting and $\\tau$-tilting modules coincide. A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if it satisfies:\n1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 ($\\text{pd}_A(T) \\le 1$). This is true for any module over a hereditary algebra.\n2.  $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$.\n3.  $T$ has $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands (since there are 3 simple modules).\n\nA module $T$ is **$\\tau$-tilting** if it is $\\tau$-rigid ($\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T)=0$) and has $n=3$ summands. For hereditary algebras, this is equivalent to being a tilting module.\n\n**Step 3: Understand Slice Modules**\n\nThere are two common ways to define a slice module for a hereditary algebra:\n1.  **Combinatorial Definition:** A slice module is the direct sum of all indecomposable modules in a **slice** of the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. A slice is a convex set of vertices that intersects each $\\tau$-orbit exactly once.\n2.  **Homological Definition:** A tilting module $T$ is a slice module if its endomorphism algebra $\\text{End}_A(T)$ is a **tilted algebra**, which is equivalent to the condition $\\text{gldim}(\\text{End}_A(T))\\leq 2$. For hereditary algebras, this is equivalent to $T$ being a tilting module with $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$.\n\nSince a tilting module by definition satisfies $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$, the homological definition seems redundant. However, the term \"tilting module\" is sometimes used more broadly (e.g., in the context of $\\tau$-tilting theory where the Ext-condition is dropped). The question distinguishes between \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" and \"slice module\". This suggests we should consider $\\tau$-tilting modules (which are not necessarily classical tilting modules with the Ext-vanishing condition) and check which ones are not slice modules (where \"slice\" implies the Ext-vanishing condition).\n\nSo, a $\\tau$-tilting module $T$ is a slice module if and only if $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$. The question asks for the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is NOT a slice module. This implies we are looking for a $\\tau$-tilting module $T$ for which $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify all $\\tau$-tilting modules**\n\nFor this algebra, there is a known correspondence: a module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^3 T_i$ is $\\tau$-tilting if and only if the g-vectors of its summands, $\\{g(T_1), g(T_2), g(T_3)\\}$, form a basis for $K_0(\\text{proj} A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nThe g-vectors can be calculated from minimal projective presentations.\n*   $g(P_i) = [P_i]$. So $g(P_1)=(1,0,0)$, $g(P_2)=(0,1,0)$, $g(P_3)=(0,0,1)$ in the basis $\\{[P_1], [P_2], [P_3]\\}$.\n*   $0 \\to P_2 \\to P_1 \\to S_1 \\to 0 \\implies g(S_1)=[P_1]-[P_2]=(1,-1,0)$.\n*   $0 \\to P_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to 0 \\implies g(S_2)=[P_2]-[P_3]=(0,1,-1)$.\n*   $0 \\to P_3 \\to P_1 \\to I_2 \\to 0 \\implies g(I_2)=[P_1]-[P_3]=(1,0,-1)$.\n\nThere are 14 such modules in total. We don't need to list all of them. We need to find the one that is \"not a slice\".\n\n**Step 5: Identify the unique module**\n\nThe question's use of the word \"unique\" suggests we should look for a candidate with a special property that distinguishes it from other potential non-slice modules. Let's analyze the combinatorial slices and the corresponding modules. For the linearly oriented quiver $A_n$, there are $n+1$ slices. For $A_3$, there are 4 slices:\n1.  The projective slice $\\mathcal{S}_P = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$. Module $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n2.  The injective slice $\\mathcal{S}_I = \\{I_1, I_2, I_3\\} = \\{S_1, I_2, P_1\\}$. Module $T_I = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$.\n3.  A \"mixed\" slice $\\mathcal{S}_1 = \\{P_2, P_3, I_1\\} = \\{P_2, S_3, S_1\\}$. Module $T_1 = P_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus S_1$.\n4.  Another \"mixed\" slice $\\mathcal{S}_2 = \\{P_3, I_1, I_2\\} = \\{S_3, S_1, I_2\\}$. Module $T_2 = S_3 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus I_2$.\n\nThese four modules are formed from the combinatorial slices of the AR-quiver. Let's check their \"slice module\" status using the homological condition, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$. To do this, we need to know the non-vanishing $\\text{Ext}^1$ groups between indecomposable modules. The crucial ones are:\n*   $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_2, S_1) \\neq 0$ (the module $I_2$ is the non-trivial extension).\n*   $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_2, S_3) \\neq 0$ (the module $P_2$ is the non-trivial extension).\n*   $\\text{Ext}_A^1(I_2, S_3) \\neq 0$ (the module $P_1$ is the non-trivial extension).\n*   $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_1, P_2) \\neq 0$ (this can be shown from the projective resolution of $S_1$).\n\nNow, let's test the four modules from the combinatorial slices:\n1.  $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$: Since all summands are projective, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_P, T_P)=0$. This is a slice module.\n2.  $T_I = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$: Since all summands are injective, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_I, T_I)=0$. This is a slice module.\n3.  $T_1 = P_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus S_1$: We check $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_{1,i}, T_{1,j})$ for all summands. We need to check $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_1, P_2)$. As established, this is non-zero. Therefore, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_1, T_1) \\neq 0$. This is NOT a slice module.\n4.  $T_2 = S_3 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus I_2$: Since $S_3$ is projective, and $S_1, I_2$ are injective, all $\\text{Ext}^1$ groups between these summands are zero. $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_2, T_2)=0$. This is a slice module.\n\nThis analysis provides a unique candidate. Among the four modules that correspond to combinatorial slices, exactly one of them, $T_1 = P_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus S_1$, fails the homological condition for being a slice module. This provides the uniqueness requested in the question.\n\nThis module is a valid $\\tau$-tilting module. Its g-vectors are $g(P_2)=(0,1,0)$, $g(S_3)=(0,0,1)$, and $g(S_1)=(1,-1,0)$. The determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is 1, so they form a basis, confirming it is a $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module which corresponds to a combinatorial slice but is not a homological slice module is $P_2 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus I_1$.\n\n<<<I_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3>>>"
