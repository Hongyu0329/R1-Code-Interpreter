    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the generalized quaternion group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128}$ with the presentation:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be partitioned into two sets:\n1.  The elements of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\}$. This subgroup has order 64.\n2.  The elements in the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle = \\{yx^i \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\}$. This set has 64 elements.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if it is the image of a power map, i.e., there exists an integer $k$ such that $H = G^{(k)} = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nIt is important to note that the set $G^{(k)}$ is not always a subgroup. We need to find all integers $k$ for which $G^{(k)}$ is a subgroup and then count how many distinct subgroups are formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the set of k-th powers in Q_128**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^{(k)} = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in Q_{128}\\}$ for an arbitrary integer $k$. We can do this by considering the two types of elements in $Q_{128}$.\n\n1.  **Powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**: For an element $g = x^i$, its $k$-th power is $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. The set of all such powers is $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\}$, which forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Powers of elements in $y\\langle x \\rangle$**: For an element $g = yx^i$, let's compute its powers.\n    First, find the square of $g$:\n    $(yx^i)^2 = yx^i yx^i = y(x^i y)x^i = y(y x^{-i})x^i = y^2 x^{-i} x^i = y^2$.\n    Using the group relation $y^2 = x^{32}$, we have $(yx^i)^2 = x^{32}$. Notice this result is independent of $i$.\n    Now, the $k$-th power of $g$ depends on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n    *   If $k$ is even, say $k=2m$:\n        $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m} = ((yx^i)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$. All elements in $y\\langle x \\rangle$ have the same $k$-th power when $k$ is even.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, say $k=2m+1$:\n        $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m+1} = ((yx^i)^2)^m (yx^i) = (x^{32})^m yx^i = x^{32m} yx^i$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Power Subgroups for different k**\n\nWe consider two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: k is odd**\n    In this case, $G^{(k)}$ is the union of two sets of powers:\n    - From $\\langle x \\rangle$: Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64)=1$. Thus, the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle = \\langle x^1 \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$.\n    - From $y\\langle x \\rangle$: The powers are of the form $x^{32m} yx^i$. As $i$ varies from 0 to 63, $yx^i$ covers all elements of the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$. The term $x^{32m}$ just permutes these elements within the coset (since $x^{32m} y = y x^{-32m}$). So, the set of powers is exactly the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, for any odd $k$, $G^{(k)} = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup y\\langle x \\rangle = Q_{128}$. The group itself is a subgroup, so $Q_{128}$ is a power subgroup. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even**\n    Let $k=2m$. In this case, $G^{(k)}$ is the union of two sets:\n    - From $\\langle x \\rangle$: The set of powers is the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n    - From $y\\langle x \\rangle$: The set of powers is just the single element $\\{x^{32m}\\} = \\{x^{16k}\\}$.\n    So, $G^{(k)} = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{16k}\\}$.\n    For this set to be a subgroup, the element $x^{16k}$ must be contained within the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. This is true if $\\langle x^{16k} \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$, which is equivalent to the condition that $\\gcd(k, 64)$ divides $16k$. Since $\\gcd(k, 64)$ is a divisor of $k$, it must also be a divisor of $16k$. Thus, the condition is always satisfied.\n    So, for any even integer $k$, $G^{(k)}$ is the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nNow we count the number of distinct subgroups we found.\n\n1.  From the odd $k$ case, we have one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n\n2.  From the even $k$ case, the power subgroups are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ for some even integer $k$.\n    Since $k$ is even, $k=2m$. So $d=\\gcd(2m, 64) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(m, 32)$. This implies that $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n    The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n    The even divisors are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n    For each of these even divisors $d$, we can find an even $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 64) = d$. For instance, we can simply choose $k=d$.\n    This gives us the following distinct subgroups:\n    *   $k=2 \\implies d=2 \\implies \\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n    *   $k=4 \\implies d=4 \\implies \\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n    *   $k=8 \\implies d=8 \\implies \\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n    *   $k=16 \\implies d=16 \\implies \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n    *   $k=32 \\implies d=32 \\implies \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n    *   $k=64 \\implies d=64 \\implies \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n    This gives **6** distinct power subgroups. Note that $k=0$ also gives the trivial subgroup as $g^0=1$ for all $g$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is:\n$\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128."
