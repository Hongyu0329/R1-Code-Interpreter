    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Set G with n elements**: A collection of `n` distinct objects.\n*   **Binary Operation `·`**: A rule that takes any two elements `a`, `b` from `G` and produces a result `a · b` which must also be in `G`. This property is called **Closure**.\n*   **Group**: A set `G` with a binary operation `·`, denoted as `(G, ·)`, is a group if it satisfies the following axioms:\n    1.  **Closure**: For all `a, b` in `G`, `a · b` is in `G`. (This is already guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on G).\n    2.  **Associativity**: For all `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n    3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element**: For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest `n` where we can define an operation `·` on a set `G` of size `n` such that `(G, ·)` is *not* a group. This means at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) must fail.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Smallest Possible Values of n\n\nBy convention in abstract algebra, a group must be a non-empty set. This means `n` must be a positive integer, so we start our analysis from `n = 1`.\n\n#### Case n = 1\n*   Let the set be `G = {a}`. There is only one element.\n*   Let's define a binary operation `·` on `G`. To do this, we only need to define the result of `a · a`. For the closure property to hold, the result must be an element of `G`. Since `a` is the only element, the operation must be:\n    `a · a = a`\n*   Now, let's check if this structure `({a}, ·)` is a group.\n    1.  **Closure**: Satisfied by definition (`a · a = a`, and `a` is in `G`).\n    2.  **Associativity**: We need to check if `(x·y)·z = x·(y·z)` for all choices of `x,y,z` from `G`. The only possible choice is `x=y=z=a`.\n        *   LHS: `(a · a) · a = (a) · a = a`\n        *   RHS: `a · (a · a) = a · (a) = a`\n        Since LHS = RHS, the operation is associative.\n    3.  **Identity Element**: We need an element `e` in `G` such that `e · a = a · e = a`. Let's try `e = a`.\n        *   `a · a = a`. This works. So, `a` is the identity element.\n    4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element (only `a` here), we need an inverse. The inverse of `a` must be an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = e`. Here, `e = a`, so we need `a · b = a`. The only possible choice for `b` is `a`.\n        *   `a · a = a`. This matches the identity element `e`. So, the inverse of `a` is `a`.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1**: All four group axioms are satisfied. It is impossible to define a binary operation on a set of one element that is *not* a group. Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n#### Case n = 2\n*   Let the set be `G = {x, y}`.\n*   We need to find if there exists a binary operation `·` on `G` that fails at least one of the group axioms. Let's try to construct one.\n*   We can define the operation using a multiplication table (Cayley table). Let's try to define an operation that fails the **Identity Element** axiom.\n\n    Let's define the operation `·` as follows:\n    `x · x = x`\n    `x · y = x`\n    `y · x = y`\n    `y · y = y`\n\n    The Cayley table is:\n    ```\n      · | x | y\n     ---|---|---\n      x | x | x\n      y | y | y\n    ```\n*   Now, let's check the group axioms for this structure `({x, y}, ·)`.\n    1.  **Closure**: All the results in the table (`x` and `y`) are elements of `G`. The closure property holds.\n    2.  **Identity Element**: Let's check if either `x` or `y` can be the identity element `e`.\n        *   If `e = x`, we would need `x · y = y`. But our table says `x · y = x`. So, `x` is not the identity element.\n        *   If `e = y`, we would need `y · x = x`. But our table says `y · x = y`. So, `y` is not the identity element.\n    Since neither element in `G` acts as an identity element, the **Identity Element** axiom fails.\n*   **Conclusion for n=2**: We have successfully constructed a set `G` of size 2 and a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for `n = 1`, any structure `(G, ·)` must be a group. We have also shown that for `n = 2`, it is possible to define a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group. Since we are looking for the *smallest* such number `n`, the answer is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
