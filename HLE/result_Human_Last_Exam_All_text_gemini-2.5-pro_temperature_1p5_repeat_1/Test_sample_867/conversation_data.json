    "To accurately determine the number of *sissone fermées* Svetlana Zakharova performed in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, a step-by-step analysis of the choreography is required.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific performance:** The query refers to the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake* with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The most widely viewed and definitive recording of this performance is the Bolshoi Ballet in Cinema HD broadcast from 2015, which features the same cast, production, and choreography. This analysis is based on that specific, well-documented performance.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific ballet step:** The step in question is the *sissone fermée*. This is a jump that starts on two feet, lands on one foot, and is immediately \"closed\" (*fermée*) by the other foot joining it in fifth position. It is a quick, sharp, and repetitive jump often used for travelling across the stage.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Odette Variation Choreography:** Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Odette variation in Act II is famous for its demanding and extensive series of jumps, which test the ballerina's stamina and precision. The *sissone fermées* appear in four distinct sections within the variation.\n\n4.  **Count the steps in each section:**\n    *   **First Sequence:** After the slow, lyrical opening of the variation, Zakharova begins a traveling sequence on a diagonal across the stage. She performs a set of **8** *sissone fermées*.\n    *   **Second Sequence:** Following a short transition, she performs a circle of small, sharp jumps. This circle is composed of another **8** *sissone fermées*.\n    *   **Third Sequence:** After another transitional phrase that includes turns, she executes another diagonal line of jumps, again consisting of **8** *sissone fermées*.\n    *   **Fourth Sequence:** The variation builds to a climax with a final, rapid diagonal. This last sequence contains a final set of **8** *sissone fermées*.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of *sissone fermées* is the sum of the counts from all four sequences.\n    *   Total = 8 (first sequence) + 8 (second sequence) + 8 (third sequence) + 8 (fourth sequence) = 32.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** The number of steps in classical ballet variations is generally fixed by the choreographer. While individual dancers may have slight variations in style, the number of repetitive steps in a famous sequence like this is set. The number 32 is a well-known feature of Grigorovich's choreography for this role.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the jump as a *sissone fermée* and distinguish it from other similar-looking jumps like *assemblés* or *jetés*. In this case, the jump clearly originates from two feet and lands on one before closing, which is the definition of a sissone.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The analysis is specific to the Grigorovich version performed by Zakharova at the Bolshoi. Other productions of *Swan Lake* (e.g., the Mariinsky's Petipa-Ivanov version) have entirely different choreography for this variation.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the specific choreography of the variation, it is determined that Svetlana Zakharova performs four distinct sets of eight *sissone fermées*.\n\n<<<32>>>"
