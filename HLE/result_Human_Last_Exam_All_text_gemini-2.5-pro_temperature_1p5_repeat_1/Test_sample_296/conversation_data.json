    "An analysis of the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $G$ requires classifying the possible transitive actions of $G$ on a set of 4 elements.\n\n**Step 1: Identify possible quotient groups**\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with index $[G:H]=4$. The action of $G$ on the set of left cosets $G/H$ induces a homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to S_4$. The image of this homomorphism, $\\text{Im}(\\rho)$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\nA key property of the Grigorchuk group $G$ is that all of its proper quotients are finite 2-groups. Therefore, $\\text{Im}(\\rho)$ must be a transitive 2-subgroup of $S_4$. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are the cyclic group $C_4$, the Klein four-group $V_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the alternating group $A_4$, and the symmetric group $S_4$. The 2-groups among these are $C_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (order 4), and $D_4$ (order 8).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each possible quotient group**\n\n*   **Case 1: Image is isomorphic to $C_4$**\n    A homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $C_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ must factor through the abelianization of $G$, $G^{ab} = G/[G,G]$. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be $G^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n    Any element $x$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ satisfies $2x=0$. Therefore, its image $\\phi(x)$ in $C_4$ must satisfy $2\\phi(x)=0$. The elements in $C_4$ satisfying this condition are the identity (0) and the element of order 2 (2). Thus, the image of any homomorphism from $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to $C_4$ is contained in the subgroup $\\{0, 2\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    This means the image cannot be $C_4$, so no surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $C_4$ exists. Consequently, there are no subgroups of index 4 with a quotient isomorphic to $C_4$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Image is isomorphic to $V_4$**\n    If the image is $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, the kernel of the homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to V_4$ is a normal subgroup $N$ of index 4. The corresponding subgroup of index 4 is $H = \\rho^{-1}(\\text{Stab}_{V_4}(p))$ where $p$ is a point in the set of 4 elements. Since the action of $V_4$ is regular, the stabilizer of any point is the trivial subgroup. Thus, $H=N$. This means that any subgroup of index 4 with a $V_4$ quotient must be a normal subgroup.\n    We need to count the number of normal subgroups of index 4. These are the kernels of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $V_4$. Since $V_4$ is abelian, these homomorphisms factor through $G^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n    Counting the number of epimorphisms from $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ is equivalent to counting the number of 2-dimensional quotient spaces of a 3-dimensional vector space over the field $F_2$. This is equivalent to counting the number of 1-dimensional subspaces (to be the kernel). A 3-dimensional vector space over $F_2$ has $2^3-1=7$ non-zero vectors, each spanning a unique 1-dimensional subspace.\n    So, there are 7 distinct kernels, which means there are **7 normal subgroups of index 4**.\n\n*   **Case 3: Image is isomorphic to $D_4$**\n    If the image of the action is $D_4$, the kernel $N = \\ker(\\rho)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ such that $G/N \\cong D_4$. The index of $N$ is 8. The subgroup of index 4, $H$, corresponds to the stabilizer of a point in the action. In $D_4$, the stabilizer of a point in a transitive action on 4 elements is a subgroup of order $|D_4|/4 = 8/4 = 2$.\n    It is a well-known fact about the Grigorchuk group that it has a unique normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N \\cong D_4$. This subgroup is $G_2$, the stabilizer of the set of all 4 vertices at the second level of the binary tree. The corresponding homomorphism $\\rho_2: G \\to D_4$ describes the action of $G$ on these 4 vertices.\n    The subgroups of index 4 arising from this action are the preimages of the subgroups of order 2 in $D_4$. The group $D_4$ has 5 subgroups of order 2:\n    1.  The center $Z(D_4) = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This subgroup is normal in $D_4$. The preimage $H_Z = \\rho_2^{-1}(Z(D_4))$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The quotient $G/H_Z \\cong (G/G_2)/(H_Z/G_2) \\cong D_4/Z(D_4) \\cong V_4$. Thus, $H_Z$ is one of the 7 normal subgroups already counted in Case 2.\n    2.  Four subgroups generated by reflections. These are not normal in $D_4$. Let's call them $K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4$. Their preimages $H_i = \\rho_2^{-1}(K_i)$ are four distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4 in $G$. They are distinct because if $H_i = H_j$, then applying $\\rho_2$ gives $K_i=K_j$. They are non-normal because their core in $G$ is $G_2$, which has index 8, whereas a normal subgroup of index 4 is its own core.\n\n    Any epimorphism from $G$ to $D_4$ must have kernel $G_2$. While there are $|\\text{Aut}(D_4)|=8$ such epimorphisms, they all result in the same set of four non-normal subgroups.\n\n**Step 3: Total Count**\nCombining the results from all cases:\n-   From actions with a $V_4$ image, we get 7 distinct normal subgroups of index 4.\n-   From the action with a $D_4$ image, we get 4 distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n-   These two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of these counts.\nTotal number = 7 (normal) + 4 (non-normal) = 11.\n\nFinal list of careful points:\n1.  Quotients of $G$ are finite 2-groups, restricting the image of any action.\n2.  Homomorphisms to abelian groups factor through $G^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n3.  Subgroups corresponding to an action with an abelian image ($V_4$) are normal. There are 7 such subgroups.\n4.  Subgroups corresponding to an action with a non-abelian image ($D_4$) are generally not normal.\n5.  $G$ has a unique normal subgroup $G_2$ with quotient $D_4$.\n6.  The action on the second level of the tree gives rise to 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n7.  The question \"how many subgroups\" is interpreted as counting the number of distinct subsets of $G$ that are subgroups of index 4, not the number of conjugacy classes.\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is $7 + 4 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
