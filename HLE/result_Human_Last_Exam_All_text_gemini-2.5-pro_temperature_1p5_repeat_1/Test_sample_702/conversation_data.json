    "Answering this question involves identifying the map in question, understanding the homotopy type of the spaces involved, and then using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for a fibration to determine the connectivity.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Identifying the map**\n\nThe spaces involved are $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and $Z = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\nNote that $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, so $Z \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" and the specific form of the spaces suggest a well-known map in homotopy theory. This map is constructed from the James-Hopf invariant and the suspension map.\nLet's define two standard maps:\n*   The **James-Hopf invariant map** is (the adjoint of) a map $h: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to S^{m+n-1}$. For $m=4, n=6$, we have $h: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^9$. This map is a key tool for understanding Whitehead products and homotopy groups of spheres.\n*   The **suspension map** $E: S^k \\to \\Omega S^{k+1}$ is the inclusion of the fiber in the path space fibration for $S^{k+1}$. It is the adjoint of the identity map on $S^{k+1}$. For $k=9$, we have $E: S^9 \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe map in the question, let's call it $f$, is the composition:\n$f = E \\circ h : \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\xrightarrow{h} S^9 \\xrightarrow{E} \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n**2. Connectivity of the domain and codomain**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Z$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Z)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nLet's determine the connectivity of the spaces $X$ and $Z$.\n*   **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$**: The space $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected, since $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^n)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of a smash product**: If a space $A$ is $p$-connected and a space $B$ is $q$-connected, then their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of a suspension**: If a space $A$ is $p$-connected, its suspension $\\Sigma A$ is $(p+1)$-connected.\n    *   $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(X)=0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n*   **Connectivity of the codomain**:\n    *   $Z = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected. A typo in my thoughts, $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected, so $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected. Let's recheck. $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$, which is zero for $i+1 < 10$, i.e., $i<9$. So $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected. $\\pi_i(Z) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\nWait. A space $A$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(A)=0$ for all $i \\le k$.\n$\\pi_i(S^n)=0$ for $i<n$. Thus $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n$\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^n)=0$ for $i+1 < n$, i.e. $i < n-1$. So $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected. This seems right.\nAh, but the definition of $k$-connected is often taken to be \"path-connected and $\\pi_i=0$ for $1 \\le i \\le k$\". Since loop spaces are path-connected, this distinction is minor here. For $n \\ge 2$, $S^n$ is simply connected, so $\\Omega S^n$ is path-connected. The definition holds.\n$\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2)=8$-connected. $\\pi_i(Z) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\n**3. Analysis of the fiber of the map**\n\nLet $F$ be the homotopy fiber of the map $f: X \\to Z$. The connectivity of $f$ is $k$ if $F$ is $(k-1)$-connected. We analyze the homotopy groups of $F$ using the long exact sequence:\n... $\\to \\pi_{i+1}(Z) \\to \\pi_i(F) \\to \\pi_i(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_i(Z) \\to$ ...\n\n*   For $i \\le 8$: We have $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(Z)=0$. The long exact sequence implies that $\\pi_i(F)=0$ for $i \\le 7$. So $F$ is at least 7-connected.\n\n*   For $i=8$: The relevant part of the sequence is $\\pi_9(Z) \\to \\pi_8(F) \\to \\pi_8(X)$.\n    Since $X$ is 8-connected, $\\pi_8(X)=0$. The sequence becomes $\\pi_9(Z) \\to \\pi_8(F) \\to 0$, which is not enough.\n    Let's use the other part: $\\pi_9(X) \\xrightarrow{f_9} \\pi_9(Z) \\to \\pi_8(F) \\to \\pi_8(X)=0$.\n    Exactness implies $\\pi_8(F) \\cong \\text{coker}(f_9)$. We need to analyze $f_9$.\n    $f_9 = (E \\circ h)_* = E_* \\circ h_*$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since the domain is 7-connected, Hurewicz's theorem applies: $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Kunneth formula, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(S^9) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(Z) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $h_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(S^9)$ is a standard result, known to be an isomorphism (rationally, it's a map of degree 1).\n    *   The map $E_*: \\pi_9(S^9) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})$ is induced by the adjoint of the identity map, and it is also an isomorphism.\n    *   Therefore, $f_9: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Z)$ is the composition of two isomorphisms $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, so it is an isomorphism.\n    *   Since $f_9$ is an isomorphism, its cokernel is zero. Thus, $\\pi_8(F)=0$.\n\n*   We have shown $\\pi_i(F)=0$ for $i \\le 8$. So, $F$ is 8-connected.\n    This implies that the map $f$ is $(8+1) = 9$-connected.\n    Let's confirm by checking what happens at the next level.\n\n*   For $i=9$: We analyze $\\pi_9(F)$. The long exact sequence segment is:\n    $\\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Z) \\to \\pi_9(F) \\to \\pi_9(X) \\xrightarrow{f_9} \\pi_9(Z)$.\n    *   Since $f_9$ is an isomorphism, the map $\\pi_9(F) \\to \\pi_9(X)$ must be the zero map.\n    *   Exactness implies $\\pi_9(F) \\cong \\text{coker}(\\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Z))$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(X) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 8)$ up to dimension 10, meaning its homotopy groups $\\pi_9$ and $\\pi_{10}$ are zero. So $\\pi_{10}(X)=0$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(Z) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   So, we have the sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\pi_9(F) \\to \\dots$.\n    *   This gives $\\pi_9(F) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    Since $\\pi_9(F) \\neq 0$, the fiber $F$ is not 9-connected. It is precisely 8-connected.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe homotopy fiber $F$ is 8-connected ($\\pi_i(F)=0$ for $i \\le 8$, but $\\pi_9(F) \\neq 0$). A map whose homotopy fiber is $(k-1)$-connected is said to be $k$-connected. Therefore, for $F$ being 8-connected, the map $f$ is 9-connected.\n\nFinal check of the definition: $f$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and surjective for $i=k$.\n*   Since $F$ is 8-connected, $\\pi_i(F)=0$ for $i \\le 8$. The LES shows that $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<9$.\n*   For $i=9$, the segment is $\\pi_9(F) \\to \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Z) \\to \\pi_8(F)$. Since $\\pi_9(F) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\pi_8(F)=0$, we have an exact sequence $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$. This implies that $f_9: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is surjective (it is in fact an isomorphism).\n*   So the map is 9-connected. It is not 10-connected because $\\pi_{10}(f)$ is the map $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is not surjective.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 9.\n\n>>>9"
