    "The problem asks for the conditions under which a system of three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, possesses a \"tripled fixed point\". We will use the framework of complete metric spaces and generalize the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a system of equations on a product space.\n\n### Step 1: Clarifying the Definitions\n\nFirst, we must interpret the question's notation and define the core concepts.\n\n*   **Spaces**: We assume `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are non-empty sets. For fixed-point theorems, they are typically required to be **metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n*   **Functions**: The functions are given as `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. There is a typo here, as the name `G` is used for two different functions. We will assume the second `G` is meant to be `H`, which is standard for FGH-tripled point problems. So the functions are:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfy the following system of equations:\n    *   `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    *   `y = G(y, x, y)` (Note how `y` appears as both the first and third argument, consistent with the domain `Y × X × Y`)\n    *   `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Mathematical Framework\n\nThe most common method to prove the existence and uniqueness of fixed points is the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem**. This theorem requires a **contraction mapping** on a **complete metric space**.\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Space**: We assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Product Space**: We combine these spaces into a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`. This product space is also a complete metric space with a suitable metric. A convenient choice is the **max metric**:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = max{d_X(x₁, x₂), d_Y(y₁, y₂), d_Z(z₁, z₂)}`\n3.  **Operator Definition**: We define a single operator `T: W → W` whose fixed points correspond to the FGH-tripled fixed points.\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n    A fixed point of `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`, which is exactly our system of equations.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Contraction Conditions\n\nThe goal is to find conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H` that make the operator `T` a contraction mapping on `(W, d_W)`. A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁, p₂ ∈ W`:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`. We analyze the distance `d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂))` component by component. To do this, we must assume `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz-continuous in their arguments.\n\n**Assumed Lipschitz Conditions:**\nWe assume there exist non-negative constants (`αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ`) such that:\n\n1.  For `F: X × Y × Z → X`:\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n2.  For `G: Y × X × Y → Y`: We assume a general form for its inputs `(v, u, v')`.\n    `d_Y(G(v₁, u₁, v'₁), G(v₂, u₂, v'₂)) ≤ α₂ d_X(u₁, u₂) + β₂ d_Y(v₁, v₂) + γ₂ d_Y(v'₁, v'₂)`\n    In our specific operator `T`, the inputs to `G` are `(y, x, y)`. So we get:\n    `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) = α₂ d_X(x₁, x₂) + (β₂ + γ₂) d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n3.  For `H: Z × Y × X → Z`:\n    `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n**Putting it all together:**\nNow we bound each component of the distance `d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂))` in terms of `d_W(p₁, p₂) = max{d_X, d_Y, d_Z}`.\n\n*   `d_X(F(...), F(...)) ≤ α₁ d_X + β₁ d_Y + γ₁ d_Z ≤ (α₁ + β₁ + γ₁) * max{d_X, d_Y, d_Z} = (α₁ + β₁ + γ₁) * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n*   `d_Y(G(...), G(...)) ≤ α₂ d_X + (β₂ + γ₂) d_Y ≤ (α₂ + β₂ + γ₂) * max{d_X, d_Y} ≤ (α₂ + β₂ + γ₂) * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n*   `d_Z(H(...), H(...)) ≤ α₃ d_X + β₃ d_Y + γ₃ d_Z ≤ (α₃ + β₃ + γ₃) * max{d_X, d_Y, d_Z} = (α₃ + β₃ + γ₃) * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\nThe distance `d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂))` is the maximum of these three component distances. Therefore:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ max{ (α₁+β₁+γ₁), (α₂+β₂+γ₂), (α₃+β₃+γ₃) } * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, the overall constant `k = max{ (α₁+β₁+γ₁), (α₂+β₂+γ₂), (α₃+β₃+γ₃) }` must be less than 1. This is true if and only if each of the summed terms is less than 1.\n\n### Final Answer: The Conditions\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are a combination of conditions on the spaces and contraction conditions on the functions.\n\n<<<The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point if the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Space Requirement**: `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty, complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Function Contraction Requirements**: The functions must satisfy Lipschitz-type conditions. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants `(α₁, β₁, γ₁)`, `(α₂, β₂, γ₂)`, and `(α₃, β₃, γ₃)` such that for any points `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, and `u₁, u₂ ∈ Y`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, u₁), G(y₂, x₂, u₂)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₂ d_Y(u₁, u₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n3.  **Overall Contraction Condition**: The sum of the constants for each function must be less than 1.\n    *   `α₁ + β₁ + γ₁ < 1`\n    *   `α₂ + β₂ + γ₂ < 1`\n    *   `α₃ + β₃ + γ₃ < 1`\nUnder these conditions, the Banach Fixed Point Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique triplet `(x, y, z)` satisfying `x=F(x,y,z)`, `y=G(y,x,y)`, and `z=H(z,y,x)`.>>>"
