    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0, after executing a series of statements.\n2.  **Variable and Initial Value:** There is only one variable, `x`. Its initial value is 0.\n3.  **Operations:** There are two operations:\n    *   `++`: Increases `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decreases `x` by 1.\n4.  **Statements:** A statement consists of one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`. The order can be varied. This gives four possible statement strings:\n    *   `\"++X\"` (prefix increment)\n    *   `\"X++\"` (postfix increment)\n    *   `\"--X\"` (prefix decrement)\n    *   `\"X--\"` (postfix decrement)\n    *   All four forms have the same effect on the final value of `x`. Increment forms add 1, decrement forms subtract 1.\n5.  **Input Format:**\n    *   The first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150), the number of statements.\n    *   The next `n` lines each contain one of the four possible statements.\n6.  **Output Format:** Print the final integer value of `x`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **All Four Statement Types:** A correct program must handle all four variations of the statements: `\"++X\"`, `\"X++\"`, `\"--X\"`, and `\"X--\"`. Any solution that misses one of these is incorrect.\n2.  **Initial Value:** The variable `x` must be initialized to 0 before processing the statements.\n3.  **Efficiency:** The prompt asks for an analysis of the most efficient solution in C (fastest and least memory) for an input size of at most 100 instructions. An efficient solution should minimize processing for each statement. Full string comparisons (like `strcmp`) are unnecessary. A better approach is to check for the presence of a specific character ('+' or '-') which uniquely identifies the operation.\n4.  **Input Reading:** Reading input efficiently is part of the solution. In C, `scanf` is generally very fast for formatted input.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Initialization:** The code correctly initializes `tresult` (representing `x`) to 0. `int tresult = 0;`\n2.  **Input Loop:** It correctly reads the number of statements `t` and loops that many times. `while (t-- > 0)`\n3.  **Statement Processing:** Inside the loop, it reads the statement string: `String test = inpt.next();`.\n4.  **The Flaw:** The code checks for the operation using `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`.\n    *   It correctly handles `\"++X\"`.\n    *   It correctly handles `\"--X\"`.\n    *   **It completely fails to handle `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`**. If the input is `\"X++\"`, neither `if` condition will be true, and `tresult` will not be changed. This is incorrect.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The provided Java program does **not** solve the problem correctly because it ignores two of the four valid statement types.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**1. Is the program correct?**\nNo.\n\n**2. How to write an efficient C solution?**\nAn optimal C solution would avoid complex string comparisons. All statement strings are 3 characters long. The character at index 1 is always an operator (`+` or `-`), while the characters at index 0 and 2 can be either an operator or 'X'. Therefore, checking just the middle character is sufficient and highly efficient.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// This is a conceptual C solution for analysis.\nint main_conceptual() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n); // Read number of statements\n\n    int x = 0; // Initialize result\n    char statement[4]; // Buffer for statement string, size 4 for \"X++\\0\"\n\n    while (n--) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement); // Read the statement string\n        // Check the middle character to determine the operation\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Step-by-step analysis for the answer `Nx+y`:**\n\n*   **N or Y:** The provided program is incorrect, so the answer must start with **N**.\n\n*   **x (smallest number of character comparisons for n=100):**\n    *   The efficient C solution loops 100 times for 100 instructions.\n    *   Inside the loop, the logic `if (statement[1] == '+')` performs exactly **one** character comparison to determine whether to increment or decrement.\n    *   This is the minimum possible, as at least one character must be inspected.\n    *   Total comparisons = 100 statements * 1 comparison/statement = 100.\n    *   So, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **y (smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   We need to store the number of instructions `n`. An `int` is appropriate (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   We need to store the final result `x`. An `int` is appropriate (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   We need a buffer to read the statement string from the input. A string like \"X++\" requires 3 characters plus a null terminator, so a `char` array of size 4 is needed (`char statement[4]`). This uses 4 bytes.\n    *   Total minimal memory for variables = (size of `int` for n) + (size of `int` for x) + (size of `char[4]` for statement) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 bytes.\n    *   So, **y = 12**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   Prefix: **N**\n    *   x: **100**\n    *   y: **12**\n    *   Combining into the format `Nx+y` gives `N100+12`.\n\n<<<N100+12>>>"
