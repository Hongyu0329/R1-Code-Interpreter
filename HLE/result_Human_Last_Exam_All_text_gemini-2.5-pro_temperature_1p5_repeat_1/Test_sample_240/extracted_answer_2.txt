The most likely reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance on a VNA is that its **active detuning circuit** is in its default, unpowered state. These circuits are designed to make the coil non-resonant to protect it during the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. Without the specific DC control voltage from the MRI system to switch it into its "receive" mode, the coil remains in this safe, detuned state on the workbench, and thus no resonance can be measured at its operating frequency. Other contributing factors include the coil's preamplifier being unpowered (which alters impedance matching) and potentially poor inductive coupling between the measurement probe and the coil.
