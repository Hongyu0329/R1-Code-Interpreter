No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered to be radial. The justification for using a radial-based coordinate system is Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis. Since the solar wind velocity is much larger than the wave's own propagation speed and is directed radially, the wave pattern is convected past the spacecraft along the radial direction. This makes the radial direction the effective propagation direction in the spacecraft's frame, justifying the use of perpendicular components (Y and Z) relative to the radial axis for calculating helicity.
