    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, to identify a specific novel and its author.\n    *   **Clue 1 (A quote about the novel):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Clue 2 (A description of the author):** He is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: The Quote**\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a work of literature that is visceral, powerful, primal, and possibly violent or filled with raw emotion.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This points to a work that is intellectually complex, highly structured, and strategic. A chess game has a limited set of pieces and rules, yet it can produce an almost infinite variety of intricate situations. This suggests the novel has a similar quality: built from a few core elements but arranged in a complex, multifaceted way.\n    *   **The combination:** Borges is praising a novel that is both intellectually rigorous and emotionally powerful, a rare combination.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2: The Author's Description**\n    *   **\"Continuator... of Faulkner\":** This means the author was influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner is known for his creation of a fictional county (Yoknapatawpha), his exploration of themes like memory, history, and the decay of the old South, and his use of complex narrative techniques like stream of consciousness and multiple, unreliable narrators. The author in question would likely engage with similar themes or techniques.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is the crucial modifier. While the author continues Faulkner's legacy, they do so by simplifying his style. Instead of Faulkner's long, labyrinthine sentences and sprawling narratives, this author achieves similar effects with more concise, direct, or minimalist prose.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Clues to Find the Author and Novel**\n    *   Many Latin American \"Boom\" writers were influenced by Faulkner, but the \"simplifier\" tag is a very specific pointer.\n    *   Let's consider the Mexican writer **Juan Rulfo**. His work is deeply concerned with Faulknerian themes: a haunted past, the weight of history on a specific region (Jalisco, Mexico), and the voices of the dead.\n    *   Crucially, Rulfo's style is the polar opposite of Faulkner's in its execution. His prose is famously sparse, laconic, and chiseled down to its bare essentials. This perfectly fits the description of a \"simplifier\" who distills Faulknerian complexity into a potent, minimalist form.\n    *   The novel in question is Rulfo's undisputed masterpiece, **Pedro Páramo** (1955).\n    *   Now, let's connect *Pedro Páramo* to the quote. The novel is about a man who travels to his dead mother's hometown, Comala, only to find it populated entirely by ghosts and memories.\n        *   **\"Intensity of a tiger\":** The novel's world is brutal, filled with the echoes of violence, lust, and raw power embodied by the tyrannical figure of Pedro Páramo himself.\n        *   **\"Variety of a chess duel\":** The novel is not told chronologically. It is a mosaic of fragmented conversations, flashbacks, and voices from beyond the grave. The reader must piece together the story like a puzzle, appreciating the intricate structure and how Rulfo combines these few narrative elements (the \"chess pieces\") into a hauntingly complex whole.\n    *   Borges was a great admirer of Rulfo's work. It is a well-documented fact that he wrote a brief but highly influential piece on *Pedro Páramo*, and the descriptions provided in the question are directly attributed to Borges's analysis of this specific novel.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the analysis of the quote and the description of the author, we can confidently identify the work Borges was referring to. The author is Juan Rulfo, who simplified Faulkner's sprawling style into a minimalist one, and the novel is *Pedro Páramo*, which matches the description of having both raw intensity and intricate, puzzle-like complexity.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
