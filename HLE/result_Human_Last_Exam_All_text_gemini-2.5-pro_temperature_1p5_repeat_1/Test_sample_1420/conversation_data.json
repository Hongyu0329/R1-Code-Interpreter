    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Scaling Exponents:** In the theory of critical phenomena, scaling exponents describe the power-law behavior of physical quantities near a continuous phase transition. The specific heat, C, is expected to diverge or have a cusp at the critical temperature $T_c$, following the relation $C \\propto |t|^{-\\alpha}$, where $t = (T - T_c) / T_c$ is the reduced temperature.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For any given physical system, there is an upper critical dimension, $d_c$. For spatial dimensions $d > d_c$, the fluctuations that drive non-trivial critical behavior are negligible, and the system's exponents are correctly given by the simpler mean-field theory. For the class of models encompassing the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (described by $\\phi^4$ theory), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. In mean-field theory, the specific heat has a simple jump discontinuity, which corresponds to $\\alpha_{MF} = 0$.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** The epsilon expansion, developed by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, is a powerful technique within the renormalization group (RG) framework. It calculates critical exponents as a power series in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. This allows for systematic corrections to the mean-field results for dimensions slightly below $d_c$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Parameters for the Problem\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem specifies the system is in $d = 3$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** As established, for this class of universal systems, $d_c = 4$.\n*   **Expansion Parameter (ϵ):** We calculate $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion is formally an expansion for small $\\epsilon$. Applying it for $\\epsilon=1$ (i.e., to go from $d=4$ to $d=3$) is a significant extrapolation. However, it is a standard and remarkably successful procedure in theoretical physics to get a first estimate of the exponents.\n\n### Step 3: State the General Formula for the Exponent α\n\nThe epsilon expansion can be carried out for the O(n) model, which describes a system with an n-component order parameter.\n*   n=1 corresponds to the Ising model (e.g., a simple liquid-gas transition or a uniaxial magnet).\n*   n=2 corresponds to the XY model (e.g., superfluid helium).\n*   n=3 corresponds to the Heisenberg model (e.g., an isotropic ferromagnet).\n\nTo the first order in $\\epsilon$, the formula for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for the O(n) model is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n### Step 4: Specify the Model (Choose n)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The question does not specify the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. In the absence of such information, it is conventional to assume the simplest and most widely studied case, which is the **Ising model (n=1)**. It is the canonical model for learning and discussing critical phenomena.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Exponent α for d=3\n\n1.  Substitute **n=1** (for the Ising model) into the general formula:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18} \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6} \\epsilon $$\n\n2.  Now, substitute the value **ϵ = 1** (for d=3) into this result:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6} $$\n\nThis is the first-order result from the epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent of the 3D Ising universality class.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis proceeds by identifying the theoretical framework (RG and epsilon expansion), defining the parameters ($d=3$, $d_c=4$, $\\epsilon=1$), stating the general first-order formula for $\\alpha$ in terms of 'n', selecting the standard Ising model case (n=1), and substituting the parameters to find the numerical value.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
