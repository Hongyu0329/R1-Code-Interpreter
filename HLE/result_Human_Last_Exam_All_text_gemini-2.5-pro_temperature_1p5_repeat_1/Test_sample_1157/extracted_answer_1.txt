**Procedures:** The patient's appropriate management requires a multi-phased approach.
1.  **Immediate Medical Care:** Urgent referral to a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) by initiating medication and stabilizing blood glucose.
2.  **Immediate Dental Care:** Administration of systemic antibiotics and a tetanus booster. Radiographic assessment (Panoramic/CBCT) to rule out bone fractures. Gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets, followed by suturing of soft tissues. Pain control must be established. Replantation of teeth is not possible due to the 28-hour delay.
3.  **Definitive Treatment Planning:** After a 3-6 month healing period, a definitive prosthesis can be made, taking into account her mandibular prognathism (SNB=88Â°).

**Cells of Interest:** The key cells are those involved in wound healing, whose function is impaired by uncontrolled diabetes: **neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and endothelial cells.** This leads to a high risk of infection and delayed, poor-quality healing.

**Denture Replacement Plan:**
*   **Denture Type & Material:** A **Removable Partial Denture with a cast Cobalt-Chromium metal framework** is the recommended option. The denture base and artificial teeth would be made of **acrylic resin.**
*   **Abutment Teeth & Rationale:** The abutment teeth would be the **left second premolar, right canine, and right first molar.** This selection provides **cross-arch stabilization**, which is essential to distribute biting forces, prevent leverage on the adjacent teeth, and ensure the stability of the denture, especially given the significant loss of the cornerstone canine tooth and the patient's Class III skeletal pattern.
