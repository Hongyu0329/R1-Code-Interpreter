    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This represents the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 after the system has reached a steady state (or equilibrium). In the context of Markov chains, these are the stationary probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$. Our goal is to calculate $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nWhen the system reaches a steady state at $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ no longer change with time. This means their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero. We replace $P_i(t)$ with the stationary probability $\\pi_i$ and set the derivatives to zero.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1, which gives us the normalization equation:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Rate Constants**\nWe are given the following values for the transition rates:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equations from step 2:\n1.  $0 = -0.019\\pi_{0} + 0.65\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019\\pi_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4)\\pi_{1} + 0.392\\pi_{2} + 0.008\\pi_{3} \\implies 0 = 0.019\\pi_{0} - 1.05\\pi_{1} + 0.392\\pi_{2} + 0.008\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - 0.4\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008\\pi_{2} - 0.008\\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**4. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe can solve this system by expressing three of the probabilities in terms of one, say $\\pi_1$, and then using the normalization equation.\n\n*   From equation (4):\n    $0.008\\pi_{2} = 0.008\\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\n*   From equation (3):\n    $0.4\\pi_{1} = 0.4\\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n    Therefore, we have $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\n*   From equation (1):\n    $0.019\\pi_{0} = 0.65\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}$\n\nNow we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}\\right) + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$\\pi_{1} \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) = 1$\n\nTo solve for $\\pi_1$, we simplify the expression in the parenthesis:\n$\\pi_{1} \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_{1} \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_{1} \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$\\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Probabilities**\nNow we can find the value of $\\pi_0$ using the expression we found earlier:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\n**6. Find the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the result is 0.946252."
