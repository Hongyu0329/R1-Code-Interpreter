    "Answering this question requires understanding the two metric spaces and the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Metric Spaces\n\n1.  **Space X**: The interval $[0,1]$ with the standard absolute value metric, $d_X(x,y) = |x-y|$.\n    *   This is a compact metric space.\n    *   The diameter of X is the maximum distance between any two points in it: $\\text{diam}(X) = \\sup_{x,y \\in [0,1]} |x-y| = |1-0| = 1$.\n\n2.  **Space Y**: The unit circle $S^1$ with the intrinsic metric.\n    *   A unit circle is typically defined as a circle with a radius of 1.\n    *   The intrinsic metric (or geodesic distance) is the shortest arc length between two points on the circle. For a circle of radius $r$, the distance between two points separated by an angle $\\Delta\\theta$ is $r \\cdot \\Delta\\theta$.\n    *   The total circumference of a unit circle ($r=1$) is $2\\pi$.\n    *   The diameter of Y is the maximum possible intrinsic distance between any two points, which is the distance between two diametrically opposite points. This distance is half the circumference: $\\text{diam}(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi$.\n    *   This is also a compact metric space.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Gromov-Hausdorff Distance\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, is a way to measure how \"far apart\" two metric spaces are. There are several equivalent definitions. Two important properties that can be derived from the definition are:\n*   $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ is the infimum of the Hausdorff distances between isometrically embedded copies of $X$ and $Y$ in some larger metric space $Z$.\n*   This provides a method to find lower and upper bounds for the distance.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound\n\nA fundamental result provides a lower bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance based on the diameters of the spaces:\n$d_{GH}(X,Y) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\text{diam}(X) - \\text{diam}(Y)|$\n\nUsing the diameters we calculated in Step 1:\n*   $\\text{diam}(X) = 1$\n*   $\\text{diam}(Y) = \\pi$\n\nSo, the lower bound is:\n$d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\pi - 1| = \\frac{\\pi - 1}{2}$\n\nNumerically, this is approximately $\\frac{3.14159 - 1}{2} \\approx 1.0708$.\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific realization of $X$ and $Y$ in a common metric space and calculate their Hausdorff distance. This gives an upper bound because the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is the infimum over all such constructions. Finding the optimal construction that gives the actual distance can be very complex.\n\nLet's embed the interval $[0,1]$ into the circle $S^1$.\n*   Let the common space $Z$ be the circle $S^1$ itself.\n*   The embedding of $Y=S^1$ into $Z$ is simply the identity map.\n*   We can isometrically embed the interval $X=[0,1]$ into $S^1$ as an arc of length 1. Let's parameterize points on the circle by their arc length from a starting point, from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The embedding can be defined as $f: [0,1] \\to S^1$, where $f(t)$ is the point on the circle at arc length $t$. The image, $f([0,1])$, is an arc of length 1. Let's call this arc $A$.\n\nNow we calculate the Hausdorff distance $d_H(A, S^1)$ within the space $S^1$. The Hausdorff distance is defined as:\n$d_H(A, B) = \\max \\left( \\sup_{a \\in A} \\inf_{b \\in B} d(a, b), \\sup_{b \\in B} \\inf_{a \\in A} d(b, a) \\right)$\n\nHere, $A = f([0,1])$ and $B = S^1$.\n*   Since $A$ is a subset of $B$, the first term $\\sup_{a \\in A} \\inf_{b \\in B} d(a, b)$ is 0.\n*   The second term is $\\sup_{b \\in B} \\inf_{a \\in A} d(b, a) = \\sup_{y \\in S^1} d(y, A)$. This is the maximum distance from any point on the circle to the arc $A$.\n*   The point on the circle furthest from the arc $A$ is the point antipodal to the midpoint of $A$. The midpoint of the arc $A$ (which runs from arc length 0 to 1) is at $1/2$. The antipodal point is at $1/2 + \\pi$.\n*   The distance from the point $(1/2 + \\pi)$ to the arc $A$ is the shortest distance to any point in $A$. This will be the distance to one of its endpoints (0 or 1).\n    *   Distance from $(1/2+\\pi)$ to $0$ is $\\min(1/2+\\pi, 2\\pi - (1/2+\\pi)) = \\min(1/2+\\pi, \\pi-1/2) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n    *   Distance from $(1/2+\\pi)$ to $1$ is $\\min(|(1/2+\\pi)-1|, 2\\pi - |(1/2+\\pi)-1|) = \\min(\\pi-1/2, \\pi+1/2) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n*   So, the Hausdorff distance is $d_H(A, S^1) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n\nThis provides an upper bound: $d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\le \\pi - 1/2$. This bound is approximately $2.64$, which is quite loose. More sophisticated constructions (e.g., using correspondences) can yield tighter upper bounds.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer\n\nFinding the exact value of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is often a difficult problem solved in mathematical literature. For this specific case, the result is known. Multiple sources (e.g., T. Rieck & K. Nakamura, 2013) have shown that for a circle of radius $r$ and an interval of length $l$, under the condition $l \\le (\\pi-2)r$, the distance is given by:\n$d_{GH}(S^1(r), [0,l]) = \\frac{\\pi r - l}{2}$\n\nIn our case, $r=1$ and $l=1$. The condition is $1 \\le \\pi - 2 \\approx 1.14$, which is true.\nPlugging our values into the formula:\n$d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot 1 - 1}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$\n\nNotice that this exact value is identical to the lower bound we calculated in Step 3. This means that the diameter-based lower bound is sharp for this pair of spaces, and the value is attained.\n\nThe final answer is the expression $\\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$.\n\n<<<(pi-1)/2>>>"
