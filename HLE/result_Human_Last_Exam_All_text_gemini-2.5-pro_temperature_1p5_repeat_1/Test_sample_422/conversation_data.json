    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Prompt\n1.  **Core Theory:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    *   P is true (Truth condition).\n    *   S believes P (Belief condition).\n    *   S is justified in believing P (Justification condition).\n2.  **Core Constraint:** We must assume a simplified epistemic world with only two possible states: **Knowledge** and **Belief**. The phrasing \"the two...states\" implies they are mutually exclusive categories. If a person is in the state of 'Knowledge' regarding a proposition, they are not in the state of 'Belief', and vice-versa. This is a crucial, non-standard constraint that creates the problems.\n3.  **Exclusion:** We must explicitly ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases of justified true belief that are still not considered knowledge, typically due to luck.\n4.  **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB theory encounters *within this specific, constrained system*.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Problem - The Contradiction\nThis problem arises from the direct conflict between the JTB definition and the system's constraints.\n\n*   **JTB's Requirement:** The second condition of the JTB theory is the **Belief condition**. It states that for Knowledge to exist, Belief must first exist. In logical terms, Knowledge implies Belief (K → B).\n*   **System's Constraint:** The system dictates that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are mutually exclusive states. You can be in one state or the other, but not both. This means that if you have Knowledge, you cannot have Belief (K → ¬B).\n*   **The Clash:** These two premises cannot both be true. The JTB definition requires belief as a necessary component of knowledge, while the constrained system posits knowledge and belief as two separate, non-overlapping states. This creates a logical contradiction at the heart of the system. Knowledge is defined in a way that makes it impossible to achieve, because fulfilling the conditions for being in the 'Knowledge' state (which requires having a belief) simultaneously prevents one from being in that state (as having a 'Belief' puts you in the other category).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Problem - The Classification Problem\nThis problem arises from the consequences of using 'Belief' as the single catch-all category for anything that isn't 'Knowledge'.\n\n*   **Defining the 'Belief' Category:** If 'Knowledge' is strictly defined as JTB, then the state of 'Belief' must encompass every other possible epistemic situation.\n*   **What falls into 'Belief'?** This category must now include a wide range of epistemically different states:\n    1.  **Justified False Belief:** A belief that is held for good, rational reasons but happens to be incorrect. This is typically seen as an epistemically respectable position (a rational mistake).\n    2.  **Unjustified True Belief:** A belief that is true by luck but is held for bad reasons or no reason at all (a lucky guess).\n    3.  **Unjustified False Belief:** A belief that is both incorrect and held for bad reasons (a simple error or superstition).\n*   **The Loss of Nuance:** The problem is that lumping these vastly different states into a single category called 'Belief' makes the category almost useless. The system loses the crucial ability to distinguish between a belief that is held rationally (justified) and one that is not. It treats a rational but mistaken person the same as a person with a wild, unsubstantiated superstition. This makes the concept of 'Belief' too coarse to be useful for any meaningful analysis of a person's epistemic standing.\n\n### Step 4: Finalizing the Answer\nThe two problems are distinct and are direct consequences of the artificial constraints imposed by the question, without referring to Gettier cases.\n\n1.  **Problem 1** is a foundational, logical self-contradiction.\n2.  **Problem 2** is a functional problem concerning the loss of important epistemic distinctions.\n\nThese two points fully address the prompt.\n\n<<<\nBased on the provided constraints, the two problems the JTB theory runs into are:\n\n**1. The Problem of Self-Contradiction:**\nThe JTB theory defines knowledge as requiring belief (K → B). However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two available and mutually exclusive epistemic states means that if one is in a state of 'Knowledge', one cannot be in a state of 'Belief' (K → ¬B). This creates a direct logical contradiction. The JTB definition of knowledge becomes impossible to satisfy because the condition of having a belief would place an individual in the 'Belief' state, thereby disqualifying them from being in the 'Knowledge' state.\n\n**2. The Problem of the Overly Coarse 'Belief' Category:**\nIn this system, any state that fails to meet all three JTB criteria must be classified as 'Belief'. This forces epistemically distinct states into a single, uninformative category. For instance, a 'Justified False Belief' (a rational error), an 'Unjustified True Belief' (a lucky guess), and an 'Unjustified False Belief' (a superstition) would all be categorized simply as 'Belief'. This lumping destroys the crucial distinction between having good reasons for a belief (justification) and not having them, rendering the category of 'Belief' too coarse for meaningful epistemic evaluation.\n>>>"
