Based on the provided constraints, the two problems the JTB theory runs into are:

**1. The Problem of Self-Contradiction:**
The JTB theory defines knowledge as requiring belief (K → B). However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two available and mutually exclusive epistemic states means that if one is in a state of 'Knowledge', one cannot be in a state of 'Belief' (K → ¬B). This creates a direct logical contradiction. The JTB definition of knowledge becomes impossible to satisfy because the condition of having a belief would place an individual in the 'Belief' state, thereby disqualifying them from being in the 'Knowledge' state.

**2. The Problem of the Overly Coarse 'Belief' Category:**
In this system, any state that fails to meet all three JTB criteria must be classified as 'Belief'. This forces epistemically distinct states into a single, uninformative category. For instance, a 'Justified False Belief' (a rational error), an 'Unjustified True Belief' (a lucky guess), and an 'Unjustified False Belief' (a superstition) would all be categorized simply as 'Belief'. This lumping destroys the crucial distinction between having good reasons for a belief (justification) and not having them, rendering the category of 'Belief' too coarse for meaningful epistemic evaluation.
