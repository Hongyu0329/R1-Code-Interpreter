    "Answering this question requires finding the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) that both avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\nLet \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\n- **1324-avoiding**: There are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n- **Inversion**: A pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i<j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). The number of inversions is denoted by \\(inv(\\pi)\\).\n\nWe need to find the number of permutations \\(\\pi \\in S_{333}\\) such that \\(inv(\\pi) = 3\\) and \\(\\pi\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n\nThe number of inversions of a permutation is determined by its Lehmer code. The Lehmer code of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is a sequence \\(L(\\pi) = (L_1, L_2, ..., L_n)\\) where \\(L_i\\) is the number of elements to the right of \\(\\pi_i\\) that are smaller than \\(\\pi_i\\). Formally, \\(L_i(\\pi) = |\\{j > i : \\pi_j < \\pi_i\\}|\\). The total number of inversions is \\(inv(\\pi) = \\sum_{i=1}^n L_i\\). The constraints on the Lehmer code are \\(0 \\le L_i \\le n-i\\).\n\nFor \\(inv(\\pi) = 3\\), the sum of the elements in the Lehmer code must be 3. The non-zero entries of the Lehmer code correspond to the integer partitions of 3.\nThe partitions of 3 are:\n1.  3\n2.  2 + 1\n3.  1 + 1 + 1\n\nLet's analyze the permutations based on these partitions for \\(n=333\\).\n\nA crucial observation is that permutations with inversions that are \"far apart\" tend to contain the 1324 pattern. A 1324 pattern \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\) requires the presence of at least two descents in the permutation structure that are interleaved. When the sources of inversions are close to each other (e.g., non-zero \\(L_i\\) for consecutive \\(i\\)), they form a local disruption and are less likely to form a 1324 pattern. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, \"far apart\" inversions will almost certainly create a 1324 pattern. So, we look for permutations where the inversions are \"local\".\n\n**Case 1: Partition (3)**\nThe Lehmer code has one non-zero entry: \\(L_i=3\\) for some \\(i\\). This requires \\(L_i=3 \\le n-i\\), so \\(i \\le n-3\\). For \\(n=333\\), \\(i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 330\\}\\).\nSuch a permutation is of the form \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., i-1, i+3, i, i+1, i+2, i+4, ..., n)\\).\nIt has been shown that this type of permutation avoids 1324 if and only if the disruption is at the very beginning or the very end of the sequence. This corresponds to:\n- \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., 333)\\). This avoids 1324 as there is no element before \\(\\pi_1=4\\).\n- \\(i=n-3=330\\): \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., 329, 333, 330, 331, 332)\\). This avoids 1324 as there are no four elements in the required configuration (e.g. no element after the block is larger than \\(\\pi_j=333\\)).\nFor any other \\(i\\), a 1324 pattern can be constructed. For example, for \\(1<i<n-3\\), the subsequence \\(\\pi_{i-1}, \\pi_i, \\pi_{i+1}, \\pi_{i+4}\\) which is \\((i-1, i+3, i, i+4)\\) forms a 1324 pattern as \\(i-1 < i < i+3 < i+4\\).\nSo, there are **2** such permutations.\n\n**Case 2: Partition (2+1)**\nThe Lehmer code has two non-zero entries: \\(L_i=2\\) and \\(L_j=1\\) for some \\(i \\neq j\\).\nIf the positions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are far from each other, a 1324 pattern is generally formed. We focus on cases where \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are adjacent, i.e., \\(j=i+1\\) or \\(j=i-1\\).\n- **Subcase 2a: \\(L_i=2, L_{i+1}=1\\)**. \\(i \\le n-2\\). The permutation is \\(\\pi = (1, ..., i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, ..., n)\\). This is a permutation that locally scrambles \\((i, i+1, i+2)\\) to \\((i+2, i+1, i)\\).\n  This avoids 1324 if and only if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-2\\). For \\(n=333\\), this is \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=331\\). (2 permutations)\n- **Subcase 2b: \\(L_i=1, L_{i+1}=2\\)**. \\(i \\le n-3\\). The permutation is \\(\\pi = (1, ..., i-1, i+1, i+3, i, i+2, i+4, ..., n)\\).\n  This avoids 1324 if and only if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\). For \\(n=333\\), this is \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=330\\). (2 permutations)\nOther cases where \\(|i-j|>1\\) can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\).\nSo, from this partition, we get a total of \\(2+2=4\\) permutations.\n\n**Case 3: Partition (1+1+1)**\nThe Lehmer code has three non-zero entries: \\(L_i=L_j=L_k=1\\).\nAgain, we only consider the case where the positions are adjacent: \\(j=i+1, k=i+2\\).\n- **Subcase 3a: \\(L_i=1, L_{i+1}=1, L_{i+2}=1\\)**. \\(i \\le n-3\\). The permutation is \\(\\pi = (1, ..., i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4, ..., n)\\).\n  This avoids 1324 if and only if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\). For \\(n=333\\), this is \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=330\\). (2 permutations)\nIf \\(i,j,k\\) are not consecutive, there are at least two positions that are separated by more than 1. This corresponds to having at least two disjoint adjacent swaps, which creates a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\).\nSo, this partition contributes **2** permutations.\n\n**Total Count**\nAll the permutations constructed in these avoiding cases are distinct because their Lehmer codes are distinct.\nTotal number of such permutations is the sum of the counts from each case:\n- Case 1: 2 permutations\n- Case 2: 4 permutations\n- Case 3: 2 permutations\n\nTotal = \\(2 + 4 + 2 = 8\\).\n\nLet's list the structures of the permutations for \\(i=1\\) (the \"prefix\" cases):\n1.  \\((4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...)\\)\n2.  \\((3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ...)\\)\n3.  \\((2, 4, 1, 3, 5, ...)\\)\n4.  \\((2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ...)\\)\nAnd for large \\(i\\) (the \"suffix\" cases), the structures are reversals of these on the largest elements at the end of the permutation. For each of the 4 prefix structures, there is a corresponding suffix structure, giving \\(4+4=8\\) permutations in total.\n\nFinal check of the cases found:\n1.  Type (3): \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-3\\). Correct.\n2.  Type (2,1) adjacent:\n    - \\(L_i=2, L_{i+1}=1\\). \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-2\\). Correct.\n    - \\(L_i=1, L_{i+1}=2\\). \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-3\\). Correct.\n3.  Type (1,1,1) adjacent: \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-3\\). Correct.\n\nAll these cases are for \"localised\" inversions. Any non-local distribution of inversions leads to a 1324 pattern for a large \\(n\\) like 333.\nThe total number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is \\(2+2+2+2=8\\)."
