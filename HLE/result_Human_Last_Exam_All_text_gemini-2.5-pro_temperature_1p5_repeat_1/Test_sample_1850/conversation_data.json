    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Historical saints\"**: This is a crucial qualifier. It distinguishes from biblical figures who are also considered saints (like the apostles Peter and Paul, or prophets like Moses and Elijah). The question asks for figures from church history, i.e., those who lived *after* the biblical era and were later venerated or canonized as saints.\n    *   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The specific name of the saint, or a clear adjectival form derived from it, must appear in the text. A mere allusion to their life or works is not sufficient.\n    *   **\"In Milton's *Paradise Lost*\"**: The search is confined to the twelve books of the epic poem.\n\n2.  **Consider Milton's Theological Stance:**\n    *   John Milton was a devout but fiercely independent Protestant, with strong anti-Catholic and anti-monastic sentiments.\n    *   He believed that the Catholic Church, particularly after the time of Emperor Constantine, had fallen into corruption. Practices like the veneration of saints, praying to them, and monasticism were, in his view, forms of \"superstition\" and \"idolatry\".\n    *   Given this perspective, it is highly unlikely that Milton would mention historical saints in a positive or venerational context. If he mentions them, it would almost certainly be in a critical or satirical manner.\n\n3.  **Search the Text for Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The most likely place to find such references is in passages where Milton describes the future corruption of the Church. The primary locations for this are Adam's vision of the future in Books XI and XII, and the description of the \"Paradise of Fools\" in Book III.\n\n4.  **Examine Book III: The \"Paradise of Fools\"**:\n    *   In Book III, Milton describes a limbo \"over the backside of the World\" reserved for all things vain and foolish. He populates this limbo with people who relied on empty rituals and \"zealous Superstition\" for their salvation.\n    *   He explicitly lists various Catholic \"trumpery\" like \"Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls\".\n    *   He then describes the people who end up there:\n        > \"And they who to be sure of Paradise\n        > Dying put on the weeds of **DOMINIC**,\n        > Or in **FRANCISCAN** think to pass disguis’d\"\n        > (Book III, lines 478-480)\n\n5.  **Identify the Named Saints:**\n    *   **Saint Dominic**: The line \"weeds of DOMINIC\" is a direct reference to Saint Dominic de Guzmán (c. 1170–1221), the founder of the Dominican Order (the \"Black Friars\"). Milton is mocking the belief that being buried in a Dominican habit could help one's soul get to heaven. This is a clear mention by name.\n    *   **Saint Francis**: The line \"in FRANCISCAN think to pass disguis’d\" refers to Saint Francis of Assisi (c. 1181–1226), founder of the Franciscan Order (the \"Grey Friars\"). \"Franciscan\" is the adjectival form of his name, and the reference is unmistakable. This also counts as a mention by name.\n\n6.  **Search for Other Mentions:**\n    *   A thorough search of the text for other prominent historical saints (e.g., Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Gregory, Benedict, Athanasius, George) reveals no other direct mentions by name.\n    *   While Milton alludes to historical events where saints were involved (like the Arian controversy, involving St. Athanasius), he does not name the saints themselves.\n    *   He mentions biblical figures who are also saints (Peter, John, Paul), but as established in Step 1, these do not fit the criteria of \"historical saints\" as distinct from biblical figures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a careful analysis of the text and an understanding of Milton's theological views, *Paradise Lost* mentions exactly two historical, post-biblical saints by name. Both are mentioned in a single, satirical passage in Book III to criticize monasticism and what Milton saw as the false promise of salvation through works and rituals rather than faith.\n\nThe two saints are:\n1.  **Saint Dominic**\n2.  **Saint Francis**\n\nTherefore, the total number is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
