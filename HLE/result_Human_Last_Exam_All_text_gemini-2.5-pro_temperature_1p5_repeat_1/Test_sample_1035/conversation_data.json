    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of the complete graph $K_n$ for $n=35$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet $K_n$ be the complete graph on a vertex set $V$, where $|V|=n$. We want to find a family of bipartite graphs $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$ such that the union of their edge sets covers all edges of $K_n$. Let $G_i$ have vertex set $V_i \\subseteq V$. The goal is to minimize the quantity $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|$, which represents the \"total number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs\".\n\nThis problem is a known problem in combinatorics, often phrased as finding the minimum size of a \"biclique cover\" of $K_n$, where the size is measured by the sum of the orders of the bicliques. A biclique is a complete bipartite graph. Since any bipartite graph is a subgraph of a complete bipartite graph on the same vertex set, we can assume without loss of generality that the graphs $G_i$ are bicliques.\n\n### Step 2: Formalizing the Problem with Vectors\nWe can represent this problem using vectors. Let $k$ be the number of bipartite graphs in our family. We can assign to each vertex $v \\in V$ a vector $y_v \\in \\{0, 1, *\\}^k$.\nFor each graph $G_i$ with bipartition $(A_i, B_i)$, we define the vector coordinates for each vertex $v \\in V$ as follows:\n- $y_v(i) = 0$ if $v \\in A_i$\n- $y_v(i) = 1$ if $v \\in B_i$\n- $y_v(i) = *$ if $v \\notin V_i = A_i \\cup B_i$\n\nThe condition that the family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}$ covers all edges of $K_n$ means that for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V$, the edge $(u,v)$ must belong to some $G_i$. This implies that for some $i$, we must have $u$ in one part of the bipartition of $G_i$ and $v$ in the other. In terms of our vector representation, this means that for any distinct $u, v$, there must exist a coordinate $i$ such that $\\{y_u(i), y_v(i)\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe quantity to minimize, $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|$, is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph. The number of vertices in graph $G_i$ is $|V_i| = |\\{v \\in V \\mid y_v(i) \\neq *\\}|$. Therefore, $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|$ is equal to the total number of non-$*$ entries in the set of all vectors $\\{y_v\\}_{v \\in V}$.\n\n### Step 3: Relating to a Known Theorem\nThis problem has been studied, and a key result connects it to a problem in extremal graph theory on the hypercube. The minimum value we are looking for, let's call it $f(n)$, is given by a theorem (attributed to Füredi, and stated in several surveys and theses, e.g., by Pritikin or Cioabă):\n$f(n) = 2 \\cdot e(n, k)$\nwhere $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$, and $e(n, k)$ is the minimum number of edges in a subgraph of the $k$-dimensional hypercube $Q_k$ induced by a set of $n$ vertices.\n\nHarper's Theorem states that $e(n, k)$ is minimized by choosing the set of vertices $C$ corresponding to the first $n$ binary vectors of length $k$ in lexicographical order.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Theorem for n = 35\n1.  **Determine the hypercube dimension `k`**:\n    For $n=35$, we need $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $k=6$. So we will work with the 6-dimensional hypercube, $Q_6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the set of `n` vertices `C`**:\n    We need to choose the first 35 binary vectors of length 6 in lexicographical (or numerical) order.\n    - The first 32 vectors are all vectors starting with 0: $\\{ (0, x) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^5 \\}$. These correspond to the integers 0 to 31. Let's call this set $C_0$.\n    - We need $35 - 32 = 3$ more vectors. These are the next three binary numbers:\n        - 32: `100000`\n        - 33: `100001`\n        - 34: `100010`\n    Let's call this set $C_1 = \\{(1,0,0,0,0,0), (1,0,0,0,0,1), (1,0,0,0,1,0)\\}$.\n    So our set of vertices is $C = C_0 \\cup C_1$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of edges `e(35, 6)`**:\n    We need to find the number of edges in the subgraph of $Q_6$ induced by $C$, which we denote as $|E(Q_6[C])|$. We can count this by summing the edges within $C_0$, within $C_1$, and between $C_0$ and $C_1$.\n    - **Edges within $C_0$**: The set $C_0$ forms a complete 5-dimensional hypercube, $Q_5$. The number of edges in $Q_d$ is $d \\cdot 2^{d-1}$. For $Q_5$, this is $5 \\cdot 2^{5-1} = 5 \\cdot 16 = 80$.\n    - **Edges within $C_1$**: The set $C_1$ has three vertices: $v_{32}=(1,0,0,0,0,0)$, $v_{33}=(1,0,0,0,0,1)$, and $v_{34}=(1,0,0,0,1,0)$. Two vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate (i.e., their Hamming distance is 1).\n        - $d(v_{32}, v_{33}) = 1$ (they differ in the last bit). So, there is an edge.\n        - $d(v_{32}, v_{34}) = 1$ (they differ in the second to last bit). So, there is an edge.\n        - $d(v_{33}, v_{34}) = 2$. No edge.\n      There are 2 edges within $C_1$.\n    - **Edges between $C_0$ and $C_1$**: An edge exists between a vertex $u \\in C_0$ and $v \\in C_1$ if $d(u,v)=1$. Since all vertices in $C_0$ start with 0 and all in $C_1$ start with 1, they must differ in the first coordinate. For them to be adjacent, they must be identical in all other coordinates.\n        - $v_{32}=(1,0,0,0,0,0)$: Its neighbor across the first dimension is $(0,0,0,0,0,0)$, which is in $C_0$.\n        - $v_{33}=(1,0,0,0,0,1)$: Its neighbor is $(0,0,0,0,0,1)$, which is in $C_0$.\n        - $v_{34}=(1,0,0,0,1,0)$: Its neighbor is $(0,0,0,0,1,0)$, which is in $C_0$.\n      There are 3 edges between $C_0$ and $C_1$.\n    - **Total edges**: The total number of edges is the sum of these counts:\n      $e(35, 6) = |E(Q_6[C])| = 80 + 2 + 3 = 85$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer**:\n    Using the formula $f(n) = 2 \\cdot e(n, k)$, we get:\n    $f(35) = 2 \\cdot e(35, 6) = 2 \\cdot 85 = 170$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 170. This result is significantly better than the simpler upper bound of $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 = 210$."
