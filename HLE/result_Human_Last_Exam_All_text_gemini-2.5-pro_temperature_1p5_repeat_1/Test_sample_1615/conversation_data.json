    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has a specific number of vertices and is not a complete graph.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   Let $G$ be a graph.\n    *   The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is \"other than the complete graph\". This means $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ satisfying these conditions.\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Properties of Chromatic Number:**\n    *   The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$.\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, a trivial upper bound on the chromatic number is $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n    *   A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph, $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so they all must have different colors.\n\n3.  **Apply the Properties to the Specific Problem:**\n    *   We are given that $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   We are also given the crucial piece of information that $G$ is **not** a complete graph, i.e., $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   Based on the property mentioned in the previous step, since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\n    *   Therefore, we can establish a strict upper bound: $\\chi(G) < n$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n    *   For this problem, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Determine if this Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   The analysis so far tells us that no such graph can require more than 12344 colors. The question is whether it's possible for a graph to require exactly 12344 colors. To confirm this, we must show that there exists at least one graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not complete, but has a chromatic number of 12344.\n    *   Let's try to construct such a graph.\n    *   Consider a graph $G$ that consists of two disconnected components:\n        1.  A complete graph on 12344 vertices, let's call it $H_1 = K_{12344}$.\n        2.  A single isolated vertex, let's call it $H_2 = K_1$.\n    *   The total number of vertices in this graph $G$ is $|V(H_1)| + |V(H_2)| = 12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n    *   Is this graph $G$ a complete graph? No. For $G$ to be a complete graph ($K_{12345}$), every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In our construction, the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. Therefore, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   What is the chromatic number of this graph $G$? The chromatic number of a graph with multiple disconnected components is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n        *   $\\chi(H_1) = \\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   $\\chi(H_2) = \\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n        *   $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(H_1), \\chi(H_2)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   We have also constructed a specific graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344. The mention of \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is a standard property of a graph but does not act as a further constraint that changes the answer in this context.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Identify the Core Question:** The problem asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ over a specific class of graphs.\n*   **Use the Key Constraint:** The most important constraint is that $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_n$).\n*   **Establish a Firm Upper Bound:** Knowing that only $K_n$ requires $n$ colors, any graph that is not $K_n$ must require at most $n-1$ colors.\n*   **Prove the Bound is Tight:** Demonstrate that the upper bound of $n-1$ is achievable by providing a concrete example of a graph that meets the criteria and has a chromatic number of $n-1$. The construction $G = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$ is a standard and effective example.\n\nFinal answer is calculated by taking the number of vertices, $n=12345$, and subtracting 1."
