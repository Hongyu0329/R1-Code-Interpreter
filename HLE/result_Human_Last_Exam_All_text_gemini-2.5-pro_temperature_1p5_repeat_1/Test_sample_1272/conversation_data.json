    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Context:**\n    *   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A prominent general of the Ming Dynasty in China.\n    *   **The Conflict:** The Lam Sơn War (1418–1427), which was a Vietnamese war of independence led by Lê Lợi against the Ming occupation of Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination).\n    *   **The Question:** Pinpoint the location of Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\" and identify its corresponding modern Vietnamese province.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   In the context of this war, a \"major defeat\" refers to a significant military loss where an army under a general's command is routed, suffers heavy casualties, and fails in its strategic objective. This is distinct from minor skirmishes or tactical retreats.\n    *   While Mu Sheng participated in earlier stages of the war against the Lam Sơn uprising, the most notable defeats for the Ming were inflicted on other generals or were situations where Mu Sheng was not the primary commander facing the loss. The most significant defeat attributed directly to his command occurred during the final Ming campaign.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Ming Campaign (1427):**\n    *   In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent a massive final expeditionary force to crush Lê Lợi's rebellion once and for all. This force was split into two armies.\n    *   The primary army was led by General Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), advancing from Guangxi.\n    *   The secondary army was led by General Mu Sheng, advancing from Yunnan to provide support and attack from a different direction.\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and completely destroyed in the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang (in modern-day Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces). Liu Sheng himself was killed.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Defeat:**\n    *   Upon receiving news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, the morale in Mu Sheng's army collapsed. Fearing a similar fate, Mu Sheng abandoned his offensive and ordered a hasty retreat back to Yunnan.\n    *   Lê Lợi dispatched his generals, including Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to pursue and attack the retreating Ming army.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces caught up with Mu Sheng's army and inflicted a devastating defeat upon them at the passes of **Lãnh Câu (ải Lãnh Câu)** and **Đan Xá (ải Đan Xá)**.\n    *   In these battles, Mu Sheng's army was routed. The Vietnamese forces captured thousands of Ming soldiers, horses, and a vast quantity of supplies. Mu Sheng barely escaped with his life, fleeing back to Yunnan. This rout effectively ended his campaign and was a major, personal defeat.\n\n5.  **Locate the Battle Site in Modern Vietnam:**\n    *   Historical records and maps place the Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá passes, the sites of this decisive battle, in the western, mountainous region of what is today **Nghệ An Province**. This region was on Mu Sheng's invasion and subsequent retreat route from Yunnan and was a key strategic area throughout the Lam Sơn War.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Generals:** It is crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng Pass. Liu Sheng's defeat happened first and was the catalyst for Mu Sheng's retreat and subsequent defeat.\n2.  **Timeline of the War:** The early years of the war (1418-1423) involved many battles, but the Lam Sơn forces were often on the defensive. Mu Sheng's most significant and personal failure as a field commander came at the very end of the war in 1427.\n3.  **Geographical Accuracy:** The location of the battle is key. The pursuit of Mu Sheng's army occurred as it retreated through the mountainous terrain connecting the Red River Delta region to Yunnan. Historical sources confirm this route passed through the territory of modern Nghệ An.\n4.  **Defining the Defeat:** The rout at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá was not just a retreat; it was a forced, panicked withdrawal that turned into a military disaster where a large part of the army was destroyed or captured. This qualifies it as a \"major defeat.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the 1427 campaign, General Mu Sheng's first major and defining defeat occurred when his retreating army was crushed by Vietnamese forces at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. These historical locations are situated in the modern-day province of Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
