    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a ballet step from the given options where the final placement of the feet (e.g., right foot in front in fifth position) is identical to the initial placement.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump where the legs rapidly cross and uncross. An *entrechat* with an even number (like two, four, or six) that starts and lands on two feet is by definition *changé* (changed). The legs beat six times, and the dancer lands with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** All even-numbered entrechats that land on two feet change the feet.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement:** The name of the step itself provides the answer. *Échappé* means the legs \"escape\" from a closed position to an open one (e.g., fifth to second) and then return. *Battu* means the legs beat as they close. *Changé* explicitly means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word *changé* in the name of a step is a direct indicator that the feet will change their starting position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement:** The word *assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" In its most basic form, a working leg brushes out from fifth position (e.g., the front foot brushes to the side or forward), the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air to land simultaneously back in fifth position. In a standard, unqualified *assemblé*, the foot that started in front will land in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the same foot in front as the start (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** While there are variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) which do change the feet, the fundamental step *assemblé* does not. Compared to the other options which are inherently changing steps, this is the correct choice.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" *Derrière* means \"behind.\" This step involves a glide where the front foot closes in the back. Starting with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot glides out, weight is transferred, and the right foot closes *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but now the left foot is in front. The feet have changed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The direction of the close (*derrière*) determines the change. A close to the back from the front results in a change of feet.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative jumping step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg while in the air. The standard execution of this step involves changing the feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is an ornate step that almost always travels and changes feet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the *assemblé* is the only step among the choices that, in its basic form, concludes with the feet in the same position as they were in the beginning. All other steps listed inherently involve a change of feet (*changé*).\n\n<<<C>>>"
