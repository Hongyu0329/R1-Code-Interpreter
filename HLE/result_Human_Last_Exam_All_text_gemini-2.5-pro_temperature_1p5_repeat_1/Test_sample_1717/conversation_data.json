    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Normal Mode. According to the Terraria source code, this value is **2,800 HP**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Expert Mode Multiplier:**\n    In Expert Mode, the health of bosses is significantly increased. Since the 1.4 \"Journey's End\" update, boss health is multiplied by a flat factor of 2.0.\n    *   Base Expert Health (for 1 player) = Base Normal Health × 2.0\n    *   Base Expert Health = 2,800 × 2.0 = **5,600 HP**\n\n3.  **Determine the Multiplayer Scaling Formula:**\n    Expert Mode introduces a health scaling mechanic that increases a boss's health for each additional player in the world. For each player beyond the first, the boss's total health is increased by 35%.\n    The formula can be expressed as:\n    `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`\n    Where:\n    *   `BaseExpertHealth` is the health with one player (5,600 HP).\n    *   `N` is the total number of players.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Health Function:**\n    Plugging the Eye of Cthulhu's Base Expert Health into the formula, we get the function for its health based on the number of players (`N`):\n    `Health(N) = 5,600 × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`\n    This can be simplified for easier analysis:\n    `Health(N) = 5,600 × (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    `Health(N) = 5,600 × (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n    `Health(N) = 3,640 + 1,960N`\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an **infinite** number of players. We must evaluate the limit of our health function as `N` approaches infinity.\n    `lim (N → ∞) [3,640 + 1,960N]`\n    As `N` becomes infinitely large, the `1,960N` term dominates, and the function's value grows without bound. Mathematically, the limit is infinity.\n\n6.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    The question specifically references the game's \"source code\". This implies we must consider the technical limitations of the game's implementation. In Terraria, an NPC's health is stored in a variable named `lifeMax`. This variable is a standard 32-bit signed integer (`int` in C#).\n\n7.  **Identify the Data Type Limit:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value is 2³¹ - 1.\n    *   Maximum `int` value = **2,147,483,647**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Terraria Version:** The health calculation used here is from Terraria 1.4+. While older versions had a different base health for Expert mode, the health still scaled linearly with players, leading to the same conclusion regarding the limit.\n*   **\"Theoretical\" vs. \"Practical\":** The word \"theoretical\" in the question pushes us beyond the in-game player limit (255) but still keeps us within the boundaries of the code's architecture (the `int` data type).\n*   **Integer Overflow:** If the health calculation were to exceed `2,147,483,647`, it would result in an integer overflow. In Terraria's `unchecked` programming context, this would cause the value to wrap around and become a large negative number, likely killing the boss instantly. Therefore, the maximum stable health the boss can have is the maximum value of the `int` data type.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the mathematical formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health increases infinitely with the number of players, the game's source code stores this value in a 32-bit signed integer. This imposes a hard cap on its health. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is the highest value this data type can hold.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
