The probability is given by the expression $\mathbb{E}_{F} \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 W(u, v) du dv \right]$, where the expectation $\mathbb{E}_{F}$ is taken with respect to the random measure $F$ that governs the choice of the random graphon $W(u,v)$, and the integral is over the uniform measure on the unit square.
