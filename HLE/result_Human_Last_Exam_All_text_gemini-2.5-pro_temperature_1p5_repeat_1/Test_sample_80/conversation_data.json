    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\nThe objective is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no bishop can attack another. We then need to determine how many edge squares are left unoccupied.\n\n*   **Board:** An 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops.\n*   **Placement Area:** Only the edge squares.\n*   **Rule:** No two bishops can be on the same diagonal.\n*   **Question:** How many edge squares remain empty after placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops?\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Edge Squares\nAn 8x8 board has 4 sides. Each side consists of 8 squares. If we simply multiply 4 by 8, we get 32, but this double-counts the 4 corner squares.\nA more accurate calculation is:\nTotal Edge Squares = (Squares on all 4 sides) - (4 corner squares counted twice)\nTotal Edge Squares = (4 Ã— 8) - 4 = 28.\nSo, there are 28 available squares for placing the bishops.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Bishop's Attack and Simplify the Problem\nA crucial characteristic of bishops is that they are color-bound. A bishop placed on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. Similarly, a bishop on a black square is confined to black squares.\nThis means we can solve the problem in two independent parts:\n1.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the **white edge squares**.\n2.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the **black edge squares**.\n\nThe total number of bishops will be the sum of these two results.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares\nFirst, we count the number of white edge squares. An 8x8 board is perfectly symmetrical, with 32 white and 32 black squares. The 28 edge squares are evenly divided by color.\n*   Total White Edge Squares = 14.\n*   Total Black Edge Squares = 14.\n\nTo find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 white edge squares, we need to find the largest set of these squares where no two squares share a diagonal. A systematic way to do this is to group the squares by the diagonals they occupy. Any two squares in the same group attack each other, so we can only place one bishop from each group.\n\nThe 14 white edge squares can be uniquely partitioned into a set of components where squares within a component are connected by attacks. For the white squares, the attack graph forms four separate components:\n1.  One component consisting of the squares `h1` and `a8`. They attack each other, so we can place at most **1** bishop.\n2.  A second component is a cycle of 4 squares: `b1-a2-g8-h7-b1`. On a cycle of 4, we can place a maximum of **2** non-attacking bishops (e.g., on b1 and g8).\n3.  A third component is another cycle of 4: `d1-a4-e8-h5-d1`. We can place a maximum of **2** bishops here.\n4.  A fourth component is the last cycle of 4: `f1-a6-c8-h3-f1`. We can place a maximum of **2** bishops here.\n\nSumming the maximum number of bishops from each component: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\nSo, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on white edge squares is **7**.\n\n### Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares\nThe analysis for the 14 black edge squares is remarkably similar due to the board's symmetry.\nThe attack graph for the black squares also decomposes into four components with the exact same structure:\n1.  One component of 2 squares (`a1` and `h8`). Maximum of **1** bishop.\n2.  A cycle of 4 squares (`g1-h2-b8-a7-g1`). Maximum of **2** bishops.\n3.  A cycle of 4 squares (`e1-h4-d8-a5-e1`). Maximum of **2** bishops.\n4.  A cycle of 4 squares (`c1-h6-f8-a3-c1`). Maximum of **2** bishops.\n\nSumming the maximums: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\nThe maximum number of bishops that can be placed on black edge squares is **7**.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Total Bishops and the Final Answer\nThe total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color.\n*   Total Maximum Bishops = (Max on White) + (Max on Black) = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n*   Total Edge Squares = 28\n*   Bishops Placed = 14\n*   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = Total Edge Squares - Bishops Placed\n*   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
