    "This is a number sequence problem. To find the missing number, we need to identify the pattern governing the sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **List the given sequence:**\n    The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n2.  **Look for a simple difference pattern (First-order differences):**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric pattern here.\n\n3.  **Look for a multiplicative pattern:**\n    Since the numbers are growing quickly, a multiplicative pattern is likely. Let's try to express each term as a multiple of the previous term plus or minus a constant.\n    *   `Term_n = k * Term_{n-1} ± c`\n    Let's test k=2:\n    *   2 * 2 = 4.  To get to 11, we add 7. (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n    *   2 * 11 = 22. To get to 23, we add 1. (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n    *   2 * 23 = 46. To get to 51, we add 5. (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n    *   2 * 51 = 102. To get to 119, we add 17. (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\n    The added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. This sequence doesn't have a clear pattern.\n\n    Let's test k=3:\n    *   3 * 2 = 6. To get to 11, we add 5. (11 = 3 * 2 + 5)\n    *   3 * 11 = 33. To get to 23, we subtract 10. (23 = 3 * 11 - 10)\n    *   3 * 23 = 69. To get to 51, we subtract 18. (51 = 3 * 23 - 18)\n    *   3 * 51 = 153. To get to 119, we subtract 34. (119 = 3 * 51 - 34)\n\n4.  **Analyze the pattern of the subtracted numbers:**\n    The pattern is: `Term_n = 3 * Term_{n-1} - (a specific number)`.\n    The sequence of subtracted numbers (starting from the third term) is {10, 18, 34, ...}. Let's call this sequence B.\n    *   B = {10, 18, 34, ...}\n\n5.  **Find the pattern within sequence B:**\n    Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms in B.\n    *   18 - 10 = 8\n    *   34 - 18 = 16\n    The differences are 8, 16. This is a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous term (8, 8*2=16).\n\n6.  **Predict the next term in the difference sequence:**\n    The next difference should be 16 * 2 = 32.\n\n7.  **Predict the next term in sequence B:**\n    The next term in sequence B is the previous term (34) plus the next difference (32).\n    *   Next term in B = 34 + 32 = 66.\n\n8.  **Calculate the missing number in the original sequence:**\n    The missing number is the next term in the original sequence. We apply the rule we found: `Term_6 = 3 * Term_5 - (next number from sequence B)`.\n    *   Term_5 = 119\n    *   Next number from sequence B = 66\n    *   Missing Number = 3 * 119 - 66\n    *   Missing Number = 357 - 66\n    *   Missing Number = 291\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The pattern is `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - b_{n-1}`, where the sequence `b` is {10, 18, 34, 66, ...}. The next number in the original sequence is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\nThe pattern is as follows:\n23 = 11 × 3 - 10\n51 = 23 × 3 - 18\n119 = 51 × 3 - 34\nThe subtracted numbers are 10, 18, 34.\nThe differences between these numbers are:\n18 - 10 = 8\n34 - 18 = 16\nThese differences form a geometric sequence with a ratio of 2 (8, 16, ...). The next difference will be 16 × 2 = 32.\nSo, the next number to be subtracted will be 34 + 32 = 66.\nTherefore, the number in the parentheses is:\n119 × 3 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
