    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type:**\n    The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The reaction is an electrocyclization occurring under thermal conditions. The reacting part of the molecule is the conjugated octatetraene system from carbon C2 to C9. The substituents on the termini of this system are the methyl groups C1 (attached to C2) and C10 (attached to C9).\n\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules / FMO Theory:**\n    The electrocyclization involves 8 π-electrons from the four conjugated double bonds. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a system with `4n` π-electrons (here, n=2) undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure under thermal conditions. This is predicted by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which considers the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). For an 8 π-electron system, the HOMO (ψ₄) has terminal lobes of opposite symmetry, requiring a conrotatory motion to achieve bonding overlap.\n\n3.  **Consider Reactant Isomerization:**\n    The question states that two products, cis-isomer A and trans-isomer B, are formed. A single stereoisomer reacting through a single, well-defined stereospecific pathway (conrotation) should yield only one product. The formation of two diastereomeric products implies that the reaction proceeds from two different stereoisomers of the reactant that are in equilibrium under the thermal conditions.\n    The starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it **R_E**). It can isomerize at the C8=C9 double bond to form \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it **R_Z**).\n    **R_E**  ⇌  **R_Z**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome for Each Isomer:**\n    We must determine the stereochemical outcome of the conrotatory cyclization for both **R_E** and **R_Z**. This is done by arranging the C2-C9 chain in the required 'U-shaped' (all-s-cis) conformation and determining the orientation of the terminal methyl groups. Let's define \"out\" as pointing away from the 'U' and \"in\" as pointing towards the inside.\n\n    *   **From R_E (\\(...,8E\\))**:\n        *   At C2 (part of a 2Z bond): The methyl group points **out**.\n        *   At C9 (part of an 8E bond): The methyl group also points **out**.\n        *   A conrotatory closure of an **(out, out)** system results in the two methyl groups being on opposite sides of the newly formed ring. This is the **trans-isomer B**.\n        **R_E → Product B (trans)**\n\n    *   **From R_Z (\\(...,8Z\\))**:\n        *   At C2 (part of a 2Z bond): The methyl group points **out**.\n        *   At C9 (part of an 8Z bond): The methyl group points **in**.\n        *   A conrotatory closure of an **(out, in)** system results in the two methyl groups being on the same side of the ring. This is the **cis-isomer A**.\n        **R_Z → Product A (cis)**\n\n5.  **Apply the Curtin-Hammett Principle:**\n    Since the two isomers **R_E** and **R_Z** are in rapid equilibrium compared to the rate of cyclization, the ratio of products A/B is determined not by the relative concentrations of **R_E** and **R_Z**, but by the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to A and B.\n    Product Ratio [A]/[B] = exp[-(G‡_A - G‡_B)/RT], where G‡_A and G‡_B are the free energies of the transition states for the formation of A and B, respectively.\n\n6.  **Analyze Transition State Energies (Incorporating FMO Theory):**\n    We need to compare the stability of the two transition states, `TS_A` (from **R_Z**) and `TS_B` (from **R_E**). Two main factors contribute: steric hindrance and secondary orbital interactions (an FMO concept).\n\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:**\n        *   `TS_B` (leading to trans-product): The reactant **R_E** must adopt a conformation where the C7-C8 single bond is s-cis. This is sterically unfavorable because the C8=C9 double bond is E. This introduces torsional strain and a steric clash between the hydrogens on C7 and C8.\n        *   `TS_A` (leading to cis-product): The reactant **R_Z** must have its C9-methyl group pointing \"in\". This creates a significant steric clash between this inward-pointing methyl group and the backbone of the polyene chain (around C5 and C6). This type of clash is typically highly destabilizing.\n\n    *   **Secondary Orbital Interactions (FMO Theory):**\n        *   In the conrotatory transition state, non-bonding atoms are brought into close proximity (e.g., C4 and C7). The FMO theory predicts that there can be stabilizing (attractive) interactions between the lobes of the HOMO on these atoms.\n        *   The `all-Z`-like conformation of **R_Z** is more compact and regular (helical). This geometry allows for stronger overlap between the interacting orbitals in `TS_A`, leading to a greater stabilizing effect from secondary interactions.\n        *   The conformation of **R_E** is less regular due to the 'kink' from the E-double bond. This leads to weaker overlap and less stabilization from secondary interactions in `TS_B`.\n\n7.  **Final Prediction of the Ratio:**\n    We have a competition between steric and electronic (FMO) effects:\n    *   **`TS_A` (→ cis)**: Highly destabilized by sterics (Me-in clash), but highly stabilized by secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   **`TS_B` (→ trans)**: Less destabilized by sterics (torsional strain), but also less stabilized by secondary orbital interactions.\n\n    The question's premise that both products are formed suggests that neither transition state is prohibitively high in energy and they are likely of comparable energy. The FMO-based secondary orbital interactions provide a rationale for how the high steric strain in `TS_A` could be offset. If we assume that the stronger electronic stabilization in `TS_A` approximately cancels out its greater steric hindrance when compared to `TS_B`, the free energies of the two transition states would be nearly equal (G‡_A ≈ G‡_B).\n\n    If G‡_A ≈ G‡_B, then ΔG‡ ≈ 0. The product ratio is:\n    Ratio of A : B = exp(-0/RT) = 1.\n    Therefore, the predicted ratio is 1:1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1:1}$.\n<<<1:1>>>"
