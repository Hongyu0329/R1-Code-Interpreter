    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about a specific anatomical feature of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. This was a spinosaurid theropod that lived in what is now Brazil during the Early Cretaceous period.\n2.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on the \"lacrimal recess\".\n    *   The **lacrimal** is a bone in the skull that sits in front of the orbit (eye socket) and typically forms the posterior border of the antorbital fenestra (a large opening in front of the eye).\n    *   A **recess** (or fossa) is a depression or indentation in a bone.\n    *   The question asks for the number of smaller **depressions** *within* this main lacrimal recess.\n3.  **Locate the Authoritative Scientific Source:** To answer such a specific anatomical question, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the skull of *Irritator*. The most detailed and widely cited description is the 2002 monograph by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n4.  **Examine the Description in the Source:** In this paper, the authors provide a meticulous description of each bone in the holotype skull (SMNS 58022). In the section describing the lacrimal bone, they write about the lacrimal recess.\n5.  **Extract the Specific Information:** The paper explicitly states the following regarding the lacrimal recess: *\"The lacrimal recess houses **two** large, anteroposteriorly succeeding depressions of subequal size.\"*\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The primary scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull clearly documents the presence of two distinct depressions located within the larger lacrimal recess on the lacrimal bone.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Precision of Terminology:** It is important to distinguish between the larger *antorbital fossa* (a depression that houses the antorbital fenestra), the *lacrimal recess* (a specific depression on the lacrimal bone posterior to the antorbital fossa), and the smaller *depressions* located inside the lacrimal recess. The question is specifically about the last of these.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies entirely on the accuracy of the published scientific description of the only known skull of *Irritator*. General dinosaur books or websites are unlikely to contain this level of anatomical detail.\n*   **Anatomical Context:** These depressions are part of a complex system of pneumatic (air-filled) sinuses and fenestrae (openings) in the skulls of theropod dinosaurs, which served to lighten the skull without compromising its strength. The presence of two depressions in this recess is a characteristic feature noted in the diagnosis of this animal.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can confidently state the final answer.\n\n***\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2>>>"
