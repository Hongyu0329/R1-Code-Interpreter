    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is `CH2=CH-CH=CH2`. It is a conjugated diene, a key component for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is `CCl2=CF2`. This is an alkene substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (halogens), making it an excellent dienophile for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where 4 pi electrons from the diene and 2 pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Product:**\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, a six-membered ring is formed from the four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile.\n    *   The diene, `C(1)H2=C(2)H-C(3)H=C(4)H2`, rearranges its bonds. The pi bond between C2 and C3 moves to form the new double bond in the product ring. The terminal carbons, C1 and C4, form new single (sigma) bonds.\n    *   The dienophile, `C(a)Cl2=C(b)F2`, has its double bond converted to a single bond, and its carbons, C(a) and C(b), form new sigma bonds to the terminal carbons of the diene.\n    *   The new ring is formed by connecting C1 of the diene to one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., C(a)) and C4 of the diene to the other carbon of the dienophile (C(b)).\n    *   The resulting six-membered ring has the atoms connected in the sequence: `-C(1)-C(2)=C(3)-C(4)-C(b)-C(a)-`. The atoms C(a) and C(b) from the dienophile are adjacent in the product ring, as are the four carbons from the diene.\n\n3.  **Address Potential Regiochemistry:**\n    *   Regiochemistry asks which end of an unsymmetrical diene connects to which end of an unsymmetrical dienophile.\n    *   In this specific case, the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. Therefore, there is no regiochemical ambiguity. Whether C1 connects to the `CCl2` carbon and C4 to the `CF2` carbon, or vice-versa, the same single product molecule is formed. Flipping the molecule in space would show they are identical.\n\n4.  **Draw and Name the Final Product:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene ring. The double bond is within the ring.\n    *   On two adjacent saturated carbons of the ring, there are geminal substituents: two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on the other.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n              CH=CH\n             /     \\\n           H2C     CH2\n            |       |\n           CCl2 -- CF2\n        ```\n    *   To name this molecule using IUPAC nomenclature:\n        a. The parent ring is a cyclohexene.\n        b. The double bond carbons are numbered 1 and 2.\n        c. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions). Numbering either clockwise or counter-clockwise from the double bond places the substituents at positions 4 and 5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n        d. Since the locant sets are identical for both numbering directions, we use alphabetical order to decide which substituent gets the lower number. \"Dichloro\" comes alphabetically before \"difluoro\".\n        e. Therefore, the `CCl2` group is assigned to position 4, and the `CF2` group is assigned to position 5.\n    *   The final IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe product of the reaction is a six-membered ring formed via a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Its chemical name is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
