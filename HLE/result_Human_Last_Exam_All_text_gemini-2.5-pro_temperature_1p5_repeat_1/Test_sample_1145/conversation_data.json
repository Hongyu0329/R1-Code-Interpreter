    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n**1. Define the System and Goal**\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length `a`.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the `n=2` energy state.\n*   **Interval:** We want to find the particle between `x₁ = 0.495a` and `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability `P` for the particle to be located in this interval.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics**\n*   The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n*   The probability density, which represents the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is `|ψn(x)|²`.\n    `P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`\n*   The probability of finding the particle in the interval from `x₁` to `x₂` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψn(x)|² dx`\n\n**3. Substitute the Specific Values into the Equations**\n*   For our problem, `n = 2`, `x₁ = 0.495a`, and `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   The probability integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**4. Analyze the Interval and the Integrand**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Small Interval.** The width of the interval is `Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small fraction of the box length `a`. This suggests that an approximation might be valid.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Location of the Interval.** The interval is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Node Location.** For the `n=2` state, let's check the value of the wave function and the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`.\n    `ψ₂(0.5a) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(π) = 0`\n    This means that `x = 0.5a` is a **node** of the wave function for the `n=2` state. Consequently, the probability density at this point is zero: `|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = 0`.\n*   **Conclusion from Analysis:** Because the probability density is zero at the center of our small interval, a simple approximation `P ≈ |ψ₂(0.5a)|² * Δx` would yield `P = 0`, which is not accurate. We must use a more precise method, as the probability density is not zero elsewhere in the interval.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation (Approximation Method)**\nSince the interval is very small and centered around a point `x_c = 0.5a`, we can use a Taylor expansion of the probability density function `f(x) = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a)` around this point.\n\n1.  Let `x = x_c + δx = 0.5a + δx`.\n2.  Substitute this into the function:\n    `f(0.5a + δx) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a + δx)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π + 2πδx/a)`\n3.  Using the identity `sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n    `f(0.5a + δx) = (2/a) * [-sin(2πδx/a)]² = (2/a) * sin²(2πδx/a)`\n4.  For small values of `δx`, the argument of the sine function `(2πδx/a)` is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    `f(0.5a + δx) ≈ (2/a) * (2πδx/a)² = (2/a) * (4π²(δx)²/a²) = (8π²/a³)(δx)²`\n5.  Now we integrate this approximated function. The integration limits for `δx` are from `x₁ - x_c = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a` to `x₂ - x_c = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π²/a³) * (δx)² d(δx)`\n6.  Perform the integration:\n    `P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (δx)³/3 ]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`.\n    `P ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]`\n    `P ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³ ]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Numerical Answer**\n1.  Simplify the expression:\n    `P ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005³ * a³)`\n2.  The `a³` terms cancel out:\n    `P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n3.  Substitute the values (`π ≈ 3.14159`, `0.005³ = 1.25 x 10⁻⁷`):\n    `P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `P ≈ 52.638 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `P ≈ 65.7975 x 10⁻⁷`\n4.  Express in standard scientific notation:\n    `P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶`\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from `0.495a` to `0.505a` for the `n=2` state is extremely small, which is expected since the interval is centered on a node.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
