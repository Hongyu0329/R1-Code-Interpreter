The best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47, 48, 49, and 50 is Alanine (A). A site-directed mutagenesis experiment should be designed to create a mutant protein where the original sequence S-E-E-D is replaced with A-A-A-A. This change (S47A, E48A, E49A, D50A) will effectively neutralize the patch by removing the negatively charged side chains of Glutamate and Aspartate and by preventing the addition of a strong negative charge via phosphorylation at position 47.
