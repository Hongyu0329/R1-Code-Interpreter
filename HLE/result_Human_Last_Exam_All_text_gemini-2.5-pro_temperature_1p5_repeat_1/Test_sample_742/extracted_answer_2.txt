No. It is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the mathematics of quantum mechanics. There is a fundamental category error, as the two systems operate in incommensurable domains. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory describing measurable quantities, while Gödel's proof is a formal argument in modal logic about metaphysical concepts. There is no coherent way to translate the concepts of one framework into the other.
