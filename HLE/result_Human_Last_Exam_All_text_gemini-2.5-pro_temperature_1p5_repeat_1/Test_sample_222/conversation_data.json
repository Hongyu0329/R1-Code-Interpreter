    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Careful Point: Interpreting \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\"**\n\nThe question asks for a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence. This is not a standard operation. The most common interpretation in digital signal processing involves **aliasing** the 8-point sequence in the time domain to create a 4-point sequence.\n\n*   Let the 8-point sequence be `y(n)`.\n*   Let the aliased 4-point sequence be `z(n)`. It is created by wrapping `y(n)` with a period of 4:\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   Our goal is to find `Z(k)`, the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`.\n\n**3. Strategy: Using DFT Properties to Find the Solution Efficiently**\n\nInstead of calculating the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`, we can leverage DFT properties for a more direct solution.\n\n*   **Property 1: DFT of Interleaved Sequences (Decimation-in-Time)**\n    The 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`, which we'll call `Y(k)`, can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    The general formula is `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_N = e^(-j2π/N)`.\n    This leads to the well-known FFT butterfly equations:\n    *   `Y(k)   = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n*   **Property 2: DFT of an Aliased Sequence (Decimation-in-Frequency)**\n    The DFT of the aliased sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` is related to the DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. The 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is obtained by taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`.\n    *   `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n**4. Combining Properties for the Solution**\n\nOur goal is to find `Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`. Using the decimation-in-frequency property, we have:\n*   `Z(0) = Y(0)`\n*   `Z(1) = Y(2)`\n*   `Z(2) = Y(4)`\n*   `Z(3) = Y(6)`\n\nNow we can use the decimation-in-time property to calculate these four specific values of `Y(k)`.\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's find the required twiddle factors `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^(-j2π*0/8) = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j2π*2/8) = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n\nNow, let's calculate the components of `Z(k)`:\n\n*   **Calculate Z(0) = Y(0):**\n    Using the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`:\n    `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(1) = Y(2):**\n    Using the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`:\n    `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(2) = Y(4):**\n    Using the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`:\n    `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(3) = Y(6):**\n    Using the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`:\n    `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nAssembling the calculated components, the 4-point DFT of the specified sequence is:\n`Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`\n\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
