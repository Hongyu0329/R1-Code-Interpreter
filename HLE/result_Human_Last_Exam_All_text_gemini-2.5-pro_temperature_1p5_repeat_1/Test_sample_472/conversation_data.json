    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line comes from Plautus's play *Asinaria*. The meter is an **Iambic Senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet (`S L`). Plautine verse allows for frequent substitutions, such as a spondee (`L L`), a pyrrhic (`S S`), an anapest (`S S L`), a dactyl (`L S S`), or a proceleusmatic (`S S S S`).\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Elision:** First, we identify any elisions (when a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or 'h-').\n    *   In `bene esse`, the final `-e` of `bene` elides with the initial `e-` of `esse`.\n    *   The line is read as: `et tibi ben'esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantities:** We determine the length of each syllable (Long 'L' or Short 'S') based on its vowel length (natural quantity) or its position (a short vowel followed by two or more consonants is made long).\n\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is short. **S**.\n    *   `tibi`: Both vowels are short by nature (`tĭbĭ`). **S S**.\n    *   `ben(e) esse`: After elision, this is treated as `ben'esse`.\n        *   The first syllable is `ben-`. The vowel `e` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`n` and the `ss` from `esse`). This makes the syllable long by position. **L**.\n        *   The second syllable is `-se`. The vowel `e` is short. **S**.\n        *   So, `ben'esse` scans as **L S**.\n    *   `soli`: This is the dative of `solus`. The vowels are `sōlī`, both long by nature. **L L**.\n    *   `quom`: This is an archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is long. **L**.\n    *   `sibi`: Both vowels are short by nature (`sĭbĭ`). **S S**.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` and the `m` from the next word, `male`). This makes it long by position. **L**.\n    *   `male`: This is the adverb, from `mălus`. The `a` is short by nature (`măle`). The final `e` is also short. **S S**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Sequence of Syllables:**\n    Putting it all together, we get a sequence of 13 syllables with the following quantities:\n    `S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n5.  **Divide into Metrical Feet:** Now, we divide this 13-syllable sequence into the 6 feet of an Iambic Senarius. The presence of 13 syllables indicates that one foot has been \"resolved\" into three syllables.\n\n    *   **Foot 6 (end of the line):** The last two syllables are `male` -> `S S`. This is a **Pyrrhic** (`S S`), a common substitution for an iamb in the final foot.\n    *   **Foot 5:** The three syllables before that are `sibi sit` -> `S S L`. This is an **Anapest** (`S S L`), a valid resolution of an iambic foot.\n    *   **Foot 4:** The two syllables before that are `-li quom` (from `soli quom`). The quantities are `L L`. This is a **Spondee** (`L L`), a valid substitution.\n    *   **Foot 3:** The two syllables before that are `-se so-` (from `ben'esse` and `soli`). The quantities are `S L`. This is a perfect **Iamb** (`S L`).\n    *   **Foot 2:** The two syllables before that are `-bi ben-` (from `tibi` and `ben'esse`). The quantities are `S L`. This is a perfect **Iamb** (`S L`).\n    *   **Foot 1 (start of the line):** The first two syllables are `et ti-`. The quantities are `S S`. This is a **Pyrrhic** (`S S`), a valid substitution.\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nThe feet are as follows:\n*   Foot 1: `et ti-` = **S S** (Pyrrhic)\n*   Foot 2: `-bi ben-` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   Foot 3: `-se so-` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   Foot 4: `-li quom` = **L L** (Spondee)\n*   Foot 5: `sibi sit` = **S S L** (Anapest)\n*   Foot 6: `male` = **S S** (Pyrrhic)\n\nListing all careful points:\n*   Recognizing the meter as Iambic Senarius and its rules.\n*   Correctly applying the elision of `bene esse`.\n*   Correctly determining length by position, especially for `ben'esse` and `sit`.\n*   Knowing the natural quantities of key vowels (e.g., `sōlī`, `quom`, and crucially, the short `a` in `măle`).\n*   Parsing the line into feet by identifying valid substitutions and resolutions (Pyrrhic, Spondee, Anapest).\n\nThe final answer is formatted by representing each foot's scansion, separated by spaces.\n\n<<<S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
