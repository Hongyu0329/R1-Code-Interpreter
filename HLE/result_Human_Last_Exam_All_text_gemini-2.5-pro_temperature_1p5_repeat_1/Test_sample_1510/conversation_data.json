    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**\n\n*   A **wallpaper group** (or plane crystallographic group) describes the symmetry of a two-dimensional repeating pattern. There are a total of 17 such groups.\n*   The **point group** of a wallpaper group consists of the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the pattern fixed. It describes the symmetry of the \"motif\" or the local environment around a point.\n*   The **order of a group** is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Possible Point Groups in 2D**\n\nDue to the crystallographic restriction theorem, only certain rotational symmetries are compatible with a repeating lattice. In two dimensions, the allowed point groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups (rotations only):** $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6$\n*   **Dihedral groups (rotations and reflections):** $D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_6$\n\n**Step 3: Determine which Point Groups have an Order of 2**\n\nWe need to find which of the groups listed in Step 2 contain exactly two symmetry operations (one of which is always the identity operation).\n*   The order of a cyclic group $C_n$ is n.\n*   The order of a dihedral group $D_n$ is 2n.\n\nLet's check their orders:\n*   Order of $C_1$: 1\n*   **Order of $C_2$**: **2** (contains identity and 180° rotation)\n*   Order of $C_3$: 3\n*   Order of $C_4$: 4\n*   Order of $C_6$: 6\n*   **Order of $D_1$**: 2 × 1 = **2** (contains identity and a single reflection)\n*   Order of $D_2$: 4\n*   Order of $D_3$: 6\n*   Order of $D_4$: 8\n*   Order of $D_6$: 12\n\nSo, the point groups with an order of 2 are $C_2$ and $D_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Wallpaper Groups Corresponding to these Point Groups**\n\nNow we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify how many of them have either $C_2$ or $D_1$ as their point group.\n\n1.  **Wallpaper groups with point group $C_2$ (or '2' in Hermann-Mauguin notation):**\n    *   There is only **one** such group: **p2**. This group's symmetries are translations and 180° rotations (2-fold rotations).\n\n2.  **Wallpaper groups with point group $D_1$ (or 'm' in Hermann-Mauguin notation):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This point group involves a single reflection axis. However, in the full wallpaper group, this can manifest as a pure reflection axis or a glide reflection axis. The point group operation abstracts away the translational component of the glide, leaving only the reflection. Therefore, groups with either reflection or glide reflection (but no rotational symmetry other than identity) will have a point group of $D_1$.\n    *   The groups are:\n        *   **pm**: Contains reflection axes.\n        *   **pg**: Contains glide reflection axes.\n        *   **cm**: Contains both reflection and glide reflection axes on a centered lattice.\n    *   There are **three** such groups: **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total**\n\nThe total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is the sum of the counts from Step 4.\n*   Number of groups with point group $C_2$ = 1\n*   Number of groups with point group $D_1$ = 3\n*   Total = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThe four wallpaper groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
