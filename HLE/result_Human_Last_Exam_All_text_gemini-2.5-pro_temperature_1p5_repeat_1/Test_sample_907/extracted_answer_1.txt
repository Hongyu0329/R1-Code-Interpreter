**a) Case of negligible interaction:**
The absorption cross-section is the sum of the cross-sections of N independent molecules. It exhibits a single absorption peak at the frequency of the molecular transition.
$\sigma(\omega) = N \frac{\pi \omega}{n \epsilon_0 c \hbar} |\vec{\mu}_{mol} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 \delta(\omega - \omega_{mol})$
where:
-   $N$: Number of molecules in the chain.
-   $\omega$: Photon frequency.
-   $\omega_{mol}$: Transition frequency of a single molecule.
-   $\vec{\mu}_{mol}$: Transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
-   $\vec{\epsilon}$: Polarization vector of the laser pulse.
-   $n, \epsilon_0, c, \hbar$: Physical constants (refractive index, vacuum permittivity, speed of light, reduced Planck constant).
-   $\delta(\dots)$: Dirac delta function, indicating absorption occurs only when the photon frequency matches the transition frequency.

**b) Case of near-neighbor interaction (Frenkel Exciton Model):**
The interaction delocalizes the excitations into exciton states, splitting the single absorption peak into a band of several peaks corresponding to different exciton states.
$\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\pi \omega}{n \epsilon_0 c \hbar} |\vec{\mu}_{mol} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 \sum_{k=1}^N \left[ \frac{2}{N+1} \left( \sum_{j=1}^N \sin\left(\frac{jk\pi}{N+1}\right) \right)^2 \delta(\omega - \omega_k) \right]$
where:
-   The summation is over the $N$ exciton states, indexed by the quantum number $k$.
-   The term $\left( \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\dots) \right)^2$ is the cooperative factor that determines the strength of the transition to the $k$-th exciton state. It is non-zero only for odd values of $k$, which is a selection rule.
-   $\omega_k = \omega_{mol} + \frac{D}{\hbar} + \frac{2J}{\hbar} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{N+1}\right)$ is the transition frequency for the $k$-th exciton state. $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy and $D$ is an energy shift from the environment.
