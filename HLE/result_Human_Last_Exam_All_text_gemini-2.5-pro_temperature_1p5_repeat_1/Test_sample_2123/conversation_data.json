    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Vienna.\n    *   **Object of Description:** Wide boulevards.\n    *   **Source Text:** A Russian translation of an essay (or, more broadly, a Russian text discussing a foreign subject).\n    *   **Key Detail:** The surname of an English poet is used within the description.\n    *   **Task:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Puzzle:**\n    The central point to understand is how a surname can be used to describe a physical feature like a boulevard. It is highly unlikely to be a direct comparison or metaphor. This points strongly towards a pun or a play on words that works specifically in the Russian language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Linguistic Clue:**\n    The boulevards are described as \"wide.\" Let's consider the relevant Russian words.\n    *   The Russian adjective for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy).\n    *   The comparative form, meaning \"wider,\" is \"шире\" (shire).\n\n4.  **Connect the Clue to English Poets:**\n    The task is to find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds like the word \"шире\" (shire).\n    *   Consider the English poet Percy Bysshe **Shelley**.\n    *   When his surname is written in Cyrillic, it becomes **Шелли** (Shelli).\n    *   Phonetically, the Russian words **шире** ([ˈʂɨrʲe], meaning \"wider\") and **Шелли** ([ˈʂɛlʲɪ], \"Shelley\") are very similar, creating a perfect opportunity for a pun.\n\n5.  **Verify the Source:**\n    This specific literary pun is well-known and comes from the work of the Russian formalist critic and writer Viktor Shklovsky. In his epistolary novel/essay collection \"Zoo, or Letters Not About Love\" (\"Zoo, или Письма не о любви\"), written in 1923, he describes Vienna. He makes the observation that the streets in Vienna are not only \"шире\" (wider) but also \"Шелли\" (Shelley), playing on the famous poet's name.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the pun between the Russian word for \"wider\" (шире) and the Russian transliteration of the surname (Шелли), the English poet mentioned is Percy Bysshe Shelley. The question asks for the surname.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\nThe poet is Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the surname required is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
