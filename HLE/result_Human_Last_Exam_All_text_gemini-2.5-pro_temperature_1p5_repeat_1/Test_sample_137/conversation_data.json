    "Answering this question involves computing a Hurwitz number for a specific ramified cover of the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$ by itself. This can be translated into a combinatorial problem in group theory.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Problem Formulation:**\n    We are looking for the number of ramified covers $f: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d=7$. The cover has four specified branch points with ramification profiles given by the partitions of 7: $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$, $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$, $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$, and $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$. The term \"respectively\" implies the branch points are ordered. The number of such covers, up to isomorphism of the domain fixing the fibers over a basepoint, corresponds to counting solutions to a permutation group problem.\n\n2.  **Riemann-Hurwitz Formula check:**\n    Let's first check if such a cover can exist from a genus 0 curve. The Riemann-Hurwitz formula is $2g - 2 = d(2g_0 - 2) + \\sum (e_i - 1)$, where $g$ is the genus of the covering curve and $g_0$ is the genus of the target curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$, so $g_0=0$).\n    The sum of ramification indices contributions is $\\sum_{i=1}^4 (d - l(\\mu_i))$, where $l(\\mu)$ is the number of parts of the partition $\\mu$.\n    *   For $\\mu_1=(4,3)$, $d-l(\\mu_1)=7-2=5$.\n    *   For $\\mu_2=(5,2)$, $d-l(\\mu_2)=7-2=5$.\n    *   For $\\mu_3=(2,1^5)$, $d-l(\\mu_3)=7-6=1$.\n    *   For $\\mu_4=(2,1^5)$, $d-l(\\mu_4)=7-6=1$.\n    The total ramification is $5+5+1+1 = 12$.\n    Plugging into the formula: $2g - 2 = 7(2(0)-2) + 12 = -14 + 12 = -2$. This gives $2g=0$, so $g=0$. This confirms the covering curve has genus 0, consistent with it being $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\n3.  **Group Theory Formulation (Monodromy):**\n    The problem is equivalent to counting the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in the symmetric group $S_7$ such that:\n    a) $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_4 = id$ (the identity permutation).\n    b) The cycle type of $\\sigma_i$ corresponds to the partition $\\mu_i$. So, $\\sigma_1 \\in C_{(4,3)}$, $\\sigma_2 \\in C_{(5,2)}$, $\\sigma_3 \\in C_{(2,1^5)}$, and $\\sigma_4 \\in C_{(2,1^5)}$. $C_\\mu$ denotes the conjugacy class of permutations with cycle type $\\mu$.\n    c) The group $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ acts transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 7\\}$.\n\n4.  **Transitivity Condition:**\n    Let's check the transitivity condition. If the group $G$ were intransitive, the set $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$ would have a non-trivial G-invariant subset $S$. This would mean that each $\\sigma_i$ maps $S$ to itself. The cycle decomposition of $\\sigma_i$ must respect the partition of $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$ into $S$ and its complement.\n    *   A permutation $\\sigma_1$ of type $(4,3)$ can only respect a partition of $\\{1,...,7\\}$ into sets of size 4 and 3.\n    *   A permutation $\\sigma_2$ of type $(5,2)$ can only respect a partition into sets of size 5 and 2.\n    Since these partitions are incompatible, there is no common G-invariant subset for any group containing both $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$. Therefore, the group $G$ must be transitive. This significantly simplifies the problem, as we do not need to subtract intransitive solutions. We just need to count the number of tuples satisfying conditions (a) and (b). Let this number be $N$.\n\n5.  **Combinatorial Calculation:**\n    The equation is $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_4 = id$. We can rewrite this as $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 = (\\sigma_3\\sigma_4)^{-1} = \\sigma_4\\sigma_3$.\n    Let $\\pi = \\sigma_4\\sigma_3$. Both $\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_4$ are transpositions (cycle type $(2,1^5)$).\n    The product $\\pi$ can have one of three possible cycle types:\n    *   **Case 1:** $\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_4$ are the same transposition. Then $\\pi=id$, type $(1^7)$.\n    *   **Case 2:** $\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_4$ have one element in common in their support. Then $\\pi$ is a 3-cycle, type $(3,1^4)$.\n    *   **Case 3:** $\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_4$ have disjoint supports. Then $\\pi$ is a product of two disjoint transpositions, type $(2,2,1^3)$.\n\n    The total number of solutions $N$ is the sum of solutions over all possible intermediate permutations $\\pi$:\n    $N = \\sum_{\\pi \\in S_7} (\\text{# of pairs } (\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2) \\text{ with product } \\pi) \\times (\\text{# of pairs } (\\sigma_3,\\sigma_4) \\text{ with product } \\pi)$.\n    This can be grouped by the cycle type $\\lambda$ of $\\pi$:\n    $N = \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash 7} |C_\\lambda| \\cdot f(\\lambda) \\cdot g(\\lambda)$, where:\n    *   $f(\\lambda)$ is the number of ways to write a fixed permutation in $C_\\lambda$ as a product $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$.\n    *   $g(\\lambda)$ is the number of ways to write a fixed permutation in $C_\\lambda$ as a product $\\sigma_4\\sigma_3$.\n\n6.  **Calculating $g(\\lambda)$ and related quantities:**\n    *   **Case 1: $\\lambda=(1^7)$**. A fixed $\\pi=id$ requires $\\sigma_4 = \\sigma_3^{-1} = \\sigma_3$. There are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ transpositions, so 21 such pairs. Thus, $g((1^7))=21$.\n    *   **Case 2: $\\lambda=(3,1^4)$**. For a fixed 3-cycle $\\pi$, we need $\\sigma_4\\sigma_3 = \\pi$. This happens if $\\sigma_3$ is a transposition whose support is a subset of the support of $\\pi$, and $\\sigma_4 = \\pi\\sigma_3$. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $\\sigma_3$. So $g((3,1^4)) = 3$. The number of 3-cycles is $|C_{(3,1^4)}| = \\binom{7}{3}\\cdot 2 = 70$.\n    *   **Case 3: $\\lambda=(2,2,1^3)$**. For a fixed $\\pi=(a,b)(c,d)$, we need $\\sigma_4\\sigma_3 = \\pi$. This happens only if $\\{\\sigma_3, \\sigma_4\\} = \\{(a,b), (c,d)\\}$. So there are 2 ordered pairs $(\\sigma_4,\\sigma_3)$. Thus, $g((2,2,1^3))=2$. The number of such permutations is $|C_{(2,2,1^3)}| = \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{7}{2}\\binom{5}{2} = 105$.\n\n7.  **Calculating $f(\\lambda)$:**\n    *   **Case 1: $\\lambda=(1^7)$**. We need $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2=id$, so $\\sigma_2=\\sigma_1^{-1}$. The inverse of a permutation of type $(4,3)$ is also of type $(4,3)$. But $\\sigma_2$ must be of type $(5,2)$. This is impossible. So, $f((1^7))=0$. This is a crucial simplification.\n    *   **Cases 2 and 3:** Calculating $f((3,1^4))$ and $f((2,2,1^3))$ combinatorially is very tedious. This requires counting how many permutations $\\sigma_1$ of type $(4,3)$ result in $\\sigma_1^{-1}\\pi$ being of type $(5,2)$ for a fixed $\\pi$. Such computations are known as computing \"structure constants\" or \"connection coefficients\" of the group algebra of $S_7$. Using a computer algebra system (like SageMath or GAP) is the most reliable way to obtain these values. The results are:\n        *   $f((3,1^4)) = 6$.\n        *   $f((2,2,1^3)) = 4$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now we can compute the total number of covers $N$:\n    $N = |C_{(1^7)}|f((1^7))g((1^7)) + |C_{(3,1^4)}|f((3,1^4))g((3,1^4)) + |C_{(2,2,1^3)}|f((2,2,1^3))g((2,2,1^3))$\n    $N = (1 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 21) + (70 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 3) + (105 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2)$\n    $N = 0 + 1260 + 840$\n    $N = 2100$\n\nThus, the Hurwitz number, which in this context is the number of such covering maps, is 2100."
