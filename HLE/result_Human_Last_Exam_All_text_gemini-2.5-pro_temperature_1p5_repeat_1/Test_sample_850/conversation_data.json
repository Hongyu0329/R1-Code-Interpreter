    "This problem requires a careful analysis of the symmetry requirements for different crystal properties. Let's break down the question and analyze each component step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Key Properties**\n\nThe question asks us to find crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis, meaning it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment.\n3.  **Has the correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry Requirement for Each Property**\n\n*   **Symmetry for Optical Activity:** The necessary and sufficient condition for a crystal to be optically active is that its point group must be **chiral**. A chiral object is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, a chiral point group is one that **lacks any roto-inversion axes** (-n). Roto-inversion axes include the inversion center (i, which is a -1 axis) and mirror planes (m, which is a -2 axis). There are 11 chiral (and therefore optically active) crystal classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n*   **Symmetry for an Achiral Crystal:** An achiral crystal class is, by definition, one that is **not chiral**. This means it **must possess at least one roto-inversion axis** (i.e., an inversion center 'i', a mirror plane 'm', or a -3, -4, or -6 axis). There are 21 achiral crystal classes, which are all the crystal classes except for the 11 chiral ones.\n\n*   **Symmetry for a Non-polar Crystal:** A polar crystal has a unique vector direction. There are 10 polar crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm). A non-polar crystal is any crystal that does not belong to these 10 polar classes. This category includes all 11 centrosymmetric classes (those with an inversion center) as well as 11 other non-centrosymmetric, non-polar classes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Contradiction in the Question**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the conflicting requirements.\n*   The question requires the crystal class to have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity,\" which means the class must be **chiral**.\n*   The question also requires the crystal class to be **achiral**.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. These are mutually exclusive categories. If a class has the symmetry for optical activity, it must be chiral, and therefore it cannot be achiral.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBecause the conditions specified in the question are mutually exclusive, no crystal class can satisfy them all simultaneously. It is a logical impossibility for a crystal to be both \"achiral\" and have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity.\"\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Fundamental Definitions:** The terms must be understood correctly. \"Symmetry for optical activity\" is synonymous with \"chirality\".\n2.  **Mutual Exclusivity:** Chirality (required for optical activity) and achirality are direct opposites. An object cannot be both.\n3.  **Polarity vs. Chirality:** Do not confuse these terms. A class can be chiral and polar (e.g., class 2), chiral and non-polar (e.g., class 222), achiral and polar (e.g., class m), or achiral and non-polar (e.g., class 2/m). The question imposes constraints from both categories.\n4.  **Flawed Premise:** The question is based on a flawed premise, as it asks to find members of an empty set. The rigorous answer is that no such classes exist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the set of crystal classes that satisfies all the given conditions is the empty set.\n\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions. The requirement for a crystal class to be \"achiral\" and the requirement for it to have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" (which means it must be chiral) are mutually exclusive.>>>"
