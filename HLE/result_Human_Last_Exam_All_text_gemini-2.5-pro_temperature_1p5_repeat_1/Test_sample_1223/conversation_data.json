    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the key terms.\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A key property is that it is composed of uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) disjoint dense subsets called composants.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is the most famous example.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. Composants are dense, connected, and partition the continuum.\n*   **The Space:** We start with a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$, choose a point $x \\in X$, and consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For the space $Y$, its Stone-Cech compactification, denoted $\\beta Y$, is the largest possible compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The remainder is the set $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. This is a compact Hausdorff space.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the maximum possible number of composants of the remainder $R$. For this question to be meaningful, we must consider cases where $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the remainder $R$.\n\n1.  **Is R a continuum?**\n    *   A space is a continuum if it is compact and connected. The remainder $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, so it is compact.\n    *   For connectedness, we use a known theorem by H. Cook: for a continuum $K$ and a point $p \\in K$, the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is connected if and only if $p$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $K$ containing it.\n    *   In our case, $X$ is a *hereditary* indecomposable continuum. This means every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable. If a point $x$ were a cut point of a subcontinuum $K \\subset X$ containing it, then $K$ would be the union of two proper subcontinua, making $K$ decomposable. This contradicts the hereditary indecomposability of $X$.\n    *   Therefore, $x$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $X$. By Cook's theorem, the remainder $R$ is connected.\n    *   Conclusion: The remainder $R$ is always a continuum.\n\n2.  **Is R an indecomposable continuum?**\n    *   This is not always true, but it is possible. The structure of the remainder depends heavily on the choice of $X$ and $x$. The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants, so we should look for examples of $X$ and $x$ that produce an indecomposable remainder.\n    *   There are celebrated results in continuum theory that confirm this possibility. For certain choices of $X$ and $x$, the remainder $R$ is indeed an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of composants in known examples.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum can have either one composant or uncountably many. For a metric indecomposable continuum, \"uncountably many\" means exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n*   **Example 1: A Remainder with one composant.**\n    D. P. Bellamy and L. R. Rubin constructed a rigid (and thus hereditary indecomposable) continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum with exactly one composant. This means the minimum possible number of composants (for a non-degenerate indecomposable remainder) is 1.\n\n*   **Example 2: A Remainder with $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.**\n    Let $X$ be the **pseudo-arc**, which is the canonical example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. It is known to be chainable and have \"endpoints\". A major result by D. P. Bellamy shows that if $x$ is an endpoint of the pseudo-arc $X$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc itself.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   A classical theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific choice of $X$ and $x$, the remainder $R$ has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the maximum possible number.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we have established the following:\n*   There exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ for which the Stone-Cech remainder has 1 composant.\n*   There exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ for which the Stone-Cech remainder has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number. Based on the existence of the pseudo-arc example, the maximum number is at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nCould the number be greater than $2^{\\aleph_0}$? While remainders of some general separable metric spaces can have more than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants (assuming set-theoretic axioms like the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis), the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has a very specific structure imposed by the fact that it is a dense subset of the hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$. The known results and constructions within standard ZFC set theory for this particular problem do not yield a number larger than $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The pseudo-arc example, which results in a metric remainder, is considered the benchmark for complex behavior in this context. Thus, $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the maximum achievable number.\n\nThe number $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $c$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
