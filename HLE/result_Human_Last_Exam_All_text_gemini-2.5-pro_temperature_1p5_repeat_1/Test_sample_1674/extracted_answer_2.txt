Yes, the theory can not hold. The addition of the birefringent medium can make the overall optical system non-reciprocal, even though the birefringent medium itself is a reciprocal component. This happens because the polarization transformation of the birefringent plate and the random medium are described by matrices that, in general, do not commute. When the transformation matrices of cascaded components do not commute, the combined system is no longer guaranteed to be reciprocal, and therefore the principle of time-reversal fails.
