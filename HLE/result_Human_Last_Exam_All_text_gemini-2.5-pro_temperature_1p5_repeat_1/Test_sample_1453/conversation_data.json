    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat\nThe fundamental characteristic of a coiled-coil is the heptad repeat, a repeating pattern of seven amino acids denoted as `(a b c d e f g)n`. The stability of the coiled-coil is primarily determined by the hydrophobic core formed by residues at the `a` and `d` positions. These positions are typically occupied by nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids. Our goal is to find the correct phasing of this repeat within the given sequence.\n\n**Sequence:** `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (30 amino acids)\n\nLet's test different possible phasings of the `(a b c d e f g)` repeat by looking for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V) at positions `a` and `d`. Remember, `a` and `d` are separated by two residues (`a-x-x-d`).\n\n*   **Attempt 1:** Let's assume the first residue, G, is at position `a`.\n    *   `a` positions would be G(1), K(8), K(15), K(22), K(29).\n    *   `d` positions would be A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25).\n    *   This is not a stable core because the `a` positions are occupied by charged (K) and non-hydrophobic (G) residues. This phasing is incorrect.\n\n*   **Attempt 2:** Let's assume the first hydrophobic residue, I(3), is at position `a`.\n    *   `a` positions would be I(3), I(10), I(17), I(24). (Consistently Isoleucine - good)\n    *   `d` positions would be S(6), S(13), S(20), S(27). (Consistently Serine - bad). Serine is polar and not suitable for the hydrophobic core. This phasing is incorrect.\n\n*   **Attempt 3:** Let's assume the next hydrophobic residue, A(4), is at position `a`.\n    *   `a` positions would be A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25). (Consistently Alanine - good).\n    *   `d` positions would be L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28). (Consistently Leucine - good).\n    *   This phasing results in a highly consistent and stable hydrophobic core pattern (`a`=Ala, `d`=Leu) for four full heptad repeats. The flanking residues are `GEI` at the N-terminus and `KG` at the C-terminus. This is the correct heptad repeat assignment.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:** The coiled-coil portion of the sequence consists of four heptad repeats with Alanine (A) at all `a` positions and Leucine (L) at all `d` positions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues and Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes)\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is strongly influenced by the size and shape of the amino acid side chains at the `a` and `d` positions, which affects how they can efficiently pack together in the hydrophobic core (the \"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` position: Alanine (A) - has a small methyl group side chain.\n    *   `d` position: Leucine (L) - has a larger, bulkier isobutyl side chain.\n\n*   **Evaluating Oligomeric States:**\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the `a` and `d` residues of one helix pack against the `a` and `d` residues of the other. The core has layers of `a-a` packing and `d-d` packing. A layer of two small Alanine side chains (`a-a`) would leave a significant cavity in the core. This poor packing makes the hydrophobic core unstable because it's not well-shielded from water. Therefore, a **dimer is highly unfavorable**.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a tetramer, the core would have layers of four `a` residues and four `d` residues. A layer of four large Leucine side chains (`d-d-d-d`) pointing into the core would result in severe steric clashes. The core would be too crowded to accommodate them favorably. Therefore, a **tetramer is also unfavorable**.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the core has layers of three `a` residues and three `d` residues. The layer with three small Alanine side chains (`a-a-a`) can pack together neatly, filling the central space without creating a cavity or causing steric strain. The next layer with three large Leucine side chains (`d-d-d`) can also pack efficiently in a \"knobs-into-holes\" fashion. This combination provides both good packing and strong hydrophobic interactions.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\nThe pattern of a small hydrophobic residue (Alanine) at the `a` position and a large hydrophobic residue (Leucine) at the `d` position is a classic motif that strongly favors the formation of a **trimeric** (3-stranded) coiled-coil. It optimizes packing efficiency by avoiding both the cavities of a dimer and the steric crowding of a tetramer.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
