    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a precise set of events:\n    *   **The Film:** Must be nominated for at least one Academy Award.\n    *   **The Character:** A character's fate is sealed.\n    *   **The Action:** The character says \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The Setting:** This occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n\n2.  **Initial Scene Identification:** This combination of elements points to a very specific and memorable scene. The key is the phrase \"Thank you\" acting as a revelatory or fatal trigger in the context of a bus. This strongly suggests the 2005 film *Munich*.\n\n3.  **Verify Against Criteria:**\n    *   **Film:** The film is **Munich**, directed by Steven Spielberg.\n    *   **Oscar-Nominated?:** Yes. *Munich* was nominated for five Academy Awards in 2006, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. This fits the primary criterion.\n    *   **Analyze the Scene:** In the film, a team of Israeli assassins is in London to meet a contact. They are staked out near a bus stop. One of the assassins, Carl (played by Ciarán Hinds), is watching vigilantly.\n    *   **The Action and Dialogue:** A man approaches and boards a double-decker bus. As he does so, he says \"Toda\" to the driver. \"Toda\" (תודה) is the Hebrew word for \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **\"Seals his Fate\":** Hearing the man speak Hebrew, Carl instantly realizes this is not their Palestinian contact but another Mossad agent. This is a pivotal moment. Carl understands that their own agency is now monitoring them, that they are compromised, and that they are no longer trusted or safe. This revelation introduces a powerful sense of paranoia and directly precedes a sequence of events where the team members, including Carl himself, are hunted down and killed. Therefore, while Carl didn't say the words himself, this moment on the bus is what \"seals his fate.\"\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Nuances:**\n    *   The most critical point of nuance is that the question is slightly imprecise. It says the character who \"seals his fate\" is the one *saying* \"Thank you.\" In *Munich*, the character whose fate is sealed (Carl) is the one who *overhears* the phrase. The speaker is an unnamed character whose utterance is the catalyst.\n    *   Despite this slight ambiguity, no other Oscar-nominated film contains a scene that so closely matches all the other elements: a bus boarding, the phrase \"Thank you,\" and a character's fate being sealed as a direct result. The scene is iconic for this specific reason. Other potential candidates (like *The French Connection* or *The Departed*) do not feature a scene with this combination of events.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis consistently and strongly points to one film. The scene where a man says \"Thank you\" in Hebrew while boarding a bus, thereby revealing to the watching Mossad agent Carl that their team is compromised, is a unique and defining moment in the Oscar-nominated film *Munich*. This act seals Carl's fate.\n\n<<<Munich>>>"
