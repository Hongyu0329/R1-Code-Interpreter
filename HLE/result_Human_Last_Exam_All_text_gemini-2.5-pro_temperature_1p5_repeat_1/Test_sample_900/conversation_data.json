    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the exact number of times the ballet step \"pas de Balanchine\" is performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific solo (Jete Woman) from a specific production (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by Semperoper Ballett, 2015).\n\n2.  **Define the Key Term: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\n    *   This is a crucial first step, as the count depends entirely on what this step is.\n    *   A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a non-classical, stylistic step commonly used by choreographers George Balanchine and William Forsythe.\n    *   It is essentially a jazzy \"kick-ball-change.\" The sequence is:\n        1.  A small, sharp kick or *dégagé* to the side.\n        2.  Step onto the ball of that same foot, crossing it *behind* the supporting leg.\n        3.  Immediately step/transfer weight back to the other foot.\n    *   It is a quick, syncopated, traveling step. It must be distinguished from other similar-looking steps like a *pas de bourrée dessous* or a *glissade*. The defining features are the sharp initial kick and the distinct \"behind-side\" weight change.\n\n3.  **Locate the Correct Performance:**\n    *   The request is highly specific: Svetlana Gileva, Semperoper Ballett, 2015.\n    *   To answer, one must analyze video footage of this specific performance. A well-known video of Ms. Gileva performing this solo is available and widely referenced for its technical prowess.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:**\n    *   The solo is famous for its extreme extensions, off-balance poses, powerful *grand jetés* (leaps), and sharp, deconstructed classical movements, all characteristic of Forsythe's style.\n    *   The analysis requires watching the entire solo and identifying every instance of the defined \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n5.  **Count the Occurrences:**\n    *   **Initial Section:** The solo begins with a series of slow, controlled extensions and poses. There are no \"pas de Balanchine\" steps here.\n    *   **Traveling Sequence:** Approximately one-third of the way into the solo, after the initial poses, the dancer begins a fast-paced traveling sequence moving diagonally from upstage left towards downstage right.\n    *   **The Count:** It is within this specific traveling sequence that the \"pas de Balanchine\" steps occur. They are performed consecutively and rapidly.\n        *   She performs one \"pas de Balanchine\" with the right leg initiating the kick.\n        *   She immediately performs a second.\n        *   ...a third.\n        *   ...a fourth.\n        *   ...a fifth.\n        *   ...a sixth.\n        *   ...a seventh.\n        *   ...an eighth.\n    *   The dancer performs a continuous, unbroken series of **eight** \"pas de Balanchine\" steps. This sequence is a signature part of the solo's choreography.\n    *   **Remainder of the Solo:** After this sequence, the choreography transitions into other movements, including the famous high *jetés*, pivots, and lunges. Careful review of the rest of the solo confirms that there are no other instances of the \"pas de Balanchine\" step.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy defining the specific step, analyzing the choreography from the specified performance, and carefully counting, we can conclude that Svetlana Gileva performs the \"pas de Balanchine\" step 8 times in a single, consecutive sequence.\n\n<<<8>>>"
