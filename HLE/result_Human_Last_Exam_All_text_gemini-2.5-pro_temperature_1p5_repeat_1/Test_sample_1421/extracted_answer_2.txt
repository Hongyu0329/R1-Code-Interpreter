The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int_{\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}[\psi^*, \psi] \, e^{-S[\psi^*, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields that obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time interval $\tau \in [0, \beta]$. The Euclidean action is given by $S[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left( \psi^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right)$.
