    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe user wants to identify the specific range of verses, or *bayt*s, within the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'* where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the Prophets in Islam.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the structure and content of *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'*.**\n*'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'* is a foundational didactic poem (*mandhumah*) that outlines the essential articles of faith in Sunni Islam. A key part of this creed is the belief in all the prophets. The poem systematically lists the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an, as belief in them is obligatory.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the section on the Prophets.**\nThe poem follows a logical order. It discusses the attributes of Allah, then moves on to the attributes of the Prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, etc.). Immediately following the discussion of their attributes, the poem introduces the list of their names.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the introductory verse.**\n*Bayt* (verse) number 32 serves as an introduction to the list. It states:\nتَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\nكُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\nTranslation: \"The detailed knowledge of twenty-five [prophets] is binding upon every responsible person, so ascertain this and seize the benefit.\"\n*Careful Point:* This verse *introduces* the list but does not yet *mention* the names. The question asks from which *bayt* the names are mentioned. Therefore, this is the verse just before the list begins.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the starting verse of the list.**\nThe very next verse, *bayt* 33, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names:\nهُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\nصَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\nTranslation: \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\n*Careful Point:* This is the first verse that explicitly contains the names of the prophets.\n\n**Step 6: Trace the list to its conclusion.**\nThe list continues over the next few verses:\n*   **Bayt 34:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 35:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n**Step 7: Identify the final verse of the list.**\nThe enumeration of the 25 prophets concludes in *bayt* 36:\nإِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\nعِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\nTranslation: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Prophet Muhammad], the Seal; leave misguidance.\"\n*Careful Point:* This verse contains the final names in the list, concluding with Prophet Muhammad, who is referred to by one of his names, 'Taha'.\n\n**Step 8: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\nBased on the analysis, the actual listing of the prophets' names starts in *bayt* 33 and ends in *bayt* 36.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe list of the names of the Prophets mentioned in Islam begins at *bayt* 33 and concludes at *bayt* 36 of the poem.\n\n<<<From bayt 33 to bayt 36.>>>"
