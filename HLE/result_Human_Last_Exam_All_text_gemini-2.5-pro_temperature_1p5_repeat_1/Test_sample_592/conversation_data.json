    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core information requested.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the details provided in the question.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (released in 1997). This is correct.\n*   **Character:** Tommaso. This is a key character in the film, the best friend of the protagonist, Piero.\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci. He did indeed play the role of Tommaso. This confirms we are looking at the correct character.\n*   **Action:** The character moves to the United States. This is a central part of his storyline.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the character's plotline within the movie.**\nIn *Ovosodo*, the character Tommaso represents the desire to escape the provincial life of their hometown, Livorno. While the protagonist Piero ends up staying, Tommaso decides to leave Italy after finishing school to pursue a more adventurous life. His chosen destination is the United States.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific city mentioned in the film's narrative.**\nThe film's plot explicitly states Tommaso's destination. Through dialogue and postcards he sends back to Piero, it is revealed that he has moved to New York City. This move to a large, iconic American city is used to contrast his path with Piero's life, which remains rooted in Livorno.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Protagonist vs. Secondary Character:** It's important not to confuse Tommaso with the main character, Piero. The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Narrative vs. Filming Location:** The question is about where the character moves *in the story*, not where the movie was filmed. While most of the film is set and shot in Livorno, Tommaso's story arc takes him fictionally to the US.\n*   **Source Verification:** This information is confirmed in multiple detailed plot summaries and reviews of the film, particularly from Italian sources which are very familiar with this well-known movie.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of the film *Ovosodo*, Tommaso moves to New York City after leaving Italy.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
