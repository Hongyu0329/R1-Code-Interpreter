    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to analyze the symmetries of the tensor. The presence of a compatible complex structure imposes additional symmetries beyond those on a general Riemannian manifold.\n\nLet the Kähler manifold have complex dimension $m$. Its real dimension is $n = 2m$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **General Riemann Tensor Symmetries:**\n    On a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{ijk\\ell}$ has the following symmetries:\n    *   $R_{ijk\\ell} = -R_{jik\\ell}$ (skew-symmetry in the first two indices)\n    *   $R_{ijk\\ell} = -R_{ij\\ell k}$ (skew-symmetry in the last two indices)\n    *   $R_{ijk\\ell} = R_{k\\ell ij}$ (block/pair symmetry)\n    *   $R_{ijk\\ell} + R_{ik\\ell j} + R_{i\\ell jk} = 0$ (First Bianchi identity)\n\n    These symmetries reduce the number of independent components from $n^4$ to $\\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{12}$. For our manifold with $n=2m$, this would be $\\frac{(2m)^2((2m)^2-1)}{12} = \\frac{m^2(4m^2-1)}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Kähler Manifold Symmetries:**\n    A Kähler manifold has an almost complex structure $J$ that is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection ($\\nabla J = 0$). This imposes further strong constraints on the Riemann tensor. It is most convenient to work in local complex coordinates $(z^1, \\dots, z^m)$ and their conjugates $(\\bar{z}^1, \\dots, \\bar{z}^m)$.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Vanishing Components.** The compatibility with the complex structure implies that the only non-vanishing components of the Riemann tensor are those with two holomorphic indices and two anti-holomorphic indices, such as $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, where Greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)$ run from $1$ to $m$. All other components, like $R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ or $R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, are zero.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: New Algebraic Symmetries.** The standard symmetries, when applied to the non-vanishing components $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, yield new, simpler relations:\n        1.  **Block Symmetry:** $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}$.\n        2.  **Bianchi Identity Implication:** The first Bianchi identity implies $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}}$. This means the tensor is symmetric in its holomorphic indices (the first and third index positions).\n        3.  **Combined Symmetry:** Combining the previous two symmetries, we also find $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}}$. This means the tensor is also symmetric in its anti-holomorphic indices (the second and fourth index positions).\n        4.  **Hermitian Property:** The reality of the Riemann tensor implies a Hermitian-like symmetry on its complex components: $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = \\overline{R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}}$.\n\n3.  **Counting the Independent Components:**\n    We need to count the number of independent *real* numbers required to define the tensor, respecting all these symmetries. Let's count the number of independent complex components of $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$ first and then use the Hermitian property to find the real count.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the tensor $K_{\\alpha\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\bar{\\delta}} \\equiv R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$.\n    *   The symmetry in the holomorphic indices $(\\alpha, \\gamma)$ means we are choosing a pair of indices from $\\{1, ..., m\\}$ with replacement, where order doesn't matter. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+1}{2} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n    *   Similarly, the symmetry in the anti-holomorphic indices $(\\bar{\\beta}, \\bar{\\delta})$ means we are choosing a pair from $\\{1, ..., m\\}$ with replacement. The number of choices is also $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n    *   So, we can think of our tensor as a matrix $H_{I\\bar{J}}$, where the index $I$ represents a symmetric pair $(\\alpha, \\gamma)$ and the index $\\bar{J}$ represents a symmetric pair $(\\bar{\\beta}, \\bar{\\delta})$. The size of the index sets for $I$ and $J$ is $N = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Applying the Hermitian Property.** The Hermitian property $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = \\overline{R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}}$ translates to $H_{I\\bar{J}} = \\overline{H_{J\\bar{I}}}$ in our new notation. This is precisely the definition of an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix.\n\n    *   The final step is to count the number of independent real numbers needed to specify an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix.\n        *   The $N$ diagonal entries ($H_{I\\bar{I}}$) must be real.\n        *   The $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ entries above the diagonal can be arbitrary complex numbers, which account for $2 \\times \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} = N(N-1)$ real numbers.\n        *   The entries below the diagonal are determined by the complex conjugate of the upper entries.\n        *   Total independent real components = $N$ (diagonals) + $N(N-1)$ (off-diagonals) = $N^2$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Calculation:**\n    Substituting $N = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ into the formula $N^2$, we get the total number of independent entries.\n    Number of independent entries = $N^2 = \\left( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\right)^2$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $m$ is given by the square of the number of components of a symmetric $m \\times m$ matrix.\n\n<<<$\\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$>>>"
