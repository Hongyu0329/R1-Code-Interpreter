    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks to identify a specific scene in a film based on a set of distinct visual and narrative elements:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car (or large vehicle).\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorming and Initial Candidate Analysis**\nThe combination of \"teenager\" and \"pink\" might initially bring to mind 80s teen films.\n\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** This film, produced by Paramount Pictures (a major studio), features a teenager and is heavily themed around the color pink. However, the iconic pink vehicle is Andie's Volkswagen Karmann Ghia car, not a bike. There is no scene matching the described bike action.\n*   ***The Goonies* (1985):** Produced by Warner Bros. (a major studio), this film features a memorable scene where the teenager Brand is forced to ride a little girl's small pink bike (with training wheels). However, he does not pedal it *toward* an oncoming car; he is caught by his rival, Troy, and dragged *alongside* Troy's car. This is a close match on some elements but fails on the specific action.\n*   ***Footloose* (1984):** Produced by Paramount Pictures, this film features teenagers in a high-stakes confrontation with oncoming vehicles. One character, Ariel, stands between two oncoming trucks, and the protagonist, Ren, plays a game of \"chicken\" with a tractor. However, no pink bike is involved in these scenes.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Action**\nThe core of the question is the act of pedaling a pink bike *directly toward* an oncoming vehicle. This suggests an act of desperation or extreme recklessness. We need to find a film that combines this specific action with the other elements.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Film and Scene**\nThe film that precisely matches all the criteria is **A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985)**.\n\n*   **1. Hollywood Feature Film:** Yes, it is a well-known Hollywood horror film.\n*   **2. Major Film Studio:** It was produced by New Line Cinema. At the time, following the massive success of the first film in the franchise, New Line was a highly significant and influential studio (often called a \"mini-major\") and is now a subsidiary of the major studio Warner Bros.\n*   **3. Teenager:** The scene involves the character Grady (played by Robert Rusler), who is a high school teenager and the main character's best friend.\n*   **4. Pink Bike:** In the scene, Grady tries to stop his friend Jesse from leaving town on a bus. In his haste, he grabs the nearest available transportationâ€”a little girl's small pink Huffy bicycle, complete with a white basket and streamers.\n*   **5. Pedals Toward Oncoming Car/Vehicle:** To get the bus driver's attention and force the bus to stop, Grady pedals the ridiculous pink bike furiously and swerves directly into the path of the oncoming bus. The bus screeches to a halt just inches from hitting him.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis scene from *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* is a perfect match for every detail provided in the question. While other films from the era contain some of the individual elements (a pink vehicle, a teen on a bike, a confrontation with an oncoming vehicle), only this film combines them all into the specific sequence described.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
