    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Properties of a Solution Function**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$. Let $f \\in S$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since $e^x$ is an injective function, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be injective.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous injective function defined on an interval (here, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n    *   If $f$ were strictly decreasing, then $f(f(x))$ would be a composition of two strictly decreasing functions, which is strictly increasing. The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this is consistent so far.\n    *   However, any strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point (i.e., there exists a unique $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$). This is because the function $g(x) = f(x)-x$ is continuous and strictly decreasing, with $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = -\\infty$, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a unique $x_0$ where $g(x_0)=0$.\n    *   If $f$ had a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $e^{x_0} = x_0$. However, the equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n    *   Therefore, $f$ cannot have any fixed points and thus cannot be strictly decreasing.\n    *   This leaves only one possibility: **$f$ must be strictly increasing.**\n\n*   **Behavior relative to $x$**: Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, the function $f(x)-x$ is continuous and never zero. This means either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $e^x < x$, which is false for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have **$f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$**.\n\n*   **Range of $f$**: Since $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range must be an open interval $(L, M)$ for some $L, M \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty, +\\infty\\}$. The equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ has range $(0, \\infty)$. The range of $f(f(x))$ is $f(\\text{range of } f) = f((L, M))$. Since $f$ is increasing, $f((L,M)) = (\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y))$.\n    *   So we must have $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $M=\\infty$.\n    *   We also have $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(L, \\infty)$.\n    *   Let's determine $L$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to L$. So $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = 0$. This is consistent with $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x=0$.\n    *   Could $L=-\\infty$? If $L=-\\infty$, then $f$ would be an increasing homeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$. Let $y=f(x)$, then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. But we need this limit to be 0. This is a contradiction ($-\\infty = 0$).\n    *   So, $L$ must be a finite real number. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we have $f(L) = \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n    *   From $f(x)>x$, we have $f(L) > L$, which implies $0 > L$. So **$L$ is a finite negative number.**\n\n*   **Commutation Property**: For any solution $f$, we can show that it must commute with the exponential function.\n    $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x)))$. Also, replacing $x$ with $f(x)$ in the original equation gives $e^{f(x)} = f(f(f(x)))$.\n    Therefore, **$f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$**.\n\n**2. Construction of Solutions**\n\nThe properties derived above allow us to construct the solutions. The construction depends on a choice of two parameters.\n\n*   The function $f$ is determined by its value of $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) < 0$.\n*   Let's analyze the behavior of $f$ on $(0, \\infty)$. The commutation property $f(e^x)=e^{f(x)}$ implies that the behavior of $f$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is entirely determined by its behavior on any interval of the form $[a, e^a)$. A convenient choice is the interval $[1, e]$.\n*   For any $x \\in (0, \\infty)$, there is a unique $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and a unique $y \\in [1, e)$ such that $x = \\exp^n(y)$ (the $n$-th iteration of exp on $y$). Then $f(x) = \\exp^n(f(y))$.\n*   So we only need to define $f$ on $[1,e]$. Let $y_0 = f(1)$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $y_0 > 1$. Applying $f$ again, $f(y_0)=f(f(1)) = e^1 = e$.\n*   We need to determine $y_0$. Using the commutation property as $x \\to 0^+$ from the right:\n    $f(x) = f(\\ln(e^x)) = \\ln(f(e^x))$ assuming $f(e^x)>1$ for $x$ close to 0.\n    Taking the limit, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = \\ln(\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(e^x)) = \\ln(f(1)) = \\ln(y_0)$.\n    We also know $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = L$, and the function is built from parts like $f(x)=f_0(x)$ for $x>L$ and $f(x) = f_0^{-1}(e^x)$ for $x<L$. One can show that $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0)$. And from $f(L)=0$, we get $f(f(L))=f(0)$, so $e^L=f(0)$.\n    Thus, $e^L = \\ln(y_0)$, which implies **$y_0 = e^{e^L}$**.\n*   Since $L<0$, we have $0 < e^L < 1$. This implies $1 < e^{e^L} < e$. So $y_0 \\in (1, e)$. This is consistent.\n*   The function $f$ must map $[1, y_0]$ increasingly onto $[y_0, e]$. We can choose this mapping function, let's call it $k$, in many ways. Specifically, we can choose **any strictly increasing continuous function $k: [1, y_0] \\to [y_0, e]$**.\n*   Once $k$ is chosen, $f$ is defined on $[1, y_0]$ as $f(x)=k(x)$. Then on $[y_0, e]$, we must have $f(x)=f(f(k^{-1}(x))) = e^{k^{-1}(x)}$.\n*   This defines $f$ on $[1,e]$. The commutation relation extends the definition to all of $(0,\\infty)$, and the relation $f(f(x))=e^x$ extends it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**3. Cardinality of the Set of Solutions**\n\nThe construction of a solution $f$ depends on two choices:\n1.  The value of $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. The set of possible values for $L$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  For each choice of $L$, we have an associated $y_0 = e^{e^L} \\in (1, e)$. We must then choose a strictly increasing homeomorphism $k$ from $[1, y_0]$ to $[y_0, e]$. The set of such functions $k$ also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. For instance, we can specify an arbitrary value $k(\\frac{1+y_0}{2}) = z \\in (y_0, e)$ and connect the points with line segments. There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $z$, each leading to a different function $k$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of the choices available at each step.\n$|S| = |(-\\infty, 0)| \\times |\\{\\text{choices for } k\\}| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers, and also the cardinality of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$."
