    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Primary Mountain and Its Height\nThe question specifies Mount Olympus as the point of comparison.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, central to the epic. It is a real mountain in northern Greece.\n*   **Elevation:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet).\n\n### Step 2: List Other Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad\nWe need to scan the epic for other named mountains and confirm they are real, historical locations.\n1.  **Mount Ida:** Located in the Troad (modern-day Turkey), near Troy. Zeus often observes the battle from its peak, Gargarus. It is mentioned frequently throughout the epic.\n2.  **Samothrace:** Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the Trojan War (Iliad, Book 13). This peak is a real mountain, known today as **Mount Fengari** or Saos.\n3.  **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece. The famously heavy spear of Achilles was crafted from an ash tree grown on its peak.\n4.  **Mount Parnassus:** A mountain in central Greece, overlooking Delphi. It is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the home of the Phocians and by Achilles (Book 9) when he references the wealth of \"rocky Pytho\" (Delphi).\n5.  **Mount Tmolus:** A mountain in Lydia (modern-day Turkey), mentioned in Book 2 in the context of the Maeonian contingent.\n6.  **Caucasus Mountains:** Mentioned once in a rhetorical boast by Achilles (Book 20), who says that even if Hector fled to the \"misty peaks of Caucasus,\" he would still be found.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Elevations of the Identified Mountains\nWe look up the modern, accepted elevations for these historical mountains.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m (9,573 ft)\n*   **Caucasus Mountains (Mount Elbrus):** 5,642 m (18,510 ft)\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** 2,457 m (8,061 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar):** 2,159 m (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 m (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Fengari (Samothrace):** 1,611 m (5,285 ft)\n\n### Step 4: Analyze and Compare the Heights\nThe list of mountains mentioned in the Iliad, ordered by height, is:\n1.  Caucasus Mountains (5,642 m)\n2.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n3.  Mount Parnassus (2,457 m)\n4.  Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)\n5.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n6.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n7.  Mount Fengari (1,611 m)\n\n### Step 5: Address the Ambiguity in the Question\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain \"After Mount Olympus.\" This phrasing creates an ambiguity because the Caucasus Mountains, which are mentioned, are significantly taller than Mount Olympus.\n*   **Interpretation A (Literal):** If we take all mentioned mountains, the tallest is Caucasus. The second tallest is Olympus. The one \"after\" Olympus in height would be Mount Parnassus.\n*   **Interpretation B (Contextual):** The question's structure (\"After Mount Olympus...\") strongly implies that Olympus should be considered the highest mountain relevant to the narrative. The mention of the Caucasus is a single, rhetorical line about a distant land at the edge of the Greek world. The other mountains (Ida, Parnassus, etc.) are geographically and narratively central to the story. This interpretation assumes the question excludes the rhetorical mention of Caucasus and focuses on the mountains integral to the Achaean and Trojan world.\n\nGiven that questions of this nature usually focus on the core setting and narrative elements, Interpretation B is the most likely intended meaning. By this reasoning, we remove Caucasus from the primary list of contenders.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion based on Contextual Interpretation\nExcluding the rhetorical mention of Caucasus, we re-evaluate the list of mountains that are central to the epic's geography.\n1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Parnassus (2,457 m)**\n3.  Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Mount Fengari (1,611 m)\n\nIn this list, the tallest mountain after Mount Olympus is Mount Parnassus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
