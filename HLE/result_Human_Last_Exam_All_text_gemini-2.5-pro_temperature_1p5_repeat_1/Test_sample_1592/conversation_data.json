    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. It is located on the southern shore of the Rupert River, very close to where the river flows into James Bay. Its geographical coordinates are approximately 51.19° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Provinces and Territories Bordering Quebec**\nQuebec shares its borders with several other Canadian provinces and territories:\n*   **To the west:** Ontario\n*   **To the east:** Newfoundland and Labrador\n*   **To the south-east:** New Brunswick\n*   **To the north:** Nunavut. It's important to note that Nunavut's territory includes all the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Geographical Position of Waskaganish Relative to its Neighbors**\nWaskaganish is situated in the western part of Quebec. This makes it geographically distant from Quebec's eastern neighbors.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These provinces are on the far eastern and southeastern sides of Quebec, respectively. Waskaganish is thousands of kilometers away from these borders. Therefore, they are not the closest.\n*   **The main candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.** We need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point in Ontario and the nearest point in Nunavut.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances to Ontario and Nunavut**\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The Quebec-Ontario border lies directly to the west of Waskaganish. For a large section, this border is a straight line defined by the longitude 79°31′ W. Waskaganish is at approximately 78°46′ W longitude. The distance from Waskaganish heading due west to the Ontario border is a relatively short overland journey, calculated to be approximately 55 kilometers (about 34 miles).\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut is composed of the islands within James Bay. Waskaganish is on the mainland of Quebec. The closest parts of Nunavut are these islands. The closest significant islands, like Charlton Island or the Twin Islands, are well over 100 kilometers away from Waskaganish across the water of James Bay. Even the smallest islands belonging to Nunavut are located several kilometers offshore from the Quebec coastline.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nComparing the two shortest distances:\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~55 km (over land)\n*   Distance to nearest Nunavut island: >100 km (over water)\n\nThe land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to the territory of Nunavut.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
