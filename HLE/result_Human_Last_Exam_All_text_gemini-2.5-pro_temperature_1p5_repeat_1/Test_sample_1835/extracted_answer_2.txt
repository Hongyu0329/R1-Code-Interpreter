Yes. According to the Generality Constraint, understanding 'Fa' means you possess the concept of the predicate 'F' as a general, recombinable capacity, not one tied specifically to the object 'a'. The separate premise that you understand universal quantification (∀) means you possess the conceptual structure for making a universal claim about a predicate. Since you possess both the general predicate concept (F) and the logical structure for universalizing it (∀x(...x...)), the principle of systematicity inherent in the Generality Constraint implies you have the conceptual resources to combine them to understand '∀x(Fx)'.
