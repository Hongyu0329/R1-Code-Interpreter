    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the group G and its generators**\n\nThe group $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$ acting on the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$. It is generated by three permutations:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the generators**\n\nFirst, let's determine the order and the sign (parity) of each generator.\n- The permutation $a$ is a single cycle of length 11. Its order is 11. A cycle of length $k$ can be written as a product of $k-1$ transpositions. So $a$ is a product of $11-1=10$ transpositions, which means $a$ is an even permutation.\n- The permutation $b$ consists of two disjoint 4-cycles. Its order is lcm(4, 4) = 4. A 4-cycle is odd (3 transpositions). The product of two odd permutations is even. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n- The permutation $c$ consists of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). Its order is 2. Since it is a product of 6 transpositions, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, the group $G$ they generate must be a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$. So, $G \\le A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the group G**\n\nTo find the Schur multiplier of $G$, we need to identify the group $G$. The generators and the set they act on suggest that $G$ is likely a well-known group. The action is on 12 elements. Let's analyze the structure of $G$.\n\nThe group $G$ is transitive on the set $S$. For example, one can trace the orbit of the element 1: $a(1)=3, c(1)=2, b(1)=8$. Then $a(3)=2, a(2)=5, \\dots$. It can be shown that any element of $S$ can be reached from any other element.\n\nThe permutation $a$ is an 11-cycle, which is a cycle of length $n-1$ for a group acting on $n=12$ elements. This is a very strong structural property. A theorem by W. Feit states that a transitive permutation group of degree $n$ that contains a permutation with a cycle of length $m > n/2$ is either the alternating group $A_n$, the symmetric group $S_n$, or belongs to a small, known list of exceptions.\nFor $n=12$, $m=11$, we have $11 > 12/2 = 6$. The exceptions for $n=12$ are subgroups of $AGL(d,q)$ (12 is not a prime power), $PSL(2,11)$, $M_{11}$, and $M_{12}$.\n\nLet's examine the candidates for $G$:\n- $S_{12}$: Ruled out because $G \\le A_{12}$.\n- $PSL(2,11)$: The orders of elements in $PSL(2,11)$ are divisors of 11, $(11-1)/2=5$, and $(11+1)/2=6$. Thus, $PSL(2,11)$ has no elements of order 4. Our generator $b$ has order 4, so $G \\ne PSL(2,11)$.\n- $M_{11}$ (Mathieu group): $M_{11}$ has two transitive representations of degree 12. Let's check the cycle structures of their elements. The generator $b$ has cycle type $4^2 \\cdot 1^4$ (it fixes $2,3,y,z$). One of the degree 12 representations of $M_{11}$ has elements of order 4, but their cycle type is $4^2 \\cdot 2^2$. The other does not have this element type. So, it's unlikely $G \\cong M_{11}$.\n- $M_{12}$ (Mathieu group): Let's check the cycle types of the generators against the known cycle types of elements in $M_{12}$ in its natural permutation representation on 12 points.\n    - $a$: type $11^1 \\cdot 1^1$. This type exists in $M_{12}$.\n    - $b$: type $4^2 \\cdot 1^4$. This type exists in $M_{12}$.\n    - $c$: type $2^6$. This type exists in $M_{12}$.\n    This suggests that $G$ might be $M_{12}$. However, a check of the product $cb = (1,4,9,2)(3,z)(5,x,y,7)(6,8)$ reveals its cycle type is $4^2 \\cdot 2^2$. This cycle type does not exist for any element of $M_{12}$. This implies that $G$ is not $M_{12}$.\n- $A_{12}$: The fact that $G$ contains elements with cycle types found in $M_{12}$ but also an element ($cb$) not in $M_{12}$ suggests that $G$ might be a larger group containing $M_{12}$. Since $M_{12}$ is a maximal subgroup of $A_{12}$, if $G$ properly contains a subgroup isomorphic to $M_{12}$, and $G \\le A_{12}$, it's very likely that $G=A_{12}$. Proving this from scratch is very tedious. However, this seems to be the most logical conclusion if the problem is well-posed and contains no typos.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nWe have two main candidates for $G$: $M_{12}$ (if the problem has a typo leading to the $cb$ contradiction) or $A_{12}$ (if the generators are as given and my calculations are correct). Let's find the Schur multiplier for both.\n- The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is known to be the cyclic group of order 2, $M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n- The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 8$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $M(A_n) \\cong C_2$. For $n=12$, this holds.\n\nIn both plausible cases, the Schur multiplier, denoted by $A$, is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n$A \\cong C_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is the cyclic group of order 2. Let $A = \\{e, g\\}$ where $g^2 = e$.\nThe subgroups of A are:\n1. The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n2. The entire group $A = \\{e, g\\}$.\n\nA proper subgroup is a subgroup that is not equal to the whole group.\nThe only proper subgroup of $A$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism.\nThe only proper subgroup is $\\{e\\}$. All trivial groups are isomorphic to each other (they are all isomorphic to the group $C_1$). So there is only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups of $A$.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
