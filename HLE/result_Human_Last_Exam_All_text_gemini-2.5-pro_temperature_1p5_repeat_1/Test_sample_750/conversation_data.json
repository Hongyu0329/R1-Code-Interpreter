    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the multi-valued nature of the equation\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term on the right, $i^z$, is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. We must use its general definition: $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The logarithm of a complex number is also multi-valued.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The multi-valued complex logarithm of $i$ is given by:\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$\nwhere $k$ is any integer ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$). Each integer $k$ corresponds to a different branch of the logarithm.\n\nSo, the equation must be solved for any possible branch, which means we write it as:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot i (\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation with a substitution\nTo make the equation more manageable, let's define a constant $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for a given integer $k$. The equation becomes:\n$zi = e^{zi C_k}$\n\nNow, let's introduce a new complex variable $w = zi$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$w = e^{w C_k}$\n\n### Step 3: Solve for $w$ using the Lambert W function\nThe equation $w = e^{w C_k}$ is a form that can be solved using the Lambert W function, also known as the product log function. The Lambert W function is defined as the function that solves for $u$ in the equation $u e^u = x$. The solution is written as $u = W(x)$. Since the exponential function is not injective on the complex plane, the Lambert W function is multi-valued, with branches indexed by an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, denoted $W_n(x)$.\n\nTo get our equation into the standard Lambert form $u e^u = x$, we manipulate it as follows:\n$w = e^{w C_k}$\n$w e^{-w C_k} = 1$\nMultiply by $-C_k$:\n$(-w C_k) e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$\n\nNow, let $u = -w C_k$. The equation becomes:\n$u e^u = -C_k$\nThe solutions for $u$ are given by the branches of the Lambert W function:\n$u = W_n(-C_k)$ for any integer $n$.\n\n### Step 4: Back-substitute to find $z$\nNow we reverse the substitutions to find $z$.\nFrom $u = -w C_k$, we get $w = -\\frac{u}{C_k}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $u$:\n$w = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nFrom $w = zi$, we get $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$.\nSubstituting the expression for $w$:\n$z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nSo, the complete set of solutions for $z$ is given by the formula:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the solution set\nThis formula encapsulates all solutions. Let's analyze it to identify specific types of solutions.\n\n**A. Real Solutions**\nBy inspection, we can test for simple integer solutions.\n- If $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$. And $i^1=i$ (this is true for all branches of the logarithm since $e^{i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = e^{i\\pi/2}e^{i2k\\pi} = i \\cdot 1 = i$). So $z=1$ is a solution.\n- If $z=-1$: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$. And $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$ (this is also true for all branches). So $z=-1$ is a solution.\nThese real solutions correspond to specific choices of $k$ and $n$ in the general formula that make the imaginary part of $z_{k,n}$ zero.\n\n**B. Purely Imaginary Solutions**\nA solution $z$ is purely imaginary if its real part is zero. From the general formula $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$, this occurs if $W_n(-C_k)$ is a real number.\nThe Lambert W function $W_n(x)$ produces a real value only if the argument $x \\ge -1/e$ and the branch is $n=0$ or $n=-1$.\nOur argument is $x = -C_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n- If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$. So $-C_k \\le -\\frac{\\pi}{2} < -1/e$. In this case, $W_n(-C_k)$ is always a non-real complex number. Thus, there are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n- If $k < 0$ (i.e., $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$), then $C_k$ is negative, so $-C_k$ is positive. For a positive argument $x>0$, only the principal branch $W_0(x)$ is real and positive. The other branches $W_n(x)$ for $n \\ne 0$ are complex.\nTherefore, for each integer $k < 0$, we get a single purely imaginary solution by taking the principal branch $n=0$:\n$z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$.\nThis corresponds to an infinite sequence of distinct purely imaginary solutions. Each solution $z_k=iy_k$ has its $y$-component $y_k$ being the unique solution to the transcendental equation $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$.\n\n**C. Other Complex Solutions**\nAll other combinations of integers $k$ and $n$ produce non-real, non-purely-imaginary complex solutions.\n- For $k \\ge 0$, all branches $W_n(-C_k)$ result in complex solutions (this includes the specific branches that yield the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$).\n- For $k < 0$, the branches $n \\ne 0$ give complex values for $W_n(-C_k)$, leading to an infinite number of other complex solutions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ is given by:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers, and $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThis complete solution set can be categorized as follows:\n1.  **Real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:** An infinite sequence of solutions $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$ where $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, for each negative integer $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$. Each such solution $z_k = iy_k$ corresponds to the unique real number $y_k$ that solves $-y_k = e^{-y_k C_k}$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions:** All other pairs of integers $(k, n)$ generate complex solutions that are neither real nor purely imaginary."
