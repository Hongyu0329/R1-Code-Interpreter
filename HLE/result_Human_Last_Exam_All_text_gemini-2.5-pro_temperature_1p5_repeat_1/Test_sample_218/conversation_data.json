    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand Irreps of S_n and their Dimensions**\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n$$ \\dim(V_\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}} $$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of boxes to the right of the box in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus the box itself.\n\nThe dimension of an irrep for a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$.\n\nIrreps with small dimensions correspond to partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"tall and narrow\", i.e., partitions that are far from being \"square-like\". We will systematically list these partitions and calculate their dimensions.\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Calculation of Dimensions**\n\nWe will check partitions class by class, starting from those known to have the smallest dimensions.\n\n**Class 1: Hooks and their Conjugates**\nThese are partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$ for $0 \\le k \\le n-1$. Their dimension is given by $\\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$, we need to find $k$ such that $\\binom{24}{k} < 500,000$.\n*   $k=0$: $\\lambda=(25)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{0} = 1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, also dim 1. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=1$: $\\lambda=(24, 1)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{1} = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, also dim 24. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23, 1^2)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Its conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22, 1^3)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. Its conjugate is $(4, 1^{21})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21, 1^4)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$. Its conjugate is $(5, 1^{20})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20, 1^5)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$. Its conjugate is $(6, 1^{19})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19, 1^6)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. Its conjugate is $(7, 1^{18})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18, 1^7)$, $\\dim = \\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. Its conjugate is $(8, 1^{17})$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=8$: $\\dim = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471 > 500,000$.\nThis gives $8 \\times 2 = 16$ irreps. None are self-conjugate.\n\n**Class 2: Two-Row Partitions and their Conjugates**\nThese are partitions of the form $(n-k, k)$ with $k \\ge 2$ (to avoid the hook $(n-1,1)$). Their conjugates are two-column partitions $(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$. The dimension is $\\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n*   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23, 2)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22, 3)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21, 4)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20, 5)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19, 6)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18, 7)$, $\\dim = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. (2 irreps)\n*   $k=8$: $\\dim = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875 > 500,000$.\nThis gives $6 \\times 2 = 12$ irreps.\n\n**Class 3: Other Partitions**\nWe test other partitions that are \"close\" to hooks, such as those with 3 or 4 parts, one of which is very large. Through careful application of the hook-length formula, we find the following partitions (and their distinct conjugates) also have dimensions less than 500,000.\n\n*   $\\lambda=(22, 2, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2, 1^{20})$. $\\dim = 4025$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(21, 2, 2)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 3, 1^{19})$. $\\dim = 22000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(21, 3, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2, 2, 1^{18})$. $\\dim = 31350$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(20, 4, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2, 2, 2, 1^{16})$. $\\dim = 164220$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(20, 3, 2)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 3, 2, 1^{17})$. $\\dim = 207000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(21, 2, 1, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 2, 1^{19})$. $\\dim = 31625$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(20, 3, 1, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 3, 2, 1^{17})$. $\\dim = 79200$. (2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda=(20, 2, 2, 1)$, conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 3, 1^{18})$. $\\dim = 209000$. (2 irreps)\n\nFurther partitions, such as $(19, 5, 1)$ or $(19, 4, 2)$ or $(19,3,2,1)$, have dimensions exceeding 500,000. Partitions that are more \"balanced\", such as those whose parts are closer in size (e.g., $(5,5,5,5,5)$), have extremely large dimensions. Self-conjugate partitions for $n=25$ (such as $(13,1^{12})$) also have dimensions larger than 500,000.\n\n**Step 3: Final Count**\nWe sum the number of irreps found:\n*   Class 1 (Hooks): 16\n*   Class 2 (Two-Rows): 12\n*   Class 3 (Others): $8 \\times 2 = 16$\n\nTotal number of irreps = $16 + 12 + 16 = 44$."
