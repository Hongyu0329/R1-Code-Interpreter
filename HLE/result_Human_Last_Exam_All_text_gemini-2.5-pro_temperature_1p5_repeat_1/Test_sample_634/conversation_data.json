    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two given polynomial matrices, P1 and P2.\n\n**1. Definition of GCRD**\nLet P1(s) and P2(s) be two polynomial matrices. A polynomial matrix G(s) is a common right divisor of P1 and P2 if there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that:\nP1(s) = Q1(s) * G(s)\nP2(s) = Q2(s) * G(s)\nG(s) is called a *greatest* common right divisor (GCRD) if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s). That is, G(s) = L(s) * D(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s). The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Method for Finding the GCRD**\nThe most systematic method is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves forming a stacked matrix from P1 and P2 and then reducing it to a simpler form using elementary row operations.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Interchanging any two rows.\n2.  Multiplying any row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nWe form the matrix M by stacking P1 and P2 (or P2 and P1, the order does not change the result):\n`M = [P1; P2]`\nWe then apply elementary row operations to M to transform it into the form:\n`M' = [G; 0]`\nwhere G is a square matrix and 0 is a zero matrix. The resulting matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n\n**3. Applying the Method**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s,     0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nLet's form the stacked matrix M. It is often easier to start with the simpler matrix on top.\nM = [P2;\n     P1]\nM = [s,        0   ]  (R1)\n    [-s - 1,   1   ]  (R2)\n    [s^2 + s,  -s  ]  (R3)\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2 ]  (R4)\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Notice that R2 has a `1` at position (2,2). This is very useful as a pivot to eliminate other elements in the same column.\n\nLet's use the `1` in R2 to create zeros in the second column of R3 and R4.\n*   **Operation 1:** `R3 -> R3 + s * R2`\n    `[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s + s(-s-1), -s + s*1]`\n    `= [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n    This is a valid elementary row operation.\n\n*   **Operation 2:** `R4 -> R4 - s^2 * R2`\n    `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2*1]`\n    `= [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n    This is also a valid elementary row operation.\n\nAfter these two operations, the matrix M becomes:\nM' = [s,        0      ]  (R1)\n     [-s - 1,   1      ]  (R2)\n     [0,        0      ]  (New R3)\n     [s^3 - 1,  0      ]  (New R4)\n\nWe now have two zero rows and two non-zero rows. Let's focus on the remaining non-zero rows which carry the information about the GCRD. The GCRD will be formed by reducing the matrix:\n[s,        0      ]\n[-s - 1,   1      ]\n[s^3 - 1,  0      ]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We now need to reduce the rows `[s, 0]` and `[s^3 - 1, 0]`. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the polynomials `s` and `s^3 - 1`.\n\nLet's use the Euclidean algorithm for these two polynomials:\n`s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * s - 1`\nThe remainder is -1, which is a non-zero constant. This means the GCD of `s` and `s^3 - 1` is 1.\nThe Bezout identity is `1 = s^2 * s - (s^3 - 1)`.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** We can use this identity to perform another row operation on M' to simplify it further.\n*   **Operation 3:** `R4 -> s^2 * R1 - R4`\n    `s^2 * [s, 0] - [s^3 - 1, 0] = [s^3 - (s^3 - 1), 0] = [1, 0]`\n    This is not a single elementary operation. We must do it step-by-step:\n    1. `R4 -> R4 - s^2 * R1`: `[s^3-1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [-1, 0]`. Let's call this New R4.\n    2. The matrix is now:\n       `[s,        0   ]` (R1)\n       `[-s - 1,   1   ]` (R2)\n       `[0,        0   ]`\n       `[-1,       0   ]` (New R4)\n    3. `R1 -> R1 + s * (New R4)`: `[s,0] + s*[-1,0] = [0,0]`. The original R1 is now eliminated.\n    4. The matrix becomes:\n       `[0,        0   ]`\n       `[-s - 1,   1   ]` (R2)\n       `[0,        0   ]`\n       `[-1,       0   ]` (New R4)\n\nThe remaining non-zero rows are `[-s-1, 1]` and `[-1, 0]`. These rows form a GCRD. Let's call this matrix G_raw.\nG_raw = [-s - 1, 1;\n         -1,     0]\n\n**4. Simplify the Resulting GCRD**\nThe GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. We can simplify G_raw using more elementary row operations to find a more standard form.\nLet's re-order the rows (an elementary operation):\nG' = [-1, 0;\n      -s-1, 1]\n\nMultiply the first row by -1 (an elementary operation):\nG'' = [1,   0;\n       -s-1, 1]\n\nAdd `(s+1)` times the first row to the second row (an elementary operation): `R2 -> R2 + (s+1)R1`\n`[-s-1, 1] + (s+1)*[1, 0] = [-s-1+s+1, 1+0] = [0, 1]`\nSo the matrix becomes:\nG_final = [1, 0;\n           0, 1]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, `I`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix. This also means that the matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Stack P2 over P1.\n*   Use row `[-s-1, 1]` to eliminate `[s^2+s, -s]` and `[-s^2-1, s^2]`, resulting in rows `[0,0]` and `[s^3-1, 0]`.\n*   The system is reduced to rows `[s,0]`, `[-s-1, 1]`, and `[s^3-1, 0]`.\n*   Use row `[s,0]` to simplify `[s^3-1, 0]` to `[-1, 0]`.\n*   Use row `[-1, 0]` to eliminate `[s, 0]`.\n*   The remaining independent rows are `[-s-1, 1]` and `[-1, 0]`.\n*   These two rows can be reduced to `[1,0]` and `[0,1]` using further elementary row operations.\n*   Therefore, the GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\n>>> [1, 0; 0, 1]"
