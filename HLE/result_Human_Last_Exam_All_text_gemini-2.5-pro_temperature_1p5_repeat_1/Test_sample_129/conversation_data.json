    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### 1. Symbols and Rules\n\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Evaluation:** Expressions must evaluate to True.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` (highest) > `&` > `|` (lowest).\n*   **Associativity:** `&` and `|` are left-associative (e.g., `a|b|c` is `(a|b)|c`).\n\n### 2. General Approach: Parse Tree Structure\n\nAny valid boolean expression has a structure defined by its parse tree. The root of this tree is the last operation to be performed. For any 5-symbol expression, this root operation must be one of:\n1.  **Parentheses:** The expression is of the form `(A)`.\n2.  **Negation:** The expression is of the form `!A`.\n3.  **Or:** The expression is of the form `A|B`.\n4.  **And:** The expression is of the form `A&B`.\n\nThese four categories are mutually exclusive. We can count the number of true expressions in each category and sum them up. To do this, we need to know the number of true and false sub-expressions of shorter lengths.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Sub-Expressions\n\nLet `N(L, V)` be the number of valid expressions of length `L` that evaluate to value `V` (where `V` is True or False).\n\n*   **Length 1:**\n    *   `T`: 1 True expression. `N(1, T) = 1`.\n    *   `F`: 1 False expression. `N(1, F) = 1`.\n\n*   **Length 2:**\n    *   `!F`: 1 True expression. `N(2, T) = 1`.\n    *   `!T`: 1 False expression. `N(2, F) = 1`.\n\n*   **Length 3:**\n    *   `A op B` (`|A|=1, |B|=1`):\n        *   `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (3 True)\n        *   `T&T` (1 True)\n        *   `F|F`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F` (4 False)\n    *   `(A)` (`|A|=1`): `(T)` (1 True), `(F)` (1 False)\n    *   `!!A` (`|A|=1`): `!!T` (1 True), `!!F` (1 False)\n    *   **Totals for L=3:**\n        *   `N(3, T) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`\n        *   `N(3, F) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   **Length 4 (False expressions only):** We need this for the `!A` case of length 5. Let's count `N(4, F)`.\n    *   **Root `()`:** Form `(A)`, where `|A|=2` and `A` is False. Expression: `(!T)`. Count: 1.\n    *   **Root `!`:** Form `!A`, where `|A|=3` and `A` is True. There are `N(3, T) = 6` such `A`. Count: 6.\n    *   **Root `|`:** Form `A|B`, must be False, so both `A` and `B` must be False.\n        *   Split (1,2): `F|!T`. Count: 1.\n        *   Split (2,1): `!T|F`. Count: 1.\n        *   Split (2,2): `!T|!T`. Count: 1.\n        *   Total `|`-root False: 3.\n    *   **Root `&`:** Form `A&B`, must be False. We count (Total pairs) - (True pairs).\n        *   Split (1,2): 4 pairs (`{T,F} & {!T,!F}`). 1 True (`T&!F`). So, 3 False.\n        *   Split (2,1): 4 pairs (`{!T,!F} & {T,F}`). 1 True (`!F&T`). So, 3 False.\n        *   Split (2,2): 4 pairs (`{!T,!F} & {!T,!F}`). 1 True (`!F&!F`). So, 3 False.\n        *   Total `&`-root False: 9.\n    *   **Total `N(4, F)` = 1 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 19**.\n\n### 4. Counting True Expressions of Length 5\n\nNow we can calculate the number of true 5-symbol expressions for each of the four categories.\n\n**Category 1: Root is `()`**\n*   Form: `(A)`, where `|A|=3`.\n*   Expression is True if `A` is a True expression of length 3.\n*   Number of ways = `N(3, T) = 6`.\n*   **Count = 6**\n\n**Category 2: Root is `!`**\n*   Form: `!A`, where `|A|=4`.\n*   Expression is True if `A` is a False expression of length 4.\n*   Number of ways = `N(4, F) = 19`.\n*   **Count = 19**\n\n**Category 3: Root is `|`**\n*   Form: `A|B`, where `|A|+|B|+1=5`. The sub-expressions `A` and `B` cannot have an un-parenthesized `|`.\n*   We count the total combinations and subtract the False ones (`A` is False AND `B` is False).\n*   **Split (1,3):** `c|A'`. `c` is T/F. `A'` is a length-3 expression without `|`.\n    *   Valid `A'` exprs (L=3, no `|`): `(T), (F), !!T, !!F, T&T, T&F, F&T, F&F`. Total: 8 (3 True, 5 False).\n    *   Total combinations: 2 (`c`) * 8 (`A'`) = 16.\n    *   False combinations (`F | A'_False`): 1 * 5 = 5.\n    *   True combinations: 16 - 5 = 11.\n*   **Split (3,1):** `A'|c`. Symmetric to (1,3). True combinations: 11.\n*   **Split (2,2):** `A|B`. `A,B` are `!T` or `!F`.\n    *   Total combinations: 2 * 2 = 4.\n    *   False combinations (`!T|!T`): 1.\n    *   True combinations: 4 - 1 = 3.\n*   **Total Count = 11 + 11 + 3 = 25**\n\n**Category 4: Root is `&`**\n*   Form: `A&B`, where `|A|+|B|+1=5`. Expression is True if `A` is True AND `B` is True. The sub-expressions `A` and `B` cannot have an un-parenthesized `|`.\n*   **Split (1,3):** `T & A'`. `A'` is a True length-3 expression with no un-parenthesized `|`.\n    *   From our list of 8 `A'` expressions above, 3 are True: `(T), !!T, T&T`.\n    *   True combinations: 1 (`T`) * 3 (`A'`) = 3.\n*   **Split (3,1):** `A' & T`. Symmetric to (1,3). True combinations: 3.\n*   **Split (2,2):** `A & B`. `A,B` must be True length-2 expressions: `!F`.\n    *   True combination: `!F&!F`. Count: 1.\n*   **Total Count = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7**\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nWe sum the counts from the four disjoint categories:\nTotal = (from `()` root) + (from `!` root) + (from `|` root) + (from `&` root)\nTotal = 6 + 19 + 25 + 7 = 57.\n\n<<<57>>>"
