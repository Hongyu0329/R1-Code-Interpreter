  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the components of the encryption system.\n\n1.  **The Message Alphabet:** The secret message is written using the characters found in the Shu. The problem states that the Shu uses \"120 most common Chinese characters\". Therefore, the alphabet for our secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n2.  **The Encoding Medium:** The message is encrypted using the symbols in the Ching. The Ching contains 9999 symbols. These symbols are the building blocks of the encrypted message.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of unique encoding symbols.\n\nThe symbols in the Ching are described as \"symbols of yinyang-wuxing\". This implies a combination of two separate concepts:\n*   **Yinyang:** Has two states (yin and yang).\n*   **Wuxing (The Five Elements):** Has five states (e.g., metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n\nThe total number of unique symbol types is the product of the number of states for each concept:\n*   Unique Symbol Types = (Number of yinyang states) × (Number of wuxing states)\n*   Unique Symbol Types = 2 × 5 = 10\n\nSo, we have 10 distinct symbols available to create our code (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire, yin-metal, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of symbols needed to represent one character.\n\nWe need to encode 120 different message characters using a code made from our 10 unique symbols. We need to find the minimum number of symbols (`N`) required in a sequence to represent one message character.\n\n*   If we use a sequence of 1 symbol (`N=1`), we can represent `10^1 = 10` different characters. This is not enough, as 10 < 120.\n*   If we use a sequence of 2 symbols (`N=2`), we can represent `10^2 = 100` different characters. This is still not enough, as 100 < 120.\n*   If we use a sequence of 3 symbols (`N=3`), we can represent `10^3 = 1000` different characters. This is sufficient, as 1000 > 120.\n\nTherefore, we need a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching to encode each single character of the secret message.\n\n### Step 4: Discard irrelevant information.\n\nThe problem contains several pieces of information designed to be distractors. They are not needed to solve the core question.\n*   **Shu containing \"around 3000 characters\"**: The total number of characters in the Shu is irrelevant. The important fact is the *size of the alphabet* it uses, which is 120.\n*   **Computer vision recognition time (12 ms)**: This relates to the process of analyzing the Shu, not decoding the Ching's message.\n*   **Integer and float computation times (10 ns and 30 ns)**: These are computational details that have no bearing on the information capacity or length of the encrypted message.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the maximum length of the message.\n\nWe have a total supply of 9999 symbols in the Ching, and we use 3 of these symbols for every character in the secret message.\n\n*   Max Message Length = (Total number of available symbols) / (Number of symbols per character)\n*   Max Message Length = 9999 / 3\n*   Max Message Length = 3333\n\nThe maximum possible length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
