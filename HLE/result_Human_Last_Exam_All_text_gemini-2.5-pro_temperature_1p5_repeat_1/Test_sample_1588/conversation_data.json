    "The question asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra. The formula is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n    $Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] - [Y,[X,Y]]) + \\dots$\n    The terms in this series can be grouped by their total degree in $X$ and $Y$. The term of order $n$ (or degree $n$) is denoted as $Z_n(X, Y)$, which is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree $n$.\n\n2.  **Relating Coefficients to the Free Lie Algebra**\n    The question is about the number of \"nonzero coefficients\". In this context, this refers to the number of linearly independent terms that make up the component of a specific order. The set of all possible Lie polynomials of degree $n$ in two generators ($X$ and $Y$) forms a vector space. The number of nonzero coefficients in the generic BCH formula at order $n$ is the dimension of this vector space. This space is known as the degree-$n$ component of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\n3.  **Witt's Formula**\n    The dimension of the degree-$n$ component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    $L_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n    where:\n    *   $n$ is the degree (order).\n    *   $k$ is the number of generators.\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n    *   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n4.  **Applying Witt's Formula to the Problem**\n    In our case:\n    *   The order is $n = 10$.\n    *   The number of generators is $k = 2$ (since the expansion is in terms of $X$ and $Y$).\n\n    We need to calculate $L_2(10)$.\n\n5.  **Calculation Steps**\n\n    *   **Identify the divisors of n=10:**\n        The positive divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n        The Möbius function is defined as:\n        *   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free integer with an even number of prime factors.\n        *   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n        *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n        Let's calculate $\\mu(d)$ for our divisors:\n        *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition, 1 has 0 prime factors, which is even).\n        *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is prime, 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n        *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is prime, 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n        *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is square-free with 2 prime factors, which is even).\n\n    *   **Plug the values into Witt's formula:**\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right)$\n\n    *   **Substitute the calculated values:**\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right)$\n\n    *   **Perform the arithmetic:**\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2)$\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n        $L_2(10) = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the free Lie algebra on 2 generators of degree 10, which is calculated using Witt's formula. The calculation yields 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
