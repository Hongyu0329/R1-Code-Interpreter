    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the lowest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be synthesized efficiently. The key terms are \"coldest temperature\" and \"produced efficiently.\" This means we are not looking for the absolute minimum temperature at which a trace amount of product can be formed, but rather a temperature at which the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate and yield for practical purposes.\n\n2.  **Recall or Research the Synthesis of XeF₄:** The most common and direct method for preparing Xenon tetrafluoride is the reaction between xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Conditions:** This reaction, while exothermic, requires significant activation energy. This means that simply mixing the gases at room temperature is not sufficient for an efficient reaction. Energy must be supplied, typically in the form of heat. The conditions need to be carefully controlled to favor the formation of XeF₄ over other xenon fluorides like XeF₂ or XeF₆.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Role of Temperature:**\n    *   **Low Temperatures (e.g., < 200 °C):** At lower temperatures, the rate of reaction between xenon and fluorine is extremely slow. Even if the reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it is kinetically hindered. Therefore, production would be highly inefficient.\n    *   **Optimal Temperature Range:** Standard chemical literature and textbooks state that the synthesis of XeF₄ is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (usually in a 1:5 molar ratio to provide excess fluorine and prevent the formation of XeF₂) in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel. The standard temperature cited for this process is approximately **400 °C** at several atmospheres of pressure. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds to completion within a few hours, which is considered an efficient synthesis.\n    *   **High Temperatures (e.g., > 500-600 °C):** If the temperature is too high, or if a large excess of fluorine is used, the reaction will start to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) according to the reaction: XeF₄(s) + F₂(g) ⇌ XeF₆(g). Thus, very high temperatures are not efficient for the specific production of XeF₄.\n\n5.  **Compare with Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high and would lead to the inefficient production of XeF₄ due to the competing formation of XeF₆.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the widely accepted and cited temperature for the efficient, large-scale synthesis of XeF₄. It provides a good balance between reaction rate and product selectivity.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly lower than at 400 °C, making the process slow and therefore not \"efficient\" by typical laboratory or industrial standards.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at any practical or efficient rate.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard, established methods for synthesis, 400 °C is the conventional temperature used for efficient production of XeF₄. While some reaction may occur at lower temperatures, it would not be efficient. Therefore, 400 °C is the best answer for the \"coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can still be produced efficiently.\"\n\n---\n**Final Answer determination:**\n\nThe standard synthesis method involves heating xenon and fluorine. The established optimal temperature for this reaction to be efficient is around 400 °C. Temperatures significantly lower than this result in a very slow reaction rate (inefficient), while higher temperatures favor the formation of XeF₆ (also inefficient for producing XeF₄). Therefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature in the given list that allows for efficient production.\n\n<<<B>>>"
