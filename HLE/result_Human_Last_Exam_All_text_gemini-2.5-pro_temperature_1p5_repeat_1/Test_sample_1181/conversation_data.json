    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. This character expresses a particular feeling: they miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth and are ashamed of this feeling.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research the Characters in *Solaris***\n*   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the space station. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, establishing his deep connection to it. His primary emotional struggle revolves around his deceased wife, Hari.\n*   **Hari:** Kris's late wife, who is recreated by the Solaris ocean as a \"guest.\" As a creation of the planet, she has no genuine memories of Earth, only those she gleans from Kris. Therefore, she couldn't miss something she hasn't truly experienced.\n*   **Dr. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is portrayed as cynical, world-weary, and highly articulate. He often engages in philosophical discussions with Kris about their purpose in space and the nature of humanity.\n*   **Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, detached, and rigorously scientific. He views the \"guests\" as a pathological phenomenon to be studied and eliminated, showing little room for sentimentality or nostalgia.\n*   **Gibarian:** Kris's friend and a scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches a video message Gibarian left, but his message is one of despair and warning, not nostalgic reflection.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Sentiment: \"Ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling\"**\nThis phrase contains two important parts:\n1.  **Missing the sound of leaves:** This is a powerful symbol of homesickness and a longing for Earth and nature.\n2.  **Being ashamed of it:** This suggests an internal conflict. The character likely feels that such a \"soft\" or \"unscientific\" emotion is a weakness, inappropriate for a scientist on a mission far from home. This feeling of shame points to a character who is trying to maintain a stoic or professional exterior but is struggling with profound loneliness and alienation.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Sentiment to the Characters**\n*   **Kris:** While he is deeply connected to Earth, the film focuses more on his personal grief for Hari than a generalized homesickness that he would be ashamed of. He is defined by his emotional turmoil, not its suppression.\n*   **Sartorius:** He is the least likely candidate. He is actively trying to suppress all emotion in favor of cold, hard science. He would probably feel this longing but would never admit it, even to himself, let alone express shame over it.\n*   **Snaut:** This character fits perfectly. He is the one who most frequently philosophizes about the human condition and their isolation. His cynical exterior is a mask for his vulnerability. In a pivotal conversation with Kris, Snaut confesses his deep-seated homesickness and alienation. He admits that he misses simple, earthly things and is ashamed of this feeling, as if it undermines his role as a space-faring scientist. It is he who says to Kris, \"I'm ashamed to admit it, Kris, but I miss the sound of leaves.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Based on the Evidence**\nThe character who delivers this specific line of dialogue is Dr. Snaut. It is a key moment that reveals his inner turmoil and underscores the film's theme of humanity's unsuitability for the cold, alien cosmos and our intrinsic need for the familiarities of Earth.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
