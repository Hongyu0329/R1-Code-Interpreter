    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the spaces involved**\n\n*   $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the complex projective space of dimension 3. It is a 6-dimensional real manifold.\n*   $X$ is defined by the zero set of a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   Since $X$ is a hypersurface in a 3-dimensional complex manifold, $X$ is a 2-dimensional complex manifold, and thus a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n*   We want to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. Since $X$ is a manifold, it is path-connected. For any path-connected space $Y$, $\\pi_k(Y)$ is an abelian group for $k \\ge 2$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part (i.e., the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors in its decomposition).\n\n**Step 2: Basic topological properties of X and $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**\n\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which relates the topology of a smooth projective variety to its smooth hyperplane sections.\n\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homotopy version):** Let $Y$ be a complex projective manifold of dimension $n$, and let $X$ be a smooth hyperplane section of $Y$. The inclusion map $i: X \\to Y$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$.\n*   In our case, $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$ (complex dimension $n=3$) and $X$ is a smooth hypersurface (complex dimension $n-1=2$).\n*   The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 3-1=2$.\n    *   For $k=0$, this confirms $X$ is connected.\n    *   For $k=1$, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, which implies $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n*   **Homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**: The homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ can be computed from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^{2n+1} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$. For $k>2$, the sequence gives $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\cong \\pi_k(S^{2n+1})$.\n    *   For $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we have $n=3$. So $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_k(S^7)$ for $k>2$.\n    *   We need $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Thus, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7)$.\n    *   The homotopy group $\\pi_k(S^m)$ is zero for $k < m$. Here $k=3, m=7$, so $\\pi_3(S^7) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to other groups**\n\nWe use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(Y, A) = (\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(X) \\to \\dots $$\nLet's look at the portion involving $\\pi_3(X)$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\nSubstituting $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, we get:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis tells us that the boundary map $\\partial: \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is surjective. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a quotient of the relative homotopy group $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. This information by itself is not sufficient to determine the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n**Step 4: Use a powerful theorem from algebraic topology**\n\nThe computation of higher homotopy groups of algebraic varieties is a deep subject. There are powerful theorems that address this question directly. A key result is due to A. Libgober and J. Wood regarding the topology of complete intersections.\n\n*   **Theorem (Libgober-Wood):** Let $V$ be a smooth complete intersection of complex dimension $m$ in $\\mathbb{P}^{m+k}$. If $m$ is even and $m \\ge 2$, then the homotopy group $\\pi_{m+1}(V)$ is finite, unless $V$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ (i.e., $m=2, k=1$) of degree $d$ such that $d$ divides $m+1=3$.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to our problem:\n*   Our space $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. So it is a complete intersection with $k=1$.\n*   The complex dimension of $X$ is $m=2$. This is even and greater than or equal to 2, so the theorem's premise on dimension is met.\n*   We are interested in $\\pi_3(X)$, which is $\\pi_{m+1}(X)$.\n*   The degree of our hypersurface is $d=5$.\n*   The theorem states an exception for the case $m=2, k=1$ if the degree $d$ divides $m+1=3$.\n*   In our case, $d=5$. Since 5 does not divide 3, our hypersurface $X$ does not fall into the exceptional case.\n*   Therefore, the theorem's conclusion applies: $\\pi_3(X)$ is a finite group.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the rank**\n\n*   The rank of an abelian group is the size of the largest free abelian subgroup, which corresponds to the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into a free part and a torsion part.\n*   A finite abelian group has no free part. Its rank is 0.\n*   Since $\\pi_3(X)$ is a finite group, its rank must be 0.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n1.  The dimension of $X$ is 2 in the complex sense, and 4 in the real sense. The theorem of Libgober-Wood uses the complex dimension.\n2.  The homotopy group $\\pi_k(Y)$ is abelian for $k \\ge 2$ when $Y$ is path-connected. Our $X$ is a compact manifold, hence path-connected.\n3.  The calculation $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$ is crucial. It simplifies the long exact sequence but does not solve the problem on its own.\n4.  Correctly checking the conditions of the Libgober-Wood theorem: $m=2$ is even, the group is $\\pi_{m+1}$, the degree is $d=5$, and checking if $d$ divides $m+1=3$.\n5.  Understanding the definition of the rank of an abelian group. For a finite group, the rank is zero.\n\nThe final answer is determined by applying a known theorem about the topology of complex hypersurfaces, which shows that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a finite group.\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0."
