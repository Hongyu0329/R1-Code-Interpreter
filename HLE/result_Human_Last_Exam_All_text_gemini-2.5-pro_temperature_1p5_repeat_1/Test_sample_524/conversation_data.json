    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of mathematical objects that satisfy three properties simultaneously: they are homogeneous, they are planar, and they are continua. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n    *   *Compact* means that every open cover has a finite subcover. In the context of subsets of Euclidean space (like the plane R²), this is equivalent to being closed and bounded.\n    *   *Connected* means it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets. Intuitively, it's a single \"piece\".\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (R²). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of R².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h from X to itself (an automorphism) such that h(x) = y. This means the space looks the same from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are mutually homeomorphic (topologically equivalent). The question asks for the number of such distinct classes.\n\n**2. Considering the Degenerate Case**\n\nThe definition of a continuum includes the simplest possible case: a single point.\n*   Let X be a space consisting of a single point, {p}.\n*   **Continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n*   **Planar?** Yes. It can be represented as a point in the plane R².\n*   **Homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. For any two points x, y in X, we must have x = y = p. The identity map h(p) = p is a homeomorphism that sends x to y.\nTherefore, the single point constitutes one homeomorphism class of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n**3. Considering the Non-Degenerate Case**\n\nThis is the more complex part of the problem. We are looking for continua with more than one point that are homogeneous and can exist in the plane. The classification of such objects is a famous and deep result in point-set topology, established through the work of mathematicians like R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, and Charles Hagopian.\n\nThe main classification theorem states that **any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of exactly three types of spaces.**\n\nThese three types are:\n\n*   **a) The Circle (S¹):** This is the familiar unit circle in the plane.\n    *   *Continuum:* It is a closed, bounded, and connected subset of R².\n    *   *Planar:* It exists in the plane by definition.\n    *   *Homogeneous:* Any point on the circle can be rotated to any other point, and this rotation is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself.\n\n*   **b) The Pseudo-arc:** This is a pathological but fascinating object. It can be constructed as the inverse limit of a sequence of arcs. It has several counter-intuitive properties: it is one-dimensional, chainable (can be approximated by chains of open sets), and \"hereditarily indecomposable\" (meaning no subcontinuum of it can be written as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua).\n    *   *Continuum:* It is a compact and connected space.\n    *   *Planar:* It can be embedded in the plane.\n    *   *Homogeneous:* R. H. Bing proved in 1951 that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. It is surprisingly \"uniform\" despite its complexity.\n\n*   **c) The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** This object is constructed by \"replacing\" each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way. More formally, it is a continuous decomposition of a certain non-planar continuum (a solenoid) whose decomposition space is a circle.\n    *   *Continuum:* It is a compact and connected space.\n    *   *Planar:* It can be embedded in the plane.\n    *   *Homogeneous:* Like the circle and the pseudo-arc, it is homogeneous.\n\n**4. Verifying Distinctness and Completeness**\n\n*   These three non-degenerate spaces belong to distinct homeomorphism classes.\n    *   The circle is **locally connected**, while the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are not.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is **tree-like** (or chainable), while the circle of pseudo-arcs is not. Cutting a circle of pseudo-arcs doesn't result in a tree-like object.\n*   The classification theorem is complete. It has been proven that there are no other non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. Other famous homogeneous continua, like the solenoids and the Menger universal curve, are provably **non-planar**.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nWe list all the distinct homeomorphism classes we have found:\n1.  The single point (the degenerate case).\n2.  The circle (S¹).\n3.  The pseudo-arc.\n4.  The circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\nCombining the degenerate and non-degenerate cases, we find there are a total of four such classes.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Inclusion of the degenerate case:** The definition of a continuum includes a single point, which satisfies all the conditions. Forgetting this would lead to an answer of 3.\n*   **Reliance on a major theorem:** The answer for the non-degenerate case is not trivial and relies on a significant classification theorem from topology.\n*   **Exclusion of non-planar examples:** It is important to know that other well-known homogeneous continua like solenoids and the Menger curve are not planar and therefore are not counted.\n*   **Understanding the differences:** The three non-degenerate types are distinguished by fundamental topological properties like local connectedness and being tree-like.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to a definitive count of four distinct classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
