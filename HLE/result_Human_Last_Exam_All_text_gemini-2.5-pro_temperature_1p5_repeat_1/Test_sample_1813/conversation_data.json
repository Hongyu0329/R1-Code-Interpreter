    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\". This does not mean the continued fraction of the integer \\( m_{4/7} \\). Instead, it refers to a specific quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is linked to the rational number \\( p/q = 4/7 \\) within the framework of the theory of Markov and Lagrange spectra. Several constructions for this associated quadratic irrational exist in the literature. We will use a canonical one defined by J.S. Calcut, related to works by Bombieri, Stoppino, and Bauer.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Continued Fraction of 4/7\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).\n1.  \\( 7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\)\n2.  \\( 4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\)\n3.  \\( 3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\)\n\nThe partial quotients are \\( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3 \\).\nSo, the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Convergents of [0; 1, 1, 3]\n\nWe compute the sequence of convergents, denoted by \\( p_k/q_k \\). The recurrence relations are \\( p_k = a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2} \\) and \\( q_k = a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2} \\), with initial values \\( p_{-1}=1, q_{-1}=0, p_0=0, q_0=1 \\).\n\n*   **k=1 (\\( a_1=1 \\)):**\n    *   \\( p_1 = 1 \\cdot p_0 + p_{-1} = 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n    *   \\( q_1 = 1 \\cdot q_0 + q_{-1} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1 \\)\n    *   Convergent: \\( p_1/q_1 = 1/1 \\) (Check: \\( [0;1]=1 \\))\n\n*   **k=2 (\\( a_2=1 \\)):**\n    *   \\( p_2 = 1 \\cdot p_1 + p_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1 \\)\n    *   \\( q_2 = 1 \\cdot q_1 + q_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n    *   Convergent: \\( p_2/q_2 = 1/2 \\) (Check: \\( [0;1,1] = 1/(1+1/1) = 1/2 \\))\n\n*   **k=3 (\\( a_3=3 \\)):**\n    *   \\( p_3 = 3 \\cdot p_2 + p_1 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 4 \\)\n    *   \\( q_3 = 3 \\cdot q_2 + q_1 = 3 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 7 \\)\n    *   Convergent: \\( p_3/q_3 = 4/7 \\) (Check: \\( [0;1,1,3] = 4/7 \\))\n\nWe have \\( n=3 \\), and the necessary values are \\( p_3=4, q_3=7 \\) and the previous convergent's terms \\( p_2=1, q_2=2 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Quadratic Equation\n\nThe quadratic irrational number associated with \\( p/q = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\), let's call it \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\), is defined as the positive root of the quadratic equation:\n$$ p_n x^2 + (q_n - p_{n-1}) x - q_{n-1} = 0 $$\nSubstituting our values (\\( n=3, p_3=4, q_3=7, p_2=1, q_2=2 \\)):\n$$ 4x^2 + (7 - 1)x - 2 = 0 $$\n$$ 4x^2 + 6x - 2 = 0 $$\nDividing by 2, we get the simplified equation:\n$$ 2x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 $$\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Quadratic Equation\n\nWe find the roots of \\( 2x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n$$ x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{4} $$\nThe question implicitly asks for the continued fraction of a positive number, so we take the positive root:\n$$ x = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{4} $$\n\n### Step 6: Compute the Continued Fraction of the Root\n\nLet's find the continued fraction of \\( x_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{4} \\). We use the standard algorithm:\n*   **Term 0:** \\( \\sqrt{16} < \\sqrt{17} < \\sqrt{25} \\), so \\( 4 < \\sqrt{17} < 5 \\).\n    \\( x_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{4} \\approx \\frac{4.123 - 3}{4} = \\frac{1.123}{4} \\approx 0.28 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( a_0 = \\lfloor x_0 \\rfloor = 0 \\).\n\n*   **Term 1:** The next term is \\( x_1 = \\frac{1}{x_0 - a_0} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17} - 3} \\).\n    Rationalize the denominator: \\( x_1 = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17} + 3)}{(\\sqrt{17} - 3)(\\sqrt{17} + 3)} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17} + 3)}{17 - 9} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17} + 3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 3}{2} \\).\n    \\( x_1 \\approx \\frac{4.123 + 3}{2} = \\frac{7.123}{2} \\approx 3.56 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( a_1 = \\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = 3 \\).\n\n*   **Term 2:** The next term is \\( x_2 = \\frac{1}{x_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 3}{2} - 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17} - 3} \\).\n    Rationalize: \\( x_2 = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{17} + 3)}{17 - 9} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{17} + 3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 3}{4} \\).\n    \\( x_2 \\approx \\frac{4.123 + 3}{4} = \\frac{7.123}{4} \\approx 1.78 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( a_2 = \\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\n\n*   **Term 3:** The next term is \\( x_3 = \\frac{1}{x_2 - a_2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 3}{4} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 1}{4}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17} - 1} \\).\n    Rationalize: \\( x_3 = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17} + 1)}{17 - 1} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17} + 1)}{16} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 1}{4} \\).\n    \\( x_3 \\approx \\frac{4.123 + 1}{4} = \\frac{5.123}{4} \\approx 1.28 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( a_3 = \\lfloor x_3 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\n\n*   **Term 4:** The next term is \\( x_4 = \\frac{1}{x_3 - a_3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} + 1}{4} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17} - 3} = x_1 \\).\n    Since we have found a remainder \\( x_4 \\) that is equal to a previous remainder \\( x_1 \\), the continued fraction is periodic. The periodic block is \\( [a_1, a_2, a_3] = [3, 1, 1] \\).\n\nThe continued fraction is \\( [0; 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, \\dots] \\), which is written as \\( [0; \\overline{3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n### Final Observation\n\nThe continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The associated continued fraction we computed is \\( [0; \\overline{3, 1, 1}] \\). The periodic part of the resulting continued fraction is the reverse of the sequence of partial quotients of the original rational number. This is a known property of this specific construction and provides confidence in the result. The generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is indeed 8, but its value is not directly used in the final calculation, rather the theory provides the procedure.\n\n<<<[0; 3, 1, 1]>>>"
