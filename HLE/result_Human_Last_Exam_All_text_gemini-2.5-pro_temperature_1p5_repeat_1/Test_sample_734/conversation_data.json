    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theologian who developed the specialized terminology in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe core of the question is to identify a Christian theologian who meets several specific criteria:\n1.  **Is a Christian theologian:** The figure must be from within the history of Christian thought.\n2.  **Developed specialized terminology:** This implies the creation of a specific, defined set of terms or a conceptual framework, not just a general discussion of the topic.\n3.  **The terminology describes \"changes in the laws of nature\":** The concepts must account for how the regular, observable patterns of the natural world (natural law) can be altered or suspended.\n4.  **The terminology is applicable to two distinct events:**\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A singular, specific miracle that suspends a biological law.\n    *   **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** A hypothetical, systemic, and potentially permanent change in the entire natural order resulting from a specific event in salvation history.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Potential Candidates\n\n*   **Early Church Fathers (e.g., Augustine of Hippo):** Augustine (354–430 AD) is a strong early candidate. He wrote extensively on miracles and creation. He argued that miracles are not `contra naturam` (against nature) but rather `contra quam est nota natura` (against nature *as it is known to us*). He developed the concept of `rationes seminales` (seminal reasons), suggesting that God embedded the potential for all future events, including miracles, into creation from the very beginning. While this is a sophisticated framework, it tends to explain miracles as part of the original, deeper fabric of nature, rather than as a \"change\" in its laws. It works for the virgin birth, but it's less focused on a systemic *alteration* of laws post-Fall.\n\n*   **Reformation Theologians (e.g., John Calvin):** Calvin (1509–1564) wrote extensively on God's sovereignty and providence, arguing that God constantly upholds and governs the world. Miracles are direct expressions of this divine power. However, he did not focus on creating new philosophical terminology to categorize the mechanics of how natural laws might change. He largely worked within existing theological frameworks while emphasizing God's direct and personal will.\n\n*   **Medieval Scholastic Theologians (e.g., Thomas Aquinas):** The Scholastic period was known for its detailed systematization and development of precise terminology. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) is the most prominent figure here. Building on earlier thought, he articulated a critical distinction that directly addresses the question.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Thomas Aquinas's Specialized Terminology\n\nAquinas developed and popularized a clear distinction between two ways of understanding God's power:\n\n1.  **Potentia Dei ordinata (God's Ordained Power):** This refers to God's power as it is expressed through the established, reliable order of creation that He Himself willed and put in place. This is the \"laws of nature\" as we observe them—the regular, predictable way the universe functions.\n\n2.  **Potentia Dei absoluta (God's Absolute Power):** This refers to God's sheer, intrinsic power, which is the realm of all logical possibilities. It represents everything God *could* do by his own nature, unconstrained by the order he has currently established.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Aquinas's Terminology to the Question's Examples\n\nThis framework provides the exact terminology needed to describe the two scenarios in the question:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** This event is a classic example of God acting according to His **absolute power** (`potentia absoluta`). He temporarily and locally sets aside the \"ordained\" law of biological reproduction to bring about the Incarnation. It is not bound by the `potentia ordinata`.\n\n*   **Alterations at the Fall:** The idea that creation itself was changed after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of mortality, corruption, \"thorns and thistles\") can be described as God instituting a *new* **ordained power** (`potentia ordinata`). The pre-Fall world operated under one ordained order, and the post-Fall world operates under a different, harsher one. This represents a systemic \"change in the laws of nature.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Augustine provided crucial groundwork, it was **Thomas Aquinas** who most clearly developed and systematized the specialized terminology of **`potentia ordinata`** and **`potentia absoluta`**. This framework uniquely and precisely allows theologians to describe both a singular miraculous suspension of natural law (the virgin birth) and a systemic, historical change in the entire order of natural law (the Fall).\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
