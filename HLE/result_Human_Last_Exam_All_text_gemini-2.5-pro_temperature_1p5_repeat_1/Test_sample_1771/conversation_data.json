    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the PIE root *seh₂g- into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **From Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the correct PIE base form.** The question provides the PIE present tense form *seh₂gieti*. However, the known reflexes in Germanic (like OE *sēċan*, OHG *suohhen*, 'to seek') point not to this *e*-grade thematic present, but to an *o*-grade causative formation, PIE **\\*soh₂g-éye-ti**. This means 'to cause someone to track/perceive a sign', which semantically shifted to 'to look for, to seek'. The provided Latin and Hittite forms suggest a root *sāg-*, which might come from a different formation or ablaut grade, but the Germanic reflexes are consistently derived from PGmc **\\*sōkijaną**. We will proceed with the PIE form that correctly yields the Germanic evidence.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Applying sound laws.**\n        *   **Laryngeal Effect:** In the form *soh₂g-, the laryngeal *h₂ follows an *o*. The sequence *oh₂C (where C is a consonant) develops into a long *ō* in Proto-Germanic. So, PIE *soh₂g- > PGmc **\\*sōk-**.\n        *   **Grimm's Law:** The PIE voiced velar stop *g is devoiced to a voiceless velar stop *k. PIE *g > PGmc **\\*k**.\n        *   **Verner's Law:** This law does not apply to the root consonant *g because the PIE accent in causative verbs (*-éye-) was on the suffix, not the syllable before it. Wait, the rule is if the accent does *not* immediately precede the consonant. The causative PIE *-éye-ti has stress on the syllable right before the *y* but after the *g*. Re-checking standard doctrine on Verner's law, it's about the location of the PIE accent. In *soh₂g-éye-ti*, the accent is not on the root syllable *soh₂g-*. However, Grimm's law is the primary change for stops, and *g > *k is the regular outcome. Let's assume the standard derivation *g > *k holds.\n        *   **Suffix:** The PIE causative suffix *-éye- becomes the suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic, *-jan-*.\n    *   **Resulting Proto-Germanic Form:** Combining these changes, the infinitive form becomes **\\*sōkijaną**. The 3rd person singular present would be **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n2.  **From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old Norse (ON)**\n    *   **PGmc form:** \\*sōkijaną\n    *   **Careful Point: I-umlaut.** The high front vowel sound, represented by *-j-* or *-i-* in the suffix, causes the back root vowel **\\*ō** to be fronted. In Old Norse, \\*ō > **\\*œ** (sometimes written ø).\n    *   **Suffix Change:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-a** in Old Norse. The medial *-j-* is preserved after the root and triggers the umlaut.\n    *   **Resulting Old Norse Form:** \\*sōkijaną > ON **sœkja**.\n\n3.  **From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old English (OE)**\n    *   **PGmc form:** \\*sōkijaną\n    *   **Careful Point 1: I-umlaut.** As in Old Norse, the *-j-* of the suffix causes fronting of the root vowel. In Old English, PGmc \\*ō > **\\*ē**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Palatalization.** After the i-umlaut created the new front vowel *ē*, the preceding velar consonant PGmc *k* was palatalized, becoming an affricate /tʃ/. This sound is written as **ċ** in Old English texts (or often just <c>).\n    *   **Suffix Change:** The *-j-* is lost after causing umlaut and palatalization. The infinitive ending PGmc *-aną* becomes **-an**.\n    *   **Resulting Old English Form:** \\*sōkijaną > \\*sœ̄kian > \\*sēkian > OE **sēċan**.\n\n4.  **From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old High German (OHG)**\n    *   **PGmc form:** \\*sōkijaną\n    *   **Careful Point 1: High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift).** The PGmc voiceless stop **\\*k** becomes a voiceless fricative **\\*hh** /x:/ after a vowel.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Vowel Change.** PGmc long vowel **\\*ō** becomes a diphthong **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: I-umlaut and Suffix.** While i-umlaut existed in OHG (*uo* > *üe*), in Class 1 weak verbs with long syllables like this one, the umlaut is often not expressed in the infinitive form (a phenomenon sometimes called *Rückumlaut* or 'reversion umlaut'). The suffix *-jan-* combines with the new root-final fricative, and the infinitive ending becomes **-en**.\n    *   **Resulting Old High German Form:** \\*sōkijaną > \\*suohhjan > OHG **suohhen**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step phonological analysis, the reflexes of the root in the specified languages (using the standard infinitive form) are:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkja\n*   **Old English:** sēcan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
