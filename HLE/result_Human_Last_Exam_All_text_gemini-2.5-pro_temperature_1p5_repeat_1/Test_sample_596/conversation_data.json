    "Answering this question requires navigating through several possible definitions of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" and a number of theorems from algebraic combinatorics and topology. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n1.  **Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band (K):** This is a simplicial complex whose geometric realization is the Möbius band. The Möbius band is a non-orientable surface with a single boundary circle. Its topological properties are key:\n    *   The fundamental group is $\\pi_1(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is generated by the \"core circle\" of the band.\n    *   The homology groups (with integer coefficients) are $H_0(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_n(K) = 0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(K) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$.\n    *   The reduced Euler characteristic is $\\tilde{\\chi}(K) = \\chi(K) - 1 = -1$.\n    *   The dimension of the complex is $\\dim K = 2$.\n\n2.  **Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest ((F, R)):** This is the most ambiguous term. There is no single standard definition. We need to analyze the implications of different possible definitions.\n    *   **F is a forest:** This means F is a \"tree-like\" subcomplex of K. Common definitions include:\n        a.  The 1-skeleton of F, $F^{(1)}$, is a graph-theoretic forest (contains no cycles).\n        b.  F contains no \"minimal circuits.\" For a 2-complex like K, which has $H_2(K)=0$, any subcomplex will also have $H_2=0$. This definition would imply every subcomplex of K is a forest, which is too broad.\n        c.  Collapsibility is part of the definition of a tree/forest (e.g., as in the work of Duval, Klivans, and Martin). A \"tree\" is a complex that is collapsible to a point.\n    *   **R is a root:** This is a non-empty subcomplex of F, $R \\subseteq F$.\n\n3.  **Simplicial Collapse (F ↘ R):** This is a standard concept. It means F can be reduced to R through a sequence of elementary simplicial collapses. An elementary collapse removes a pair $(\\sigma, \\tau)$ where $\\sigma$ is a principal simplex and $\\tau$ is a free face of $\\sigma$. A key property is that if $F \\searrow R$, then the inclusion map $i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ is a homotopy equivalence. For this to happen, all relative homology groups $H_n(F, R)$ must be zero.\n\n4.  **The Goal:** We want to count the number of pairs $(F, R)$ that are \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" but for which $F$ does *not* simplicially collapse onto $R$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Possible Definitions and their Consequences\n\nLet's explore the definitions of a forest and see where they lead.\n\n*   **Case 1: The definition of a \"rooted forest\" includes collapsibility.**\n    In some literature, a \"higher-dimensional tree\" or \"forest\" is defined as a complex that is collapsible. A \"rooted forest\" $(F,R)$ could be defined as a pair where, by definition, $F \\searrow R$. If we adopt this definition, the question \"How many such pairs fail to collapse?\" is self-contradictory. The answer would be 0. This is a clean answer, but it feels like a semantic trick.\n\n*   **Case 2: A forest F is a subcomplex with an acyclic 1-skeleton.**\n    Let's assume $F$ is a subcomplex of $K$ such that $F^{(1)}$ has no cycles.\n    *   If $F$ is connected, its 1-skeleton is a tree. Such a complex $F$ is always contractible (homotopy equivalent to a point).\n    *   For $F \\searrow R$, we need the inclusion $R \\hookrightarrow F$ to be a homotopy equivalence. Since $F$ is contractible, $R$ must also be contractible.\n    *   A subcomplex $R$ of such an $F$ also has an acyclic 1-skeleton. For $R$ to be contractible, it must be connected.\n    *   So, for a connected forest $F$, $F \\searrow R$ if and only if $R$ is connected.\n    *   A failure to collapse occurs if $R$ is disconnected. For example, we can take $F$ to be a path of length 2 (edges $e_1, e_2$ meeting at a vertex $v_2$), and $R$ to be its two endpoints $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$. This is a valid rooted forest under this definition, and it fails to collapse.\n    *   The triangulation $K$ of the Möbius band contains many such paths. We can form many such non-collapsing pairs $(F,R)$. The total number would depend on the specific combinatorial details of the triangulation (number of vertices, edges, etc.) and would not be a single, universal integer. This suggests this definition is not the one intended by the question.\n\n*   **Case 3: The answer comes from a general theorem about enumerating collapsing pairs.**\n    There is a theorem from algebraic combinatorics stating that a certain weighted sum of collapsing rooted forests is a topological invariant: $\\sum_{(F,R) \\in \\mathcal{RF}_{coll}(K)} w(F, R) = (-1)^{\\dim K} \\tilde{\\chi}(K)$.\n    For our Möbius band triangulation $K$, this gives $(-1)^2 \\tilde{\\chi}(K) = -1$. This is a weighted count, not the actual number of collapsing pairs (which must be non-negative). This doesn't directly give the number of failing pairs.\n\n### Step 3: A Topological Interpretation Leading to a Unique Answer\n\nThe failure of the above approaches suggests that the question is not about a simple combinatorial count on a specific triangulation, but about a more fundamental topological property of the Möbius band. The key feature of the Möbius band is its non-orientability and its \"twist,\" captured by its fundamental group $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. An obstruction to collapse should be related to this essential structure.\n\nLet's consider what would constitute a \"fundamental\" or \"irreducible\" failure of collapse that is unique to the Möbius band.\n\n1.  A failure $(F,R)$ can be considered \"trivial\" or \"local\" if it can exist in a contractible space, like a disk. The example from Case 2 (a path rooted at its disconnected endpoints) is of this type. It doesn't use any global properties of the Möbius band.\n\n2.  An \"essential\" failure must involve the non-trivial topology of the Möbius band. This means the complex $F$ must itself be non-contractible and must carry the fundamental group of the band. The minimal such subcomplex is the whole triangulation, $F=K$. (Any smaller subcomplex containing the core circle would deformation retract to it, but a \"higher dimensional forest\" should arguably be 2-dimensional).\n\n3.  Let's assume we are counting essential failures, where we must take $F=K$. Now the question is: for which roots $R \\subseteq K$ does the pair $(K,R)$ fail to collapse? The pair $(K,R)$ fails to collapse if the inclusion $i: R \\hookrightarrow K$ is not a homotopy equivalence.\n\n4.  Consider the boundary of the Möbius band, $R = \\partial K$. The boundary is a circle, $S^1$. The inclusion map $i: \\partial K \\to K$ takes the generator of $H_1(\\partial K)$ to twice the generator of $H_1(K)$. (Going around the boundary takes you around the core circle twice). Since the induced map on homology is not an isomorphism, the inclusion is not a homotopy equivalence. Therefore, **K does not simplicially collapse onto its boundary ∂K**. This gives us one essential, non-collapsing rooted forest: $(K, \\partial K)$.\n\n5.  What about other roots? The Möbius band $K$ *does* collapse onto its core circle $C$. The inclusion $C \\hookrightarrow K$ is a homotopy equivalence. The collapse of a space onto a subspace to which it deformation retracts is a standard result. So, $(K,C)$ is a collapsing pair.\n\nThe pair $(K, \\partial K)$ represents the fundamental obstruction to triviality in the Möbius band. While other, \"local\" non-collapsing pairs exist, they are not specific to the Möbius band's topology. The question seems to aim for a universal answer that captures the essence of the space. The most natural interpretation that yields a small, universal integer is that it is counting the number of these \"essential\" or \"global\" obstructions. In this view, the unique topological twist of the Möbius band gives rise to a single fundamental obstruction to collapse.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one such \"essential\" rooted forest that fails to collapse."
