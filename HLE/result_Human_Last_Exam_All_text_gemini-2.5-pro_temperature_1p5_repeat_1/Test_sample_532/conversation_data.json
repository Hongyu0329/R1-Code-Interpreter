    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, inverses for all elements, and a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a` and `b` in `S` (including the case where `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S² ∩ S = ∅`, where `S² = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** This is a product-free set `S` that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if `S` is a maximal product-free set, then for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free. This is commonly called a \"maximal product-free set\".\n*   **Filled Group:** The question defines a finite group `G` as a \"filled group\" if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to the entire group `G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\nThe question asks us to identify all finite groups that are both **filled** and **nilpotent**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the \"Filled Group\" Condition**\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and let `M` be the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`. The condition for `G` to be a filled group is:\n`⋃_{S ∈ M} S = G`\n\nLet's analyze the properties of product-free sets, specifically concerning the identity element of the group, `1` (or `e`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Identity Element and Product-Free Sets**\n    Let `S` be any product-free set in `G`. Can the identity element `1` be a member of `S`?\n    Let's assume `1 ∈ S`. According to the definition of a product-free set, the product of any two elements of `S` cannot be in `S`. If we choose both elements to be `1` (which is in `S`), their product is `1 * 1 = 1`. The result, `1`, must not be in `S`. This leads to a contradiction: `1 ∉ S` and `1 ∈ S`.\n    Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. The identity element `1` cannot be an element of any product-free set.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Identity Element and Maximal Product-Free Sets**\n    A maximal product-free set is, by definition, a product-free set. Therefore, based on the conclusion from Careful Point 1, the identity element `1` cannot be a member of any maximal product-free set.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Union of Maximal Product-Free Sets**\n    Let's consider the union of all maximal product-free sets, `⋃_{S ∈ M} S`. Since `1 ∉ S` for every single set `S` in the collection `M`, the identity element `1` cannot be in their union.\n    This means `⋃_{S ∈ M} S` is a subset of `G \\ {1}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nThe definition of a filled group requires the union of all maximal product-free sets to be equal to the entire group `G`.\n`⋃_{S ∈ M} S = G`\n\nHowever, as we've established in Step 2, the union can never contain the identity element `1`.\n`⋃_{S ∈ M} S ⊆ G \\ {1}`\n\nFor these two conditions to be true simultaneously, `G` must be equal to `G \\ {1}`. This is impossible for any group, as the identity element is a necessary component of a group's structure.\n\nThe only edge case to consider is the trivial group, `G = {1}`.\n*   **Analysis of the Trivial Group `G = {1}`:**\n    *   What are the product-free subsets of `G`? The only non-empty subset is `{1}`. Is it product-free? No, because `1 * 1 = 1`, and the result is in the set.\n    *   The only product-free subset of `G = {1}` is the empty set, `∅`.\n    *   Is the empty set a maximal product-free set? Yes. It cannot be extended, because adding the only other element, `1`, results in the set `{1}`, which is not product-free.\n    *   So, for `G = {1}`, the collection of all maximal product-free sets is `M = {∅}`.\n    *   The union of these sets is `∅`.\n    *   The \"filled\" condition requires this union to equal `G`. This means `∅ = {1}`, which is false.\n    *   Therefore, the trivial group `G = {1}` is not a filled group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the strict definition provided in the question, no finite group `G` (whether trivial or non-trivial, nilpotent or not) can satisfy the condition of being a \"filled group\". This is because the union of its maximal product-free sets will always exclude the identity element and thus cannot be equal to the whole group `G`.\n\nTherefore, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups is the empty set.\n\n***\n\nNote: Some mathematical literature uses \"filled\" or similar terms to mean the union covers all *non-identity* elements (`⋃ S = G \\ {1}`). This leads to a much more complex problem with results that are still debated in research. However, based on the explicit definition given in your question (\"fills G\"), the conclusion is unambiguous.\n\n<<<There are no finite filled nilpotent groups.>>>"
