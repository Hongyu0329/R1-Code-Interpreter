    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premise:** The question states that Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) are tracked by capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\". This interval is the fundamental piece of data from which both HR and HRV are calculated. The question asks for the specific name of this interval value.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The \"value between heartbeats\" is a measure of time. Specifically, it is the time duration that elapses from the peak of one heartbeat (or pulse wave) to the peak of the very next one. This duration is typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\n3.  **Relate the Measurement to the Technology:**\n    *   The most common and \"gold standard\" method for measuring heart activity is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG trace has several characteristic waves for each heartbeat (P, Q, R, S, T). The most prominent and easiest to detect peak is the \"R-wave\". Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R Interval**.\n    *   The question mentions Photoplethysmography (PPG), which is the technology used in smartwatches and pulse oximeters. PPG detects changes in blood volume, creating a pulse wave. The interval is measured between the peaks of these successive pulse waves. This can be technically called a \"Peak-to-Peak (P-P) Interval\" or more generally, an **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Most Common Terminology:** Despite the technical differences between ECG and PPG, the term **R-R Interval** has become the standard and most widely used term in the entire field of HRV research and clinical application. It is very common for scientific papers and device manufacturers to refer to the beat-to-beat intervals from PPG sensors as \"R-R intervals\" or to use the more general term \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\". Both are considered correct in this context.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:** The value measured between heartbeats is the time interval. This series of time intervals is then used to compute HRV metrics (e.g., the standard deviation of these intervals). The most common and established name for this fundamental interval is the R-R Interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **R-R Interval vs. Inter-Beat Interval (IBI):** While \"R-R Interval\" originates from ECG, it is ubiquitously used in the HRV field, even for PPG data. \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is a more general and technically neutral term that is also correct.\n*   **Raw Data vs. Filtered Data:** For accurate HRV analysis, these raw intervals are often filtered to remove artifacts and non-normal beats (e.g., ectopic beats). The resulting cleaned-up intervals are called **Normal-to-Normal (NN) Intervals**. So, while the measurement is an R-R interval, the data used for calculation is often the NN interval. However, the fundamental value being measured is still the R-R interval.\n*   **HRV is not the Interval Itself:** It's crucial to understand that the R-R interval is the raw data point. HRV is a statistical property calculated from a *series* of many R-R intervals, reflecting their variability over time. The question asks for the name of the base value, not the final HRV score.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the value measured between heartbeats.\n2.  This value is a time interval.\n3.  Based on the standard terminology in cardiac physiology and HRV analysis, this time interval is most commonly called the R-R interval.\n4.  Therefore, the final answer is \"R-R interval\".\n\n<<<R-R interval"
