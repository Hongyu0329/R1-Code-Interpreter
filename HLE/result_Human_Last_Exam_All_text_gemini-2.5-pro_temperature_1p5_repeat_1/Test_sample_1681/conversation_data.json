    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nFirst, let's analyze the classical version of the game defined by the given payoff matrix:\n$P = \\begin{bmatrix} (5,5) & (0,7) \\\\ (7,0) & (1,1) \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n*   **R = 5**: Reward for mutual cooperation (C, C).\n*   **S = 0**: Sucker's payoff for cooperating while the other defects (C, D).\n*   **T = 7**: Temptation payoff for defecting while the other cooperates (D, C).\n*   **P = 1**: Punishment for mutual defection (D, D).\n\nIn classical game theory, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect (D):\n*   If Player 2 Cooperates (C), Player 1 gets 7 by defecting vs. 5 by cooperating. Player 1 chooses D.\n*   If Player 2 Defects (D), Player 1 gets 1 by defecting vs. 0 by cooperating. Player 1 chooses D.\n\nThe same logic applies to Player 2. Therefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium in the classical game is (Defect, Defect), which results in a suboptimal payoff of **(1, 1)** for the players. The dilemma is that both players would be better off at (5, 5) if they could trust each other to cooperate.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Quantum Game\n\nIn the quantum version, the game is placed within the framework of quantum mechanics, specifically using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Quantum State:** The game state is represented by a 2-qubit system, one qubit for each player. The classical choices 'Cooperate' and 'Defect' correspond to the basis vectors |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively.\n2.  **Initial State Design:** The question states, \"You design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. In the EWL protocol, this implies using a maximally entangled initial state. We start with the simple state |00⟩ and apply an entangling operator `J` to create the initial game state `|ψ₀⟩ = J|00⟩`. For maximal entanglement, this state is `|ψ₀⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + i|11⟩)`.\n3.  **Quantum Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer limited to C or D. They can choose any single-qubit unitary operation `U` from the special unitary group SU(2). The classical strategies are a subset of these quantum strategies, with Cooperate (C) being the Identity operator `I` and Defect (D) being the Pauli-X operator `σₓ`.\n4.  **Payoff Calculation:** After players Alice and Bob apply their chosen strategies (`Uₐ` and `Uₑ`), the entangling operator is reversed (`J†`), and the final state `|ψ_f⟩ = J†(Uₐ ⊗ Uₑ)|ψ₀⟩` is measured in the computational basis {|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩}. The expected payoff is calculated from the probabilities of these outcomes.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Equilibria in the Quantum Game\n\nWith the game extended to the quantum realm, we must find the new Nash Equilibrium.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Breaking the Classical Equilibrium:** The classical (D, D) equilibrium becomes unstable. If one player commits to the classical 'Defect' strategy, the other player can adopt a quantum strategy that yields a higher payoff than the classical 'Defect' response. Thus, (D, D) is often no longer a Nash Equilibrium.\n\n2.  **The New Quantum Equilibrium:** A new, superior equilibrium emerges thanks to the quantum strategies. A key strategy, often denoted as `Q`, is represented by the Pauli-Z gate up to a phase: `Q = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the (Q, Q) Strategy Profile:** Let's analyze the case where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`.\n    *   The state after both players apply `Q` and the `J†` operator is applied is `|ψ_f⟩ = -|00⟩`.\n    *   The probability of measuring the outcome `|00⟩` is `|-1|² = 1`. This corresponds to the **(Cooperate, Cooperate)** outcome.\n    *   Therefore, the payoff for the strategy profile (Q, Q) is **(5, 5)**.\n\n4.  **Checking for Stability (Nash Equilibrium):** We must verify that no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy from Q. Let's assume Bob plays `Q`. We can calculate Alice's payoff if she deviates to another strategy, such as the classical `C` or `D`.\n    *   If Alice plays `Q`, her payoff is **5**.\n    *   If Alice deviates to play `C` (`I`), her resulting payoff is **1**.\n    *   If Alice deviates to play `D` (`σₓ`), her resulting payoff is **0**.\n\nSince 5 is greater than 1 and 0, Alice has no incentive to deviate from `Q` if Bob is playing `Q`. By symmetry, the same holds for Bob. Thus, **(Q, Q) is a stable Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe quantum game, when set up optimally with maximal entanglement, introduces a new Nash Equilibrium. This equilibrium strategy `(Q, Q)` resolves the prisoner's dilemma by making the mutually cooperative outcome `(C, C)` stable. The players, picking their best strategies, will choose `Q` to achieve the Pareto-optimal payoff.\n\nThe equilibrium point of the game is the payoff vector achieved at this stable quantum equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium point is **(5, 5)**.\n\n<<<**(5, 5)**>>>"
