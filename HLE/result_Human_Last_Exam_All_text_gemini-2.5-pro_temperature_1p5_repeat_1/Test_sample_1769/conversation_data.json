    "This is a question of counterfactual historical linguistics. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and isolate the influence of Old Norse.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Modern English Word \"sister\"**: The word \"sister\" comes from Middle English *sister*. This form, however, was not the only one in Middle English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Old English Ancestor**: The word for a female sibling in Old English was *sweostor*. It had a common variant form, *swuster*. Both of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic root *\\*swestēr*.\n\n3.  **Identify the Old Norse Cognate**: The Old Norse word for sister was *systir*. It also descends from the same Proto-Germanic root *\\*swestēr*. Old English *sweostor* and Old Norse *systir* are, therefore, \"cognates\"—words that share a common historical origin.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Norse Influence**: The key to the question lies in how the modern word is pronounced and spelled. The 'i' vowel in \"sister\" is not the expected outcome from the Old English *sweostor* or *swuster*. This 'i' (originally a 'y' sound in Old Norse, which was often rendered as 'i' in English) comes directly from the Old Norse *systir*. In the northern parts of England (the Danelaw), where Viking settlement and influence were strongest, the pronunciation of the native English word was modified by the similar-sounding Norse cognate. This northern form, *sister*, eventually spread south and became the standard form in the English language.\n\n5.  **Establish the Counterfactual**: Now, we must imagine an English language where the Norse invasions never happened. In this timeline, there would be no Old Norse *systir* to influence the native word. The Old English word *sweostor*/*swuster* would have evolved according to the regular sound changes happening in the southern dialects of England, which formed the basis of Modern Standard English.\n\n6.  **Trace the Native Word's Development**: The southern Middle English form derived from Old English *swuster* was *suster*. This form is well-attested in the writings of southerners like Chaucer. Without the influence from the Norse-speaking North, *suster* would have been the standard form to continue developing into Modern English.\n\n7.  **Apply Regular Sound Changes to Get the Final Answer**: The final step is to project what Middle English *suster* would have become today. The short 'u' vowel (/ʊ/) in Middle English, as in *suster*, regularly developed into the modern /ʌ/ vowel (the \"STRUT\" vowel, as in the words \"sun\", \"son\", \"cut\", or \"duster\").\n\nTherefore, had the Old English word developed without Norse influence, the Middle English *suster* would have become the Modern English **suster** (pronounced /ˈsʌstər/).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   This is not a case of the English borrowing a new word. It is a case of a native word's pronunciation being altered by a closely related (cognate) word from another language.\n*   The primary evidence of the Norse influence is the vowel 'i'. The southern *suster* form clearly shows the native developmental path.\n*   The predicted change from Middle English *suster* to Modern English \"suster\" follows one of the most regular and well-documented sound changes in the history of the English language.\n*   We can see a parallel in the Dutch word *zuster*, which evolved from the same root without Norse influence, further supporting this conclusion.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
