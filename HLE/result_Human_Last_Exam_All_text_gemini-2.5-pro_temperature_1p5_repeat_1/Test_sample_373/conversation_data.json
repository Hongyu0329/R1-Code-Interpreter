    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, which acts as a bridge.\n*   The problem specifies a graph with 10 nodes. This means the barbell graph consists of two 5-node cliques ($K_5$).\n*   Let's call the two cliques $A$ and $B$. Clique $A$ has 5 nodes, and clique $B$ has 5 nodes.\n*   The **bottleneck edge** is the single edge that connects a node from clique $A$ to a node from clique $B$. Let's name the nodes connected by this edge $u_A$ (from clique $A$) and $u_B$ (from clique $B$). The bottleneck edge is $e_b = (u_A, u_B)$.\n\n**2. Determining the Degree of Each Node**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to calculate the degrees for all nodes in the graph.\n\n*   **Nodes not on the bridge:** Consider a node in clique $A$ that is not $u_A$. In a $K_5$, every node is connected to the other 4 nodes. Since this node is not part of the bridge, its only connections are within its own clique. Therefore, its degree is 4. There are 4 such nodes in clique $A$ and 4 in clique $B$, making a total of 8 nodes with degree 4.\n*   **Nodes on the bridge ($u_A$ and $u_B$):**\n    *   Node $u_A$ is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique ($A$).\n    *   It is also connected to node $u_B$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   So, the degree of $u_A$ is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of node $u_B$ is also 5.\n\n*   **Summary of Degrees:**\n    *   2 nodes ($u_A$ and $u_B$) have a degree of 5.\n    *   8 other nodes have a degree of 4.\n\n**3. Understanding the \"Randomized Uniform Gossiping\" Sampling Process**\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a node-centric process for selecting an edge. A single sampling event consists of two steps:\n\n1.  **Node Selection:** A node is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of picking any specific node $u$ is $P(u) = 1/10$.\n2.  **Neighbor Selection:** The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random. The \"uniform weights\" in the problem description confirms this. The probability of a node $u$ selecting a specific neighbor $v$ is $P(v|u) = 1/d(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of node $u$.\n\nThe result of this process is a sampled directed edge, $(u, v)$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nThe undirected bottleneck edge $e_b = (u_A, u_B)$ is considered \"sampled\" if the gossiping process selects either the directed edge from $u_A$ to $u_B$ or the directed edge from $u_B$ to $u_A$. These are two distinct, mutually exclusive events. We must calculate the probability of each and add them together.\n\n*   **Case 1: Sampling the directed edge $(u_A, u_B)$**\n    *   First, node $u_A$ must be selected. The probability is $P(u_A) = 1/10$.\n    *   Second, node $u_A$ must select its neighbor $u_B$. Node $u_A$ has degree 5, so the probability is $P(u_B|u_A) = 1/d(u_A) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability for this case is $P(u_A \\to u_B) = P(u_A) \\times P(u_B|u_A) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Sampling the directed edge $(u_B, u_A)$**\n    *   First, node $u_B$ must be selected. The probability is $P(u_B) = 1/10$.\n    *   Second, node $u_B$ must select its neighbor $u_A$. Node $u_B$ also has degree 5, so the probability is $P(u_A|u_B) = 1/d(u_B) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability for this case is $P(u_B \\to u_A) = P(u_B) \\times P(u_A|u_B) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n    *   $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(u_A \\to u_B) + P(u_B \\to u_A) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Graph Model:** Correctly identifying the structure of a 10-node barbell graph (two $K_5$ cliques joined by one edge) is crucial. Any other structure (e.g., smaller cliques with a longer path) would change the node degrees and the final answer. The phrasing \"the bottleneck edge\" implies a unique bridge.\n*   **Sampling Process:** It is essential to understand that \"randomized uniform gossiping\" implies a two-step, node-centric sampling method, not simply picking an edge uniformly from all edges in the graph. The probability of sampling an edge is dependent on the degrees of the nodes it connects.\n*   **Undirected vs. Directed:** The sampled entity in the gossip process is a directed edge $(u,v)$, but the question asks about sampling an undirected edge. One must account for both possible directions, $(u_A, u_B)$ and $(u_B, u_A)$.\n*   **Degrees:** Accurately calculating the degrees of all nodes is fundamental. A mistake here, especially for the bridge nodes, would lead to an incorrect result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final calculated probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two ways the bottleneck edge can be sampled.\nFinal Probability = $1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
