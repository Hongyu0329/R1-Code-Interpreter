    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the specified 4-polytope.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the f-vector of a specific mathematical object. Let's break down the properties of this object:\n*   **f-vector:** For a `d`-dimensional polytope, the f-vector is an integer vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, ..., f_{d-1})`, where `f_i` represents the number of `i`-dimensional faces.\n*   **4-polytope:** A four-dimensional polytope (`d=4`). Its f-vector is of the form `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)`, where:\n    *   `f_0`: number of vertices (0-faces)\n    *   `f_1`: number of edges (1-faces)\n    *   `f_2`: number of polygons (2-faces)\n    *   `f_3`: number of cells or facets (3-faces)\n*   **6 vertices:** The polytope has exactly 6 vertices, so `f_0 = 6`.\n*   **Non-simplicial:** This is a crucial constraint. A polytope is simplicial if all its facets are simplices. For a 4-polytope, this means all its 3-faces (cells) must be tetrahedra (3-simplices). A non-simplicial 4-polytope has at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron (e.g., a cube, a prism, a pyramid).\n*   **Maximal number of 2-faces:** Among all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, we are interested in the one that has the largest possible value for `f_2`.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the General Upper Bound\nThe Upper Bound Theorem (UBT) by McMullen states that for any `d`-polytope with `n` vertices, the number of faces of each dimension is maximized by the *cyclic polytope* `C_d(n)`. The cyclic polytope is always simplicial.\n\nFor our case (`d=4, n=6`), the maximum number of faces of all dimensions is achieved by the simplicial polytope `C_4(6)`. The f-vector for this polytope is known to be `(6, 15, 18, 9)`.\n*   `f_0 = 6`\n*   `f_1 = 15`\n*   `f_2 = 18`\n*   `f_3 = 9`\n\nThis tells us that for *any* 4-polytope with 6 vertices, `f_2` cannot exceed 18. Since the cyclic polytope is simplicial, the polytope we are looking for (which must be non-simplicial) will have an `f_2` value less than or equal to 18.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Candidate Polytopes\nWe need to find non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices. A powerful way to find such polytopes is to consult the complete classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices.\n\nThe classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices is a known result in polyhedral combinatorics (Hachimori, 2000). It states that there are exactly **two** combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices:\n1.  **The join of two triangles (`Δ₂ * Δ₂`)**: This polytope is combinatorially equivalent to the cyclic polytope `C_4(6)`. As established, it is **simplicial**, and its f-vector is `(6, 15, 18, 9)`.\n2.  **The pyramid over a square pyramid (`Pyr(Pyr₄)`)**: This is the only other possible type. Let's analyze its properties.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Non-Simplicial Candidate\nThe polytope in question must be the second type from the classification, the pyramid over a square pyramid. Let's verify it is non-simplicial and calculate its f-vector.\n\n*   **Is it non-simplicial?** A pyramid `Pyr(B)` built over a base `B` has `B` as one of its facets. In our case, the base `B` is a square pyramid (`Pyr₄`). A square pyramid is a 3-polytope with 5 vertices, which is not a 3-simplex (a tetrahedron has 4 vertices). Since one of its facets (`B`) is not a simplex, the 4-polytope `Pyr(Pyr₄)` is **non-simplicial**.\n\n*   **Calculate its f-vector:** The f-vector of a pyramid `P = Pyr(B)` can be calculated from the f-vector of its base `B`. The formula is `f_i(P) = f_i(B) + f_{i-1}(B)` (for `i>0`) and `f_0(P) = f_0(B) + 1`.\n\n    First, let's find the f-vector of the base, a square pyramid `B = Pyr₄`:\n    *   `f_0(B) = 5` (4 vertices for the square base, 1 apex)\n    *   `f_1(B) = 8` (4 edges on the square base, 4 slant edges connecting to the apex)\n    *   `f_2(B) = 5` (1 square face, 4 triangular faces)\n    *   We also need `f_3(B)`, which is the count of 3-dimensional faces of B. Since B is a 3-polytope, it has only one 3-face: itself. So, `f_3(B) = 1`.\n\n    Now, we apply the pyramid formula to find the f-vector of `P = Pyr(Pyr₄)`:\n    *   `f_0(P) = f_0(B) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`\n    *   `f_1(P) = f_1(B) + f_0(B) = 8 + 5 = 13`\n    *   `f_2(P) = f_2(B) + f_1(B) = 5 + 8 = 13`\n    *   `f_3(P) = f_3(B) + f_2(B) = 1 + 5 = 6`\n\n    The f-vector is `(6, 13, 13, 6)`.\n\n    As a check, we can verify the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes: `f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0`.\n    `6 - 13 + 13 - 6 = 0`. The f-vector is valid.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nBased on the known classification, there is only one combinatorial type of non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices. Therefore, this single type inherently fulfills the condition of having the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" among its class (as there are no others to compare it to).\n\nThe polytope is the pyramid over a square pyramid, and its f-vector is `(6, 13, 13, 6)`.\n\nThe final answer is the f-vector of this polytope.\n\nf-vector = `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)`\n*   `f_0` = 6\n*   `f_1` = 13\n*   `f_2` = 13\n*   `f_3` = 6\n\nFinal Answer: `(6, 13, 13, 6)`\n\n>>>(6, 13, 13, 6)"
