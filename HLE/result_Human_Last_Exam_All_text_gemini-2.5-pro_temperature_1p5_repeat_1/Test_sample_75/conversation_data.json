    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to know the duration, in years, of the \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore. The final answer must be rounded up to the nearest whole year.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\":** In StarCraft lore, the conflict commonly referred to as the Second Great War is the galaxy-wide war against the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his forces. This conflict is the central plot of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*).\n\n2.  **Identify the Start Date:** The war officially begins with the renewed Zerg Swarm's invasion of the Terran Dominion space. The first major attack occurs on the planet Mar Sara, which is the starting point of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official timeline, this event takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Identify the End Date:** The war concludes with the final and permanent defeat of Amon. This happens after the unified protoss, terran, and zerg forces pursue Amon into the Void and destroy his physical form and consciousness. This final confrontation is depicted in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void.\" These events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. Let's break down the events by year:\n    *   **2504:** The Zerg invade the Dominion, and Raynor's Raiders collect the Xel'naga artifact (*Wings of Liberty*).\n    *   **2505:** Sarah Kerrigan reclaims control of the Zerg Swarm and kills Emperor Mengsk (*Heart of the Swarm*).\n    *   **2506:** Artanis unites the Protoss, reclaims Aiur, and leads the final charge against Amon, culminating in his defeat in the Void (*Legacy of the Void* and its Epilogue).\n\n    The war spans across the entirety of these three years. The total time elapsed from the beginning of 2504 to the end of 2506 is more than two full years but not quite three full years. The duration is approximately 2.5 to 2.8 years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question explicitly states to round the duration **up** to the nearest whole year. Since the calculated duration is a value greater than 2 (e.g., 2.7 years), rounding it up to the next whole number gives us 3.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Start and End Points:** It's crucial to correctly identify the start (Zerg invasion in *Wings of Liberty*) and the end (Amon's defeat in the *Epilogue*) of the specific conflict.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\":** This instruction is key. A simple subtraction of years (2506 - 2504 = 2) would be an incorrect calculation because it doesn't account for the time elapsed *within* the start and end years, nor does it follow the rounding instruction. The conflict spans *across* three calendar years.\n*   **Official Lore:** The answer relies on the established timeline from Blizzard Entertainment's official game lore.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   War Start: 2504\n*   War End: 2506\n*   Total Duration: A period of time that spans across 3 different years, lasting more than 2 full years.\n*   Rounding Up: Any duration over 2 years, when rounded up, becomes 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
