    "This problem requires us to find the equilibrium properties of a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons, using principles from large deviation theory. The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state of a system, and large deviation theory provides a framework for understanding the probabilities of macroscopic states.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Connecting Statistical Mechanics and Large Deviation Theory**\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle:** The entropy `S` of a macrostate is related to the number of microstates `W` corresponding to it by `S = k_B ln(W)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. The equilibrium state is the macrostate that maximizes `W`, and therefore maximizes `S`.\n*   **Large Deviation Principle:** This principle states that the probability of observing a macroscopic configuration (like a specific empirical distribution or a mean value) that deviates from the most likely one decays exponentially with the number of particles/observations `N`. The probability `P` is given by `P ≈ exp[-N * I]`, where `I` is the \"rate function\".\n*   **Connecting the two:** The most probable state (equilibrium) is the one that maximizes the probability `P`. This is equivalent to minimizing the rate function `I`. Since `P` is also proportional to the number of microstates `W`, we have `exp[-N * I] ∝ W = exp[S/k_B]`. This implies that minimizing the rate function `I` is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the entropy `S`.\n*   **The Role of Theorems:**\n    *   **Sanov's Theorem** deals with the rate function for an empirical probability distribution. It connects the problem of finding the most likely distribution of particles among energy levels to maximizing an entropy-like functional.\n    *   **Cramér's Theorem** deals with the rate function for the sample mean of random variables. It establishes the Legendre-Fenchel transform relationship between the rate function (entropy) and the cumulant generating function (logarithm of the partition function), which is fundamental to the structure of thermodynamics.\n\nThe procedure to find the equilibrium values is therefore to maximize the entropy `S` for the Bose gas, subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Entropy Maximization for Bose-Einstein Statistics**\n\n1.  **System Setup:** We consider a system of photons distributed among discrete energy levels `ε_i`. Let `n_i` be the number of photons in the level `ε_i`, which has a degeneracy of `g_i` (number of states at that energy).\n2.  **Number of Microstates (W):** For bosons, the number of ways to place `n_i` indistinguishable particles into `g_i` distinguishable states is given by the stars and bars formula: `W_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! (g_i - 1)!)`. The total number of microstates for a given distribution `{n_i}` is the product over all energy levels: `W = Π_i W_i`.\n3.  **Entropy Formula:** The entropy is `S = k_B ln(W)`. Using Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x ln(x) - x`) for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy expression for a Bose gas becomes:\n    `S/k_B = Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - g_i ln(g_i) ]`\n4.  **Constraints:**\n    *   **Total Energy:** The total energy of the system is held constant at a value `E`. `Σ_i n_i ε_i = E`.\n    *   **Number of Particles:** For photons, the total number of particles is not conserved (they can be created and destroyed). This corresponds to a chemical potential `μ=0`. Therefore, we do not need a constraint on the total number of particles `N = Σ_i n_i`.\n5.  **Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize `S` subject to the energy constraint. We define the function `Φ = S/k_B - β(Σ_i n_i ε_i - E)`, where `β` is a Lagrange multiplier. To find the maximum, we set the derivative with respect to each `n_j` to zero: `∂Φ/∂n_j = 0`.\n    *   `∂(S/k_B)/∂n_j = ln(n_j + g_j) - ln(n_j) = ln((n_j + g_j)/n_j)`\n    *   `∂(-β n_j ε_j)/∂n_j = -β ε_j`\n    *   Setting the sum to zero: `ln((n_j + g_j)/n_j) - β ε_j = 0`\n6.  **Equilibrium Distribution:** Solving for `n_j`, we get:\n    *   `ln(1 + g_j/n_j) = β ε_j`\n    *   `1 + g_j/n_j = exp(β ε_j)`\n    *   The equilibrium occupation number `<n_j>` for energy level `ε_j` is: `<n_j>/g_j = 1 / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)`\n    This is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nTo find the total energy `E`, we sum the energy of all occupied states using the equilibrium distribution. For a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral over the density of states `g(ε)`.\n\n1.  **Density of States:** For photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, the number of states with energy between `ε` and `ε+dε` is `g(ε)dε = (V / (π² c³ ħ³)) ε² dε`, where `ħ = h/(2π)` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n2.  **Integral for Energy:**\n    `E = ∫_0^∞ ε <n(ε)> dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * (g(ε) / (exp(β ε) - 1)) dε`\n    `E = (V / (π² c³ ħ³)) ∫_0^∞ ε³ / (exp(β ε) - 1) dε`\n3.  **Solving the Integral:** Let `x = β ε`. The integral becomes `(1/β⁴) ∫_0^∞ x³ / (e^x - 1) dx`. This is a standard definite integral whose value is `π⁴/15`.\n4.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    `E = (V / (π² c³ ħ³)) * (π⁴ / (15 β⁴)) = (V π² / (15 c³ ħ³ β⁴))`\n    Substituting `β = 1/(k_B T)`, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation:\n    `E(T) = (V π² k_B⁴ / (15 c³ ħ³)) T⁴`\n\n**Step 4: Calculating Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nWe can find the entropy using the thermodynamic relation for the grand potential `Ω`. For a photon gas (`μ=0`), `Ω = F = E - TS`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. It is also known that for a relativistic gas like photons, `Ω = -PV = -E/3`.\n\n1.  **Relation between S, E, and Ω:**\n    `S = (E - Ω) / T`\n2.  **Substituting Ω = -E/3:**\n    `S = (E - (-E/3)) / T = (4E/3) / T`\n3.  **Equilibrium Entropy:** Now, we substitute the expression for the equilibrium energy `E(T)`:\n    `S(T) = (4 / (3T)) * [(V π² k_B⁴ / (15 c³ ħ³)) T⁴]`\n    `S(T) = (4V π² k_B⁴ / (45 c³ ħ³)) T³`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T are given by:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n    `E = (π² k_B⁴ V / (15 ħ³ c³)) T⁴`\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    `S = (4π² k_B⁴ V / (45 ħ³ c³)) T³`\n\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the volume.\n*   `T` is the equilibrium temperature.\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: E = (π²k_B⁴V / (15ħ³c³))T⁴\nEquilibrium Entropy: S = (4π²k_B⁴V / (45ħ³c³))T³\n>>>"
