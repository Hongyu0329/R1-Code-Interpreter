    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Semidihedral Group**: The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined for $n \\ge 4$. In this problem, the size is 512, which is $2^9$. So we are dealing with $G = SD_{512}$ where $n=9$.\n*   **Group Presentation**: The standard presentation for $SD_{2^n}$ is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, \\ srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $n=9$, this becomes:\n    $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, \\ srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group consists of 512 elements, which can be uniquely written as $r^i$ or $sr^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$.\n*   **Power Subgroup**: For a group $G$ and an integer $k$, the $k$-th power subgroup, denoted $G^k$, is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$.\n    $G^k = \\{ g^k \\mid g \\in G \\}$.\n    Note that this set is not always a subgroup, but for the semidihedral groups, it turns out to be. Our goal is to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ as $k$ varies over the integers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Element Orders\nThe orders of elements in $G$ are crucial.\n*   The elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ have orders that are powers of 2, up to $|r|=256$.\n*   For elements of the form $sr^i$, we calculate their square:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = (srs)r^{i-1} s r^i = ...$ this is not the most efficient way.\n    A better way is to use the relation $sr^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i$. Since $s=s^{-1}$, we have $sr^i s = (srs)^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n    So, $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = (sr^i s) r^i = r^{127i} r^i = r^{128i}$.\n    Since the order of $r$ is 256, the order of $(sr^i)^2$ is $256 / \\gcd(256, 128i) = 2/\\gcd(2,i)$.\n    - If $i$ is even, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i} = r^{256 \\cdot (i/2)} = 1$. So, elements $sr^i$ with $i$ even have order 2.\n    - If $i$ is odd, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$. The order of this element is 2. Thus, the order of $sr^i$ with $i$ odd is 4.\nThe exponent of the group $G$ (the lcm of all element orders) is 256.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Power Subgroups based on the parity of k\nWe analyze the structure of $G^k$ by considering two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n**Case 1: k is odd**\nThe exponent of $G$ is $\\exp(G) = 256$. If $k$ is odd, then $\\gcd(k, \\exp(G)) = \\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. For any finite group, if $k$ is coprime to the exponent, the mapping $\\phi: g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the group's elements. Therefore, the set of $k$-th powers is the entire group.\n$G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$.\nThis means that for any odd integer $k$, we get the same power subgroup, which is $G$ itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: k is even**\nLet $k=2m$ for some integer $m$. We compute the $k$-th power for each type of element in $G$.\n*   For an element $g = r^i \\in \\langle r \\rangle$:\n    $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n    The set of all such powers is $\\{r^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 255\\}\\}$, which forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n*   For an element $g = sr^i$:\n    $g^k = (sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m} = ((sr^i)^2)^m$.\n    From Step 2, we know $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n    So, $g^k = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im} = r^{i \\cdot 128 \\cdot (k/2)} = r^{64ik}$.\n    The set of all such powers is $\\{r^{64ik} \\mid i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 255\\}\\}$, which forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\n\nCombining these results, for an even $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the union of these two sets:\n$G^k = \\{r^{ik}\\} \\cup \\{r^{64ik}\\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\nThe union of two subgroups is a subgroup if and only if one is contained in the other. Since $64k$ is a multiple of $k$, any power of $r^{64k}$ is also a power of $r^k$. Thus, $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Distinct Subgroups for k even\nWe now need to count how many distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ exist for even integers $k$.\nThe subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle$ (of order 256) are determined by the divisors of 256. Specifically, $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ is identical to the subgroup $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$.\nSo, we need to find the number of possible values for $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ where $k$ is an even integer.\nThe divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $\\{2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8\\}$, which are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\nSince $k$ is even and 256 is even, their greatest common divisor, $d$, must also be even. This means $d$ cannot be 1.\nThe possible values for $d$ are the even divisors of 256:\n$\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\nThere are **8** such divisors. Each of these values of $d$ gives a distinct subgroup $\\langle r^d \\rangle$. For each such $d$, we can simply choose $k=d$ (which is even) to generate the subgroup. For example, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$, $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$, etc.\nThese 8 subgroups are all distinct and are different from the subgroup $G$ found in Case 1 (as they are all proper cyclic subgroups of $G$).\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBy summing the number of distinct subgroups from both cases, we get the total number of power subgroups.\n*   From odd values of $k$: 1 subgroup ($G$ itself).\n*   From even values of $k$: 8 distinct subgroups ($\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$).\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
