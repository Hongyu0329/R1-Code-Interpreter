    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide core**: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom (-C(=O)N-).\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen of the amide. So, the group at position 1 is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] is at the C3 position of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group).\n\nThe structure has two key functional groups on the benzene ring:\n1.  **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1.\n2.  **Dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at C3.\n\nThese groups will influence the reactivity of the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Lithiation)**\nThe reagents are **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)** and **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)** in **THF (tetrahydrofuran)**.\n*   **sec-BuLi**: A very strong organometallic base. Its primary function in this context is to remove a proton (deprotonate) from the most acidic position.\n*   **TMEDA**: A chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion (Li⁺). This breaks up sec-BuLi aggregates, making the base stronger and more reactive. It also plays a crucial role in directing the deprotonation.\n*   **The Reaction**: This set of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on an aromatic ring directs the strong base to remove a proton from an adjacent (ortho) position.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identifying the Directing Groups and Site of Lithiation**\n*   Both the amide (-CONEt₂) and the amino (-NMe₂) groups are effective directing groups for ortho-lithiation. They have lone pairs of electrons (on oxygen and nitrogen, respectively) that can coordinate with the Li⁺ ion of sec-BuLi.\n*   We need to determine which group is a stronger director or if they work together. The relative directing ability generally follows the order: -CONR₂ > -OMe > -NR₂. Therefore, the **N,N-diethylamide group is the primary and stronger directing group.**\n*   The primary directing group (-CONEt₂ at C1) will direct the lithiation to its ortho positions: **C2** and **C6**.\n*   Now we must compare the protons at C2 and C6. The proton at **C2** is ortho to the strong amide directing group AND ortho to the secondary dimethylamino directing group. The proton at **C6** is only ortho to the amide group.\n*   The presence of two directing groups flanking the C2 position makes the C-H bond at C2 significantly more acidic than the one at C6. This is known as a synergistic or cooperative directing effect.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Chelation Stabilization**\n*   After deprotonation at C2, the resulting aryllithium intermediate is highly stabilized. The lithium ion (Li⁺) is chelated in a stable six-membered ring formed by the carbonyl oxygen of the amide, C1, C2, C3, and the nitrogen of the amino group. This chelation provides a powerful thermodynamic driving force for the selective deprotonation at C2.\n*   So, the first step results in the formation of the intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench)**\nThe second reagent is **methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 2 is a potent nucleophile, with a highly carbanionic character at the C2 position.\n*   Methyl iodide is an excellent electrophile. The carbon atom in the methyl group is electron-deficient due to the electronegative iodine atom.\n*   **The Reaction**: The nucleophilic C2 of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic carbon of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2 type). The C-Li bond is replaced with a C-CH₃ bond, and iodide (I⁻) is the leaving group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\nThe reaction sequence results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the original molecule with a methyl group.\n*   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final Product: A methyl group is added at the C2 position.\n\nThe name of the final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### **Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n1.  **Start:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  **Step 1 (Deprotonation):** Reaction with sec-BuLi/TMEDA. This is a Directed Ortho Metalation. The amide group (-CONEt₂) is the primary director, and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) is a secondary director. The proton at C2 is ortho to both groups, making it the most acidic. Deprotonation occurs selectively at C2.\n3.  **Intermediate:** N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n4.  **Step 2 (Alkylation):** Reaction with methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic lithiated carbon at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group.\n5.  **Product:** The lithium at C2 is replaced by a methyl group. The product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
