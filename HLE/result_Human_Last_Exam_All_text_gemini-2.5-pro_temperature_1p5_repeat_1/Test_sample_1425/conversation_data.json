    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the System and the Grand Canonical Ensemble\n\n1.  **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** This ensemble describes a system in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a large reservoir. It can exchange both energy and particles with the reservoir. The state of the system is defined by temperature (T), volume (V), and chemical potential (μ).\n2.  **Partition Function (Z):** The grand canonical partition function is defined as:\n    $Z = Tr[ e^{-\\beta(H_{sys} - \\mu N)} ]$\n    where $H_{sys}$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $N$ is the particle number operator, and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n3.  **Interpreting the Hamiltonian:** The question states the system has a Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu N$. This is an unusual form for a system Hamiltonian, as it already includes the chemical potential. A literal interpretation implies we should substitute $H_{sys} = -\\mu N$ into the formula for Z.\n    $Z = Tr[ e^{-\\beta((-\\mu N) - \\mu N)} ] = Tr[ e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu N)} ] = Tr[ e^{2\\beta\\mu N} ]$\n    This means we need to evaluate the trace of the operator $e^{\\alpha N}$ with $\\alpha = 2\\beta\\mu$.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing a Model (Statistics and States)\n\n1.  **Statistics:** The problem does not specify whether the particles are bosons or fermions. However, the structure of the problem, where the energy is proportional to the number of particles, is a classic feature of systems of non-interacting particles. For a result expressed as a simple closed-form fraction, bosonic statistics (which allow any number of particles in a single state) are the most natural choice. We will proceed assuming the particles are **bosons**.\n2.  **States:** The Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu N$ has no term depending on momentum or position (like a kinetic energy term $-\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m}$). This implies that all single-particle states are degenerate. For simplicity, and because no spatial information is given, we can consider a system with only a **single quantum state** that can be occupied by the bosons. If there were $M$ such degenerate states, the final result would be raised to the power of $M$.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation using Standard Statistical Mechanics\n\nBefore using path integrals, it is useful to find the answer with standard methods to have a result to compare against.\n1.  **Trace as a Sum over States:** The trace is a sum over all states in the Fock space. For a single bosonic state, the basis states are $|n\\rangle$, representing $n$ particles in that state, for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n2.  **Eigenvalues:** The number operator $N$ acts on these states as $N|n\\rangle = n|n\\rangle$.\n3.  **Calculating Z:**\n    $Z = Tr[ e^{2\\beta\\mu N} ] = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\langle n | e^{2\\beta\\mu N} | n \\rangle$\n    $Z = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{2\\beta\\mu n} \\langle n | n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{2\\beta\\mu})^n$\n4.  **Geometric Series:** This is a geometric series with ratio $r = e^{2\\beta\\mu}$. For the sum to converge, we must have $|r| < 1$, which implies $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$, or $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, so $\\mu < 0$.\n5.  **Final Result (Standard Method):**\n    $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n### Step 4: Derivation using Path Integrals\n\nNow we derive the same result using the more formal path integral method.\n1.  **Action Formulation:** The partition function $Z = Tr[e^{-\\beta K}]$ can be written as a path integral $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$ over a complex scalar field $\\psi(\\tau)$. The imaginary-time action $S$ for a bosonic system with grand canonical operator $K = H_0 - \\mu_{eff} N$ is given by $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + H_0 - \\mu_{eff}) \\psi(\\tau)$.\n2.  **Our Specific Action:** In our case, $H_0 = 0$ and the effective chemical potential is $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\mu$. The Lagrangian operator in our exponential is $K = -2\\mu N$. The corresponding operator in the path integral action is $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$.\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(\\tau)$\n3.  **Fourier (Matsubara) Space:** We expand the field in Matsubara frequencies for bosons, $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n    $\\psi(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_n$\n    The operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes a sum over modes:\n    $S = \\sum_n \\psi_n^* (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\psi_n$\n4.  **Evaluating the Integral:** The path integral is a product of Gaussian integrals for each mode $\\psi_n$.\n    $Z \\propto \\prod_n \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu}$\n5.  **Logarithm of Z:** Taking the logarithm simplifies the product into a sum:\n    $\\ln Z = C - \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n    where C is a normalization constant.\n6.  **Matsubara Summation:** We need to evaluate the sum $S(\\mu') = \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu')$, with $\\mu' = 2\\mu$. A standard technique is to differentiate with respect to $\\mu'$, perform the simpler sum, and then integrate back.\n    $\\frac{dS}{d\\mu'} = \\sum_n \\frac{-1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu'} = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n + \\mu'}$\n    Using the standard formula for Matsubara sums, $\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_n \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - E} = -n_B(E) = -\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta E}-1}$. With $E = -\\mu'$, we get:\n    $\\sum_n \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n + \\mu'} = \\beta(-n_B(-\\mu')) = \\beta \\left( - \\frac{1}{e^{-\\beta\\mu'}-1} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu'}}$\n7.  **Integration:** Now we integrate this result with respect to $\\mu'$ to find $S(\\mu')$.\n    $S(\\mu') = \\int \\frac{\\beta}{1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu'}} d\\mu' = \\int \\frac{\\beta e^{\\beta\\mu'}}{e^{\\beta\\mu'}-1} d\\mu'$\n    Let $u = e^{\\beta\\mu'}-1$, so $du = \\beta e^{\\beta\\mu'}d\\mu'$. The integral is $\\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\ln|u| + C' = \\ln|e^{\\beta\\mu'}-1| + C'$.\n    For convergence ($\\mu<0$), we have $\\mu'<0$, so $e^{\\beta\\mu'}<1$, which means $|e^{\\beta\\mu'}-1| = 1-e^{\\beta\\mu'}$.\n    $S(\\mu') = \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu'}) + C'$\n8.  **Final Path Integral Result:** Substituting this back into the expression for $\\ln Z$:\n    $\\ln Z = C - S(2\\mu) = C - (\\ln(1-e^{2\\beta\\mu}) + C') = -\\ln(1-e^{2\\beta\\mu}) + C''$\n    Exponentiating gives $Z \\propto (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$. The normalization constant is fixed to 1.\n    $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nThis result matches the one obtained by the standard statistical mechanics method.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z for the system is given by the expression:\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis result is valid for bosons under the condition $\\mu < 0$ and assumes a single degenerate quantum state. If there were M such states, the partition function would be $Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$.\n>>>"
