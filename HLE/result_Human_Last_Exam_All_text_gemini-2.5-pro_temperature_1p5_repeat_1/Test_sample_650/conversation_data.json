    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly finding the quotient (`q`) and remainder (`a_i`) when dividing the number by `c`.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Algorithm into Basic Steps:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    *   **Step 2 (Loop):** `while q > 0, do ... od`\n    *   **Step 2.1 (Loop Body):** `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Complexity of Each Step:**\n    We assume the standard RAM model of computation, where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on integers that fit within a machine word take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Complexity of Step 1 (Initialization):**\n        This step involves a few assignments and arithmetic operations (one division, one multiplication, one subtraction). Since each of these is an `O(1)` operation, the total time for this step is constant.\n        Time(Step 1) = `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Complexity of Step 2 (The `while` loop):**\n        To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\n        a. How many times the loop runs (number of iterations).\n        b. How much work is done in each iteration.\n\n        **a. Number of Iterations:**\n        The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's see how `q` changes.\n        - Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        - In the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`.\n        - In each subsequent iteration, the value of `q` is effectively divided by `c`.\n        The process is equivalent to repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` until the result is 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until it becomes 0 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`.\n        The number of iterations is precisely `⌊log_c(n)⌋`, which is the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` minus one.\n        Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n        **b. Work per Iteration (Loop Body - Step 2.1):**\n        The loop body contains the following operations: one increment, two assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. Each of these is considered a basic operation taking constant time `O(1)`.\n        Thus, the work done in each iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n        **Total Loop Complexity:**\n        The total time spent in the loop is the (number of iterations) × (time per iteration).\n        Time(Loop) = `O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n    *   **Complexity of Step 3 (Return):**\n        Returning the result is a single operation that takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Overall Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts.\n    Total Time = Time(Step 1) + Time(Loop) + Time(Step 3)\n    Total Time = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)`\n    The dominant term in this expression is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    So, the overall complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can express `log_c(n)` in terms of a standard base like 2 or e: `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`.\n    Since `c` is a constant `c ≥ 2`, `log(c)` is also a positive constant. In Big-O notation, we can ignore constant factors.\n    Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis hinges on the assumption that basic arithmetic operations are `O(1)`. This is true for integers that fit in a computer's word size. For arbitrarily large integers (bignum arithmetic), the cost of division and multiplication would depend on the number of bits in the operands, leading to a higher complexity (typically `O((log n)^2)`). However, for a standard algorithm analysis question like this, the `O(1)` assumption for arithmetic is standard.\n*   **Input Parameters:** The complexity is a function of `n`. The base `c` affects the constant factor but not the asymptotic growth rate with respect to `n`.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** In complexity theory, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted (e.g., writing `O(log n)` instead of `O(log_2 n)` or `O(log_c n)`) because changing the base only introduces a constant factor, which is ignored by Big-O notation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The value of `q` is divided by `c` in each iteration, which means the loop runs `O(log_c n)` times. As each iteration takes constant time `O(1)`, the total time complexity is `O(log_c n)`. By the change of base rule for logarithms, this is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
