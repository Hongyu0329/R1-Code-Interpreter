    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Composition\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We first identify the atoms present:\n*   1 Carbon (C) atom\n*   3 Hydrogen (H) atoms (two from $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and one from $\\mathrm{SiH}$)\n*   1 Silicon (Si) atom\n*   1 Fluorine (F) atom\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Electrons ($N$)\nWe sum the electrons from each atom based on its atomic number:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\nThe total number of electrons is $N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Spatial Orbitals ($K$)\nThe number of spatial orbitals is equal to the total number of basis functions in the 6-31G** basis set for this molecule. We need to count the functions for each atom.\n*   **6-31G** specifies a split-valence basis set.\n*   The `**` notation indicates the addition of polarization functions: d-functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-functions on hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Basis functions per atom:**\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 2s functions.\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of 3 p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Total per H atom: $2 + 3 = 5$ basis functions.\n*   **For the Carbon (C) atom (a 2nd-row element):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 9 basis functions (1 for the 1s core, and 2 sets of functions for the 2s and 2p valence orbitals).\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n    *   Total for C atom: $9 + 6 = 15$ basis functions.\n*   **For the Fluorine (F) atom (a 2nd-row element):**\n    *   Same as Carbon, the total is 15 basis functions.\n*   **For the Silicon (Si) atom (a 3rd-row element):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 13 basis functions (5 for the 1s, 2s, 2p core, and 2 sets of functions for the 3s and 3p valence orbitals).\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Total for Si atom: $13 + 6 = 19$ basis functions.\n\n**Total number of spatial orbitals ($K$):**\nSumming the basis functions for all atoms:\n$K = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n$K = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 19) + (1 \\times 15)$\n$K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$\nSo, we have $K=64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Spin State ($S$)\nA \"full CI calculation\" for a stable, even-electron molecule like $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ usually refers to finding the ground state, which is typically a singlet state.\n*   For a singlet state, the total spin quantum number is $S=0$.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Formula for the Number of CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a system with $N$ electrons, $K$ spatial orbitals, and a total spin $S$ is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. For singlet states ($S=0$), the formula is:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1} \\binom{K}{N/2+1} $$\nWe have $N=32$ and $K=64$. Therefore, $N/2 = 16$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17} $$\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Result\nWe need to compute the binomial coefficients and then perform the final calculation. This requires a computational tool due to the large numbers involved.\n1.  **Calculate the binomial coefficients:**\n    *   $\\binom{64}{15} = 136,520,479,858,320$\n    *   $\\binom{64}{16} = 419,356,220,803,500$\n    *   $\\binom{64}{17} = 1,183,021,435,210,0800$\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    *   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (419,356,220,803,500)^2 = 175,860,011,508,241,472,250,000$\n    *   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (136,520,479,858,320) \\times (1,183,021,435,210,0800) = 161,510,410,186,915,357,984,000$\n\n3.  **Calculate the final number of CSFs:**\n    Number of CSFs = $175,860,011,508,241,472,250,000 - 161,510,410,186,915,357,984,000$\n    Number of CSFs = $14,349,601,321,326,114,266,000$\n\nThis number can be expressed in scientific notation as approximately $1.435 \\times 10^{26}$.\n\n***\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{143496013213261142660000}$.\n<<<143496013213261142660000>>>"
