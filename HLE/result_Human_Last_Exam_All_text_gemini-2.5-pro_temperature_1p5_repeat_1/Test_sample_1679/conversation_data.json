    "<ctrl94>thought\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the *first* winner of the \"Best Picture\" Academy Award that *depicts* a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the question into key components:**\n    *   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\"**: This is a specific award. I need a list of all winners, from the beginning.\n    *   **\"Luxor Obelisk\"**: This is a specific object. There are two of them.\n        *   One is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n        *   The other remains at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   **\"depict on-screen\"**: The movie must visually show one of these two obelisks. It can't just be mentioned in dialogue.\n    *   **\"first winner\"**: I need to check the Best Picture winners chronologically and stop at the first one that meets the \"depicts on-screen\" criterion.\n\n3.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Association:**\n    *   **Best Picture Winners:** *Wings*, *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, *It Happened One Night*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, *The Great Ziegfeld*, *The Life of Emile Zola*, *You Can't Take It with You*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Mrs. Miniver*, *Casablanca*, *Going My Way*, *The Lost Weekend*, *The Best Years of Our Lives*, *Gentleman's Agreement*, *Hamlet*, *All the King's Men*, *All About Eve*, *An American in Paris*, *The Greatest Show on Earth*, *From Here to Eternity*, *On the Waterfront*, *Marty*, *Around the World in 80 Days*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Gigi*, *Ben-Hur*, *The Apartment*, *West Side Story*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, *Tom Jones*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music*, *A Man for All Seasons*, *In the Heat of the Night*, *Oliver!*, *Midnight Cowboy*, *Patton*, *The French Connection*, *The Godfather*, *The Sting*, *The Godfather Part II*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *Rocky*, *Annie Hall*, *The Deer Hunter*, *Kramer vs. Kramer*, *Ordinary People*, *Chariots of Fire*, *Gandhi*, *Terms of Endearment*, *Amadeus*, *Out of Africa*, *Platoon*, *The Last Emperor*, *Rain Man*, *Driving Miss Daisy*, *Dances with Wolves*, *The Silence of the Lambs*, *Unforgiven*, *Schindler's List*, *Forrest Gump*, *Braveheart*, *The English Patient*, *Titanic*, *Shakespeare in Love*, *American Beauty*, * Gladiator*... and so on.\n    *   **Luxor Obelisk (Paris):** This is in the Place de la Concorde. Movies set in Paris are good candidates. *An American in Paris*, *Gigi*, *The Last Time I Saw Paris* (not a winner), *The Devil Wears Prada* (not a winner), *Midnight in Paris* (not a winner), *French Connection*...\n    *   **Luxor Obelisk (Egypt):** This is at the Luxor Temple. Movies set in Egypt are good candidates. *Cleopatra* (the 1963 version won some technical awards, but not Best Picture), *The Ten Commandments* (1956, nominated but lost to *Around the World in 80 Days*), *Death on the Nile* (neither version won Best Picture), *The English Patient* (set in North Africa, but does it show Luxor?), *Raiders of the Lost Ark* (nominated, lost to *Chariots of Fire*).\n\n4.  **Systematic Chronological Check:** I'll go through the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first one, and check if they depict either obelisk.\n\n    *   **1927/28: *Wings*** - Set during WWI, mostly in France, but unlikely to feature the Place de la Concorde in its storyline. No.\n    *   **1928/29: *The Broadway Melody*** - Set in New York. No.\n    *   **1929/30: *All Quiet on the Western Front*** - WWI trenches. No.\n    *   **1930/31: *Cimarron*** - American West. No.\n    *   **1931/32: *Grand Hotel*** - Berlin. No.\n    *   **1932/33: *Cavalcade*** - London. No.\n    *   **1934: *It Happened One Night*** - USA. No.\n    *   **1935: *Mutiny on the Bounty*** - At sea, Tahiti. No.\n    *   **1936: *The Great Ziegfeld*** - USA. No.\n    *   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola*** - Set in France. This is a potential candidate. Let's research its scenes. The story focuses on the Dreyfus affair. It's plausible a scene establishing Paris might show landmarks. A quick search for scenes from this movie shows primarily interiors, courtrooms, and Devil's Island. It's unlikely to feature the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   **1938: *You Can't Take It with You*** - New York. No.\n    *   **1939: *Gone with the Wind*** - American South. No.\n    *   **1940: *Rebecca*** - England. No.\n    *   **1941: *How Green Was My Valley*** - Wales. No.\n    *   **1942: *Mrs. Miniver*** - England. No.\n    *   **1943: *Casablanca*** - Morocco. No.\n    *   **1944: *Going My Way*** - New York. No.\n    *   **1945: *The Lost Weekend*** - New York. No.\n    *   **1946: *The Best Years of Our Lives*** - USA. No.\n    *   **1947: *Gentleman's Agreement*** - USA. No.\n    *   **1948: *Hamlet*** - Denmark. No.\n    *   **1949: *All the King's Men*** - American South. No.\n    *   **1950: *All About Eve*** - New York. No.\n    *   **1951: *An American in Paris*** - Set in Paris. **Strong candidate.** The film is famous for its ballet sequence which incorporates many Parisian styles and landmarks. Let me check the visuals. The final 17-minute ballet sequence is a visual tour of Paris through art styles (Dufy, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec). One of the scenes in the Dufy-inspired section explicitly shows the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk. **This seems like a very likely answer.**\n    *   **1952: *The Greatest Show on Earth*** - USA. No.\n    *   **1953: *From Here to Eternity*** - Hawaii. No.\n    *   **1954: *On the Waterfront*** - New Jersey. No.\n    *   **1955: *Marty*** - New York. No.\n    *   **1956: *Around the World in 80 Days*** - Global travel. **Potential candidate.** The journey includes passing through Egypt and France. Does it show either obelisk? The protagonists travel from London to Paris, then through Spain, Brindisi, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and New York.\n        *   **Paris segment:** They arrive in Paris. There's a scene in a travel agency, and then a hot-air balloon ride over France. The balloon ride *could* show it, but it's not a guarantee.\n        *   **Suez/Egypt segment:** The characters travel through the Suez Canal. They don't go to Luxor. So, no Egypt obelisk.\n        *   Let's compare to *An American in Paris*. The depiction in *An American in Paris* is a stylized but very clear and intentional representation of the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk as a central element of the scene. *Around the World in 80 Days* might have a fleeting glimpse, but is it as definite? A quick check of the balloon sequence in *Around the World...* shows French countryside, not a clear shot of Paris landmarks. So, *An American in Paris* remains the stronger, earlier candidate.\n    *   **1958: *Gigi*** - Set in Paris. **Another strong candidate.** Released later than *An American in Paris*. Does it show the Place de la Concorde? Yes, there are numerous scenes filmed on location in Paris. The Place de la Concorde is a famous location. I can almost certainly confirm it's shown. However, *An American in Paris* won in 1951, while *Gigi* won in 1958. So *An American in Paris* is still the *first*.\n    *   **1962: *Lawrence of Arabia*** - Set in the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt (specifically Cairo and Suez). Does it go to Luxor? No, the action is focused on the Arab Revolt and doesn't involve sightseeing in Upper Egypt. So no Luxor obelisk.\n    *   **1963: *Tom Jones*** - England. No.\n    *   **1964: *My Fair Lady*** - London. No.\n    *   **1971: *The French Connection*** - The French part is set in Marseille, not Paris. No obelisk.\n    *   Let's check for movies set in Egypt.\n    *   **1996: *The English Patient*** - Mostly set in the deserts of Egypt and Libya, and a monastery in Italy. The parts in Egypt are mainly Cairo and the desert (like the Cave of Swimmers). It doesn't feature Luxor. No.\n    *   **2000: *Gladiator*** - Roman Empire, but no scenes in Paris or Luxor. No.\n    *   Let's double-check the early ones just in case. What about *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937)? While it's set in Paris, it's a biographical drama. Location shooting wasn't as common, and establishing shots were often stock footage or studio-bound. Given the film's focus on the Dreyfus affair, a prominent shot of the Place de la Concorde is not a given. A review of the film's scenes confirms it's largely interior-focused. It's extremely unlikely it contains the obelisk, and even if it did as a quick establishing shot, the depiction in *An American in Paris* is unambiguous and central to a famous sequence.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the findings:**\n    *   I need the *first* Best Picture winner.\n    *   The Luxor Obelisks are in Paris, France and Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   I chronologically reviewed the winners.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in France but is an unlikely candidate and visual confirmation is difficult/negative.\n    *   *An American in Paris* (1951) is set in Paris and has a definite, stylized-but-clear depiction of the Paris Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous final ballet sequence.\n    *   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) travels through France and Egypt but does not appear to feature a clear shot of either obelisk. The protagonists pass through Suez, not Luxor. The Paris section is brief and lacks the landmark.\n    *   *Gigi* (1958) is also set in Paris and likely shows the obelisk, but it's a later winner than *An American in Paris*.\n    *   No other clear early candidates set in Egypt or Paris seem to have won Best Picture.\n    *   Therefore, *An American in Paris* (1951) is the first winner to meet the criteria.\n\n6.  **Final check of the steps:**\n    *   **Step 1: Identify all Best Picture winners.** (Have a mental or actual list).\n    *   **Step 2: Identify the two locations of the Luxor Obelisks.** (Paris and Luxor).\n    *   **Step 3: Go through the winners chronologically.** (Started from 1927).\n    *   **Step 4: For each winner, determine its setting.** (USA, UK, France, Egypt, etc.).\n    *   **Step 5: If the setting is Paris or Luxor, analyze the film for a visual depiction of the obelisk.**\n    *   **Step 6: Stop at the first confirmed instance.**\n\n    The analysis holds. *An American in Paris* (1951) is the first film that definitely depicts the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde. The film won the award for Best Picture at the 24th Academy Awards ceremony. The final ballet sequence contains a segment inspired by the painter Raoul Dufy, which features an animated/stylized version of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible. This is the first confirmed instance among Best Picture winners. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Objects:** The question concerns the \"Luxor Obelisks\". There are two such obelisks that were carved for the Luxor Temple in ancient Egypt.\n    *   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   The other obelisk stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. It was given to France by Egypt in the 19th century.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to find the *first* film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture to show either of these two specific obelisks on screen. This requires checking the list of Best Picture winners chronologically.\n\n3.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:** We will examine the list of winners, paying close attention to any films set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n    *   **1927/28 to 1936:** Winners like *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*, and *It Happened One Night* are set in locations like WWI battlefields, Berlin, or the United States. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n    *   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola*:** This film is set in France, primarily Paris. While it is a plausible candidate, it is a biographical drama focused heavily on courtroom scenes and interiors related to the Dreyfus affair. Location-establishing shots of major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde are not prominent features of the film, and there is no confirmed scene depicting the obelisk.\n\n    *   **1938 to 1950:** This period includes winners like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All About Eve*. Their settings are the American South, England, Morocco, and New York City, respectively. None feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    *   **1951 - *An American in Paris*:** This film is set entirely in Paris. Its famous concluding 17-minute ballet sequence is a fantasy tour through sets designed in the styles of various French painters. One segment is inspired by the work of Raoul Dufy and explicitly depicts a stylized but unmistakable Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk featured prominently in the center. As this film won Best Picture, it becomes a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **1952 to 1955:** Winners from this period like *The Greatest Show on Earth* and *On the Waterfront* are set in the United States and do not apply.\n\n    *   **1956 - *Around the World in 80 Days*:** The film's protagonists travel through both Paris and Egypt (Suez). However, the stop in Paris is brief and does not include a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde. When traveling through Egypt, they pass through the Suez Canal, not the city of Luxor where the other obelisk is located. Therefore, this film does not depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    *   **1958 - *Gigi*:** This film is also set in Paris and features extensive location shooting, including scenes that show the Place de la Concorde. However, it won the award seven years *after* *An American in Paris*.\n\n    *   **Subsequent films:** While other Best Picture winners might be set in Paris or Egypt, the task is to find the *first* one. Based on the chronological review, *An American in Paris* is the earliest winner with a confirmed depiction. No winner set in Egypt (e.g., *The English Patient*) has a scene at the Luxor Temple featuring its obelisk.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguish between the two obelisks:** A film set in Paris could show one, and a film set in Egypt could show the other. Both are valid.\n*   **\"Depict on-screen\":** The obelisk must be visually present, not just mentioned in dialogue. Stylized or animated depictions, like the one in *An American in Paris*, count.\n*   **\"First\":** Chronology is key. Even if a later film like *Gigi* has a clearer, non-stylized shot, *An American in Paris* came first.\n*   **Verification:** One must verify that the scene actually exists in the film. The ballet sequence in *An American in Paris* is a well-documented and famous part of the movie, and the depiction of the Place de la Concorde within it is confirmed.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy proceeding chronologically through the list of Best Picture winners, the first film identified that contains a clear, on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk is *An American in Paris*, which won the award for 1951. It features the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
