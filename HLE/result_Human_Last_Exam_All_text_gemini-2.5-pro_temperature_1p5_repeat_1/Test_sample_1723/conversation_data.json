    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Term \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap, gills-down, on a surface (like paper) and allowing its mature spores to fall and create a pattern. The color of this deposit is a key characteristic of the genus. Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, brown, and black.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate Common Misconceptions**\nMany people's first thought is *Lactarius indigo*. This mushroom is famous for its vibrant blue color and the blue \"milk\" or latex it exudes when cut. However, despite its strikingly blue appearance, the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is actually creamy white to yellowish. This is a critical point; the color of the mushroom's body does not determine the color of its spores. Other blue-colored mushrooms, such as some species in the genera *Entoloma* or *Cortinarius*, also do not have blue spore prints (theirs are pink and rusty-brown, respectively).\n\n**Step 3: Research the Rare Exception**\nThe question states there is a *single* genus. This implies the answer is an exception to the general rule that mushrooms do not have blue spores. Standard mycological guides for many years stated that blue was not a known spore print color. This changed with relatively recent discoveries.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Genus**\nResearch into recent mycological literature reveals that scientists have discovered species that produce a genuinely blue spore print. These species belong to the genus *Lactifluus*. This genus is closely related to *Lactarius* (both are known as \"milk-caps\"), but was segregated into its own genus.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with Specific Species**\nThe discovery was a significant event in the world of mycology. Species within *Lactifluus*, such as *Lactifluus virescens* from Japan and the more recently described *Lactifluus atrovelutinus* and *Lactifluus lavendulospongiosus* from China, are confirmed to be the first and only known mushrooms to produce a distinctly blue spore deposit.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on these findings, the single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Lactifluus*.\n\n<<<Lactifluus>>>"
