    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Factor the polynomial.**\n    Let $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find factors. Let's try to see if it can be factored by grouping terms that have a common factor.\n    Notice that $x^5 - 9x + 3$ doesn't have obvious rational roots. Let's try to see if $f(x)$ is divisible by some simple polynomial. A good candidate might be related to the coefficients. We can see pairs of coefficients with a ratio of $-2$. For instance, $(3, -6)$ and $(18, -9)$... no that doesn't seem to work.\n    Let's try regrouping the terms in a different way:\n    $f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    $f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n    So, the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials: $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the splitting field and Galois group of each factor.**\n    *   For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. The degree of this extension is $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    *   For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:\n        *   **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $p^2=9$. Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n        *   **Galois Group:** Let $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$. Since $h(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, $G_h$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$.\n        *   To determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots. We analyze the derivative: $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, so $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        *   Let $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. $h(x_0) = x_0^5 - 9x_0 + 3 = x_0(x_0^4 - 9) + 3 = x_0(9/5 - 9) + 3 = - \\frac{36}{5} x_0 + 3$. Since $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > \\sqrt[4]{(15/36)^4} = 15/36$, we have $h(x_0) < 0$.\n        *   Let $x_1 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. $h(x_1) = (-x_0)^5 - 9(-x_0) + 3 = -x_0^5 + 9x_0 + 3 = -h(x_0) + 6$. Since $h(x_0)$ is negative, $h(x_1)$ is positive.\n        *   Since there is a positive local maximum and a negative local minimum, $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots. The remaining two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\n        *   A standard theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so $G_h \\cong S_5$.\n        *   The degree of the extension is $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the splitting field K and its Galois group G.**\n    $K$ is the compositum of $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_h(\\sqrt{2}) : K_h][K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[K_h(\\sqrt{2}) : K_h]$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\sqrt{2} \\in K_h$.\n    A splitting field with Galois group $S_n$ (for $n \\ge 3$) has a unique quadratic subfield, namely $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial.\n    The discriminant of $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$ is $D = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5 < 0$. So $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\n    Since $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{2} \\notin K_h$.\n    This implies $[K_h(\\sqrt{2}) : K_h] = 2$.\n    The total degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n    Since $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ are both Galois extensions and their intersection is $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of their Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\n4.  **Find the degrees of proper normal subfields.**\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of such an extension is $[L : \\mathbb{Q}] = [G : H] = |G|/|H|$.\n    We need to find the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n    Let's list the normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$:\n    a.  $H_1 = \\{(e, e)\\}$ (trivial subgroup). Index $[G:H_1] = 240$. This corresponds to $L=K$.\n    b.  $H_2 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ (the center of G). $|H_2| = 2$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    c.  $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$ (the commutator subgroup of G is $[C_2,C_2]\\times[S_5,S_5]=\\{e\\}\\times A_5$). $|H_3| = 60$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    d.  $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    e.  $H_5 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_5| = 120$. Index $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    f.  $H_6 = \\ker(\\phi)$, where $\\phi: C_2 \\times S_5 \\to C_2$ is the homomorphism defined by $\\phi(c, \\sigma) = c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$ (using multiplicative notation for $C_2=\\{-1,1\\}$). This is another normal subgroup of index 2. $|H_6| = 120$. Index $[G:H_6] = 2$.\n    g.  $H_7 = C_2 \\times S_5$ (the whole group). Index $[G:H_7] = 1$. This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n5.  **List the possible degrees.**\n    The question asks for the degrees of normal extensions $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. This means we must exclude the cases corresponding to the trivial subgroup ($L=K$) and the whole group ($L=\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    We look at the indices of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups: $H_2, H_3, H_4, H_5, H_6$.\n    The indices are:\n    *   Index of $H_2$ is 120.\n    *   Index of $H_3$ is 4.\n    *   Index of $H_4$ is 2.\n    *   Index of $H_5$ is 2.\n    *   Index of $H_6$ is 2.\n    The set of distinct possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
