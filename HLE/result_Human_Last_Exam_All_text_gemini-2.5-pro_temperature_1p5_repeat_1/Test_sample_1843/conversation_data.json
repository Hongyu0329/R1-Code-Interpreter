    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nSo, any character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the condition of primitivity\nA character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive with conductor $N = \\prod p^k$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive for its corresponding modulus $p^k$.\n\n*   $\\chi_4$ must be a primitive character modulo 4.\n*   $\\chi_9$ must be a primitive character modulo 9.\n*   $\\chi_7$ must be a primitive character modulo 7.\n*   $\\chi_{11}$ must be a primitive character modulo 11.\n*   $\\chi_{13}$ must be a primitive character modulo 13.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the order condition\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_9), o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{11}), o(\\chi_{13}))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$. So, we need:\n$\\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_9), o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{11}), o(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $o(\\chi_{p^k})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid choices for each component character\nWe need to count the number of primitive characters for each modulus $p^k$ whose order divides 6. Let $\\phi(d)$ be the number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group whose order is a multiple of $d$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$ (mod 4):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$ has $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The only non-primitive character is the principal character (conductor 1). Thus, there is $\\phi(4)-1 = 1$ primitive character. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (and its order is 2).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_9$ (mod 9):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$ has $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The characters induced from modulo 3 are not primitive mod 9. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters (of orders 1 and 2). The remaining $6-2=4$ characters are primitive mod 9. Their orders must be divisors of 6 but not 1 or 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both 3 and 6 divide 6. So all 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$. (These have orders 3 or 6).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_7$ (mod 7):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    All these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$ (mod 11):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, 10.\n    *   The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (and its order is 2).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$ (mod 13):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    *   The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results and finalize the count\n\nWe have found the number of valid choices for each primitive component, such that each component's order divides 6. Let's verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for any combination of these choices.\n\nThe order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is $o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n1.  From our choices, every component order $o_{p^k}$ divides 6. Therefore, their lcm must also divide 6.\n2.  The choice for $\\chi_4$ has order $o_4=2$. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n3.  The choices for $\\chi_9$ have orders $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nA number that is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3 must be a multiple of 6.\nSince the order must be a divisor of 6 and a multiple of 6, the order must be exactly 6.\nTherefore, any combination of our valid component choices will result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$\n\nThus, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
