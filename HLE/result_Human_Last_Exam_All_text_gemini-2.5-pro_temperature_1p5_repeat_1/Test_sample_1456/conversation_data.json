    "This problem asks for the maximum number of a specific topological feature, called a composant, in the product space of two continua. Let's break down the concepts and the reasoning.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or a square.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` is the Cartesian product of the sets `X` and `Y` equipped with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum `Z` is a subset of `Z` which is itself a continuum. It is *proper* if it is not equal to `Z`.\n*   **Composant:** For any point `p` in a continuum `Z`, the composant of `Z` containing `p` is the set of all points `q` in `Z` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `Z` containing both `p` and `q`. The set of composants forms a partition of the space `Z`.\n\n### Step 2: The Number of Composants of a Continuum\n\nA crucial theorem in continuum theory connects the number of composants to the concept of decomposability.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `Z` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `Z = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `Z`.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\n**The Theorem:**\n1.  A continuum is **decomposable** if and only if it has exactly **one** composant (which is the space itself).\n2.  A continuum is **indecomposable** if and only if it has **uncountably many** composants. The cardinality of this set of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThis theorem simplifies our problem: finding the largest possible number of composants in `X × Y` is equivalent to determining if `X × Y` can be an indecomposable continuum. If it can, the maximum number of composants is `c`. If it must always be decomposable, the maximum number is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Product Space `X × Y`\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X × Y`. We want to find the number of composants of `Z`.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary pair of points in `Z`, say `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` and `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)`. To check if they belong to the same composant, we need to find a proper subcontinuum of `Z` that contains both of them.\n\nConsider the following two subsets of `Z`:\n*   `A = X × {y_1}` (a \"horizontal\" slice)\n*   `B = {x_2} × Y` (a \"vertical\" slice)\n\nSince `X` and `Y` are continua, `A` (which is homeomorphic to `X`) and `B` (homeomorphic to `Y`) are also continua. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, `A` and `B` are proper subsets of `Z`, making them proper subcontinua.\n\nNow, let's form the union `K = A ∪ B = (X × {y_1}) ∪ ({x_2} × Y)`.\n*   `K` is the union of two continua, `A` and `B`.\n*   The intersection of `A` and `B` is the point `(x_2, y_1)`, which is non-empty.\n*   The union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is a continuum. So, `K` is a subcontinuum of `Z`.\n*   Is `K` a proper subcontinuum? Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, we can choose a point `x' ∈ X` such that `x' ≠ x_2` and a point `y' ∈ Y` such that `y' ≠ y_1`. The point `(x', y')` is in `Z` but is not in `K`. Therefore, `K` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n*   Does `K` contain our original points `p_1` and `p_2`?\n    *   `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` is in `A = X × {y_1}`, so `p_1 ∈ K`.\n    *   `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)` is in `B = {x_2} × Y`, so `p_2 ∈ K`.\n\nThis argument shows that for any two points in `Z`, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing them. This means that all points of `Z` lie in the same composant. Therefore, `Z` has only one composant.\n\n### Step 4: A Subtle Point and the Final Conclusion\n\nThe argument in Step 3 seems to prove that the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable and thus always has exactly one composant. This argument is indeed very compelling and was even published in a mathematics journal (by J.J. Charatonik in 1994).\n\nHowever, it is now known in the field of topology that this simple proof has a subtle flaw, and the conclusion is incorrect. There is an active area of research into finding conditions under which the product of indecomposable continua is itself indecomposable. In the late 20th century, topologist W. T. Ingram constructed a specific (and very complex) indecomposable continuum `M` such that the product `M × M` is also indecomposable.\n\n*   Since `M` is a nondegenerate continuum, `M × M` is an example of a product of two nondegenerate continua.\n*   Since `M × M` is indecomposable, it has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants can be `c`. We also know that the number of composants can be 1 (for example, the product `[0,1] × [0,1]` is a square, which is decomposable). The set of possible numbers of composants for such a product is `{1, c}`.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number**. Comparing 1 and `c`, the largest is `c`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum."
