    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric object**: The object is the \"great icosahedron\". This is one of the four non-convex regular polyhedra known as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n\n2.  **Determine the \"outer-hull\"**: The \"outer-hull\" is another term for the \"convex hull\". The convex hull of a set of points (or a geometric shape) is the smallest convex set that contains all the points. For the great icosahedron, its 12 vertices are arranged in the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Understand the task**: The task is to \"triangulate\" the surface of this outer-hull (the regular icosahedron). A triangulation of a surface is a decomposition of that surface into a set of triangles. The question asks for the \"minimal number\" of triangles required for this.\n\n4.  **Analyze the surface of the outer-hull**: The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. By its very definition, a regular icosahedron is a polyhedron made up of 20 faces, and each of these faces is an equilateral triangle.\n\n5.  **Find the minimal triangulation**: Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already composed entirely of triangles, these 20 faces themselves constitute a valid triangulation of the surface. To ask for the \"minimal number\" of triangles implies we should not subdivide these faces further. Any attempt to use fewer than 20 triangles would fail to accurately represent the polyhedral shape of the icosahedron. Thus, the minimal number of triangles in the triangulation is simply the number of faces of the icosahedron.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. These 20 faces form the minimal triangulation of its surface.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Great Icosahedron vs. Regular Icosahedron**: It is crucial not to confuse the great icosahedron (a self-intersecting star polyhedron) with its convex hull, the regular icosahedron (a convex polyhedron). The question is about the hull, not the original star polyhedron.\n*   **Meaning of \"Triangulation\"**: For a surface already composed of triangles, the most basic and minimal triangulation is the set of those triangles themselves. A \"refinement\" of the triangulation would involve adding more vertices and edges, thus increasing the number of triangles.\n*   **\"Visible from the outside\"**: This phrase reinforces that we are concerned with the external surface of the convex hull, not the internal, self-intersecting structure of the great icosahedron.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of the regular icosahedron (the outer-hull of the great icosahedron) is its number of faces. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
