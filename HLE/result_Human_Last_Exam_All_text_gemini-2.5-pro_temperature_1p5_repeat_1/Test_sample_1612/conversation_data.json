    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of \"Triple Crown\"\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand that in Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two different types of Triple Crowns: one for batting and one for pitching. The question does not specify which one, so we will analyze both. However, the batting Triple Crown is significantly more famous and is usually what is meant when the term is used without qualification.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season: **Batting Average (BA)**, **Home Runs (HR)**, and **Runs Batted In (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their respective league in three key pitching categories in the same season: **Wins (W)**, **Strikeouts (K)**, and **Earned Run Average (ERA)**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\n\nThis is the most prestigious and rare of the two honors. We will list the players who have achieved this feat to find our total.\n\n*   Paul Hines (1878)\n*   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n*   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n*   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n*   Ty Cobb (1909)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925) - Won twice\n*   Chuck Klein (1933)\n*   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n*   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n*   Joe Medwick (1937)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947) - Won twice\n*   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n*   Frank Robinson (1966)\n*   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n*   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n**Careful Points & Calculation:**\n1.  **Count the Instances:** Counting every time the feat was accomplished, we find there have been **17** batting Triple Crown seasons.\n2.  **Count the Unique Winners:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which typically means the number of unique individuals. Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the award twice. Therefore, to find the number of unique players, we count each player only once.\n3.  **The List of Unique Players:** Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Chuck Klein, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Joe Medwick, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, and Miguel Cabrera.\n4.  **Final Count for Batting Winners:** Counting the names in the list above gives us a total of **15** unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners (for completeness)\n\nWhile less commonly discussed, the pitching Triple Crown is also a remarkable achievement.\n\n**Careful Points & Calculation:**\n1.  **More Frequent:** The pitching Triple Crown has been achieved more often than the batting one. It has been won **39 times** in MLB history.\n2.  **Unique Winners:** These 39 wins were accomplished by **27 different pitchers**. Famous winners include legends like Walter Johnson (3 times), Sandy Koufax (3 times), Roger Clemens (2 times), and recent winners like Justin Verlander and Clayton Kershaw (both in 2011) and Shane Bieber (in 2020).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nGiven that the term \"Triple Crown winner\" in baseball conversation almost always refers to the batting Triple Crown, the most direct and accurate answer to the user's question is the number of unique batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n*   Number of times the batting Triple Crown has been won: 17\n*   Number of unique players (winners) who have won the batting Triple Crown: **15**\n\n<<<15>>>"
