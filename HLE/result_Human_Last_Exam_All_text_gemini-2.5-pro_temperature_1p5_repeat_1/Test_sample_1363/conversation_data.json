    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify the dance in which it is \"impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\" Let's break down the key terms:\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in Ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the amount prescribed by the standard syllabus for that figure.\n*   **Impossible... without disregarding the technique:** This is the most crucial part. It means that the fundamental technical principles of the dance's reverse turn intrinsically prevent additional rotation. In other dances, you might be able to add more turn (even if it's considered poor form or non-syllabus), but in this specific dance, doing so would require breaking the core rules of how the figure is constructed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Technique of the Reverse Turn in Each Dance**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This is a rotary dance with continuous turning. The Reverse Turn covers 360 degrees over six steps. While a specific amount of turn is ideal for flow and progression down the floor, the technique is based on momentum and swing. It is physically possible to over-rotate, although it would disrupt the rhythm and timing, making it very difficult but not technically \"impossible\" in the sense of violating a fundamental structural rule.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot & E. Quickstep:** These three are \"swing\" dances. The technique for turns relies heavily on concepts like Contra Body Movement (CBM), body sway, rise and fall, and footwork that involves pivoting and rotating over the feet (e.g., heel turns). This mechanism is fluid and allows for variations in the amount of turn. A dancer can use more body rotation or a stronger pivot to \"overturn\" a figure. This is often done in advanced or open choreography to change alignment on the dance floor. So, while a syllabus reverse turn has a set amount of rotation, the underlying technique of swing does not make it impossible to turn more.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The technique of Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat and grounded.\n    *   **No Body Sway:** The frame is kept strong and still.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and punctuated.\n    *   **Walking Action:** Dancers \"walk\" into steps rather than swinging.\n    *   **The Basic Reverse Turn Technique:** The most standard Tango Reverse Turn (often called the Basic Reverse Turn or Closed Reverse Turn) has a very specific construction. For the leader, a key step is Step 3, which is \"Left foot closes to Right foot.\" This \"close\" action, where the feet come together, mechanically completes and stops the turn for that part of the figure. To turn *more* than the prescribed amount, the leader would have to avoid closing the feet. They would need to cross their feet or perform a pivot instead. This would not be \"overturning\" the Reverse Turn; it would be performing a completely different figure and thereby \"disregarding the technique\" of the Basic Reverse Turn itself. The closing of the feet is a hard stop that defines the figure's rotation limit.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning is a matter of *modifying* the amount of swing and rotation, which the technique allows for. In Tango, the technique of the Basic Reverse Turn includes a \"close\" which acts as a structural limit to the turn. To exceed this limit, one must break the structure of the figure itself. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Basic Reverse Turn without disregarding its defining technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
