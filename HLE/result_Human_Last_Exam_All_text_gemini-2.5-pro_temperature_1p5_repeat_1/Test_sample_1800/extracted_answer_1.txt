There is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes performance for both reactions, as the optimal ratio is highly dependent on the specific catalytic process. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a moderate molar Ni/Ce ratio, typically in the range of 0.2 to 0.5, is ideal to maximize activity while minimizing side reactions like methanation. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a much lower molar Ni/Ce ratio, around 0.05 to 0.15, is optimal to act as a surface promoter for hydrogen evolution without deactivating the bulk Ceria at high temperatures.
