    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length and output -1, 1, or 0. The main constraint is to devise the \"most memory-efficient C program\" and calculate the total memory `m` in bytes used for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\n*   **Input**: Two strings of equal length (1 to 100 characters), consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Each string is on a new line.\n*   **Task**: Compare them lexicographically.\n*   **Comparison Rule**: Case-insensitive. 'a' is equivalent to 'A'.\n*   **Output**:\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger.\n    *   \"0\" if they are equal.\n*   **Constraint**: Find the solution with the minimum memory footprint for its variables and calculate this memory amount, `m`.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: This is the primary goal. We must choose data structures and types to minimize memory usage. This involves avoiding unnecessary storage and selecting the smallest possible data types for variables.\n2.  **Input Handling**: The two strings are on separate lines. Input from `stdin` is a single sequential stream. This means we cannot read one character from the first line, then one from the second, and so on. We must read the entire first line before we can start reading the second.\n3.  **String Storage**: Because of the sequential nature of `stdin`, we must store the first string in memory to have it available for comparison while reading the second string. Therefore, at least one buffer array is required. A \"most memory-efficient\" solution would avoid storing the second string.\n4.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: The comparison `char_1` vs `char_2` must be done after converting both to a common case (e.g., lowercase). The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this.\n5.  **Data Type Sizes**: The calculation of memory usage depends on the size of the data types. In C, `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte. For other types like `int`, `short`, and pointers, the size is platform-dependent. We will assume a typical environment found in competitive programming (e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit system where `sizeof(int) = 4` and `sizeof(short) = 2`).\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Devise the Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm\n\n1.  **Storing the First String**: We must read and store the first string. The maximum length is 100, so we need a character array of size 101 to accommodate the string and the null terminator (`\\0`). Thus, we declare `char str1[101];`.\n2.  **Reading the First String**: `scanf(\"%s\", str1);` is an efficient way to read the first string. It will stop at the first whitespace character, which will be the newline (`\\n`) at the end of the first line.\n3.  **Handling the Newline**: The `\\n` character remains in the input buffer. Before we read the second string, we must consume this character. A call to `getchar();` will accomplish this.\n4.  **Processing the Second String**: We can read the second string character by character using `getchar()` in a loop and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character in our stored `str1`. This avoids allocating a second buffer for the second string.\n5.  **Iteration and Comparison**: We need a loop to iterate through the characters.\n    *   An index variable is needed to access `str1[i]`. Since the string length is at most 100, the index `i` will range from 0 to 99. The most memory-efficient data type for this index is `unsigned char`, which uses only 1 byte and can hold values from 0 to 255.\n    *   We need a variable to hold the character read from the second string via `getchar()`. Since `getchar()` returns `int` to be able to represent `EOF` in addition to all character values, this variable must be of type `int`.\n    *   The loop continues until we read a newline or `EOF`. Inside the loop, we perform the case-insensitive comparison `tolower(str1[i])` vs `tolower(char_from_second_string)`.\n    *   If a difference is found, we print the result (`-1` or `1`) and exit immediately.\n6.  **Handling Equality**: If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal, and we print `0`.\n\n#### C Program Variable Memory Calculation\nBased on the algorithm above, the necessary variables declared within the `main` function are:\n\n1.  **First String Buffer**: `char str1[101];`\n    *   Size of `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop Index**: `unsigned char i;`\n    *   As reasoned above, `unsigned char` is the smallest possible type for an index from 0 to 99.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Character from Second String**: `int c;`\n    *   This variable must be `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` value returned by `getchar()`.\n    *   We assume `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, which is standard on most competitive programming platforms.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n#### Total Memory Calculation\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this problem is the sum of the memory used by these three variables.\n\n`m` = (memory for `str1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c`)\n`m` = 101 + 1 + 4\n`m` = **106 bytes**\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem under standard C language and platform conventions. Using two arrays (`char str1[101], str2[101]`) would be simpler to code but would use `101 + 101 + 1 = 203` bytes (if using an `unsigned char` index), which is significantly less memory-efficient.\n\n<<<106>>>"
