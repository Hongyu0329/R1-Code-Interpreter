    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Qudit and a Pauli Channel\n\nA **qudit** is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{kl}\\}_{k,l=0}^{d-1}$ form a basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$. There are $d^2$ such operators. They are unitary and orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_{k'l'}^\\dagger U_{kl}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kk'}\\delta_{ll'}$.\n\nA **Pauli channel** $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ can be written as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{kl} U_{kl} \\rho U_{kl}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{kl}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{kl} \\ge 0$ for all $k,l$ and $\\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{kl} = 1$. The operators $E_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl}$ are the Kraus operators for this channel. They satisfy the trace-preserving condition $\\sum_{k,l} E_{kl}^\\dagger E_{kl} = I$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Rank of a Quantum Channel and the Complementary Channel\n\nThe **rank** of a quantum channel $\\Lambda$, denoted $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$, is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$. The Choi matrix is given by $J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}|i\\rangle|i\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state. An equivalent definition for the rank is the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel. This is also equal to the dimension of the linear space spanned by the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nFor any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ described by a set of Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$, there exists a **complementary channel** $\\Lambda^c$. If $\\Lambda$ describes the evolution of the system, $\\Lambda^c$ describes the state of the environment that the system interacted with.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Rank of a Channel to Its Complementary Channel\n\nA fundamental theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of a quantum channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) $$\nThis theorem holds for any quantum channel. A sketch of the proof relies on showing that the Choi matrices of both channels, $J(\\Lambda)$ and $J(\\Lambda^c)$, are partial traces of the same pure state constructed from the channel's Stinespring isometry. The property that their ranks are equal follows from this construction.\n\n### Step 4: Rephrase the Problem\n\nUsing the theorem from Step 3, the question \"What is the maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$?\" becomes equivalent to \"What is the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$?\"\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible rank over the set of all possible Pauli channels, which means we can choose the probability distribution $\\{p_{kl}\\}$ to maximize the rank.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Maximal Rank of a Pauli Channel\n\nThe rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators $\\{E_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl}\\}$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{\\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl} \\mid k,l \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}\\}) $$\nSince $\\sqrt{p_{kl}}$ are just scalar coefficients, the rank is the number of linearly independent operators $U_{kl}$ for which $p_{kl} > 0$.\n\nThe crucial property of the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{kl}\\}$ is that they are a set of $d^2$ linearly independent operators. In fact, they form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose the probability distribution $\\{p_{kl}\\}$ to have the maximum number of non-zero entries. We can choose $p_{kl} > 0$ for all $d^2$ pairs of indices $(k,l)$. For example, we can choose the uniform distribution $p_{kl} = 1/d^2$ for all $k,l$. This corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel.\n\nWith this choice, the set of Kraus operators is $\\{ \\frac{1}{d} U_{kl} \\}_{k,l=0}^{d-1}$. Since all $d^2$ operators $U_{kl}$ are linearly independent, the dimension of the space they span is $d^2$.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nSince the maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$, and the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the rank of $\\Lambda$, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is also $d^2$.\n\nThis value, $d^2$, is the maximum possible rank for any quantum channel mapping $d \\times d$ matrices to $d \\times d$ matrices."
