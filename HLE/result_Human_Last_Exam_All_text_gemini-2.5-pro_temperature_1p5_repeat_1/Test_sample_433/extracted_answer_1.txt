According to USP <797> guidelines, once a single-dose ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed. Therefore, it must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no allowable storage time or extended BUD for an opened ampule, even when handled in a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment.
