    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date.**\nFirst, we need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*, died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's known movements around that date.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to consult historical records of his life, which are primarily official documents recording payments, commissions, and travel licenses.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the evidence from 1368.**\n*   **July 17, 1368:** A record in the *Issue Rolls* (records of royal payments) shows that King Edward III granted Chaucer a license \"to pass the sea from Dover\". This indicates that Chaucer was sent abroad on some form of official business around mid-1368.\n*   **October 25, 1368:** Another record shows that Chaucer was present in person in London to receive his semi-annual payment for an annuity granted to him by the king.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the evidence to create a timeline.**\nFrom these records, we can conclude that Chaucer left England sometime after July 17, 1368, and returned before October 25, 1368. Blanche of Lancaster's death on September 12 falls squarely within this period when Chaucer was traveling abroad. This allows us to confidently rule out England (C) and Scotland (E) as his location.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the specific location abroad.**\nThis is the most careful and crucial point. The historical records, including the travel license, do **not** specify Chaucer's destination. Scholars have put forward several theories:\n*   **France (B):** A diplomatic mission to France was a common task for Chaucer, making this a plausible destination.\n*   **Italy (A):** Some scholars speculate he may have traveled to Milan for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (one of King Edward III's sons), to Violante Visconti. This is a strong theory but lacks definitive proof.\n*   The fundamental issue is that no surviving document confirms his exact itinerary or location on the specific date of September 12, 1368.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the answer choices based on the evidence.**\n*   A. Italy: Possible, but not proven. It is a scholarly theory.\n*   B. France: Possible, but not proven. It is also a scholarly theory.\n*   C. England: Incorrect. Records show he was abroad.\n*   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no evidence he was in Scotland.\n*   D. Unknown: This is the most accurate and intellectually honest answer. While we know he was on the European continent, his specific country and city on that date are not recorded and remain a subject of scholarly debate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the available historical evidence, Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent when Blanche of Lancaster died. However, the exact country he was in is not definitively known from the records. Therefore, his precise location is unknown.\n\n<<<D>>>"
