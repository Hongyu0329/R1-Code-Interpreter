    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of integral quadratic forms and the classification of lattices. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    We are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices `L` that satisfy the following four properties:\n    *   `L` is positive definite: The quadratic form `Q(x)` associated with the lattice is positive for all non-zero vectors `x`. This means the signature is `(n, 0)`.\n    *   `L` is an even lattice: `Q(x)` is an even integer for all `x` in `L`. This implies that the diagonal entries of any Gram matrix for `L` are even integers.\n    *   The dimension of `L` is `n = 17`.\n    *   The determinant of `L` is `det(L) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Genus of the Lattice:**\n    A set of lattices sharing certain local properties (isomorphism over `Z_p` for all primes `p`) form a *genus*. The properties given (dimension, signature, determinant, and being even) are enough to constrain the possibilities for the genus.\n    *   **Signature:** Since `L` is positive definite and `n=17`, the signature `(n_+, n_-)` is `(17, 0)`. The signature invariant `n_+ - n_-` is `17`.\n    *   **Discriminant Group:** The discriminant group `L^\\# / L` is a finite abelian group of order `det(L) = 2`. Thus, `L^\\# / L \\cong Z/2Z`.\n    *   **Discriminant Form:** This group is equipped with a quadratic form `q_L: L^\\# / L -> Q/2Z`. The properties of this form determine the 2-adic structure of the lattice.\n    *   **Signature Formula (Milgram):** A fundamental theorem states that `n_+ - n_-` must be congruent to the signature of the discriminant form `q_L` modulo 8.\n        *   We have `n_+ - n_- = 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8`.\n        *   Therefore, the signature of the discriminant form `q_L` must be congruent to 1 modulo 8.\n    *   There are four possible non-isomorphic discriminant forms on the group `Z/2Z`. These forms have signatures `1, 7, 2, 6` (modulo 8).\n    *   Our condition `signature(q_L) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8` uniquely specifies which of the four possible discriminant forms `L` must have.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All lattices satisfying the given conditions belong to a single genus, denoted `II_{17,0}(2_1)` (Type II, signature (17,0), with the specific discriminant form of determinant 2 and signature 1).\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Classes in the Genus (Class Number):**\n    The question is now to find the number of distinct isomorphism classes within this specific genus. For positive definite lattices, a genus can contain multiple classes.\n    *   **Kneser's Result:** A key result in the theory, attributed to Martin Kneser (and mentioned in standard references like Conway and Sloane's \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\"), provides a complete answer for this specific case. The result states that for any even, positive definite lattice `L` of determinant 2 and dimension `n \\le 25`, `L` must be decomposable in the form `L \\cong A_1 \\oplus M` for some lattice `M`.\n    *   The lattice `A_1` is the 1-dimensional root lattice with Gram matrix `(2)`. It is even, positive definite, has `dim(A_1) = 1` and `det(A_1) = 2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Component Lattice `M`:**\n    Given the decomposition `L \\cong A_1 \\oplus M` and the properties of `L`, we can deduce the properties of `M`.\n    *   **Dimension:** `dim(L) = dim(A_1) + dim(M) \\Rightarrow 17 = 1 + dim(M) \\Rightarrow dim(M) = 16`.\n    *   **Determinant:** `det(L) = det(A_1) * det(M) \\Rightarrow 2 = 2 * det(M) \\Rightarrow det(M) = 1`. A lattice with determinant 1 is called unimodular.\n    *   **Type:** Since `L` is an even lattice and `A_1` is an even lattice, for their direct sum to be even, `M` must also be an even lattice.\n    *   **Definiteness:** Since `L` is positive definite and `A_1` is positive definite, `M` must also be positive definite.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The lattice `M` must be a **positive definite even unimodular lattice of dimension 16**.\n\n5.  **Count the Possibilities for `M`:**\n    The problem has now been reduced to counting the number of such lattices `M`. The classification of positive definite even unimodular lattices is a classic result in mathematics.\n    *   Such lattices only exist in dimensions that are multiples of 8. Dimension 16 is a multiple of 8.\n    *   In dimension 8, there is exactly one such lattice: the `E_8` root lattice.\n    *   In dimension 16, there are exactly **two** such non-isomorphic lattices:\n        1.  `E_8 \\oplus E_8`: The direct sum of two `E_8` lattices.\n        2.  `D_{16}^+` (also known as the Barnes-Wall lattice `BW_{16}` or `\\Lambda_{16}`): An indecomposable lattice constructed from the `D_{16}` root lattice.\n\n6.  **Final Count:**\n    Each of the two possible lattices for `M` gives a distinct lattice `L` that satisfies the conditions.\n    1.  `L_1 = A_1 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus E_8)`\n    2.  `L_2 = A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+`\n    These two lattices, `L_1` and `L_2`, are not isomorphic because their indecomposable components are different (`E_8 \\oplus E_8` is not isomorphic to `D_{16}^+`). Kneser's result guarantees that there are no other possibilities (e.g., an indecomposable lattice of dimension 17).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 2 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   The distinction between a *genus* and an *isomorphism class* is crucial. A genus is a local property, while a class is a global one. The number of classes in a genus is the *class number*.\n*   The signature formula is a powerful constraint that limits the possible genera.\n*   The solution hinges on a deep classification result from the literature (Kneser's decomposability theorem for this specific type of lattice). Without this, the problem would be extremely difficult.\n*   Knowledge of the classification of even unimodular lattices is also required to find the number of possibilities for the component `M`.\n*   Confirming that the resulting lattices `L_1` and `L_2` are indeed non-isomorphic is the final check. This is clear because their indecomposable components differ.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation: The number of lattices is equal to the number of possible `M` components. The number of positive definite even unimodular lattices of dimension 16 is 2. Thus, the final answer is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
