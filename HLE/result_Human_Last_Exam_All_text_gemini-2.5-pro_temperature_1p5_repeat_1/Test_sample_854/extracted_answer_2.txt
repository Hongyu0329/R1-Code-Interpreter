The laboratory's mistake was in using an inappropriate organism for their Quality Control (QC) check. They used *Bacillus subtilis* to test the effectiveness of the antibiotic chloramphenicol in the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). However, *Bacillus subtilis* is a bacterium that is naturally resistant to chloramphenicol.

Therefore, when they plated *B. subtilis* on the PDA from Batch 3 and observed no growth, they incorrectly concluded that the antibiotic was active and inhibiting the bacteria. In reality, the *B. subtilis* failed to grow simply because it is resistant, and this result would have occurred even if no antibiotic were present at all.

This flawed QC test was incapable of detecting the actual problem with Batch 3: that the chloramphenicol had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. The lab trusted this meaningless "passing" result as evidence that the batch was safe to use.
