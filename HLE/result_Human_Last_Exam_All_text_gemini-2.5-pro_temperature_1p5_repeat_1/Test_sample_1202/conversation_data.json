    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\n\nThe question asks to identify the primary mechanism responsible for two key outcomes following a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** How are both copies of the duplicated gene kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding being lost or silenced?\n2.  **Divergence:** How do the two copies become different from each other in their sequence and/or function?\n\nThe key phrase is \"most likely,\" which suggests we should choose the mechanism that is considered most common or probable.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices:**\n\n1.  **A. Gene conversion:**\n    *   **Description:** A non-reciprocal process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies more similar or identical.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This mechanism works *against* divergence. While it's a real process that affects duplicate genes, it promotes homogenization, not the differentiation needed for the long-term retention of two distinct genes. Therefore, it does not explain divergence and is an incorrect choice.\n\n2.  **B. Pseudogenization:**\n    *   **Description:** One of the duplicate gene copies accumulates debilitating mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" The other copy retains the original function.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a very common *fate* for a duplicated gene, but it represents the *loss* of one functional copy, not the *retention* of two functional, diverging genes as the question implies. Therefore, it is not the mechanism for retaining both copies.\n\n3.  **C. Neofunctionalization:**\n    *   **Description:** After duplication, one copy continues to perform the original, ancestral function. The other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This model successfully explains both retention (as both the original and new functions are under positive selection) and divergence (as the gene sequences must change to support the new function). This is a valid and important mechanism for the evolution of novelty. However, it relies on the occurrence of rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutations.\n\n4.  **D. Subfunctionalization:**\n    *   **Description:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) posits that the original, ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulation (e.g., it was expressed in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, causing each to specialize in a subset of the original functions. For example, one copy might only function in the liver, while the other only functions in the brain.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This model also explains both retention (both copies are now essential to carry out the full range of the original gene's functions) and divergence (the mutations cause differences in sequence, regulation, and function). Crucially, this process is driven by the accumulation of common, neutral, or slightly deleterious mutations that disable specific sub-functions. Because these mutations are much more frequent than rare, beneficial, new-function mutations, many scientists believe this is a more probable and common mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes.\n\n5.  **E. Adaptive radiation:**\n    *   **Description:** This is a macroevolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species that occupy different ecological niches.\n    *   **Careful Points:** Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, but adaptive radiation itself is a species-level phenomenon, not a molecular mechanism of gene retention within a single genome. It operates at the wrong level of biological organization to be the correct answer.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\n*   We have eliminated options A, B, and E. The choice is between C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization).\n*   Both C and D are valid mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n*   Subfunctionalization is driven by common loss-of-function mutations in different parts of the gene or its regulatory elements. Neofunctionalization requires rare gain-of-function mutations.\n*   The redundancy after duplication provides a window of opportunity where degenerative mutations can occur. It is statistically more probable that common degenerative mutations will partition functions between the two copies (subfunctionalization) before a rare beneficial mutation creates a new function (neofunctionalization).\n*   Therefore, subfunctionalization is considered a more frequent and likely pathway for preventing the immediate loss of a duplicate gene, making it the \"most likely\" mechanism responsible for their retention.\n\n<<<D>>>"
