The density profile `\(\rho(z)\)` is determined by `\(\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)\)`, where the number density profiles `\(n_A(z)\)` and `\(n_B(z)\)` are obtained by numerically solving the system of coupled equations for the constancy of the total chemical potential of each species in the gravitational field, subject to the integral constraints on the total number of particles `\(N_A\)` and `\(N_B\)`. The explicit equations are: `\(\mu_A^{eff}(n_A(z), n_B(z)) + m_A g z = C_A\)` and `\(\mu_B^{eff}(n_A(z), n_B(z)) + m_B g z = C_B\)`, where `\(\mu_i^{eff}\)` is the density-dependent part of the chemical potential for a van der Waals mixture, and the constants `\(C_A, C_B\)` are found by satisfying `\(N_A = A \int_0^H n_A(z) dz\)` and `\(N_B = A \int_0^H n_B(z) dz\)`.
