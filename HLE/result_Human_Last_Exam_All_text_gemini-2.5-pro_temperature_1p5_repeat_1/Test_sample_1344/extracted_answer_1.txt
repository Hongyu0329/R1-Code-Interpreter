The optimal combination is a Hafnium (Hf) metal center, supported on partially dehydroxylated silica (e.g., SiO₂ calcined at 700°C), with the active site being formed by grafting an organometallic precursor like tetrakis(neopentyl)hafnium. In this system, the ligands are the remaining alkyl groups and the surface siloxy groups of the support.
