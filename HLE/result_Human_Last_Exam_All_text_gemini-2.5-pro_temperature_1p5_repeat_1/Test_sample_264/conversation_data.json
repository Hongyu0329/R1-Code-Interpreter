    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the first cube (C1)**\n\nLet's place the first cube, C1, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its volume as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite corner at (1, 1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift and define the second cube (C2)**\n\nThe second cube, C2, is a copy of the first cube but shifted. We need to determine the shift vector.\n*   **Direction:** The shift is \"along the main diagonal\". The main diagonal of C1 connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector for this diagonal is **d** = <1, 1, 1>.\n*   **Magnitude:** The shift is \"by 1/2\". This is the most critical point to analyze carefully. In the context of geometric problems, \"shifted by a value *k* along a vector **v**\" is most commonly interpreted as a displacement by the vector *k***v*. In our case, this means the shift vector is 1/2 multiplied by the diagonal vector **d**.\n    *   Shift vector **v** = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * <1, 1, 1> = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>.\n*   **Define C2:** To get the second cube, C2, we apply this shift vector to all points of C1. This means C2 is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Find the region of intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the volume that satisfies the inequalities for both C1 and C2 simultaneously. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **x-coordinate:** The point must be in the range `[0, 1]` (from C1) AND `[1/2, 3/2]` (from C2). The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   **y-coordinate:** Similarly, the point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   `max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   **z-coordinate:** Again, the point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   `max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection**\n\nThe intersection region is a shape defined by the new bounds we just found. This shape is a cube.\n*   The length of the side in the x-direction is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The length of the side in the y-direction is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The length of the side in the z-direction is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of this smaller cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (Side Length)³ = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Shift:** The crucial step is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". Assuming the shift vector is <1/2, 1/2, 1/2> is the most standard interpretation for such problems and leads to a clean, logical answer. An alternative interpretation (a shift distance of 1/2) would lead to a far more complex calculation and an irrational number, which is unlikely to be the intended solution.\n2.  **Defining Regions:** Using inequalities to represent the volumes of the cubes makes finding the intersection straightforward.\n3.  **Finding Intersection:** The intersection of two axis-aligned rectangular prisms is found by taking the intersection of their coordinate-wise intervals. The intersection of `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is `[max(a,c), min(b,d)]`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The resulting intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2, making the volume calculation simple.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of a cube with side length 1/2.\nVolume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
