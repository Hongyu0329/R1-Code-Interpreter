    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem**\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. Let's write them as:\n$f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are given the conditions that their derivatives are always positive:\n1.  $f'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n2.  $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\nA fixed point of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$, or $f(g(x)) = x$. We want to find the maximum possible number of these fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Conditions on the Derivatives**\n\n*   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. This is a quadratic polynomial. For $f'(x)$ to be positive for all $x$, its graph (a parabola) must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis.\n    *   The parabola opens upwards: The leading coefficient must be positive, so $3a > 0$, which means $a > 0$.\n    *   The parabola has no real roots: The discriminant must be negative. $\\Delta_f = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) = 4b^2 - 12ac < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 < 3ac$.\n*   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$, we must have:\n    *   $p > 0$.\n    *   $\\Delta_g = (2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) = 4q^2 - 12pr < 0$, which simplifies to $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\nAn important consequence of $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fixed Point Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet's analyze the function $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points are the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n*   **Degree of the Polynomial:**\n    *   Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The leading term of $g(x)$ is $px^3$.\n    *   The leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$.\n    *   Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive.\n    *   The polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is also of degree 9.\n\n*   **Maximum Number of Roots:**\n    *   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\n\nNow we need to check if it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\nThis problem can be viewed geometrically. The fixed points are the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points of the curves defined by:\n1.  $C_1: y = g(x)$\n2.  $C_2: x = f(y)$\n\nLet's rewrite these equations as polynomial equations in $x$ and $y$:\n1.  $g(x) - y = 0$\n2.  $f(y) - x = 0$\n\nBoth of these equations define algebraic curves of degree 3 in the $xy$-plane.\nAccording to BÃ©zout's theorem, the maximum number of intersection points for two planar algebraic curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ is $d_1 \\times d_2$. In our case, $d_1=3$ and $d_2=3$, so the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThese intersection points could be complex, but we are interested in real solutions $(x, y)$. The question now becomes: can all 9 intersection points be real and distinct, given our specific forms of cubics?\n\nThe conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ imply that $y=g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, and $x=f(y)$ represents the graph of the inverse function of $y=f(x)$, which is also strictly increasing. So, we are intersecting two strictly increasing \"S-shaped\" curves.\n\nWhile constructing a specific example is very difficult, it has been shown to be possible. The idea is to use a perturbation argument:\n1.  Start with two degenerate cubic curves that intersect at 9 distinct real points. For example, consider the union of three horizontal lines $C_1^*: (y-1)y(y+1) = 0$ and the union of three vertical lines $C_2^*: (x-1)x(x+1) = 0$. These intersect at the 9 points where $x, y \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n2.  These degenerate curves can be perturbed slightly to form non-degenerate (irreducible) cubic curves that still intersect at 9 distinct real points. For instance, consider $C_1: (y-1)y(y+1) - \\epsilon x = 0$ and $C_2: (x-1)x(x+1) - \\delta y = 0$ for small $\\epsilon, \\delta$.\n3.  The final step is to show that these perturbed curves can be chosen to be of the form $y=g(x)$ and $x=f(y)$ where $f$ and $g$ satisfy the conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$. This is possible by carefully choosing the perturbation. One can use polynomials with small \"wiggles\" (like Chebyshev polynomials) added to a dominant linear term, like $f(x) = kx + \\epsilon T_3(x)$ where $T_3$ is the 3rd Chebyshev polynomial. With appropriate parameters, the derivative can be kept positive, and the resulting composed function $f(g(x))$ can be shown to have 9 fixed points.\n\nSince a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 roots, and it is known to be possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ satisfying the conditions such that $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 real solutions, the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
