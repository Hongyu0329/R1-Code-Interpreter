No, this approach is not valid when considering the ecological function of mimicry syndromes. The validity of the clustering depends entirely on how the signal is perceived by the relevant signal receiver, which is the predator (e.g., a bird), not a human. There are several major flaws in using untrained undergraduates for this task:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The primary predators of bumblebees, birds, are often tetrachromatic and can see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. Humans are trichromatic and cannot see UV light. Bumblebee coloration often includes patterns visible only in the UV range. Therefore, two species that appear identical to a human may look very different to a bird, and vice versa. Using human observers misses a critical component of the visual signal that drives predator selection.

2.  **Inadequate Stimuli:** Standard field photography is designed for human vision and typically filters out UV light. The images presented to the undergraduates would therefore be an incomplete and biased representation of the bees' actual appearance to a predator.

3.  **Incorrect Cognitive Framework:** A predator learns to associate a pattern with a negative experience (a sting). Its perception is functional and shaped by survival instincts. An "untrained undergraduate" judges similarity based on abstract, human-centric aesthetic or pattern-matching criteria, which are not relevant to the ecological pressures that form mimicry rings.

In conclusion, the proposed method measures visual similarity to humans, not the functional similarity that underpins the mimicry syndrome in its natural, ecological context. The resulting clusters would likely be an artifact of human perception and would not accurately reflect the mimicry groups as they exist in nature.
