    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound change rule in English. It states that a long vowel becomes short if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\nFor this rule to apply, a word must:\n*   Be at least three syllables long.\n*   Have a historically long vowel in the antepenultimate syllable, which is typically stressed.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (`south-ern`).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is only two syllables long, so the trisyllabic laxing rule cannot apply. While the vowel in `southern` (/ʌ/) is short compared to its root `south` (/aʊ/, from Middle English /uː/), this shortening is due to a different historical process, not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The root word is `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a long vowel /aɪ/ (from Middle English /iː/). In `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the stress shifts to the antepenultimate syllable (`-riv-`). The long vowel /aɪ/ is \"laxed\" or shortened to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a word that **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The root word is `serene` (/səˈriːn/), which has a long vowel /iː/ (from Middle English /eː/). In `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/), the stress shifts to the antepenultimate syllable (`-ren-`). The long vowel /iː/ is laxed to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (`pleas-ant`).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is only two syllables long, so trisyllabic laxing cannot apply. The vowel in `pleasant` (/ɛ/) is short compared to its root `please` (/pliːz/), but this is due to pre-cluster shortening (shortening before a consonant cluster), not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Three syllables (`grat-i-tude`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The first syllable (`grat-`) is the antepenultimate and is stressed. It is related to Latin `grātus` (long `ā`) and English words like `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which retain the long vowel sound (/eɪ/). In `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), this long vowel is shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (`shad-ow`).\n    *   **Analysis:** First, the word is disyllabic, so trisyllabic laxing cannot apply. Second, and more fundamentally, the root of this word is Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel (`æ`) was already short. There was never a long vowel in this position to be shortened.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nWe have identified three words that did not undergo trisyllabic laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. However, the question asks for a single answer. We must choose the best example.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` did undergo vowel shortening, just not via the trisyllabic rule.\n*   `shadow` is the strongest case because it fails to meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two counts: it is not trisyllabic, and its vowel was never long to begin with. Therefore, it is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone this process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
