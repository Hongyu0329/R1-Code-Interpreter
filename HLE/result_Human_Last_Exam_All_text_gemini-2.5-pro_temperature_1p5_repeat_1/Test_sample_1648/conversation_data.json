    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the object of study.**\nWe are asked to find the largest natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nThe ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. This can be written as $\\mathbb{Z}/p^v$ where the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $v=3$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the ring to a standard object in K-theory computations.**\nA key result in the theory of Witt vectors establishes an isomorphism between the ring of Witt vectors of length $v$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^v\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSpecifically, for any prime $p$ and integer $v \\ge 1$, we have the ring isomorphism:\n$W_v(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^v\\mathbb{Z}$.\nIn our case, with $p=3$ and $v=3$, we have:\n$\\mathbb{Z}/27 \\cong W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3)$.\nSince they are isomorphic as rings, their algebraic K-groups are also isomorphic:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_i(W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3))$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the properties of K-groups of finite fields.**\nFor a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the algebraic K-groups were computed by Quillen. A key result is that for $n \\ge 1$, the even K-groups are trivial:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_q) = 0$.\nIn our case, $q=3$, so $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Decompose the K-groups of Witt vectors.**\nThe K-theory of the ring of Witt vectors $W_v(k)$ where $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$ can be related to the K-theory of the field $k$ itself. The reduction map $W_v(k) \\to k$ (taking the first component) induces a long exact sequence in K-theory. More simply, there is a decomposition for the K-groups.\nFor $i \\ge 1$, there's a split exact sequence:\n$0 \\to K_i(W_v(k), p) \\to K_i(W_v(k)) \\to K_i(k) \\to 0$.\nHere, $K_i(W_v(k), p)$ are the relative K-groups with respect to the ideal $(p)$.\nThis means $K_i(W_v(k)) \\cong K_i(k) \\oplus K_i(W_v(k), p)$.\nWe are interested in the even K-groups, $i=2n$. So for $n \\ge 1$:\n$K_{2n}(W_v(k)) \\cong K_{2n}(k) \\oplus K_{2n}(W_v(k), p)$.\nApplying this to our case, $k=\\mathbb{F}_3$ and $v=3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n}(W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3)) \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) \\oplus K_{2n}(W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3), 3)$.\nFrom Step 3, we know $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3)=0$ for $n \\ge 1$. Therefore,\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n}(W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3), 3)$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the main theorem on the K-theory of Witt vectors.**\nThe problem of determining when $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero reduces to determining when the relative K-group $K_{2n}(W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3), 3)$ is non-zero.\nThe computation of these relative K-groups is a major result of Hesselholt and Madsen. In their paper \"On the K-theory of local fields\" (Inventiones Mathematicae, 1997), they prove the following theorem (Theorem 7.2):\nLet $k$ be a finite field of characteristic $p$ with $[k:\\mathbb{F}_p] = f$. For integers $v, n \\ge 1$, the group $K_{2n}(W_v(k), p)$ is a finite $p$-group. It is non-zero if and only if $n < v \\frac{p^f}{p-1}$.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the specific values for our problem.**\nWe have the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which corresponds to $W_3(\\mathbb{F}_3)$. So:\n- The base prime is $p=3$.\n- The length of the Witt vectors is $v=3$.\n- The base field is $k = \\mathbb{F}_3$, so its degree over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is $f=[ \\mathbb{F}_3 : \\mathbb{F}_3] = 1$.\n\nWe plug these values into the condition from the theorem:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0 \\iff n < 3 \\cdot \\frac{3^1}{3-1}$\n$n < 3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}$\n$n < 4.5$\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the largest *natural number* $n$ satisfying this condition. The natural numbers $n$ that are less than 4.5 are $n=1, 2, 3, 4$.\nThe largest among these is 4.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 4. For $n=4$, $K_8(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero, while for any $n \\ge 5$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero."
