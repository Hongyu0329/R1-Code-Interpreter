    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism:** This is a method in quantum field theory where the probability amplitude for a process is calculated by summing over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\" the system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a factor of $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action of that path.\n*   **Green's Function (Propagator):** A Green's function, in this context, describes the amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This specifically refers to the propagator in a *non-interacting* system. It describes the propagation of a \"bare\" particle, one that does not interact with other particles or with itself.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the allowed energy levels for a single, non-interacting particle. They are the eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$. The index '$k$' typically represents momentum or another appropriate set of quantum numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Bare Green's Function using the Path Integral**\n\nThe two-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. In the path integral formalism, for a fermionic field $\\psi$, this is written as:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x,t) \\psi^*(x',t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nwhere $S_0$ is the action for the *non-interacting* system.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a non-interacting fermion field is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int d^d x \\int dt \\, \\psi^*(x,t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nHere, $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator. The core of the problem lies in how $H_0$ relates to $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**Step 4: Work in the Energy-Momentum Basis**\n\nTo see the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicitly, it's easiest to work in the basis where $H_0$ is diagonal. Let's expand the field $\\psi(x,t)$ in terms of the eigenstates of $H_0$, which are typically plane waves $|k\\rangle$ with energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nWe perform a Fourier transform from spacetime $(x, t)$ to momentum-frequency $(k, \\omega)$:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, e^{i(k \\cdot x - \\omega t)} \\psi(k,\\omega)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action, the operators become algebraic terms:\n*   The time derivative $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes $\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The Hamiltonian $H_0$ acting on a state with momentum $k$ yields the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe operator in the action, $(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0)$, becomes $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis. The action then simplifies to:\n\n$S_0 = \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\psi^*(k,\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k,\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Green's Function in Momentum-Frequency Space**\n\nThe Green's function $G_0$ can be understood as the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the action. In momentum-frequency space, the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the inverse of the algebraic term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nTo handle the singularity (the pole) at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ and ensure causality (effects cannot precede their causes), a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), is added to the denominator. The precise form depends on whether we want the retarded, advanced, or time-ordered Green's function. For the causal (Feynman) propagator, the result is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n**Step 6: Final Analysis of the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the expression $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, we can clearly state the functional dependence.\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency variable $\\omega$ (times $\\hbar$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. This relationship manifests as a **simple pole** in the complex frequency plane located at $\\omega = (\\epsilon_k - i\\eta)/\\hbar$. Physically, this pole signifies that a non-interacting particle can only propagate \"on-shell\", meaning its energy-frequency $\\omega$ must match its intrinsic energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Propagator:** This entire analysis is for the *bare* propagator $G_0$, which uses the non-interacting action $S_0$. In an *interacting* system, the full propagator $G$ would have its poles shifted away from $\\epsilon_k$ due to self-energy corrections, $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$. The poles of the full Green's function would be at $\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega) = 0$, which define the *quasiparticle* energies.\n2.  **Real vs. Imaginary Time:** The derivation can also be done in the imaginary time (Matsubara) formalism, which is common in many-body and statistical physics. The result is analogous: $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$, where $i\\omega_n$ are the discrete Matsubara frequencies. The fundamental inverse relationship holds.\n3.  **Causality and the $i\\eta$ term:** The small imaginary term $i\\eta$ is not a mathematical formality; it is crucial for enforcing the correct time-ordering and causal structure of the theory. Its sign determines the type of propagator (retarded, advanced, etc.).\n4.  **Units:** I have included $\\hbar$ for completeness, but in many theoretical physics contexts, natural units ($\\hbar=1$) are used, which simplifies the expression to $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)^{-1}$.\n\nThe functional dependence is fundamentally that of an inverse.\n\n***\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, where units are chosen such that $\\hbar=1$. It exhibits a simple pole at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.>>>"
