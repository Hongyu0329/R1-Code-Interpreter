    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Flag of Tonga's Structure:**\n    The flag of Tonga is composed of a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton itself contains a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the field it is on.\n\n2.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:**\n    We represent an image of the flag as an `m x n` matrix, `M`. Each pixel in the image corresponds to an entry in the matrix.\n    *   Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n    *   White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rows of the Matrix:**\n    The key to finding the rank of a matrix is to analyze its row space (or column space). The rank is the number of linearly independent rows. Let's examine the possible types of rows in the matrix `M`.\n\n    *   Let the canton (the top-left white rectangle with the red cross) occupy the first `h` rows and `w` columns of the matrix.\n\n    *   **Type 1: Rows below the canton.**\n        Any row with an index `i > h` lies entirely in the red field. Therefore, every element in such a row is `a`.\n        Row type 1: `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n    *   **Type 2: Rows that pass through the canton.**\n        Any row with an index `i <= h` passes through the canton for its first `w` columns and through the red field for the remaining `n-w` columns.\n        The last `n-w` elements of such a row are all `a`.\n        The first `w` elements depend on the pattern of the canton in that row.\n        The canton itself has a red cross on a white background. Let's analyze the rows within the canton.\n        *   **Sub-type 2a: Rows passing through the horizontal bar of the red cross.** For these rows, all pixels within the canton are red. Thus, the first `w` elements are `(a, a, ..., a)`. When combined with the rest of the row, the entire row is `(a, a, a, ..., a)`. This is identical to Row type 1.\n        *   **Sub-type 2b: Rows passing through the canton but not the horizontal bar of the cross.** For these rows, the pixels in the canton are white, except for the vertical bar of the red cross. So, the first `w` elements will be a sequence of `b`'s (for the white background) and `a`'s (for the vertical red bar). For example, `(b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b)`. Let's call this specific pattern `P`. All rows of this sub-type will have the exact same pattern `P` in their first `w` columns, because the vertical bar of the cross is in the same column position for all of them. The full row is `(P, a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Linearly Independent Rows:**\n    From the analysis above, we see that no matter how we discretize the flag into pixels, there are at most two distinct types of row vectors in the matrix `M`.\n    *   **Vector `V_A`**: `(a, a, ..., a)`. This corresponds to all rows in the main red field and the rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the cross.\n    *   **Vector `V_B`**: `(P, a, ..., a)`, where `P` is the pattern `(b,..,b,a,..,a,b,..,b)`. This corresponds to the rows in the canton that do not pass through the horizontal bar of the cross.\n\n    The rank of the matrix `M` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by `{V_A, V_B}`. The dimension can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n5.  **Maximize the Rank:**\n    The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. This means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank. The rank will be 2 if and only if `V_A` and `V_B` are linearly independent.\n\n    *   When are `V_A` and `V_B` linearly independent? They are independent as long as one is not a scalar multiple of the other (assuming neither is a zero vector).\n    *   Let's assume `V_B = k * V_A` for some scalar `k`.\n        `(P, a, ..., a) = k * (a, a, ..., a) = (ka, ka, ..., ka)`\n        This gives us two conditions by comparing the elements:\n        1.  In positions where `P` has a `b`, we must have `b = ka`.\n        2.  In positions where `P` has an `a` or for any position outside the canton, we must have `a = ka`.\n\n    *   To achieve the maximum rank, we want to choose `a` and `b` such that these conditions *cannot* be simultaneously met.\n    *   Let's choose `a=1` and `b=2`.\n        From `a = ka`, we have `1 = k * 1`, which means `k=1`.\n        From `b = ka`, we must have `2 = 1 * 1`, which is `2 = 1`. This is a contradiction.\n        Therefore, if we choose `a=1` and `b=2`, the vectors `V_A` and `V_B` are linearly independent.\n\n    *   Generally, as long as `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, the vectors will be linearly independent.\n        If `a ≠ 0`, then `a = ka` implies `k=1`. Then `b = ka` implies `b=a`. So linear dependence only occurs if `a=b`.\n        If `a = 0`, then `V_A` is the zero vector, making the set `{V_A, V_B}` linearly dependent, and the rank is at most 1.\n\n    *   By choosing `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b` (for example, `a=1, b=2`), we ensure that `V_A` and `V_B` are linearly independent. This makes the dimension of the row space equal to 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure of the Tongan flag allows for only two distinct types of rows in its matrix representation. By choosing the values for red (`a`) and white (`b`) pixels appropriately (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`), we can make these two row types linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
