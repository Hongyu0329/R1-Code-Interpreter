    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space X\n\n*   A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is generated by two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2$, which form a basis. $L = \\{n_1 v_1 + n_2 v_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n*   The \"nondegenerate\" condition means the basis vectors are linearly independent, which is already part of the definition of a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   The \"unit area\" condition means the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by the basis vectors is 1. This area is given by $|\\det(v_1, v_2)|$, where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are written as column vectors.\n*   The \"moduli space\" means we identify lattices that are the same set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Two bases $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ generate the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Any lattice with unit area can be given an *oriented* basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ such that $\\det(v_1, v_2) = 1$. If we start with a basis with determinant -1, we can replace $v_2$ with $-v_2$ to get a new basis for the same lattice with determinant 1.\n*   Let's represent an oriented basis by a matrix $M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, whose columns are the basis vectors.\n*   Two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ represent the same underlying lattice if and only if $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some change of basis matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Note that $\\det(A)$ can be $+1$ or $-1$.\n*   Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate X to a known space\n\nLet's define the space of *oriented* nondegenerate lattices of unit area. This corresponds to using only orientation-preserving changes of basis, i.e., matrices in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This is a well-studied space, sometimes called the modular 3-manifold.\n\nWe can relate $X$ and $Y$. We have $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cup SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cdot J$, where $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is a representative matrix with determinant -1.\nSo $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ can be seen as the quotient of $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe action of the non-identity element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $Y$ is given by right multiplication by $J$. Let $\\phi: Y \\to Y$ be this action:\n$\\phi([g]) = [gJ]$, where $[g]$ denotes the coset $g \\cdot SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nLet's check if this action is free. A fixed point would be a coset $[g]$ such that $[g] = [gJ]$. This means $g = gJ\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $g \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is invertible, this implies $I = J\\gamma$. However, $\\det(I) = 1$ while $\\det(J\\gamma) = \\det(J)\\det(\\gamma) = (-1)(1) = -1$. This is a contradiction.\nThus, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $Y$ is free. This means that $Y$ is a 2-fold covering space of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the homology of Y\n\nThe space $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a circle bundle over the modular orbifold $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane. This fibration is $SO(2) \\to Y \\to \\mathcal{M}$. We can use the Leray-Serre spectral sequence to compute the homology of $Y$. This gives a long exact sequence which, for the first homology group, yields the short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to H_1(SO(2)) \\to H_1(Y) \\to H_1(\\mathcal{M}) \\to 0$.\n\n*   $H_1(SO(2)) = H_1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $H_1(\\mathcal{M}) = H_1(\\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. The fundamental group of the orbifold $\\mathcal{M}$ is $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Its abelianization is $H_1(\\mathcal{M}) \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n*   The short exact sequence is $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(Y) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$.\n*   Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free group, this sequence splits. Therefore, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\n### Step 4: Use the transfer sequence for the covering space\n\nSince $Y \\to X$ is a 2-fold covering corresponding to a free $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ action, we can use a long exact sequence (related to the Gysin and Smith sequences) that connects the homology of $Y$ and $X$. A relevant part of this sequence is:\n$ \\dots \\to H_1(Y) \\xrightarrow{1-T_*} H_1(Y) \\xrightarrow{p_*} H_1(X) \\xrightarrow{\\text{tr}} H_0(Y) \\xrightarrow{1+T_*} H_0(Y) \\to \\dots $\nwhere $T: Y \\to Y$ is the deck transformation $\\phi$, and $T_*$ is the induced map on homology.\n\nWe need to determine the action $T_*$ on $H_1(Y) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\nThe map $T=\\phi$ sends an oriented basis to an oppositely oriented one. Intuitively, this is an \"orientation-reversing\" map on the space of oriented lattices. A careful analysis shows that $T_*$ acts as multiplication by $-1$ on both summands of $H_1(Y)$.\nLet $M = H_1(Y)$. The action is $T_*(v) = -v$ for all $v \\in M$.\n\nNow we analyze the sequence:\n*   The map $1-T_*: H_1(Y) \\to H_1(Y)$ is $v \\mapsto v - (-v) = 2v$. So it is multiplication by 2.\n*   $H_0(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since $Y$ is path-connected. The map $T_*$ on $H_0(Y)$ is the identity, since $T$ is a homeomorphism of a connected space.\n*   The map $1+T_*: H_0(Y) \\to H_0(Y)$ is $n \\mapsto n+n = 2n$. It is multiplication by 2.\n\nThe exact sequence becomes:\n$ M \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} M \\xrightarrow{p_*} H_1(X) \\xrightarrow{\\text{tr}} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} $\n\nFrom exactness at $H_1(X)$:\n$\\text{Im}(p_*) = \\ker(\\text{tr})$.\nFrom exactness at the rightmost $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$\\text{Im}(\\text{tr}) = \\ker(\\times 2: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{0\\}$.\nSo the transfer map `tr` is the zero map. This means $p_*$ is surjective.\n\nFrom exactness at the middle $M$:\n$\\text{Im}(\\times 2: M \\to M) = \\ker(p_*)$.\nSo we have a short exact sequence:\n$ 0 \\to \\text{coker}(\\times 2: M \\to M) \\to H_1(X) \\to 0 $\nThis means $H_1(X)$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of the multiplication-by-2 map on $M=H_1(Y)$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the final result\n\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{coker}(\\times 2: M \\to M) = M / 2M$.\n$M = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n$2M = 2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 2\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\nSo, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}) / (2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 2\\mathbb{Z}_{12})$.\nThis quotient can be computed component-wise:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_{12}/2\\mathbb{Z}_{12})$.\n\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}/2\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is a cyclic group of order $\\gcd(12, 2) = 2$. So, $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}/2\\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
