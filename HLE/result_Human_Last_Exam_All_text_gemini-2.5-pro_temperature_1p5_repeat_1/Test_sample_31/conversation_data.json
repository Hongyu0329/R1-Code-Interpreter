    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, the final step in the popular CFOP method is PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). At this stage, all stickers on the top face are the correct color (e.g., all yellow), but the side pieces of that layer may not be in their correct positions. The goal is to identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases you have, in order to execute the correct algorithm to solve the cube.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers one must observe to uniquely identify the case.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Information Source:** The top-facing stickers are all solved, providing no information about the permutation. The required information comes from the side stickers of the top layer's four corner pieces and four edge pieces. There are a total of 12 such stickers (2 on each of the 4 corners, and 1 on each of the 4 edges).\n\n2.  **Define the Goal:** We need to find the smallest number of these 12 stickers that, once their colors are known, removes all ambiguity between the 21 PLL cases. This is a worst-case analysis; the number must be sufficient for every possible case.\n\n3.  **Analyze What a Sticker Tells Us:** When you observe a single non-top-facing sticker, you can identify the specific piece it belongs to. For example, if the front face is green and the right face is red, seeing a green sticker on the front side of the UFR (Up-Front-Right) corner piece tells you that the correct G-R-Y corner is in that position. Seeing an orange sticker there would tell you a different corner is in that slot. Since OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) is already complete, the orientation of the pieces is fixed, meaning identifying one side-sticker of a piece is enough to know the entire piece's identity.\n\n4.  **Test a Small Number of Stickers (e.g., 4):** Let's consider what happens if we only look at 4 stickers. This means we can determine the identity and position of at most 4 of the 8 pieces in the last layer.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Observe 4 edge stickers.** Let's say we check the side stickers of the four edge pieces (UF, UR, UB, UL). Several PLL cases only permute the corner pieces and leave the edges untouched (e.g., A-perms, E-perm). In all these cases, the edge stickers would all appear to be solved. This makes it impossible to distinguish between a solved cube, an A-perm, and an E-perm. So, 4 edge stickers are not enough.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Observe 4 corner stickers.** Similarly, some PLLs only permute edges (U-perms, Z-perm, H-perm). If we only observe the four corners, we can't distinguish a solved cube from a Z-perm, as both leave the corners in their correct places. So, 4 corner stickers are not enough.\n\n    *   **Scenario 3: Observe a mix of stickers.** A more general argument proves that 4 stickers are never sufficient. If you observe any 4 pieces, there are always 4 other pieces that are unobserved. It is always possible to find a valid PLL case that only permutes a subset of these 4 unobserved pieces while leaving the 4 observed pieces untouched. For example, if you observe pieces {UFL, UBR, UF, UR}, the T-perm permutes the unobserved pieces {UFR, UBL, UL, UB}. Therefore, you cannot distinguish the solved state from the T-perm just by looking at those 4 pieces. This logic holds for any combination of 4 observed pieces.\n\n5.  **Test with 5 Stickers:** Since 4 stickers are insufficient, let's test if 5 are sufficient. A common and effective recognition method for experts is \"2-side recognition\", where they observe the patterns on two adjacent faces, for example, the Front and Right faces.\n\n    *   **Stickers observed:** To know the patterns on the Front and Right faces, you need to see:\n        1.  The left corner's front sticker (on piece UFL)\n        2.  The front edge's front sticker (on piece UF)\n        3.  The right corner's front sticker (on piece UFR)\n        4.  The right edge's right sticker (on piece UR)\n        5.  The back corner's right sticker (on piece UBR)\n    *   This totals 5 distinct stickers, which reveals the identity of 5 distinct pieces: UFL, UF, UFR, UR, and UBR.\n    *   **Is this sufficient?** If we know the positions of these 5 pieces, the positions of the remaining 3 pieces (UBL, UB, UL) are constrained. The unobserved pieces are one corner (UBL) and two edges (UB, UL). A fundamental rule of the Rubik's Cube is that corners can only be swapped with corners, and edges with edges. Therefore, any permutation of these three remaining pieces must keep the corner (UBL) in its slot and can only swap the two edges (UB and UL).\n    *   A single swap of two pieces (like UB and UL) is an \"odd permutation\". A valid PLL case must be an \"even permutation\". Therefore, no valid PLL algorithm can permute only the two edges UB and UL.\n    *   This means that if the 5 observed pieces are all in their correct places, the remaining 3 must be as well. There is no ambiguity. This set of 5 stickers is sufficient to identify every PLL case uniquely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt has been proven that observing 4 non-top-facing stickers is insufficient to guarantee identification of all PLL cases. However, observing 5 stickers in a specific arrangement (like those visible from two adjacent sides) is sufficient. Therefore, the minimum number required is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
