    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deciphering the Core Question**\nThe first crucial point is to understand the question being asked. The prompt states, \"The title is a question\". The title is \"The Bays\". This is a homophone, a play on words that sounds like \"The B's\". Therefore, the haiku is a riddle asking you to identify three things that start with the letter 'B', with one clue per line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the First Line of the Haiku**\n*   **Clue:** \"An August tempest\"\n*   **Analysis:** A tempest is a violent, windy storm. We are looking for something starting with 'B' that relates to this. While one could think of hurricane names (like Bill or Bertha), a more geographical and thematic answer relates back to the title, \"The Bays\". A famous bay known for its powerful storms and rough seas is the **Bay of Biscay**. This is a strong candidate for the first 'B'.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Second Line of the Haiku**\n*   **Clue:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n*   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 * 15 = 30. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" strongly suggests something related to measuring wind. This points directly to the **Beaufort** scale (full name: Beaufort wind force scale), which is the standard empirical measure for wind intensity. This is our second 'B'.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Third Line of the Haiku**\n*   **Clue:** \"A divine one yields\"\n*   **Analysis:** The phrase \"a divine one\" refers to a singular, sacred, or holy entity or text. The word \"yields\" means it produces or provides something (like wisdom, commandments, or stories). A very common and fitting answer for a divine text starting with 'B' is the **Bible**. This is our third 'B'.\n\n**Step 5: Compiling and Ordering the Final Answer**\n*   **Instruction:** \"...in alphabetical order what is the answer?\"\n*   **Analysis:** We have identified the three 'B's':\n    1.  Bay of Biscay\n    2.  Beaufort\n    3.  Bible\n*   Now, we must arrange them in alphabetical order:\n    1.  **Bay of Biscay** (starts with 'Bay')\n    2.  **Beaufort** (starts with 'Bea')\n    3.  **Bible** (starts with 'Bib')\n*   The final answer is the ordered list of these three items.\n\n<<<Bay of Biscay, Beaufort, Bible>>>"
