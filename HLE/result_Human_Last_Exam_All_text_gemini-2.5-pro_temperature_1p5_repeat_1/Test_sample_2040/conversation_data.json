    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n**Question:** When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\n\n**1. Deconstruct the key terms:**\n\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical phenomenon. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (called \"signal\" and \"idler\"). The key material property required for SPDC to occur is a significant **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾** (chi-two).\n*   **Boron Nanosheets:** These are two-dimensional (2D), single-atom-thick sheets of boron, also known as **borophene**. Unlike graphene (the 2D form of carbon), borophene does not have a single stable structure. It is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic arrangements or phases (e.g., β₁₂, χ₃, striped phase).\n*   **Free-standing:** This specifies that we should consider the intrinsic properties of the nanosheet itself, without the influence of a substrate that could alter its properties or break its symmetry.\n\n**2. Identify the core physical principle:**\n\nThe central question boils down to whether free-standing boron nanosheets possess a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\n**3. Relate the material property (χ⁽²⁾) to a fundamental characteristic (crystal symmetry):**\n\nA fundamental rule in nonlinear optics dictates the relationship between a material's crystal structure and its optical properties.\n*   The second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is a third-rank tensor that describes the material's response.\n*   In materials that possess a **center of inversion symmetry** (i.e., they are **centrosymmetric**), all components of the bulk χ⁽²⁾ tensor must be zero. A crystal is centrosymmetric if its structure remains unchanged when all atoms are inverted through a central point (i.e., every atom at position **r** has an identical atom at position **-r**).\n*   Therefore, SPDC can only occur efficiently in **non-centrosymmetric** materials.\n\n**4. Analyze the crystal structure and symmetry of boron nanosheets:**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We need to determine if the common, stable phases of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric or not.\n*   Unlike graphene, which has a single, well-defined centrosymmetric hexagonal lattice, borophene is polymorphic.\n*   Theoretical calculations and experimental syntheses (usually on substrates like Ag(111)) have identified several possible structures. Let's examine the most prominent ones predicted to be stable in a free-standing form:\n    *   **β₁₂ borophene:** This structure has an orthorhombic unit cell and belongs to the space group *Pmmm*. This space group is centrosymmetric.\n    *   **χ₃ borophene:** This is another stable orthorhombic structure, belonging to the space group *Pmmn*. This space group is also centrosymmetric.\n    *   **Striped phases:** These phases, often observed on silver substrates, are also typically described by centrosymmetric space groups like *Pmmn*.\n*   Since the common and most stable predicted forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero.\n\n**5. Formulate the conclusion:**\n\n*   SPDC requires a non-centrosymmetric material with a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n*   The stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) possess crystal structures with a center of inversion symmetry.\n*   Therefore, based on their intrinsic crystal structure, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Polymorphism:** The answer depends critically on which phase (polymorph) of borophene is being considered. However, the most commonly studied and stable free-standing phases are centrosymmetric.\n2.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** This analysis applies to the ideal, defect-free, infinite 2D crystal. In a real, finite nanosheet, symmetry can be broken at the **edges** or by **defects**. This could lead to a very weak, localized second-order nonlinear response, but it would not be a characteristic of the bulk material and would likely be very inefficient.\n3.  **Strain Effects:** Applying non-uniform strain can break the inversion symmetry of a normally centrosymmetric material, inducing a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. While possible in principle, this is an extrinsic effect, not an intrinsic property of the \"free-standing\" (implying unstrained) nanosheet.\n4.  **Free-standing vs. Substrate-bound:** If the boron nanosheet were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the inversion symmetry of the combined system, potentially allowing for SPDC. The question's \"free-standing\" specification rules out this possibility.\n\n### Final Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\n1.  **Requirement for SPDC:** A non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  **Symmetry Condition for χ⁽²⁾:** The material must lack inversion symmetry (be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:** The most stable, common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (β₁₂, χ₃, etc.) are centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because they are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n<<<No.>>>"
