    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Factorize the Conductor `d`**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors. It is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Now we factor 7657. Testing small primes again: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Finally, we factor 589. We test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer, which simplifies the analysis.\n\n**2. Understand the Group of Dirichlet Characters**\nThe group of all Dirichlet characters modulo $d$, let's call it $G_d$, is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups of characters modulo each prime factor of $d$.\n$G_d \\cong G_7 \\times G_{13} \\times G_{19} \\times G_{31}$\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$, denoted $G_p$, is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $p-1$.\n*   $G_7 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $7-1=6$. So, $G_7 \\cong C_6$.\n*   $G_{13} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $13-1=12$. So, $G_{13} \\cong C_{12}$.\n*   $G_{19} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $19-1=18$. So, $G_{19} \\cong C_{18}$.\n*   $G_{31} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $31-1=30$. So, $G_{31} \\cong C_{30}$.\nThus, the group of characters modulo 53599 is isomorphic to the direct product of these cyclic groups:\n$G_{53599} \\cong C_6 \\times C_{12} \\times C_{18} \\times C_{30}$.\n\n**3. Understand the Conditions for a Character to be Primitive**\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is `cond(χ) = cond(χ₁)cond(χ₂)cond(χ₃)cond(χ₄)`.\nFor a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$, its conductor is $p_i$ if it's a non-trivial character, and 1 if it's the trivial character.\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, we must have `cond(χ) = d`. This means that for each component character $\\chi_i$, we must have `cond(χᵢ) = pᵢ`. This is equivalent to saying that each component character $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial (i.e., its order must be greater than 1).\n\n**4. Understand the Condition on the Order of the Character**\nWe are looking for characters $\\chi$ of order 6. The order of $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n`ord(χ) = lcm(ord(χ₁), ord(χ₂), ord(χ₃), ord(χ₄))`\nSo, we need `lcm(ord(χ₁), ord(χ₂), ord(χ₃), ord(χ₄)) = 6$.\n\n**5. Count the Characters Satisfying the Conditions**\nLet's summarize the conditions on the component characters $\\chi_p$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$:\n1.  `ord(χ_p) > 1` (for primitiveness).\n2.  `lcm(ord(χ₇), ord(χ₁₃), ord(χ₁₉), ord(χ₃₁)) = 6`.\n\nFrom condition (2), the order of each component, `ord(χ_p)`, must be a divisor of 6. Combined with condition (1), the possible orders for each component are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor `lcm(...) = 6`, two things must be true:\n*   At least one component must have an order divisible by 2.\n*   At least one component must have an order divisible by 3.\n\nWe can count the number of such characters using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of primitive characters where the order of each component `ord(χ_p)` divides 6. So for each $p$, `ord(χ_p)` can be 2, 3, or 6.\nThe number of elements of a specific order $k$ in a cyclic group $C_n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided $k|n$.\nFor any of our component groups ($C_6, C_{12}, C_{18}, C_{30}$), the orders 2, 3, and 6 are all valid divisors.\n*   Number of elements of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of elements of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of elements of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\nFor each of the four components, the number of choices for a character with order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSo, the total number of characters in our set $S$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the cases from $S$ where the `lcm` is not 6. These are the cases where the `lcm` is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.\n*   **Case A: lcm divides 3.** This happens if the order of every component character divides 3. Since the characters must be non-trivial, their orders must be exactly 3. The number of characters of order 3 in each component group is $\\phi(3)=2$. So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ such characters.\n*   **Case B: lcm divides 2.** This happens if the order of every component character divides 2. Since the characters must be non-trivial, their orders must be exactly 2. The number of characters of order 2 in each component group is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ such character.\n*   **Case C: lcm divides 1.** This means the character is trivial, but this is excluded by the primitiveness condition. The number is 0.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of characters with order exactly 6 is:\n(Total in S) - (Number with order dividing 3) - (Number with order dividing 2) + (Number with order dividing gcd(2,3)=1)\nNumber = $625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
