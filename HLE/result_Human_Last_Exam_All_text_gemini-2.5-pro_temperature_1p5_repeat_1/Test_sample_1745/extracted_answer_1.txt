The expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution $\psi(y)$ is:
$$ \psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H/2 - y))}{\sinh(kH)} $$
where `y` is the coordinate across the channel height with the origin at the centerline, `H` is the channel height, $z_1$ is the base zeta potential of the bottom surface, $\beta$ is the slip length, and `k` is the Debye-Huckel parameter.
