    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step 1: Understand Involutions in PSU(n, q)\n\nAn involution in a group is an element of order 2. Let $G = \\text{PSU}(n, q) = \\text{SU}(n, q) / Z$, where $Z = Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is the center of the special unitary group $\\text{SU}(n, q)$.\n\nAn element $x = gZ \\in \\text{PSU}(n, q)$ (with $g \\in \\text{SU}(n, q)$) is an involution if $x^2 = 1$ and $x \\neq 1$.\n- $x^2 = (gZ)^2 = g^2Z = 1$ means $g^2 \\in Z$.\n- $x \\neq 1$ means $g \\notin Z$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of cosets $gZ$ where $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z$ and $g^2 \\in Z$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Center Z(SU(4, 997))\n\nThe center $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1} = 1$. This implies $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)} = 1$.\nFor our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$.\nThe order of the center is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1) = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ (and 499 is a prime number), we have $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, the center $Z$ has order 2. The elements are solutions to $\\lambda^2=1$, which are $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=-1$.\nThus, $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$, where $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the Pre-images of Involutions\n\nWe are looking for elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$ and $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$.\nLet's analyze these two cases for $g^2$:\n\n**Case A: $g^2 = I$**\nThese are the involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$. Since $g$ must be non-central, $g \\neq I$ and $g \\neq -I$.\nAn involution $g$ is a semisimple matrix, so it is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Its eigenvalues must be $+1$ or $-1$.\nLet $k$ be the number of eigenvalues equal to $-1$. The determinant of $g$ is $(-1)^k$.\nSince $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$, we have $\\det(g) = 1$, which implies $k$ must be even.\n- If $k=0$, all eigenvalues are 1, so $g=I$. This is in the center $Z$.\n- If $k=4$, all eigenvalues are -1, so $g=-I$. This is also in the center $Z$.\n- If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are $\\{-1, -1, 1, 1\\}$. These elements are not in the center.\n\nSo, this case contributes all elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ that are involutions and not central. The number of such elements corresponds to the size of the conjugacy class of matrices with eigenvalues $\\{-1, -1, 1, 1\\}$.\n\n**Case B: $g^2 = -I$**\nLet $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of such a matrix $g$. Then $\\lambda^2 = -1$.\nAlso, for any matrix in a unitary group $\\text{U}(n, q)$, its eigenvalues $\\lambda$ must satisfy the condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nSo we need a $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $\\lambda^2 = -1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nFrom $\\lambda^2 = -1$, we can raise this to the power of $(q+1)/2$:\n$\\lambda^{q+1} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2}$.\nFor $\\lambda^{q+1}$ to be 1, $(q+1)/2$ must be an even integer. This means $q+1$ must be a multiple of 4, or $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n\nIn our case, $q=997$. We have $997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nFor $q=997$, $(q+1)/2 = 998/2 = 499$, which is odd.\nSo $\\lambda^{q+1} = (-1)^{499} = -1 \\neq 1$.\nThe condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$ cannot be satisfied. This means there are no elements $g \\in \\text{U}(4, 997)$ such that $g^2=-I$.\nTherefore, the number of such elements in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$ is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Relevant Elements\n\nThe only elements that become involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ are the images of non-central involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\nThese are the elements $g$ with eigenvalues $\\{-1, -1, 1, 1\\}$. The structure of such an involution is determined by its (-1)-eigenspace, which must be a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace of the 4-dimensional unitary space $V$.\nThe number of such elements is equal to the number of 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspaces in $V$.\nThis number, let's call it $N(n,k)$ for $k$-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional space, is given by the formula:\n$N(n, k) = \\frac{|\\text{U}(n, q)|}{|\\text{U}(k, q)| |\\text{U}(n-k, q)|}$.\n\nThe order of the unitary group is given by:\n$|\\text{U}(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^{m} (q^i - (-1)^i)$.\n\nFor our case, $n=4$ and $k=2$:\n$|\\text{U}(4, q)| = q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\n$|\\text{U}(2, q)| = q^1 (q+1)(q^2-1)$.\n\nSo, the number of non-central involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is:\n$N(4, 2) = \\frac{|\\text{U}(4, q)|}{|\\text{U}(2, q)|^2} = \\frac{q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{\\left[q(q+1)(q^2-1)\\right]^2}$\n$N(4, 2) = \\frac{q^4 (q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}$.\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$q^3+1 = (q+1)(q^2-q+1)$\n$q^4-1 = (q^2-1)(q^2+1)$\n$N(4, 2) = \\frac{q^4 (q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\nThis is the number of elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2=I$ and $g \\notin Z$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Number of Involutions in PSU(4, 997)\n\nThe set of pre-images of involutions is $S = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\mid g \\text{ is a non-central involution}\\}$. The size of this set is $|S| = N(4,2)$.\nEach involution in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ corresponds to a coset $gZ = \\{g, -g\\}$.\nSince $|Z|=2$, each coset contains two such elements from $S$. (If $g \\in S$, then $(-g)^2 = g^2 = I$ and $-g \\notin Z$, so $-g \\in S$).\nThe number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is therefore $|S|/|Z| = N(4,2) / 2$.\n\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute $q=997$:\nNumber = $\\frac{997^4 (997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1)}{2}$\n- $997^4 = 988,071,881,449$\n- $997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013$\n- $997^2 + 1 = 994,009 + 1 = 994,010$\n\nNumber = $\\frac{988,071,881,449 \\times 993,013 \\times 994,010}{2}$\nNumber = $988,071,881,449 \\times 993,013 \\times 497,005$\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$993,013 \\times 497,005 = 493,539,130,565$\nNumber = $988,071,881,449 \\times 493,539,130,565 = 487,532,345,517,173,950,185$"
