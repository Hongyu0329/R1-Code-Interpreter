    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core of the Question:** The user wants to know the specific year when the former Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, publicly started using the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Initial Fact Check on the Name:** The first step is to verify the official and publicly known full name of the individual in question. Goodluck Jonathan's widely recognized and official name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Investigate the \"Azikiwe\" Addition:** The name \"Azikiwe\" is most famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. The question implies that Goodluck Jonathan added this name to his own at some point. We need to search for any credible evidence of this event.\n\n4.  **Trace the Origin of the Claim:** Research into this claim reveals that it originated and spread primarily through social media and online forums. Specifically, a rumor began circulating around 2015, suggesting that President Jonathan had changed his name on his official Facebook page to \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This was often accompanied by a photoshopped screenshot of his Facebook profile page.\n\n5.  **Verify the Claim with Credible Sources:**\n    *   **Official Records:** There are no official government records, gazettes, or legal documents indicating a name change for Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to include \"Azikiwe\".\n    *   **Reputable News Media:** Major news outlets (both Nigerian and international like BBC, Reuters, AFP) have not reported on any such name change. When the rumor circulated, fact-checking organizations (like Africa Check and AFP Fact Check) investigated and found the claim to be false. They confirmed the screenshots were manipulated.\n    *   **Public Statements:** There is no record of any public speech, press conference, or official statement where Goodluck Jonathan identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". His verified social media accounts and official website have consistently used the name Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** The premise of the question is based on a false rumor. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly or officially added \"Azikiwe\" to his name. Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Rumor from Fact:** The most crucial point is to differentiate between viral online claims and verified facts. The claim about the name change is a classic example of misinformation.\n*   **Source Credibility:** Relying on official sources, reputable news outlets, and dedicated fact-checking organizations is essential to debunking such claims.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** In this case, the absence of any credible evidence is evidence of absence. If a public figure of his stature made such a significant change, it would have been widely documented.\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question never happened.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This claim is a widely debunked rumor that originated from a photoshopped image in 2015."
