    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Family of Lines**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line with an equation of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let's denote the set of such lines by `\\mathcal{F}`.\n\nFirst, let's identify some specific lines in this family `\\mathcal{F}` by choosing some coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`:\n*   If `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `1*x + 0*y = 1`, which is `x = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `-1*x + 0*y = 1`, which is `x = -1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `0*x + 1*y = 1`, which is `y = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `0*x + -1*y = 1`, which is `y = -1`.\n\nSince the convex domain `K` must intersect all these lines, it must intersect the four lines `x = 1`, `x = -1`, `y = 1`, and `y = -1`.\n\n**Step 2: Deriving Constraints on the Convex Domain `K`**\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain.\n*   The condition that `K` intersects the line `x = 1` means there is at least one point `(x, y)` in `K` with `x = 1`. Thus, the maximum x-coordinate in `K`, denoted `x_{max}`, must be at least 1 (`x_{max} \\ge 1`).\n*   The condition that `K` intersects `x = -1` implies that the minimum x-coordinate, `x_{min}`, must be at most -1 (`x_{min} \\le -1`).\n*   The width of `K` in the x-direction is `w_x = x_{max} - x_{min}`. From the above, `w_x \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   Similarly, using the lines `y = 1` and `y = -1`, we find that the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must be at least 2 (`w_y \\ge 2`).\n\n**Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the Area of `K`**\n\nNow we have a convex domain `K` whose width in the x-direction is at least 2 and whose width in the y-direction is at least 2. We need to find the minimum possible area for such a set.\n\n1.  **Symmetrization:** Let `K` be a convex domain that satisfies the problem's conditions. Let `K_c = \\frac{1}{2}(K - K) = \\{ \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 - p_2) | p_1, p_2 \\in K \\}` be the central symmetral of `K`. `K_c` is a centrally symmetric convex body.\n    *   `K_c` is also a solution to the problem. If `K` intersects every line in `\\mathcal{F}`, so does `K_c`.\n    *   The Brunn-Minkowski inequality states that `Area(K_c) \\ge Area(K)`.\n    *   This implies that if we are looking for a domain of minimal area, we only need to consider centrally symmetric convex domains. If a non-symmetric domain `K` were minimal, then `K_c` would also be a solution, and `Area(K_c) \\ge Area(K)`, so `K_c` would also be minimal. Equality in the Brunn-Minkowski inequality holds if and only if `K` is itself centrally symmetric (up to translation). So, the minimal domain must be centrally symmetric.\n\n2.  **Area Inequality:** For any centrally symmetric convex set `K`, its area `A` is bounded by its orthogonal widths `w_x` and `w_y` by the inequality:\n    `A \\ge \\frac{w_x w_y}{2}`\n\n3.  **Applying the Bound:** Using the widths we found in Step 2 (`w_x \\ge 2` and `w_y \\ge 2`), we can find a lower bound for the area of our centrally symmetric domain `K`:\n    `Area(K) \\ge \\frac{2 \\times 2}{2} = 2`.\n    This establishes that the area of any such convex domain must be at least 2.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing a Candidate Domain and Verifying its Validity**\n\nWe need to check if an area of 2 is achievable. Let's consider a candidate domain and verify if it satisfies the conditions.\n\n1.  **Candidate Domain:** Consider the diamond-shaped region `D` defined by the inequality:\n    `|x| + |y| \\le 1`\n    This is a square with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`.\n\n2.  **Area of the Candidate:** The area of this diamond is `\\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2`, where `d_1` and `d_2` are the lengths of the diagonals. The diagonals run from `(-1, 0)` to `(1, 0)` (length 2) and from `(0, -1)` to `(0, 1)` (length 2).\n    `Area(D) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2`.\n\n3.  **Verification:** Now we must check if `D` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n    A convex set intersects a line if the values of the line's defining linear function, `f(x, y) = px + qy`, evaluated over the set, include the line's constant term (which is 1 here).\n    The extreme values of a linear function on a convex polytope like `D` occur at its vertices. Let's evaluate `f(x, y)` at the vertices of `D`:\n    *   `f(1, 0) = p`\n    *   `f(0, 1) = q`\n    *   `f(-1, 0) = -p`\n    *   `f(0, -1) = -q`\n    The range of values of `px + qy` for `(x, y)` in `D` is the interval `[min(p, q, -p, -q), max(p, q, -p, -q)]`, which is `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]`.\n    For the domain `D` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, the value `1` must be in this interval. This requires:\n    `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero.\n    *   If one of `p` or `q` is zero, say `p=0`, then `gcd(0,q) = |q| = 1`. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n    *   If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, they are non-zero integers, so `|p| \\ge 1` and `|q| \\ge 1`. Thus, `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`.\n    The condition `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1` holds true for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`. Therefore, the domain `D` intersects all lines in the family `\\mathcal{F}`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any convex domain `K` satisfying the given conditions must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific convex domain, `D = \\{(x, y) : |x| + |y| \\le 1\\}`, which satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2."
