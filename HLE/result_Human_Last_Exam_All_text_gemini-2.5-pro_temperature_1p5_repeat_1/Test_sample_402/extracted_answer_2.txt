The proposed filtering strategy is to remove genes from the differential expression results list that have a log2 Fold Change (log2FC) greater than a high threshold, as these represent cancer cell contaminants present in the CAR-only samples. A reasonable starting threshold is 5 (log2FC > 5). This can be implemented on the command line using `awk`. Assuming your differential expression results are in a tab-separated file named `your_dge_results.tsv` and the log2FC values are in the second column, the command to execute is: `awk -F'\t' 'NR==1 || !($2 > 5)' your_dge_results.tsv > filtered_dge_results.tsv`
