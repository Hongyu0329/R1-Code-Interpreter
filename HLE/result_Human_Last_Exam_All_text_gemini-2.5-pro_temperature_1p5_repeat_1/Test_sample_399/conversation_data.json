    "**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a **separable differential equation** because we can group all terms involving $x$ on one side of the equation and all terms involving $t$ on the other side.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nTo separate the variables, we can divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful Point:** We have divided by $x^2$. This is valid as long as $x(t)$ is not the zero function. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$, and the right side of the equation is $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. So $x(t)=0$ is a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8 \\neq 0$, so the particular solution we are looking for is not the zero solution. Therefore, the division is valid.\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   Left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the constant of integration, $C$. It is essential for finding the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition.\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to solve for $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\nSo, we find that $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write the Particular Solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for our initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the Value of x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo combine the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\n**Careful Point:** Be cautious with the negative signs. To solve for $x(1)$, we can first multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
