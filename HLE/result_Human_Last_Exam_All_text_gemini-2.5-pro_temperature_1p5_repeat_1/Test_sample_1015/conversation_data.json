    "Answering this question requires a detailed understanding of the technical and stylistic nuances of the Vaganova (Russian) and Balanchine (American) ballet methods. Let's break down the *cambré derrière* (a bend of the body backward) in each style.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Vaganova Method's *Cambré Derrière***:\n    *   **Emphasis**: The Vaganova method prioritizes strength, stability, and creating a pure, unbroken line. The movement is intended to be harmonious and controlled.\n    *   **Initiation**: The bend initiates from the upper back, between the shoulder blades, not by collapsing in the lower back (lumbar spine).\n    *   **Hip Placement (Crucial Point)**: To achieve this pure upper-back bend and maintain stability, the Vaganova technique dictates that the hips must remain perfectly square to the direction the dancer is facing. The pelvis is pushed slightly *forward* as a counterbalance to the upper body moving backward. This engagement of the core and forward placement of the hips protects the lower back and creates a long, elegant curve.\n    *   **Head and Arms**: The head follows the line of the spine naturally, lifting to look up and back without \"breaking\" the neck. The arms (*port de bras*) are held in precise, classical positions that complement the line of the torso.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Balanchine Method's *Cambré Derrière***:\n    *   **Emphasis**: The Balanchine style is known for its speed, dynamism, athleticism, and pushing the boundaries of classical lines to create visually exciting, often off-balance shapes.\n    *   **Initiation**: The bend is often deeper and more extreme.\n    *   **Hip Placement (Crucial Point)**: This is the key difference. To achieve a deeper, more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine technique often instructs the dancer to *release* or \"break\" one hip. Instead of keeping the pelvis square and forward, one hip (often the one on the side of the supporting leg when the other is in *tendu*) is allowed to pull back. This action sacrifices the Vaganova ideal of a stable, square foundation in favor of achieving a greater range of motion and a more dynamic, angular aesthetic.\n    *   **Head and Arms**: The head may be thrown back more dramatically. The arms can be in less conventional positions, sometimes with the signature \"Balanchine hands\" (broken wrists), adding to the energized, angular quality of the movement.\n\n### Evaluating the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé**: While arm styling differs, it's a general stylistic trait of the methods, not the primary technical difference in the mechanics of the *cambré* itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip**: This is the fundamental mechanical difference. Vaganova's square, forward hips versus Balanchine's released hip dictates the entire execution, stability, and final look of the movement. This is the core distinction.\n*   **C. Speed**: Balanchine choreography is often faster, but a *cambré* can be performed at any tempo in either style depending on the music. Speed is not the defining technical difference of the step.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend**: The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the hip placement. A very flexible Vaganova dancer can also have a deep backbend while maintaining the correct hip placement. Therefore, the hip placement is the *cause* and the more fundamental difference, not the degree of the bend itself.\n*   **E. Placement of head**: Like the arms, the head placement is a stylistic element that follows from the core mechanics. The way the torso and hips are used is the primary driver of the movement's technique.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the use of the hips. Vaganova demands square, forward hips for stability and a pure spinal curve, while Balanchine allows for a released hip to achieve greater depth and a dynamic, angular line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
