    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe question starts with a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This tells us that the man in question was the subject of one of Voznesensky's works. The description \"sailor\" points towards an explorer, traveler, or someone associated with the sea. \"Joy-discovering\" is metaphorical, suggesting he brought something new and positive, or was involved in a story of love and discovery. This specific line is from Voznesensky's famous poem \"Saga\" (and the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\"), which is dedicated to a specific historical figure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky also wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a crucial piece of information. It indicates that, at the time the poem was written (the rock opera premiered in 1981), the man's burial site was considered lost or was unknown. This significantly narrows down the possibilities to a historical figure whose final resting place was desecrated or forgotten.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This means that the mystery of the lost grave mentioned in the second clue was solved in the late 1980s. A discovery must have been made during this period that identified his remains or burial location.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information.**\nLet's connect these points.\n*   The subject of Voznesensky's poem \"Saga\" and the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian courtier, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n*   Rezanov (1764–1807) was a leader of Russia's first circumnavigation of the Earth, fitting the \"sailor\" description. His mission to California and romance with Concepción Argüello is the basis for the \"joy-discovering\" part of the story.\n*   Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. In the 1930s, the Soviet authorities destroyed the cathedral and the cemetery, and his grave was believed to be lost forever. This aligns perfectly with Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave...\".\n*   In the late 1980s, during the era of Perestroika, construction workers in Krasnoyarsk unearthed a grave believed to be that of Rezanov. His remains were later reburied with honors. This event provides the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question and matches the timeline given in the clue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll clues point to the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
