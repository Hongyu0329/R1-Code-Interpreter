    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definition of a Filled Group:**\n    *   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S` (possibly `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ∩ (S.S) = ∅`.\n    *   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n    *   **Filling Set:** A subset `S` fills `G` if the subgroup generated by `S`, denoted `<S>`, is equal to `G`.\n    *   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if every maximal product-free set `S` in `G` generates `G` (i.e., `<S>=G`).\n\n2.  **Use a Characterization Theorem:**\n    A direct application of the definition is complex. A key theorem by V.A. Belonogov provides a more tractable characterization:\n    **Theorem:** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if its Frattini subgroup `Φ(G)` is trivial (`Φ(G) = {e}`) and `G` has a unique minimal normal subgroup.\n    We will use this theorem to find the specified groups.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`:**\n    *   Let `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n    *   By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo `q`. Since `q` is an odd prime (`q ≥ 3`), `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)` implies `n_q` can be 1, `q+1`, etc. The only possibility that also divides 2 is `n_q=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `G` must have a unique, and thus normal, Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `P`. We have `|P| = q^m` and `P ◁ G`.\n    *   Let `Q` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|Q| = 2`, so `Q ≅ C₂`, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   `G` is a semidirect product `G = P ⋊ Q`. Since `P` is normal, this structure is guaranteed.\n    *   The question asks for *nonabelian* groups. If the semidirect product were trivial (i.e., a direct product `G = P × Q`), `G` would be nilpotent. A nonabelian nilpotent group `G = P × C_2` would require `P` to be nonabelian. However, for a filled group, as we will see, `P` must be abelian, leading to a contradiction. Specifically, if `G = P × C₂`, `G` being non-abelian means `P` must be non-abelian. But `Φ(G) = Φ(P) × Φ(C₂) = Φ(P)`. For `G` to be filled, `Φ(P)` must be `{e}`, which implies `P` is elementary abelian, which is a contradiction to `P` being non-abelian. Thus, the direct product case yields no solutions, and the semidirect product must be non-trivial.\n\n4.  **Apply the `Φ(G) = {e}` Condition:**\n    *   For a semidirect product `G = K ⋊ H` where `gcd(|K|, |H|) = 1`, there's a formula for the Frattini subgroup: `Φ(G) = Φ(K)^H`, where `Φ(K)^H` is the largest `H`-invariant subgroup contained in `Φ(K)`.\n    *   In our case, `G = P ⋊ Q`, with `|P|=q^m` and `|Q|=2`. Since `q` is odd, `gcd(q^m, 2) = 1`. Let `α` be the automorphism of `P` defining the action of the non-identity element of `Q`.\n    *   `Φ(G) = Φ(P)^Q`. The Frattini subgroup `Φ(P)` is a *characteristic* subgroup of `P`, meaning it is invariant under all automorphisms of `P`, including `α`. Therefore, `α(Φ(P)) = Φ(P)`.\n    *   This simplifies the condition to `Φ(G) = Φ(P)`.\n    *   For `G` to be filled, we need `Φ(G) = {e}`, which implies `Φ(P) = {e}`.\n    *   A finite `p`-group (here a `q`-group) has a trivial Frattini subgroup if and only if it is elementary abelian.\n    *   So, `P` must be an elementary abelian `q`-group of order `q^m`, which means `P ≅ (C_q)^m`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Unique Minimal Normal Subgroup Condition:**\n    *   We now have `G ≅ (C_q)^m ⋊α C₂`, where the action `α` is non-trivial.\n    *   Any minimal normal subgroup `N` of `G` must be a `p`-group for some prime `p`. The primes are `q` and 2. It cannot be a 2-group, as a normal subgroup of order 2 would be central, but the center of `G` is a subgroup of `P` (a `q`-group). Thus, `N` must be a `q`-group, so `N ⊆ P`.\n    *   A subgroup of `P` is normal in `G` if and only if it is invariant under the action `α`.\n    *   So, we need `P ≅ (C_q)^m` to have a **unique minimal `α`-invariant subgroup**.\n    *   We can view `P` as an `m`-dimensional vector space `V` over the field `F_q`. The automorphism `α` is an `F_q`-linear map on `V` satisfying `α² = I` (identity). Minimal `α`-invariant subgroups are irreducible `α`-invariant subspaces.\n    *   Since `q` is an odd prime, the characteristic of `F_q` is not 2. Thus, the minimal polynomial of `α`, `x² - 1`, splits into distinct linear factors `(x-1)(x+1)` over `F_q`. This means `α` is diagonalizable.\n    *   `V` can be decomposed into a direct sum of eigenspaces: `V = V_1 ⊕ V_{-1}`, where `V_1` is the (+1)-eigenspace and `V_{-1}` is the (-1)-eigenspace.\n    *   The minimal `α`-invariant subspaces are one-dimensional and must belong entirely to either `V_1` or `V_{-1}`.\n    *   Let `k = dim(V_1)` and `l = dim(V_{-1})`. We have `k+l=m`. The number of one-dimensional subspaces in `V_1` is `(q^k - 1)/(q - 1)` and in `V_{-1}` is `(q^l - 1)/(q - 1)`.\n    *   For `G` to have a unique minimal normal subgroup, the total number of such subspaces must be 1:\n        `(q^k - 1)/(q - 1) + (q^l - 1)/(q - 1) = 1`\n    *   Since `q ≥ 3`, the term `(q^d - 1)/(q - 1)` is greater than 1 if `d ≥ 2`. To satisfy the equation, `k` and `l` can only be 0 or 1.\n    *   The only possible solutions for `(k, l)` are `(1, 0)` and `(0, 1)`.\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Groups:**\n    *   In both cases, `m = k + l = 1`. This restricts the problem to groups of order `2q`.\n    *   **Case (k,l) = (1,0):** `m=1`, so `P ≅ C_q`. The action `α` is trivial (all vectors are in the +1 eigenspace). This makes `G = C_q × C₂`, which is abelian. The problem specifies nonabelian groups.\n    *   **Case (k,l) = (0,1):** `m=1`, so `P ≅ C_q`. The action `α` is inversion (`α(p) = p⁻¹` for `p ∈ P`), as all vectors are in the -1 eigenspace. The resulting group `G = C_q ⋊ C₂` is the **dihedral group of order `2q`**, denoted `D_{2q}`. This group is nonabelian for any odd prime `q`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows that the only nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that satisfy the conditions for being filled are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}`, which correspond to the case `m=1`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` (where `m=1`)."
