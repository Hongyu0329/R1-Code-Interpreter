    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve.**\nThe given parametric equations, x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), describe a type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. In this specific case, the parameters are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the condition for a self-intersection.**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different values of the parameter t. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points (x, y) for which (x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2)) for some t1 ≠ t2.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe curve traces its complete path and then repeats. We need to find the range of t that covers exactly one full cycle of the curve.\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π / 9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π / 5.\nThe period of the entire curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods:\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, we consider the parameter t in an interval of length 2π, for instance, [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 4: Use the standard formula for self-intersections of Lissajous curves.**\nFor a Lissajous curve given by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where a and b are integers, there is a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points, provided that a and b are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points (N) is:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Check if the formula is applicable:** The formula requires that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1.\n    *   In our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n    *   GCD(9, 5) = 1.\n    *   Since the condition is met, the formula can be applied directly.\n\n2.  **Phase shift:** The general form of a Lissajous curve is x(t) = A sin(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt). Our curve can be written as x(t) = sin(9t + π/2) and y(t) = sin(5t). The number of self-intersections is independent of the amplitudes (A, B) and the phase shift (δ), as long as the curve is not degenerate (which it isn't, as a and b are coprime).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nSubstitute the values of a=9 and b=5 into the formula:\nN = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\nN = 8 * 4 / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n- The curve is a Lissajous curve with parameters a=9, b=5.\n- The parameters are coprime, GCD(9,5)=1.\n- The standard formula for the number of self-intersections is N = (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n- Plugging in the values gives N = (9-1)(5-1)/2 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
