    "Answering this question involves determining the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a specific fragment of first-order logic. Let's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Logical Language**\n\nThe schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n\nThe logical language is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. This means the formulas are constructed using:\n*   **Atoms:** The unary predicates from $S$ applied to a variable, e.g., $P_i(z)$.\n*   **Logical Connectives:** $\\land$ (conjunction/AND), $\\top$ (true), $\\bot$ (false).\n*   **Quantifier:** $\\exists$ (existential quantifier).\n\nWe are interested in the VC dimension of the set of classifiers defined by this language. A classifier is a formula with one free variable, say $x$. An element $a$ from the universe of a model is classified as positive if the model satisfies the formula when $x$ is interpreted as $a$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Classifiers**\n\nLet $\\phi(x)$ be a formula in this language with one free variable $x$. What is its structure?\nA formula in this language is a conjunction of simpler formulas. Each of these simpler formulas can be an atom, a constant ($\\top$ or $\\bot$), or an existentially quantified formula.\n\n*   Any atomic formula must use a predicate from $S$. If it involves the free variable $x$, it's of the form $P_i(x)$.\n*   If an atomic formula involves another variable, say $y$, like $P_j(y)$, then for the whole formula $\\phi(x)$ to only have $x$ as a free variable, $y$ must be bound by an existential quantifier. For example, $\\exists y . P_j(y)$.\n*   A formula like $\\exists y . (\\dots)$ is a *sentence* (it has no free variables). For any given model (structure), a sentence is either simply true or false for the entire model.\n\nTherefore, any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written in an equivalent form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\Psi(x) \\land \\Theta$\nwhere:\n*   $\\Psi(x)$ is a conjunction of all atomic formulas with the free variable $x$. So, $\\Psi(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   $\\Theta$ is a conjunction of sentences. Since the truth value of a conjunction of sentences is fixed within a given model, $\\Theta$ is either true or false in that model.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Classification Power**\n\nLet's fix a model $\\mathcal{A}$. The set of elements classified as positive by $\\phi(x)$ is $\\{a \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\nLet's analyze the formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land \\Theta$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\mathcal{A} \\not\\models \\Theta$.** The sentence $\\Theta$ is false in the model. In this case, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false), and it classifies no elements. The resulting set of positive examples is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   **Case 2: $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\Theta$.** The sentence $\\Theta$ is true in the model. In this case, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. The set of positive examples is $\\{a \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\}$.\n\nThis means that for any given model $\\mathcal{A}$, the set of all concepts (subsets of the universe) that can be defined by our language is a subset of the concepts definable by formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ (where $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$), plus the empty set.\n\nThese formulas, which are conjunctions of positive predicates, are known as **monotone monomials**. Our problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of the class of monotone monomials over 4 features (the predicates $P_1, \\ldots, P_4$).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the VC Dimension of Monotone Monomials**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_k^{mon}$ be the class of concepts defined by monotone monomials over $k$ variables. A well-known result in learning theory states that the VC dimension of this class is $k$. For our problem, we have $k=4$ predicates, so the VC dimension is 4.\n\nLet's briefly justify this result.\n*   **VC-dim($\\mathcal{H}_4^{mon}$) $\\le 4$:** The number of distinct monotone monomials is $2^4 = 16$. By Sauer's Lemma, the VC dimension $d$ must satisfy $| \\mathcal{H} | \\ge \\binom{d}{0} + \\binom{d}{1} + \\dots + \\binom{d}{d_H}$ where $d_H = VCdim(H)$. More simply, $VCdim(H) \\le \\log_2(|H|)$, so $d \\le \\log_2(16) = 4$. So, the VC dimension cannot be greater than 4.\n\n*   **VC-dim($\\mathcal{H}_4^{mon}$) $\\ge 4$:** To prove this, we must show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. \"Shattered\" means that for any labeling of the 4 points (i.e., any subset), there is a monomial that correctly classifies them.\n    Let's choose a model $\\mathcal{A}$ with a universe containing four specific elements, $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We define the interpretation of our predicates on these elements as follows (this corresponds to points in $\\{0,1\\}^4$ that have exactly one zero):\n    *   $a_1 \\leftrightarrow (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n    *   $a_2 \\leftrightarrow (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n    *   $a_3 \\leftrightarrow (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n    *   $a_4 \\leftrightarrow (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n    Where the $j$-th component of the tuple for $a_i$ represents the truth value of $P_j(a_i)$. For example, $P_1(a_1)$ is false, while $P_2(a_1)$, $P_3(a_1)$, and $P_4(a_1)$ are true.\n\n    Now, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we need to find a monomial $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$ that is true for all $a \\in Y$ and false for all $a \\in X \\setminus Y$.\n    Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid a_i \\notin Y\\}$. We claim that the monomial $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_Y} P_j(x)$ shatters the set.\n    Let's check this. An element $a_k \\in X$ satisfies this monomial if and only if $P_j(a_k)$ is true for all $j \\in I_Y$. By our construction, $P_j(a_k)$ is true if and only if $j \\neq k$.\n    So, $a_k$ satisfies $\\phi_Y(x) \\iff$ for all $j \\in I_Y$, $j \\neq k \\iff k \\notin I_Y$.\n    By definition of $I_Y$, $k \\notin I_Y \\iff a_k \\in Y$.\n    So, $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_Y(a_k)$ if and only if $a_k \\in Y$. This construction works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$. Therefore, the set $X$ is shattered.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension of monotone monomials over 4 predicates is at least 4.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two parts:\n1.  The classification power of the language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is upper-bounded by the power of monotone monomials over 4 predicates. So, its VC dimension is at most 4.\n2.  We showed that we can construct a model that shatters a set of 4 points using only formulas corresponding to monotone monomials. These formulas are part of our language. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nFrom these points, we conclude that the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
