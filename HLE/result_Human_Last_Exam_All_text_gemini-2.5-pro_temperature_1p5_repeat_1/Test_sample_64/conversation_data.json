    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Pronunciation:**\n    The word in question is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the Morae:**\n    Japanese pitch accent is based on morae (the basic units of sound, similar to syllables). Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' serves to lengthen the 'o' vowel of 'to', creating 'tō')\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    So, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n3.  **Define the Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Critically, when a particle (like が, は, を) is attached, the particle also has a high pitch. This is often represented as [0].\n        *   Example: さくら (sa-ku-ra) → さくらが (sa-KU-RA-GA) [L-H-H-H]\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae. The following particle is also low. This is represented as [1].\n        *   Example: はし (ha-shi, chopsticks) → はしが (HA-shi-ga) [H-L-L]\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word itself. The following particle is low. The accent falls on a mora in the middle of the word.\n        *   Example: こころ (ko-ko-ro) → こころが (ko-KO-ro-ga) [L-H-L-L]. Accent on the 2nd mora.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora. The pitch drops on the following particle. The accent is on the final mora of the word.\n        *   Example: やま (ya-ma) → やまが (ya-MA-ga) [L-H-L]\n\n4.  **Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (おとうと):**\n    *   The standard Tokyo pitch accent for 「おとうと」 starts low and rises.\n    *   Let's see how the pitch unfolds across the morae:\n        *   お (o) is **low**.\n        *   と (to) is **high**.\n        *   う (u) is **high**.\n        *   と (to) is **high**.\n    *   So, the pattern within the word is [Low-High-High-High].\n    *   Now, we must check what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached. This is the key to distinguishing between Heiban and Odaka.\n    *   For 「弟」, the phrase 「弟が」 is pronounced [o-TO-U-TO-ga], with the particle 「が」 remaining **high**.\n        *   お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H)\n\n5.  **Match the Pattern to the Definitions:**\n    *   The pattern for 「弟」 is [Low-High-High-High], and the pitch stays high on the following particle.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description of the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent in Japanese is tied to morae, not syllables. For 「おとうと」, it's crucial to recognize the four distinct morae (o-to-u-to).\n*   **The Role of Particles:** The behavior of the pitch on the particle following the noun is essential for distinguishing between Heiban (stays high) and Odaka (drops low). For 「弟」, the particle 「が」 stays high, confirming the Heiban pattern.\n*   **Standard Accent:** The question asks for the *standard* pattern, which refers to the Tokyo dialect (also known as 共通語 - kyōtsūgo, or common language). Other dialects might have different patterns.\n*   **Accent Notation:** In dictionaries, Heiban is often noted as [0]. This means the \"accent kernel\" (the point where the pitch drops) does not occur within the word; it's considered to be \"at position zero\".\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe word 「弟」 (otouto) follows a Low-High-High-High pitch pattern, and the pitch remains high when a particle is attached. This is the definition of the Heiban pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
