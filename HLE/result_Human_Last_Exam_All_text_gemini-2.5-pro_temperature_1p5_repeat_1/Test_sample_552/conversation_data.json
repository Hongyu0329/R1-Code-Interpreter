    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question**: The question asks to identify the person whose lectures were cited by Albert Einstein in his specific 1905 scientific paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Paper**: The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"annus mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Investigate the Citations within the Paper**: The next step is to examine the paper itself for citations, either in footnotes, a reference list, or mentions within the text.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: A direct analysis of the original 1905 paper published in *Annalen der Physik* shows that it contains **no formal citations or bibliography**. This is a well-known characteristic of this paper, similar to his famous 1905 paper on special relativity. Prominent Einstein biographers, such as Abraham Pais in \"Subtle is the Lord...\", confirm this lack of references.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate the Question's Premise**: Given that there are no formal citations, the question might be slightly inaccurate. It could be conflating a formal *citation* with a known major *influence*. In historical and trivia contexts, this distinction is often blurred.\n\n5.  **Investigate Influences on Einstein's Work**: While Einstein did not cite previous work in the paper, his theory was built upon the foundations of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat and statistical mechanics, primarily developed in the 19th century.\n    *   **Careful Point 2**: We must look for the most significant influence that matches the description \"lectures.\"\n\n6.  **Identify the Specific Influence**: In his later writings, particularly his \"Autobiographical Notes\" (1946), Einstein explicitly stated the scientists whose work he had studied and been influenced by. For his work on statistical physics, he credited Ludwig Boltzmann.\n    *   **Careful Point 3**: The specific work by Boltzmann that Einstein studied was his famous book, **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**:\n    *   Strictly speaking, Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 Brownian motion paper because the paper contains no citations at all.\n    *   However, the question is very likely referring to the primary intellectual influence on this work, which came from published lectures.\n    *   Einstein himself later acknowledged the profound impact of Ludwig Boltzmann's book, \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" on his thinking.\n    *   Therefore, the intended answer to the question is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis reveals that although the paper itself lacks formal citations, the most direct and acknowledged influence matching the description \"lectures\" is from the published work of Ludwig Boltzmann. His book, \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" was a foundational text for Einstein. Thus, he is the person whose lectures (in book form) are considered the key precursor to Einstein's paper.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
