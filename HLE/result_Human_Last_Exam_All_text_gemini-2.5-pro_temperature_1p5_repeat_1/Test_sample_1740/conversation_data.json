    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe user wants to know the total number of members in the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define the let-7 Family**\nThe let-7 family is a group of highly conserved and evolutionarily ancient microRNAs. Members of a miRNA family share a similar \"seed sequence\" (nucleotides 2-8 of the mature miRNA), which means they are predicted to regulate an overlapping set of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The let-7 family is a crucial regulator of developmental timing and is often described as a tumor suppressor.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Authoritative Source**\nThe primary and most widely accepted repository for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. We will base our analysis on the data available in the latest release of miRBase.\n\n**Step 4: Differentiate Between \"Members\" and \"Genes\"**\nThis is the most critical point for an accurate answer. The term \"member\" can be ambiguous:\n*   **Distinct Mature miRNA Sequences:** This refers to the number of unique functional miRNA molecules (e.g., let-7a, let-7b are two distinct members).\n*   **Gene Loci (Precursors):** This refers to the number of distinct genes in the genome that encode for these miRNAs. Sometimes, the same mature miRNA can be produced from multiple different genes (these are called paralogs).\n\nTo be thorough, we should analyze both, but the number of gene loci represents the total count of identified genetic elements for the family.\n\n**Step 5: Enumerate the Members based on their Designation**\nFirst, we list the let-7 members that are designated by a letter. In humans (*Homo sapiens*, prefix \"hsa\"), these are:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** There is no `let-7h` identified in the human genome, although it exists in other species like mice. This is a common point of confusion.\n\n**Step 6: Include Other Official Members of the Family**\nBased on seed sequence similarity, another miRNA, **miR-98**, is classified as belonging to the let-7 family. So, adding this to our list gives us 9 distinct types of mature miRNAs.\n*   Total distinct mature sequences = 8 (let-7a to let-7i) + 1 (miR-98) = **9 members**.\n\n**Step 7: Count the Total Number of Genes (Loci)**\nNow we must account for the paralogs (multiple genes encoding the same miRNA). According to miRBase:\n*   `let-7a` is encoded by **3** distinct genes: `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`.\n*   `let-7b` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `let-7c` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `let-7d` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `let-7e` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `let-7f` is encoded by **2** distinct genes: `hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`.\n*   `let-7g` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `let-7i` is encoded by **1** gene.\n*   `miR-98` is encoded by **1** gene.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the Final Number**\nLet's sum the number of genes identified:\nTotal genes = 3 (for let-7a) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = **12**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question \"how many members... have been identified\" most accurately refers to the distinct gene loci discovered in the human genome. While these 12 genes produce 9 types of mature let-7 family miRNAs, the total number of identified genetic members is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
