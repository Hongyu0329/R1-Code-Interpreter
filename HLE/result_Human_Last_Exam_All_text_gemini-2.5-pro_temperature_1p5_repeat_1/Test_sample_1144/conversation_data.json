    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal.**\n*   **Given:**\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, which means the principal quantum number is $n=1$.\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   **Goal:**\n    *   Find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) to the momentum ($p$) of the electron. This is the value of $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the formulas and constants needed.**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The relationship for minimum uncertainty is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$).\n\n*   **Bohr's Model for the Hydrogen Atom:** This model provides the value for the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit.\n    *   The angular momentum ($L$) is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$.\n    *   Since linear momentum is $p = mv$, we can write this as $p \\cdot r = n\\hbar$.\n    *   The radius of the $n$-th Bohr orbit is given by $r_n = n^2 a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius.\n    *   For the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$), the radius is $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Step 3: List careful points and conversions.**\n1.  **Units:** The uncertainty in position is given in picometers (pm), while the Bohr radius and other constants are in SI units (meters). A conversion is necessary.\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n2.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** The problem implies a calculation based on the limits set by quantum mechanics, so we use the equality in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$), which corresponds to the minimum possible uncertainty.\n3.  **Formulas:** We need to correctly apply the formulas for both the uncertainty in momentum and the momentum itself.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step A: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the momentum ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit.**\nFrom Bohr's model for $n=1$:\n$p \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step C: Find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\nNow, we can set up the ratio using the expressions from Step A and Step B.\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{(\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x))}{(\\hbar / r_1)}$\n\nNotice that the reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, cancels out, which simplifies the calculation significantly:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step D: Substitute the numerical values and calculate the final answer.**\n*   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
