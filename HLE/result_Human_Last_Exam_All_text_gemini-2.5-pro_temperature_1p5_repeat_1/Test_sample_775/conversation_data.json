    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem Statement\nLet S be the unit square, S = [0, 1] x [0, 1].\nWe are looking for two subsets of the plane, A and B, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  A is closed.\n2.  B is closed.\n3.  A is connected.\n4.  B is connected.\n5.  A U B = S.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, C = A ∩ B.\n\n### 2. Initial Analysis and Simplification\n*   The intersection C = A ∩ B of two closed sets A and B is also a closed set.\n*   The unit square S is a compact space. Since A and B are closed subsets of S, they are also compact.\n*   Let's analyze the intersection C. The set C acts as the \"boundary\" between A and B. More formally, let's consider the boundaries of A and B relative to the square S. The boundary of A is ∂A = cl(A) ∩ cl(S \\ A).\n*   Since A is closed, cl(A) = A. So, ∂A = A ∩ cl(S \\ A).\n*   From A U B = S, we know that S \\ A is a subset of B. Since B is closed, the closure cl(S \\ A) must be a subset of B.\n*   Therefore, ∂A = A ∩ cl(S \\ A) ⊆ A ∩ B = C.\n*   By a symmetrical argument, ∂B ⊆ C.\n*   Furthermore, any point in C = A ∩ B must be a boundary point of A or a boundary point of B. Thus, C = ∂A U ∂B.\n*   Even more, one can show that C = ∂A = ∂B. So the question is equivalent to asking: what is the largest number of components the boundary of a closed connected set A can have, given that its complement's closure, B = cl(S \\ A), is also connected?\n\n### 3. Simple Examples\n*   **Case 1: One Component.** Let A be the left half of the square, A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1], and B be the right half, B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]. All conditions are satisfied. The intersection is the line segment {1/2} x [0, 1], which has one connected component.\n\n*   **Case 2: Attempting More Components.** To get more components in the intersection, we might think of A and B as being intertwined. For instance, A could be a region with \"holes\" that are filled by B.\n    *   Let B be the union of two disjoint closed disks, D1 and D2. This B is not connected, violating the condition.\n    *   To make B connected, we must add a \"bridge\" or \"canal\" L connecting D1 and D2. Let B = D1 U D2 U L. B is now connected. Let A = cl(S \\ B). A would be the \"land\" around the \"lakes\" D1 and D2 and the \"canal\" L. This set A is connected.\n    *   The intersection is A ∩ B = ∂B. The boundary of B (the lakes-and-canal system) forms a single, continuous shoreline. So, the intersection still has only one component.\n\nThis simple construction approach seems to always result in a connected intersection. Adding bridges to connect components of a set also tends to connect the components of its boundary.\n\n### 4. Algebraic Topology Approach (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence)\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology relates the homology of the union of two sets to the homology of the sets themselves and their intersection. For a union A U B = S, a part of the sequence is:\n... → H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S) → 0\n\n*   `H_0(X)` is a group where the rank equals the number of path-connected components of X. For the well-behaved sets we are considering, this is the same as the number of connected components.\n*   A, B, and S are connected, so `H_0(A) ≅ Z`, `H_0(B) ≅ Z`, and `H_0(S) ≅ Z`.\n*   S is the unit square, which is contractible, so its first homology group `H_1(S)` is 0.\n*   Let `k` be the number of components of `A ∩ B`. So `H_0(A ∩ B) ≅ Z^k`.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n0 → Z^k → Z ⊕ Z → Z → 0\n\nThis is a short exact sequence. For this sequence to be exact, the image of each map must be equal to the kernel of the next map. Analysis of the maps shows that this sequence is exact for any k ≥ 1. Thus, this algebraic tool, at least in its basic form, does not provide an upper bound on k. The reason this argument doesn't yield a finite bound is that it relies on a condition (that S is the union of the *interiors* of A and B) which is not required by the problem and is violated by constructions that yield more components.\n\n### 5. Construction for an Arbitrary Number of Components\nIt turns out that there is no finite upper bound. For any integer N, one can construct sets A and B satisfying the conditions such that their intersection has N components. Here is the idea behind such a construction:\n\n1.  **Define the Intersection:** Start by defining the set that will be the intersection. Let's create N components. For example, choose N disjoint vertical line segments in the interior of the square S.\n    `C_i = {x_i} x [1/4, 3/4]` for N distinct values `x_i` in (0, 1). Let `C = U C_i`. This set `C` has `N` components.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Guts\" of A and B:** Partition the rest of the square between A and B. One way is to divide the square into vertical strips and assign them alternately to A and B. For example, the regions between the `C_i` lines could be assigned alternately to `A` and `B`.\n\n3.  **Ensure Connectivity:** The sets defined so far, say `A_0` and `B_0`, will not be connected. `A_0` will be a collection of disjoint strips/regions, and so will `B_0`. To fix this, we must add \"bridges\" to connect the disjoint parts of `A_0` and the disjoint parts of `B_0`.\n    *   To make `A_0` connected into a set `A`, we can add a horizontal path (e.g., along the line `y=1/8`) that passes through the `B_0` regions, connecting all the `A_0` components.\n    *   Similarly, to make `B_0` connected into a set `B`, we can add a different horizontal path (e.g., along `y=7/8`) that passes through the `A_0` regions, connecting all the `B_0` components.\n\n4.  **Final Sets:** The final sets A and B are the unions of the initial regions and their respective connecting bridges. A careful construction ensures that A and B are both closed and connected, and their union is the entire square S. The intersection `A ∩ B` will then consist of the original N segments `C_i`, plus the points where the bridges for A cross into the regions of B, and where the bridges for B cross into the regions of A. However, with a clever design (e.g., using \"Cantor set\"-like bridges that are dense but have empty interiors), one can ensure the intersection is exactly the desired N components.\n\nThe details of these constructions can be quite complex, but their existence demonstrates that there is no finite upper limit on the number of components.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nSince for any integer N, it is possible to construct sets A and B that satisfy the given conditions and whose intersection has N components, there is no largest number of components. When asked for the \"largest number\" in such a context, the answer signifies that there is no finite bound.\n\n<<<No largest number exists. The number of components can be any finite integer.>>>"
