    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring with a specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$). This is a strong and sterically bulky base.\n*   **Solvent:** Tert-butyl alcohol ($(CH_3)_3COH$). This is the conjugate acid of the base, a typical solvent for E2 reactions to suppress substitution side reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base favors an elimination reaction. Because the base is strong, the mechanism will be a bimolecular elimination, or **E2 reaction**. The bulky nature of the tert-butoxide base also strongly favors elimination over substitution (SN2).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means that both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in **axial** positions, one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Chair Conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**\nFirst, we determine the relative orientation of the substituents. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R) stereochemistry means the two substituents (bromo and methyl) are **trans** to each other. In a planar drawing, one would be on a wedge and the other on a dash.\nA trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations:\n1.  **Diequatorial (e,e):** Both the bromo group and the methyl group are in equatorial positions.\n2.  **Diaxial (a,a):** Both the bromo group and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n\n**Careful Point:** The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable than the diaxial conformation because placing bulky groups in axial positions leads to unfavorable 1,3-diaxial steric strain. Therefore, the molecule will predominantly exist in the diequatorial form at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Reactive Conformation for the E2 Reaction**\nDespite the diequatorial conformer being more stable, the E2 reaction can *only* occur from the conformer where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the minor, less stable **diaxial** conformer. The equilibrium between the two chairs, though favoring the diequatorial form, will continuously supply the reactive diaxial conformer as it is consumed by the reaction (Le Ch√¢telier's principle).\n\n**Step 6: Analyze Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Diaxial Conformer**\nLet's analyze the diaxial conformer. The bromo group on C1 is axial, and the methyl group on C2 is also axial. For elimination to occur, we need an axial beta-hydrogen. There are two beta-carbons: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Beta-hydrogen on C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position on C2. This means the hydrogen on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. **Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is not possible.**\n\n*   **Beta-hydrogen on C6:** The C6 carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen on C6** is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. **Therefore, elimination can only occur by removing this proton.**\n\n**Step 7: Identify the Final Product**\nSince the E2 reaction can only proceed by removing the axial proton from C6, the double bond will form exclusively between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is unaffected. The resulting product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   The reaction is E2, not SN2, E1, or SN1.\n*   The E2 reaction requires an anti-periplanar (axial-axial) arrangement in cyclohexanes.\n*   The starting material is trans, existing as an equilibrium between a stable diequatorial conformer and an unstable diaxial conformer.\n*   The reaction *must* proceed through the unstable diaxial conformer because only it has an axial leaving group.\n*   In the reactive diaxial conformer, there is no anti-periplanar proton on C2, preventing the formation of the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n*   The only available anti-periplanar proton is on C6, forcing the reaction to form the less substituted Hofmann-like product (3-methylcyclohexene). Here, the product is dictated by stereoelectronic constraints, not by the steric bulk of the base (Zaitsev vs Hofmann rules).\n\nThe final product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
