    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the Chern number of a composite system. This system is formed by laterally joining two individual Chern insulators. We are given the key properties of the individual components and their connection.\n\n*   **System Components:** Two Chern insulators.\n*   **Topological Property:** Each insulator has a Chern number (C) of 1.\n*   **Geometry:** They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a single, larger 2D system.\n*   **Coupling:** The \"tunneling barrier is negligible.\" This is a crucial piece of information that dictates how the two systems interact.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Chern Number as a Topological Invariant:** The Chern number is an integer topological invariant that characterizes the bulk electronic band structure of a 2D gapped system. It is robust against continuous deformations of the system's Hamiltonian as long as the energy gap does not close.\n\n2.  **Additivity of the Chern Number:** A key property of the Chern number is that it is additive. When two gapped topological systems are combined to form a single, larger gapped system, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\n3.  **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This condition is the physical justification for treating the two insulators as a single, coherent quantum system rather than two separate, non-interacting entities. Strong coupling between the systems ensures that their electronic bands hybridize, forming a new band structure for the composite system. This allows the application of the additivity principle. If the barrier were infinite, we would simply have two disconnected systems, and asking for \"the\" Chern number of the junction would be meaningless.\n\n4.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** The Chern number of the bulk dictates the number of protected chiral edge states at its boundary. For a system with Chern number C, there are |C| chiral edge states at an interface with a trivial insulator (like a vacuum, with C=0). While this is a consequence of the bulk topology, it can serve as a useful conceptual check.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Identify the individual systems and their properties:**\n    *   Let the first Chern insulator be denoted as System 1, with Chern number `C₁ = 1`.\n    *   Let the second Chern insulator be denoted as System 2, with Chern number `C₂ = 1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the combined system:**\n    *   The two systems are joined to form a single composite system, which we can call the \"junction\" or System_total.\n    *   The condition of \"negligible tunneling barrier\" ensures that we can treat System_total as a single Hamiltonian system whose topological properties can be determined.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of additivity for Chern numbers:**\n    *   The Chern number of a composite system formed by combining two subsystems is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems.\n    *   `C_total = C₁ + C₂`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final Chern number:**\n    *   Substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   `C_total = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n**Conclusion:** The Chern number of the junction is 2. This implies that the combined system, as a whole, is a new topological phase with two co-propagating chiral edge states at its boundary with the vacuum. The internal boundary between the two C=1 regions will have no net edge states (`ΔC = C₂ - C₁ = 1 - 1 = 0`), meaning the interface is gapped.\n\n<<<2>>>"
