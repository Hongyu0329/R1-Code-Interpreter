    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects**\n*   **C:** A Riemann surface of genus `g = 3`. This is a smooth, complex projective algebraic curve.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted `X = Sym^{15}(C)`. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension `d = 15`.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on X. Its rank, `rho(X)`, is called the Picard number of X. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of `rho(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the properties of C**\nA fundamental result concerning the cohomology and algebraic cycles of symmetric powers of a curve provides a crucial relationship. For a curve `C` of genus `g` and its `d`-th symmetric power `Sym^d(C)`, there is an isomorphism relating their Neron-Severi groups, provided that the degree `d` is sufficiently large.\nSpecifically, for `d \\ge g`, we have an isomorphism of rational vector spaces:\n`NS(Sym^d(C)) ⊗ ℚ ≅ (NS(C) ⊗ ℚ) ⊕ (NS(J(C)) ⊗ ℚ)`\nwhere `J(C)` is the Jacobian variety of `C`.\n\nBy taking the dimension of these vector spaces, we get a formula for the Picard numbers:\n`rho(Sym^d(C)) = rho(C) + rho(J(C))`\n\nIn this problem, `d = 15` and `g = 3`. Since `15 \\ge 3`, the condition is satisfied. Thus, we have:\n`rho(X) = rho(C) + rho(J(C))`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the rank `rho(C)`**\nFor any smooth projective curve `C`, its Neron-Severi group `NS(C)` is isomorphic to the group of integers `ℤ`, generated by the class of a point. Therefore, the rank is always 1, regardless of the curve's specific geometry.\n`rho(C) = 1`\nOur formula for the rank of `NS(X)` simplifies to:\n`rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C))`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the possible range of `rho(J(C))`**\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n*   `J(C)` is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g = 3`.\n*   The Picard number `rho(A)` of any complex projective variety `A` is bounded above by its Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`. For an abelian variety of dimension `g`, `h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`.\n*   Since `J(C)` is a projective variety, it has at least one algebraic cycle class from a hyperplane section, so `rho(J(C)) \\ge 1`.\n*   For our case `A = J(C)` with `g=3`, we have `h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   Therefore, the possible range for the Picard number of the Jacobian is `1 \\le rho(J(C)) \\le 9`.\n\n**Step 5: Verify if the bounds for `rho(J(C))` are achievable**\nWe need to confirm that there exist genus 3 curves for which `rho(J(C))` attains these minimum and maximum values.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank:** For a *very general* curve `C` of genus 3, its Jacobian `J(C)` has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = ℤ`. For such an abelian variety, all algebraic cycles are generated by the principal polarization (the theta divisor). This implies that its Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` has rank 1. Thus, `rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1` is achievable.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank:** The maximum rank `rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9` is achieved if all Hodge classes of type (1,1) on `J(C)` are algebraic. This happens for abelian varieties with sufficiently many endomorphisms, known as abelian varieties of CM-type (Complex Multiplication). There exist special curves of genus 3 whose Jacobians are of CM-type. A famous example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`, which has genus 3. Its Jacobian is known to be of CM-type and `rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9`. Thus, `rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9` is also achievable.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the smallest and largest rank of NS(X)**\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps using the formula `rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C))`.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    This occurs when `C` is a very general curve, so `rho(J(C)) = 1`.\n    `rho_{min}(X) = 1 + rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    This occurs when `C` is a special curve like the Fermat quartic, so `rho(J(C)) = 9`.\n    `rho_{max}(X) = 1 + rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
