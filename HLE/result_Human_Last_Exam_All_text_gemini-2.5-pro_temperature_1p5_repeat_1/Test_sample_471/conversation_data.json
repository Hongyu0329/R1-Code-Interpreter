    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the mathematical objects involved.**\n\n*   **The 2-Torus ($T^2$)**: This is a surface shaped like a donut. Mathematically, it's the product of two circles, $S^1 \\times S^1$. It is a compact, connected, and orientable manifold without a boundary. Compactness is a crucial property.\n*   **A smooth function $f : T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$**: This is a function from the torus to the real numbers that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Points**: A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative (gradient) of $f$ at $p$ is zero. At such points, the tangent plane to the graph of $f$ is horizontal.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a basic lower bound for the number of critical points.**\n\n*   Because the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function on it (including any smooth function) must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n*   At these points of maximum and minimum value, the derivative of the smooth function $f$ must be zero. Therefore, these are critical points.\n*   If the function $f$ is not constant, the maximum value will be strictly greater than the minimum value, and the points where they are achieved will be distinct.\n*   Thus, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points: one maximum and one minimum.\n\n**Step 3: Use Morse Theory to find a sharper lower bound.**\n\nMorse theory provides a deep connection between the topology of a manifold and the critical points of a smooth function defined on it.\n\n*   **Betti Numbers and Euler Characteristic**: The topology of a manifold can be described by its Betti numbers, which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions. For the 2-torus $T^2$:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it is one connected piece).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent non-contractible loops, like longitude and latitude).\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one \"void\" or volume).\n*   **Morse Inequalities**: A fundamental result, known as the Morse-Novikov theorem (a strengthening of the original Morse inequalities), states that for *any* smooth function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the total number of critical points ($N$) must be greater than or equal to the sum of its Betti numbers (computed with coefficients in a field, like $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n    *   $N \\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim M} b_k(M)$\n*   **Applying to the Torus**: For the 2-torus $T^2$, the dimension is 2. The sum of the Betti numbers is:\n    *   $\\sum b_k(T^2) = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n*   Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least **four** critical points.\n\n**Step 4: Check if this lower bound is attainable by constructing an example.**\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 4. Now we need to show that there exists a function that has exactly 4 critical points. If we can find such a function, then the minimal number is indeed 4.\n\n*   **Geometric Example (Height Function)**: Imagine a torus standing vertically in space. The height at each point defines a smooth function. This function will have:\n    1.  One minimum point (the very bottom of the torus).\n    2.  One maximum point (the very top of the torus).\n    3.  Two saddle points (at the top and bottom of the inner \"hole\").\n    This gives a total of 4 critical points.\n\n*   **Analytic Example**: We can represent the torus as the square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ with opposite sides identified. Consider the function:\n    $f(x, y) = \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)$\n    This function is doubly periodic and thus well-defined on the torus. Let's find its critical points by setting its gradient to zero:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) = 0 \\implies x = 0$ or $x = 1/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y) = 0 \\implies y = 0$ or $y = 1/2$.\n\n    This gives four unique critical points in the domain $[0,1) \\times [0,1)$:\n    1.  **(0, 0)**: $f(0,0)=1+1=2$. This is the global **maximum**. (Index 2)\n    2.  **(0, 1/2)**: $f(0,1/2)=1-1=0$. This is a **saddle point**. (Index 1)\n    3.  **(1/2, 0)**: $f(1/2,0)=-1+1=0$. This is another **saddle point**. (Index 1)\n    4.  **(1/2, 1/2)**: $f(1/2,1/2)=-1-1=-2$. This is the global **minimum**. (Index 0)\n\n    This explicit construction shows a function with exactly four critical points: one minimum, one maximum, and two saddles.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\n*   From Morse theory, we deduced that the number of critical points must be at least 4.\n*   We constructed a specific function that has exactly 4 critical points.\n*   Therefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
