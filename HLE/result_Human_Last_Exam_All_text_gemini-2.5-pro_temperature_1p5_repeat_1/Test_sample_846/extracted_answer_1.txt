The table must change its shape. At sunrise, the UV light from the sun should cause the table to transform from a relatively straight, elongated shape (the stable *trans* form) into a bent, V-shape (the less stable *cis* form). At sunset, in the absence of UV light, the table should relax back from its bent shape to its original straight shape.
