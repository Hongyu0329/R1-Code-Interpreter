    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question:**\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This implies a specific, absolute point in time, not just the earliest evidence of a calendar or writing. It must be a date that can be anchored in a chronological system.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on a durable medium like stone, bone, or ceramic.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans in 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a script native to the Americas, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or Isthmian/Epi-Olmec script.\n\n**2. Identifying the Relevant Calendar System:**\n\nTo record an absolute, non-repeating date over a long period, Mesoamerican civilizations used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the total number of days that have elapsed since a mythical creation date, which is correlated to August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. A Long Count date is typically written as a sequence of five numbers (e.g., B'ak'tun.K'atun.Tun.Winal.K'in). This system is what allows for the precise dating of historical events. Other calendars, like the 260-day ritual calendar (Tzolk'in) and the 365-day solar calendar (Haab'), were cyclical and a day name from them would repeat regularly. The question implies an absolute date, which points directly to the Long Count.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidates:**\n\nSeveral artifacts are contenders for the earliest recorded date.\n\n*   **San José Mogote Monument 3**: This Zapotec monument, dated archaeologically to around **600 BCE**, contains a glyph representing \"1 Earthquake.\" While this is the earliest known use of a calendar name from the 260-day calendar, it is not a full, absolute date like a Long Count date. The day \"1 Earthquake\" would have repeated every 260 days. Therefore, it does not represent a unique point in history.\n\n*   **Early Maya Stelae**: The earliest securely dated monument from the Maya heartland is **Tikal Stela 29**. It bears a Long Count date of **8.12.14.8.15**, which correlates to **July 6, 292 CE**. While early, this is not the earliest known overall.\n\n*   **Epi-Olmec/Isthmian Script Artifacts**: This culture, flourishing between the Olmec and the Classic Maya, produced several artifacts with very early dates.\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1**: Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument has two Long Count dates: **8.5.3.3.5** (143 CE) and **8.5.16.9.7** (156 CE).\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette**: This small greenstone figure has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17** (162 CE).\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: This monument, unearthed in Chiapas, Mexico, holds the current record. It contains a partially damaged but legible inscription in the Isthmian script. The date is read as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n**4. Verifying the Earliest Date:**\n\nLet's compare the Long Count dates. The Long Count begins with B'ak'tun 0. A lower first number (the B'ak'tun) indicates an earlier date.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: **7**.16.3.2.13\n*   **La Mojarra Stela 1**: **8**.5.3.3.5\n*   **Tuxtla Statuette**: **8**.6.2.4.17\n*   **Tikal Stela 29**: **8**.12.14.8.15\n\nThe date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 starts with B'ak'tun 7, while the others start with B'ak'tun 8. This clearly makes it the earliest of the group.\n\n**5. Converting the Date to the Gregorian Calendar:**\n\nThe Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 translates to **December of 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This date firmly places it in the 1st century BCE, making it significantly older than the other candidates with full Long Count dates.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Date vs. Calendar Use**: It's crucial to distinguish between the earliest evidence of a calendar (San José Mogote, c. 600 BCE) and the earliest recorded *absolute date*. An absolute date requires a linear, non-repeating system like the Long Count.\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Calendar**: The question's requirement for a specific \"date\" makes the Long Count calendar the relevant system to examine, as it's the only indigenous American system known to record absolute chronology.\n3.  **Artifact Authentication**: All candidates discussed (Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, La Mojarra Stela 1, etc.) are well-documented and accepted by mainstream archaeologists and epigraphers.\n4.  **Cultural Attribution**: The earliest Long Count date does not belong to the Maya but to a precursor or contemporary culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region, often referred to as Epi-Olmec or being associated with the Zoque peoples. The Maya later adopted and famously elaborated upon the Long Count system.\n5.  **Gregorian Correlation**: The conversion to a BCE/CE date depends on the GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, which is the standard accepted by most Mayanists for correlating the Long Count with the Western calendar.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe earliest known absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. The date, written in the Long Count calendar as **7.16.3.2.13**, corresponds to **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
