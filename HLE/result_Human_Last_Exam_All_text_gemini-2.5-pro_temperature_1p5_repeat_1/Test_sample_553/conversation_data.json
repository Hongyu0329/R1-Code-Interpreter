    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I or i):** This is the foundational or \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor (Am). In the key of A major, the tonic chord is A major (A).\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This refers to the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, but specifically a minor chord.\n    *   In a **minor key** (like A minor), the scale's fifth degree is E. The naturally occurring chord built on this note is an E minor (Em). So, in the key of A minor, the E minor chord is the diatonic \"minor fifth\" chord. The progression would be Am → Em (i → v).\n    *   In a **major key** (like A major), the fifth degree is E. The naturally occurring chord is E major (E), which is called the dominant chord (V). A \"minor fifth\" chord in this key would be an E minor (Em), which is a non-diatonic or \"borrowed\" chord, usually from the parallel minor key. The progression would be A → Em (I → v).\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct, immediate change from one chord to the next, particularly at the beginning of the song.\n\n**Step 2: Searching for the Song**\n\nThe question requires us to find a Beatles song that begins with the progression of **Tonic → Minor Fifth**. We need to analyze the opening chords of their songs.\n\n*   Many Beatles songs start with standard progressions. For instance, \"Love Me Do\" starts with I → IV (G → C), and \"Let It Be\" uses the I → V → vi → IV (C → G → Am → F) progression. These do not fit the criteria.\n*   Let's consider songs with more unique openings. The song we are looking for will likely have a somber or wistful sound due to this specific chord change. The move from a tonic to a minor fifth lacks the strong pull of the standard major dominant (V) chord, creating a more ambiguous, floating feeling.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Song and Verifying the Progression**\n\nThe song that perfectly matches this description is **\"I'll Be Back\"**, the closing track on the album *A Hard Day's Night* (UK version).\n\n1.  **Key and Tonic Chord:** The song is primarily in the key of A minor. It starts immediately with an **A minor (Am)** chord as John Lennon sings the first line, \"You know...\". This is the **tonic (i)** chord.\n2.  **The Chord Jump:** On the very next line, \"...if you break my heart...\", the chord changes directly to an **E minor (Em)** chord.\n3.  **The Minor Fifth Chord:** In the key of A minor, the fifth degree of the scale is E. The chord built on this note is **E minor (Em)**. This is the **minor fifth (v)** chord.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The song \"I'll Be Back\" starts with the exact chord jump described in the question: from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth (E minor). This i → v progression is responsible for the song's distinctive, melancholy opening.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
