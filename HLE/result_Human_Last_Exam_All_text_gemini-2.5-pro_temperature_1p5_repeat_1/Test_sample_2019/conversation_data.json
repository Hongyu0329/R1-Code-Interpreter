    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Toroidal Board and Queen Attacks**\n\n*   A 5x5 toroidal board is a 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. We can represent the squares by coordinates (x, y) where x, y are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   Moving right from column 4 brings you to column 0. Moving down from row 4 brings you to row 0. All arithmetic on coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   A queen at (x1, y1) attacks a square (x2, y2) if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n*   **Row attack:** x1 = x2\n*   **Column attack:** y1 = y2\n*   **Main diagonal attack:** (x1 - y1) mod 5 = (x2 - y2) mod 5\n*   **Anti-diagonal attack:** (x1 + y1) mod 5 = (x2 + y2) mod 5\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Non-Attacking Conditions**\n\nLet the positions of the 4 non-attacking queens be (r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), and (r4, c4). For any pair of queens i and j (i ≠ j), the following conditions must hold:\n1.  `ri ≠ rj` (distinct rows)\n2.  `ci ≠ cj` (distinct columns)\n3.  `(ri - ci) mod 5 ≠ (rj - cj) mod 5` (distinct main diagonals)\n4.  `(ri + ci) mod 5 ≠ (rj + cj) mod 5` (distinct anti-diagonals)\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Problem using Board Symmetries**\n\nPlacing 4 queens on a 5x5 board means that exactly one row and one column will be empty. Let's call the empty row `r_empty` and the empty column `c_empty`.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into:\n1.  Choosing the empty row and column.\n2.  Arranging the 4 queens in the remaining 4x4 subgrid subject to the non-attacking constraints.\n\nThe toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. We can translate the entire board configuration by `(a, b)`: `(x, y) -> ((x+a) mod 5, (y+b) mod 5)`. This transformation preserves the non-attacking property of a configuration of queens.\n\nWe can use this translational symmetry to fix the position of the empty row and column without loss of generality. Let's say we choose an empty row `r_empty` and an empty column `c_empty`. We can apply a translation of `(-r_empty, -c_empty)` to the entire board. This moves the empty cell `(r_empty, c_empty)` to `(0, 0)`, and the set of queen positions is transformed into a new valid configuration where row 0 and column 0 are empty.\n\nThis means that the number of valid arrangements of queens is the same, no matter which row and column are left empty.\nSo, the total number of ways is:\n(Number of ways to choose the empty row and column) × (Number of ways to place queens for a fixed empty row/column).\n\n*   **Number of ways to choose the empty row and column:**\n    *   There are 5 choices for the empty row (`r_empty`).\n    *   There are 5 choices for the empty column (`c_empty`).\n    *   Total choices = 5 × 5 = 25.\n\n**Step 4: Count Arrangements for a Fixed Empty Row/Column**\n\nLet's fix the empty row as row 4 and the empty column as column 4. This means we are placing the 4 queens in the rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nLet the placement be defined by a permutation `p` of {0, 1, 2, 3}, where the queens are at positions `(i, p(i))` for `i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n\nThe row and column conditions are automatically satisfied by this formulation. We only need to check the diagonal conditions:\n*   The set of main diagonal indices `D_diff = { (i - p(i)) mod 5 | i ∈ {0,1,2,3} }` must contain 4 distinct values.\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices `D_sum = { (i + p(i)) mod 5 | i ∈ {0,1,2,3} }` must contain 4 distinct values.\n\nLet's analyze the sums of these indices. Since `p` is a permutation of `{0,1,2,3}`:\n*   `Sum(i - p(i)) = Sum(i) - Sum(p(i)) = (0+1+2+3) - (0+1+2+3) = 0`. So, `Sum(D_diff) ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\n*   `Sum(i + p(i)) = Sum(i) + Sum(p(i)) = 6 + 6 = 12`. So, `Sum(D_sum) ≡ 2 (mod 5)`.\n\nThe sum of all elements in `Z_5` is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\nIf `D_diff` has 4 distinct elements, it is missing exactly one element from `Z_5`, say `m`. Then `Sum(D_diff) = Sum(Z_5) - m = 0 - m = -m`. Since we know `Sum(D_diff) ≡ 0 (mod 5)`, we must have `m = 0`. Therefore, `D_diff` must be the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This implies `i - p(i) mod 5 ≠ 0` for any `i`, which means `p(i) ≠ i`. The permutation `p` must be a derangement (a permutation with no fixed points).\n\nIf `D_sum` has 4 distinct elements, it is missing one element `s`. Then `Sum(D_sum) = -s`. Since we know `Sum(D_sum) ≡ 2 (mod 5)`, we have `-s = 2`, which implies `s = -2 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`. Therefore, `D_sum` must be the set `{0, 1, 2, 4}`.\n\nNow we need to find the number of derangements `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}` that satisfy these two set conditions. There are `D_4 = 9` derangements of 4 elements. We can test them:\n\n1.  p = (1, 0, 3, 2): D_diff = {4, 1, 4, 1}. Fails (not distinct).\n2.  p = (1, 2, 3, 0): D_diff = {4, 4, 4, 3}. Fails.\n3.  **p = (1, 3, 0, 2):**\n    *   D_diff = {(0-1), (1-3), (2-0), (3-2)} mod 5 = {-1, -2, 2, 1} = {4, 3, 2, 1}. **OK**.\n    *   D_sum = {(0+1), (1+3), (2+0), (3+2)} mod 5 = {1, 4, 2, 0}. **OK**.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n4.  **p = (2, 0, 3, 1):**\n    *   D_diff = {(0-2), (1-0), (2-3), (3-1)} mod 5 = {-2, 1, -1, 2} = {3, 1, 4, 2}. **OK**.\n    *   D_sum = {(0+2), (1+0), (2+3), (3+1)} mod 5 = {2, 1, 0, 4}. **OK**.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n5.  p = (2, 3, 0, 1): D_diff = {3, 3, 2, 2}. Fails.\n6.  p = (2, 3, 1, 0): D_diff = {3, 3, 1, 3}. Fails.\n7.  p = (3, 0, 1, 2): D_diff = {2, 1, 1, 1}. Fails.\n8.  p = (3, 2, 0, 1): D_diff = {2, 4, 2, 2}. Fails.\n9.  p = (3, 2, 1, 0): D_diff = {2, 4, 1, 3}. OK. But D_sum = {3, 3, 3, 3}. Fails.\n\nOut of the 9 derangements, only 2 satisfy the required conditions. So, for a fixed empty row and column, there are 2 ways to place the queens.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nTotal ways = (Number of ways to choose empty row/col) × (Number of arrangements for a fixed choice)\nTotal ways = 25 × 2 = 50.\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
