    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a renowned British painter of military and historical scenes.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings and their Historical Dates**\nWe need to list Lady Butler's significant paintings that depict specific battles and identify the date each battle occurred. The question is about the historical date of the event, not the date the painting was made.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which occurred on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the **Battle of Inkerman**, part of the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the **Battle of Balaclava**, also during the Crimean War, on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War. This battle took place on **January 22–23, 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts an incident at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** during the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Depicts the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War. The scene is commonly associated with the **Battle of Abu Klea** on **January 17, 1885**.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted c. 1920s): Depicts the British retreat following the **Battle of Mons**, which took place in **August 1914**, at the beginning of World War I.\n*   ***The V.C.*** (painted 1920): This painting shows Acting-Sergeant John Hogan of the Manchester Regiment winning the Victoria Cross during the **First Battle of Ypres** in World War I. The specific action took place on **October 29, 1914**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Historical Dates**\nNow, let's compare the dates of the battles listed above.\n\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: June 1815\n*   Battle of Waterloo: June 1815\n*   Battle of Balaclava: October 1854\n*   Battle of Inkerman: November 1854\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift: January 1879\n*   Battle of Laing's Nek: January 1881\n*   Battle of Tel El Kebir: September 1882\n*   Battle of Abu Klea: January 1885\n*   Battle of Mons: August 1914\n*   First Battle of Ypres: October 1914\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, we can see that the battles from World War I are the most recent. Between the two World War I battles she painted, the Battle of Mons (August 1914) occurred before the First Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914).\n\nTherefore, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the First Battle of Ypres.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Event Date vs. Painting Date:** It is crucial to distinguish between the year the painting was created and the year the historical event took place. The question asks for the latest historical event.\n2.  **Inclusion of Later Works:** Lady Butler's fame was established with her 19th-century works (*The Roll Call*, *Quatre Bras*), but she continued to paint into the 20th century and depicted scenes from World War I. These later, sometimes less famous, works are critical to answering the question correctly.\n3.  **Specificity of the Battle:** Some painting titles are general (e.g., *Balaclava*), but they refer to specific, datable battles within a larger conflict. It's important to identify that specific battle.\n4.  **Chronological Ordering:** A clear chronological list of the battles is the most effective way to identify the latest one.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the step-by-step analysis is that the First Battle of Ypres is the correct answer.\n\n<<<The First Battle of Ypres>>>"
