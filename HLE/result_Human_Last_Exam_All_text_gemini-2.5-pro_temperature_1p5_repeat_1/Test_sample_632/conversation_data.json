    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (home of the Pantheon).\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Timeframe:** In 1950.\n*   **Agent:** The city administration.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze \"Architectural Feature\" in a Square**\nAn \"architectural feature\" within a public square, as opposed to a building, could refer to several things: a monument, specific paving, a kiosk, or infrastructure. Since the question states it was *removed* in 1950, it was likely a feature added in the 19th or early 20th century, rather than an ancient one.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Historical Context of Rome in 1950**\nThe mid-20th century was a period of significant urban change in many European capitals. Rome was actively modernizing its infrastructure. A key aspect of this modernization was the evolution of public transportation. In the post-war era, many cities began dismantling their tramway systems in favor of buses and to accommodate the growing number of private cars.\n\n**Step 4: Research the Piazza della Rotonda's History**\nHistorical photographs and records of the Piazza della Rotonda from before 1950 show a feature that is absent today. Specifically, they reveal a double tramway line that ran through the square. The tracks formed a loop around the central obelisk and fountain (Fontana del Pantheon).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Feature and its \"Uniqueness\"**\nThe feature was the **tramway line**. Its \"uniqueness\" stemmed from the stark contrast it created: modern, noisy, electric trams running just feet away from the ancient Pantheon and the Renaissance-era fountain. For decades, this juxtaposition of ancient and modern was a defining characteristic of the square.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Removal**\nAs part of the city's plan to reorganize traffic and remove what were considered unsightly overhead wires and tracks from historical centers, the Rome city administration removed the tram lines from the Piazza della Rotonda and other central areas around 1950. This action dramatically changed the square's appearance and soundscape, returning it to a pedestrian-focused space.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the tramway line that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<The tramway line (or tram tracks).>>>"
