    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Lviv-Warsaw School\"**: This points to a specific group of Polish philosophers and logicians active in the interwar period (roughly 1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The school was renowned for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and semantic analysis.\n    *   **\"decomposes the notion of hallmark\"**: The term \"hallmark\" here is used in a general sense, meaning a sign, mark, or characteristic. The core of the question is about the analysis or classification of the concept of a *sign*.\n    *   **\"into symptoms and signals\"**: This is the specific classification scheme. The answer must be a philosopher who made precisely this distinction.\n\n2.  **Understand the Distinction: Symptoms vs. Signals**\n    *   **Symptom**: This refers to a *natural sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is causal or natural. The sign is an effect or a natural part of the thing it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal**: This refers to a *conventional sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a rule, agreement, or convention established by a user (or users). There is no natural or causal link. For example, a green traffic light is a signal to go; the word \"cat\" is a signal that refers to a feline animal.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School**\n    *   The school's focus on semantics and the philosophy of language makes it a likely origin for this type of analysis. We need to find the member whose work in semiotics (the theory of signs) is most prominent.\n    *   While many members worked on language, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is particularly famous for his contributions to semantics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. His work extensively deals with the nature of meaning and signs.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to the Philosopher**\n    *   In his works on language and logic, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz provided a detailed analysis of the concept of a sign (Polish: *znak*).\n    *   He famously divided signs into two primary categories that directly correspond to the terms in the question:\n        1.  **Natural Signs (or Symptoms; Polish: *oznaki* or *symptomy*)**: Signs that are causally linked to the objects they denote. His classic example is smoke as a sign of fire.\n        2.  **Conventional Signs (or Signals; Polish: *sygnały*)**: Signs whose meaning is established by a convention or a rule created for communication. Words in a language are the most common example.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The specific decomposition of the general notion of a sign (\"hallmark\") into \"symptoms\" (natural signs) and \"signals\" (conventional signs) is a well-known contribution of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz within the Lviv-Warsaw School's tradition of logical analysis.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Terminology**: The English term \"hallmark\" is a translation of the broader concept of a *sign* (Polish: *znak*), which was the subject of analysis.\n*   **Context**: This distinction is central to Ajdukiewicz's semiotic theory and his broader project of creating a clear and logical framework for understanding language and knowledge.\n*   **Attribution**: While other philosophers (like C.S. Peirce with his icon/index/symbol distinction) also classified signs, the specific terminology of \"symptoms\" vs. \"signals\" is characteristic of Ajdukiewicz within the context of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\nThe analysis clearly points to one philosopher.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
