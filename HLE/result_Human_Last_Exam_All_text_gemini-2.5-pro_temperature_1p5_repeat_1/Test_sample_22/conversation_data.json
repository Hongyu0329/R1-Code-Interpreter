    "This is a multistep analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the terms**\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype (a trait like height, or risk for a disease like diabetes) based on their genotype. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many different genetic variants (SNPs) across the genome. The effect of each SNP, called a \"weight,\" is typically derived from a large-scale genetic study known as a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The formula is essentially a weighted sum: `PGS = Σ (weight_snp * genotype_snp)`.\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This refers to how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype in a *new* set of individuals not included in the original GWAS. It is measured by the proportion of variance in the phenotype that can be explained by the PGS. This is commonly quantified using the R-squared (R²) metric. An R² of 0.1 means the PGS explains 10% of the variation in the trait among people.\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that quantifies the *total* proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the *additive effects of all the common SNPs* being considered (e.g., all SNPs on a genotyping chip). It represents the theoretical upper limit or the \"ceiling\" of predictability for a given trait using a linear model of these SNPs. It answers the question: \"If we knew the true effect of every single SNP perfectly, how well could we possibly predict the trait?\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the concepts**\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability is the Theoretical Maximum:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) defines the total amount of signal available. It's the \"true\" R² we would achieve with a perfect polygenic score. This perfect score would require knowing the exact, true effect size of every single SNP that influences the trait.\n\n2.  **PGS is a Practical Estimate:** A real-world PGS is built using effect sizes (weights) that are *estimated* from a GWAS. A GWAS is conducted on a finite number of people. Because the sample size is finite, these estimated weights are not perfect; they contain statistical noise or \"estimation error.\"\n\n3.  **Sources of Imperfection in a PGS:** The predictive power (R²) of a real PGS is lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP) for several key reasons:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The primary reason is that the SNP weights are estimated from a finite GWAS sample. The smaller the GWAS sample, the larger the error in the weights, and the poorer the PGS will perform in a new sample.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** SNPs are often correlated with each other. The methods used to build PGSs must account for this, but these methods are not perfect, leading to a loss of information or the inclusion of redundant information.\n    *   **Different Genetic Ancestries:** If the original GWAS and the new prediction sample have different ancestry backgrounds, the PGS may perform poorly because the correlational structure (LD) between SNPs can differ.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** The PGS might be built using only a subset of all SNPs (e.g., only those passing a certain statistical significance threshold), whereas h²_SNP accounts for the contribution of *all* common SNPs, including those with very small effects.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe SNP heritability (h²_SNP) sets the theoretical ceiling for prediction. The polygenic score (PGS) is our practical attempt to reach that ceiling. Due to limitations in our data and methods (primarily the finite sample size of the GWAS used to generate the weights), our practical attempt will always fall short of the theoretical perfection. The variance explained by the PGS (its R²) will therefore be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable (the h²_SNP). As GWAS sample sizes grow into the millions, the R² of our PGSs will get closer and closer to the h²_SNP, but it cannot exceed it.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\n**Careful Point:** The word \"necessarily\" is very strong. In statistics, it is possible for a single measurement in a specific, small test sample to be higher than an *estimate* of h²_SNP due to random chance and estimation error in *both* values. However, the statement refers to the \"predictive ability\" as a general property. The *expected* predictive ability of the PGS is always less than the true h²_SNP. In this context, \"necessarily\" should be interpreted in this theoretical and statistical sense.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: Based on the reasoning that h²_SNP is the theoretical maximum variance explainable by common SNPs and a PGS is an imperfect estimator that cannot reach this maximum due to finite sample sizes and other methodological limitations, the predictive ability of the PGS must be lower.\n\n<<<True>>>"
