    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question and Legal Context**\n\nThe question asks for the *first* original statute enacted by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, established in 1948) to *explicitly* use the term \"good faith\". Before the major legislative initiatives of the 1960s and 1970s, Israeli law was a mixture of Ottoman law, British Mandate ordinances, and English common law principles. The goal is to find the first piece of new, original Israeli legislation that codified this concept.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidate Statutes**\n\nThe principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*) is a cornerstone of modern Israeli civil law. The most famous introduction of this principle is in the Contracts (General Part) Law. However, we must check chronologically to see if an earlier statute used the term. The major civil law codifications occurred from the mid-1960s through the 1970s. Key candidates from this era include:\n*   Standard Contracts Law, 1964\n*   Agency Law, 1965\n*   Sale Law, 1968\n*   Land Law, 1969\n*   Contracts (Remedies for Breach of Contract) Law, 1970\n*   Movable Property Law, 1971\n*   Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Chronologically**\n\n*   **Standard Contracts Law, 1964:** This law addressed unfair terms (\"depriving conditions\") in standard form contracts. While it dealt with fairness, it did not use the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as the central legal test.\n*   **Agency Law, 1965:** Section 8 of this law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While loyalty is a related concept, it is legally distinct from the broader principle of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Therefore, this law did not explicitly introduce the concept of good faith.\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law, which governs contracts for the sale of goods, does not contain a general, explicit provision requiring \"good faith\".\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a crucial candidate. Section 10 of the Land Law deals with the protection of a purchaser of a registered property right. It states that a person who acquires a right in registered land for consideration, relying in *good faith* (\"בתום-לב\" - *be-tom lev*) on the registry, will have their right protected even if the registry was inaccurate. This is a clear and explicit use of the term \"good faith\".\n*   **Movable Property Law, 1971:** Section 5 of this law establishes the \"market overt\" rule, protecting a buyer who acquires a movable asset from a seller who was not the true owner, provided the transaction was in the ordinary course of business and the buyer acted in *good faith* (*be-tom lev*). This statute uses the term, but it was enacted after the Land Law.\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This law is famous for making \"good faith\" a pervasive, super-principle in Israeli law through two key sections: Section 12, which requires parties to act in good faith during pre-contractual negotiations, and Section 39, which requires that any right arising from a contract be exercised and any obligation be performed in good faith. While this law massively expanded the role of good faith, it was enacted four years *after* the Land Law.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Chronological Evidence**\n\nComparing the enactment dates, the **Land Law of 1969** is the first original Israeli statute in the new wave of civil codification to explicitly use and introduce the legal concept of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). While the Contracts Law of 1973 universalized the principle, the Land Law was the first to codify it in a specific but significant context.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Original Israeli Legislation vs. Mandate-era Law:** Some older laws from the British Mandate period, which were absorbed into Israeli law, might have contained similar concepts (e.g., the Bills of Exchange Ordinance). However, the question refers to the legislative activity of the *modern State of Israel*, implying the new, original statutes passed by the Knesset, which systematically replaced the older legal framework. The wave of codification starting in the 1960s represents this effort.\n2.  **Explicit Introduction:** The analysis focuses on the statute that first used the specific Hebrew term \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). Related but distinct concepts like \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) in the Agency Law are correctly excluded.\n3.  **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** It is crucial not to confuse the statute that was *first* with the one that is most famous or had the broadest impact. The Contracts Law (1973) is undoubtedly the most important statute for the principle of good faith, but the Land Law (1969) was chronologically first.\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
