    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $t$ is time and $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ are spatial coordinates, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity and we have set the density $\\rho=1$ without loss of generality for symmetry analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the concept of a Lie group of symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a continuous group of transformations acting on the independent variables ($t, \\mathbf{x}$) and dependent variables ($\\mathbf{u}, p$) that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions. The dimension of this group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators of these transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the infinitesimal generators of the symmetries\n\nWe systematically search for the transformations that leave the form of the equations unchanged. These are well-known and can be derived using the standard Lie symmetry algorithm.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. This gives rise to time-translation invariance.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to t + s$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n    *   Number of generators: **1**\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n    *   Number of generators: **3**\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are rotationally invariant (isotropic) because they are formulated with vector quantities. The operators $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^2$ are rotationally invariant.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ for a rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Generators (rotations about the coordinate axes): $x_j \\partial_{x_k} - x_k \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_k} - u_k \\partial_{u_j}$\n    *   Number of generators: **3** (since $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional).\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity (Galilean relativity).\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0, p \\to p$.\n    *   Generators: $t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Number of generators: **3**\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry that relates solutions at different length and time scales. This is a crucial symmetry for understanding turbulence and dimensional analysis (e.g., Reynolds number).\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$. One can verify that this set of transformations leaves the Navier-Stokes equations invariant.\n    *   Generator: $2t \\partial_t + \\sum_i x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_i u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$\n    *   Number of generators: **1**\n\n### Step 4: Sum the dimensions of the independent symmetries\n\nThe total number of generators found above determines the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries.\nTotal dimension = 1 (time transl.) + 3 (space transl.) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (boosts) + 1 (scaling) = 11.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n1.  **The Pressure Symmetry:** The pressure $p$ only appears as its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means one can transform $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, without changing the momentum equation. This implies that the full symmetry group is actually **infinite-dimensional**.\n2.  **Standard Convention:** In the context of such questions, it is standard practice to ask for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra* of symmetries. The infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure is considered a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetry and is usually factored out. The 11 generators listed above form this maximal finite-dimensional algebra.\n3.  **Viscosity:** The specific form of the scaling symmetry depends on the presence of the viscous term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$. For the inviscid Euler equations ($\\nu=0$), the scaling group is larger (2-dimensional).\n4.  **Domain:** These symmetries are for the equations on the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. If the fluid is in a bounded domain, some or all of these symmetries (like translations and rotations) would be broken.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard analysis of point symmetries and the convention of considering the maximal finite-dimensional part, we sum the number of independent infinitesimal generators.\n\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Spatial rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
