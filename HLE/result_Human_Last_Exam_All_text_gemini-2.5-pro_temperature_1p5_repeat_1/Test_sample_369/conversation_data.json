    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Syllabification and Preliminary Analysis\nFirst, we write out the line and identify the basic quantities (long by nature, short by nature) of each vowel and locate potential elisions. A vowel is long by nature if it has a macron (e.g., `ā`) or is part of a diphthong (e.g., `ae`, `au`). A vowel is long by position if it is followed by two or more consonants. An elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or `-m` is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or `h`.\n\n**Line:** `vērum ubi equī atque hominis cāsū convēnit imāgō.`\n\n*   **`vērum ubi`**: The word `vērum` ends in `-um` and `ubi` begins with a vowel `u`. This indicates an **elision**. The `-um` will be dropped in scansion.\n*   **`atque hominis`**: The word `atque` ends in `-e` and `hominis` begins with `h-`. This is another **elision**. The `-e` of `atque` will be dropped.\n\n### Step 2: Scanning Foot by Foot from the End of the Line\nIt is often easiest to start scanning from the end of the line, as the rules for the fifth and sixth feet are less flexible.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (The last foot):** This foot is always a spondee (`– –`). The word is `imāgō`. The last two syllables are `māgō`.\n    *   `mā-`: The `a` is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-gō`: The final syllable of a hexameter line is always considered long (*syllaba anceps*). **Long (–)**.\n    *   Therefore, Foot 6 is `mā gō` (`– –`), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5:** This foot is almost always a dactyl (`– U U`). The syllables before the sixth foot are from `...convēnit i-`.\n    *   `vē-`: This is from `convēnit`, the perfect tense of `conveniō`. The `ē` is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-nit`: The vowel `i` is short. It is followed by a single consonant `t` before the vowel `i` of `imago`, so the syllable is open (`-ni-ti-`) and remains short. **Short (U)**.\n    *   `i-`: The first syllable of `imāgō` has a short `i`. **Short (U)**.\n    *   These three syllables `vē-nit-i` form a perfect `– U U`.\n    *   Therefore, Foot 5 is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n### Step 3: Scanning the First Four Feet\nNow we move to the beginning of the line to scan the first four feet, which can be either dactyls or spondees. This particular line is known for its difficulty and requires recognizing poetic licenses.\n\n*   **Foot 4:** The syllables before Foot 5 are `cāsū con-`.\n    *   `cā-`: The `a` is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-sū`: The ablative ending `ū` is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   The word `cāsū` itself forms a spondee (`– –`).\n    *   Therefore, Foot 4 is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3:** The syllables before Foot 4 are from `hominis`.\n    *   `ho-`: The `o` is short.\n    *   `-mi-`: The `i` is short.\n    *   `-nis`: The `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`s` from `hominis` and `c` from `casu`), making it long by position. **Long (–)**.\n    *   The word `hominis` before `casu` scans as `U U –`. This is an anapest, not a valid hexameter foot. Here, we must invoke a poetic license called **synizesis**, where the first two short syllables (`ho-mi-`) are pronounced as a single long syllable. This effectively turns `ho-mi-nis` (`U U –`) into a two-syllable spondee (`– –`).\n    *   Therefore, Foot 3 is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2:** The syllables before Foot 3 are `equī atqu(e)`. The `-e` of `atque` is elided.\n    *   `equī`: The genitive singular has a short `e` and a long `ī`. `U –`.\n    *   `at-`: The `a` in `atque` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`), making it long by position. `–`.\n    *   The sequence of syllables is `e-quī-at...` (`U – –`). This cannot form a dactyl or a spondee from the beginning. To resolve this, another license is used: **aphesis**, the dropping of the initial unstressed vowel `e-`. The foot then begins with `quī`.\n    *   `quī`: Long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `at`: Long by position. **Long (–)**.\n    *   These form `quī at-` (`– –`).\n    *   Therefore, Foot 2 is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** We are left with `vērum ubi` and the elided `e-` from `equi`.\n    *   `vērum` elides with `ubi`. The sound becomes `vēr'ubi`.\n    *   `vē-`: Long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `u-`: The first syllable of `ubi` is short. **Short (U)**.\n    *   `-bi`: The second syllable of `ubi` is short. **Short (U)**.\n    *   These three syllables form `vē u bi` (`– U U`).\n    *   Therefore, Foot 1 is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining the analysis of all six feet, the scansion is as follows:\n\n1.  **Dactyl** (`vērum ubi`)\n2.  **Spondee** (`(e)quī atque`)\n3.  **Spondee** (`hominis`)\n4.  **Spondee** (`cāsū`)\n5.  **Dactyl** (`convēnit i-`)\n6.  **Spondee** (`-māgō`)\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
