    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the Feynman diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theory and the Diagrams**\n\n*   **Theory:** We are working with a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction term. The interaction part of the Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_I = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n*   **Diagrams:** We are looking for \"second-order vacuum bubble diagrams\".\n    *   **Vacuum bubbles:** These are Feynman diagrams with no external lines. They represent contributions to the vacuum energy. By convention (and due to the linked-cluster theorem), we sum over *connected* vacuum bubble diagrams.\n    *   **Second-order:** This refers to the power of the coupling constant, $\\lambda$. Since each vertex comes from one $\\mathcal{L}_I$ term, a second-order diagram must have exactly two vertices.\n\n**2. Finding the Topologies of the Diagrams**\n\nWe need to construct all distinct connected diagrams with two 4-point vertices and no external lines. Let the vertices be V1 and V2. Each vertex must have four lines attached. The total number of line \"ends\" is $2 \\times 4 = 8$. These must be connected in pairs to form 4 internal lines (propagators).\n\nWe can classify the diagrams by the number of lines connecting V1 and V2 ($L_{12}$), the number of loops on V1 ($L_{11}$), and the number of loops on V2 ($L_{22}$). The valency of each vertex must be 4, which gives the constraints:\n*   $L_{12} + 2L_{11} = 4$\n*   $L_{12} + 2L_{22} = 4$\n\nThis implies $L_{11} = L_{22}$ and that $L_{12}$ must be an even number.\n*   **Case 1: $L_{12} = 4$**\n    This gives $4 + 2L_{11} = 4 \\implies L_{11} = 0$. So, $L_{22} = 0$. This topology consists of two vertices connected by four propagators. Let's call this **Diagram 1**. It is often called a \"watermelon\" diagram.\n\n*   **Case 2: $L_{12} = 2$**\n    This gives $2 + 2L_{11} = 4 \\implies L_{11} = 1$. So, $L_{22} = 1$. This topology consists of two vertices connected by two propagators, with one additional propagator forming a loop on V1, and another forming a loop on V2. Let's call this **Diagram 2**.\n\n*   **Case 3: $L_{12} = 0$**\n    This gives $2L_{11} = 4 \\implies L_{11} = 2$. This is a diagram where V1 has two self-loops and V2 has two self-loops, with no propagators connecting them. This is a *disconnected* diagram and is typically not included in the sum for the vacuum energy density.\n\nThus, we have two connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n**3. The Rule for Calculating Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when summing diagrammatic contributions. It is the order of the automorphism group of the graph. A practical rule for computing it is:\n$S = (\\text{Number of permutations of vertices that leave the graph invariant}) \\times (\\text{Number of permutations of lines that leave the graph invariant}) \\times \\prod_{\\text{loops}} 2$\nThe final factor of 2 for each self-loop arises from the symmetry of swapping the two \"ends\" of the propagator line at the vertex.\n\n**4. Calculation for Diagram 1 (\"Watermelon\")**\n\n*   **Description:** Two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Line Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in any way. This gives a factor of **4! = 24**.\n*   **Loop Factor:** There are no self-loops in this diagram. The factor is $2^0 = 1$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor (S₁):** $S_1 = 2 \\times 24 \\times 1 = 48$.\n\n**5. Calculation for Diagram 2 (\"Figure-8 with Loops\")**\n\n*   **Description:** Two vertices, two propagators connecting them, one loop on the first vertex, and one loop on the second vertex.\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are structurally identical. Each has two lines going to the other vertex and one self-loop. Swapping the vertices (and consequently, their associated loops) leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Line Permutations:**\n    *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n    *   The two loop propagators are not identical in the sense of a simple line permutation, as they are attached to specific vertices. Their exchange is part of the vertex permutation symmetry.\n*   **Loop Factor:** This diagram has two self-loops. Each contributes a factor of 2. This gives a total factor of $2^2 = \\textbf{4}$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor (S₂):** $S_2 = (\\text{vertex/loop swaps}) \\times (\\text{line swaps}) \\times (\\text{loop flips}) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n**6. Summing the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all the identified connected diagrams.\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{64}$.\n<<<64>>>"
