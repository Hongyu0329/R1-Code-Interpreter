    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify Singular Behavior**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet's represent the integrand as $f(x, \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$, where $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. We assume the decimal numbers represent exact values, so the powers are integers 5, 6, 8 and the coefficients are 9, 5, 9.\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. In this limit, the integral's value will be dominated by the regions in the integration domain where the denominator is very small. The denominator, $\\epsilon + P(x)$, becomes small where $P(x)$ is close to zero.\n\nLet's find the roots of $P(x) = 0$ in the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$\nFor $x \\ge 0$, the term $(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$ is strictly positive. Thus, the only root of $P(x) = 0$ in the interval $[0, 15]$ is at $x=0$.\n\nThis means the primary contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from a small neighborhood around $x=0$. This is a classic case for applying asymptotic analysis, specifically Laplace's method or a related technique.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Function in the Dominant Region**\n\nNear the dominant point $x=0$, we can approximate the polynomial $P(x)$ by its term with the lowest power of $x$, as higher powers of $x$ will be much smaller.\nFor $x \\to 0$, we have $P(x) = 9x^5 + O(x^6)$.\nSo, we can approximate the integral as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Integral by Extending the Integration Limit**\n\nFor the integral to be tractable analytically, it is convenient to change the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$. We need to justify this step.\nThe value of the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ becomes very small for large $x$. The contribution from the tail of the integral, from 15 to $\\infty$, is:\n$\\int_{15}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx \\approx \\int_{15}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{9x^5} dx = \\frac{1}{9} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4x^4} \\right]_{15}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{36 \\cdot 15^4}$\nThis is a small constant value. As we will see, the main part of the integral diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Therefore, this constant term is a higher-order correction and can be neglected for the leading-order approximation.\nSo, our approximation becomes:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Approximate Integral using Scaling**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we use a substitution that captures the scaling with $\\epsilon$. The two terms in the denominator, $\\epsilon$ and $9x^5$, are of comparable magnitude when $9x^5 \\sim \\epsilon$. This suggests the scaling $x \\sim \\epsilon^{1/5}$.\nLet's make the substitution $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$. This implies $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\nThe limits of integration remain from $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$.\nSubstituting into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u\\right)^5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right) u^5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon (1 + u^5)}$\n\nNow, we factor out the terms involving $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} 9^{-1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining task is to evaluate the definite integral $J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$. This is a standard integral related to the Beta function. We use the substitution $t=u^5$, which means $u=t^{1/5}$ and $du = \\frac{1}{5}t^{-4/5} dt$.\n$J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t} \\left(\\frac{1}{5}t^{-4/5}\\right) dt = \\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{(1/5)-1}}{1+t} dt$\n\nThis integral is of the form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{y^{p-1}}{1+y} dy$, which is a known representation of the Beta function, equal to $\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi p)}$.\nFor our integral, $p = 1/5$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\nSo, $J = \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstitute the value of the integral $J$ back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5\\sin(\\pi/5)}\\right)$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis is the required analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. The exponent is $-4/5 = -0.8$. The constant coefficient involves $\\pi$, a fractional power of 9, and the sine of $\\pi/5$.\n\n**Careful Points Summary**\n*   The dominant contribution comes from $x \\approx 0$ as it's the only point in the integration domain where the non-epsilon part of the denominator vanishes.\n*   The function $P(x)$ is approximated by its lowest-order term, $9x^5$.\n*   The integration limit is extended to $\\infty$ to facilitate calculation, which is justified as the introduced error is of a lower order than the leading term.\n*   A scaling substitution is the key to extracting the dependence on $\\epsilon$.\n*   The resulting definite integral is a standard form related to the Beta/Gamma functions.\n*   The analysis of the next term in the expansion of $P(x)$ (i.e., $5x^6$) would yield a correction term of order $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, which is smaller than the leading term of order $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$ for small $\\epsilon$, confirming the validity of our leading-order approximation.\n\nThe final analytical formula is obtained by combining all these pieces.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
