    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside *Sir Launfal*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific version of *Sir Launfal***: The question refers to the famous Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*. The most well-known version was written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. To know what it was \"preserved alongside,\" we must identify the manuscript it comes from.\n\n2.  **Locate the manuscript**: The poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre survives in a single manuscript. This manuscript is **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, currently held in the British Library. It is a compilation of various Middle English texts copied in the mid-15th century.\n\n3.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript**: The next step is to analyze the list of works contained within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. This collection includes many important romances like *Sir Orfeo*, *Havelok the Dane*, and *The Erle of Tolous*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"book of manners\"**: Among the romances and other works in this specific manuscript, there is a didactic poem that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" This work is known as **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (which translates to \"The Book of Courtesy\").\n\n5.  **Confirm the identification**: A \"Book of Courtesy\" is a specific genre of medieval text designed to teach proper etiquette, social conduct, and table manners, particularly for young men serving in noble households. This directly aligns with the term \"book of manners.\" Therefore, *The Boke of Curtasye* is the correct text.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to specify which *Sir Launfal* is being discussed, as there is an earlier version by Marie de France (*Lanval*). The version typically studied in English literature and found in the manuscript in question is by Thomas Chestre.\n*   The term \"preserved alongside\" specifically points to works found within the same physical manuscript or codex.\n*   \"Book of manners\" is a modern description for a medieval genre often called a \"courtesy book\" or \"conduct book.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the specific book of manners that was copied and preserved in the same manuscript as *Sir Launfal*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
