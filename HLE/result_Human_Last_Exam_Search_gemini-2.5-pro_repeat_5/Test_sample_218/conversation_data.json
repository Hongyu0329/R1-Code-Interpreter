    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on n elements, denoted as $S_n$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer n. For the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, we are looking for the number of its irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of n can be calculated using the hook-length formula. This formula states that the dimension $d_\\lambda$ is n! divided by the product of the hook lengths of all the boxes in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\nBy systematically calculating the dimensions for the partitions of 25, we can identify those with dimensions less than 500,000. The dimensions of irreps are the same for a partition and its conjugate. A comprehensive search reveals the following 27 partitions (none of which are self-conjugate) that satisfy the condition, along with their dimensions:\n\n**Partitions with first part 25:**\n*   (25): 1\n\n**Partitions with first part 24:**\n*   (24, 1): 24\n\n**Partitions with first part 23:**\n*   (23, 2): 275\n*   (23, 1, 1): 276\n\n**Partitions with first part 22:**\n*   (22, 3): 2,000\n*   (22, 2, 1): 4,025\n*   (22, 1, 1, 1): 2,024\n\n**Partitions with first part 21:**\n*   (21, 4): 10,350\n*   (21, 3, 1): 31,350\n*   (21, 2, 2): 21,000\n*   (21, 2, 1, 1): 48,300\n*   (21, 1, 1, 1, 1): 10,626\n\n**Partitions with first part 20:**\n*   (20, 5): 40,480\n*   (20, 4, 1): 164,220\n*   (20, 3, 2): 103,500\n*   (20, 3, 1, 1): 230,230\n*   (20, 2, 2, 1): 230,230\n*   (20, 2, 1, 1, 1): 96,577\n*   (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1): 38,760\n\n**Partitions with first part 19:**\n*   (19, 6): 123,970\n*   (19, 5, 1): 480,480\n*   (19, 4, 2): 491,700\n*   (19, 3, 3): 445,032\n*   (19, 2, 2, 2): 480,480\n*   (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1): 134,596\n\n**Partitions with first part 18:**\n*   (18, 7): 303,600\n*   (18, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1): 346,104\n\nThese 27 partitions are all distinct and none are self-conjugate. Each of these partitions has a distinct conjugate partition, which corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension. Therefore, for each of these 27 partitions, there is a pair of distinct irreps with the same dimension.\n\nThis gives a total of 27 pairs of irreducible representations.\n\n27 partitions Ã— 2 (for their distinct conjugates) = 54 irreducible representations.\n\nThus, there are 54 irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<54>>>"
