The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) is given by the expression:
$$ P(y_{ij} = 1) = E_{W \sim F} \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 W(u,v) \,du \,dv \right] $$
where \(W\) is a random graphon drawn from the distribution F, and \(u\) and \(v\) are integrated over the uniform measure U on. This expression represents the expected edge density, averaged over the distribution of all possible graphons.
