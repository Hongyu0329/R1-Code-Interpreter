    "There are 7 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that remains connected even if any single vertex is removed. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThe number of nonisomorphic graphs with specific properties is a common subject of study in graph theory. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is a database of integer sequences that often contains enumerations of various combinatorial objects. The sequence A052443 in the OEIS lists the number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with n vertices and vertex connectivity 2.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   For n=1: 0\n*   For n=2: 0\n*   For n=3: 1\n*   For n=4: 2\n*   For n=5: 7\n\nThus, for 5 vertices, there are 7 such graphs.\n\n<<<7>>>"
