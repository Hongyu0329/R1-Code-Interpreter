The number of Tverberg partitions of `X` is given by the formula for the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into subsets of sizes specified by the partition `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.

Let `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m` be the distinct values in the partition `{a_1, a_2, ..., a_r}`, and let `k_j` be the number of times `s_j` appears. The number of Tverberg partitions is:

` (1 / (k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m!)) * (n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!)) `

Alternatively, this can be written as:

` n! / ( (s_1!)^k_1 * (s_2!)^k_2 * ... * (s_m!)^k_m * k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m! ) `
