    "The user's question is based on a specific premise from Tverberg's theory. Let's break down the problem and formulate the answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Premise\n\nThe user states: *\"For any partition a_1, a_2, ..., a_r: 1 <= a_i <= d+1 of n, there exists a set X ⊂ ℝ^d of n points, such that every Tverberg partition of X induces the same partition on n given by the parts a_1, ..., a_r.\"*\n\n1.  **Tverberg's Theorem**: This theorem states that for a set of at least `(d+1)(r-1)+1` points in d-dimensional space (`ℝ^d`), there exists a partition of the set into `r` non-empty subsets whose convex hulls have a point in common. Such a partition is called a Tverberg partition.\n2.  **The Premise**: The statement provided is a known, strong result in combinatorial geometry. It asserts the existence of a special point configuration `X`. For this specific set `X`, the only way to partition it into subsets whose convex hulls intersect (i.e., the only Tverberg partitions) is to have exactly `r` parts with sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`. This means that any partition of `X` with these part sizes is a Tverberg partition, and no other type of partition of `X` (e.g., with a different number of parts or different sizes) is a Tverberg partition. This result is cited, for instance, in works by R. T. Živaljević.\n3.  **The Question**: \"What is the number of Tverberg’s partitions of X ?\"\n\nGiven the premise, the problem transforms from a geometric one into a combinatorial one. We need to count the number of ways to partition the set `X`, which contains `n` distinct points, into subsets with the prescribed sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\n\n### Combinatorial Calculation\n\nThis is a standard problem of counting set partitions with specified block sizes.\n\nLet the set `X` have `n` labeled points. We want to partition `X` into `r` subsets, `X_1, X_2, ..., X_r`, such that the sizes of these subsets, `|X_i|`, are a permutation of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the formula for partitions of a labeled set into unlabeled subsets of specified sizes.\n\nThe formula is:\n`N = (1 / (k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m!)) * (n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the total number of points.\n*   `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` is the integer partition of `n`.\n*   `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m` are the distinct values among the `a_i`.\n*   `k_j` is the number of times the size `s_j` appears in the partition `(a_1, ..., a_r)`. The `1 / (k_j!)` terms are necessary because subsets of the same size are indistinguishable.\n\n### Alternative Formulation of the Formula\n\nThe same formula can be expressed more compactly. Let the partition of `n` be defined by `k_1` parts of size `s_1`, `k_2` parts of size `s_2`, ..., and `k_m` parts of size `s_m`, such that `Σ(k_i * s_i) = n` and `Σk_i = r`.\n\nThe number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into such parts is:\n`N = n! / ( (s_1!)^k_1 * (s_2!)^k_2 * ... * (s_m!)^k_m * k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m! )`\n\nThis formula first chooses the elements for each block (the multinomial coefficient part) and then divides by the permutations of blocks of identical size.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the premise that such a specially constructed set `X` exists, the number of its Tverberg partitions is precisely the number of ways one can partition the `n` points into subsets of sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\n\n<<<The number of Tverberg partitions of `X` is given by the formula for the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into subsets of sizes specified by the partition `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\n\nLet `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m` be the distinct values in the partition `{a_1, a_2, ..., a_r}`, and let `k_j` be the number of times `s_j` appears. The number of Tverberg partitions is:\n\n` (1 / (k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m!)) * (n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!)) `\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\n` n! / ( (s_1!)^k_1 * (s_2!)^k_2 * ... * (s_m!)^k_m * k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_m! ) `>>>"
