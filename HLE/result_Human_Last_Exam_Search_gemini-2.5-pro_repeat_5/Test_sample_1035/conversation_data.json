    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) with n=35. This value is often called the bipartite covering sum of \\(K_n\\).\n\nThere are two primary constructions for covering a complete graph \\(K_n\\) with bipartite graphs:\n\n1.  **Logarithmic Partitioning:** This method uses \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) bipartite graphs. The vertices of \\(K_n\\) are labeled with distinct binary vectors of length \\(k\\). For each position \\(i\\) in the binary representation (from 1 to \\(k\\)), a bipartite graph \\(B_i\\) is formed. The vertex set of \\(B_i\\) is partitioned into \\(X_i\\), containing all vertices with a 0 in the \\(i\\)-th position, and \\(Y_i\\), containing all vertices with a 1 in that position. Each \\(B_i\\) is a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{X_i, Y_i}\\) that includes all \\(n\\) vertices. Any edge in \\(K_n\\) connects two vertices whose labels must differ in at least one position, ensuring the edge is covered. The sum of the number of vertices in this family of graphs is \\(n \\times k = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\n2.  **Recursive Star-Stripping:** This method involves covering \\(K_n\\) with a star graph \\(K_{1, n-1}\\) centered at one vertex, which covers all edges incident to it. The remaining uncovered edges form a complete graph \\(K_{n-1}\\) on the other \\(n-1\\) vertices. This leads to a recursive formula for the minimum sum, let's call it \\(f(n)\\): \\(f(n) \\le n + f(n-1)\\).\n\nThe actual minimum value, \\(f(n)\\), is the minimum of the results from these two approaches. We can establish a recurrence relation:\n\\(f(n) = \\min(n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil, n + f(n-1))\\), with the base case \\(f(2) = 2\\).\n\nFor the case of \\(n=35\\):\n*   First, we determine the value of \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil\\). Since \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\), we have \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n*   The logarithmic partitioning method yields a sum of \\(35 \\times 6 = 210\\).\n\nNow we evaluate the recursive formula starting from \\(n=32\\), which is a power of 2 and a convenient base case.\n*   \\(f(32) = 32 \\times \\lceil \\log_2 32 \\rceil = 32 \\times 5 = 160\\).\n*   \\(f(33) = \\min(33 \\lceil \\log_2 33 \\rceil, 33 + f(32)) = \\min(33 \\times 6, 33 + 160) = \\min(198, 193) = 193\\).\n*   \\(f(34) = \\min(34 \\lceil \\log_2 34 \\rceil, 34 + f(33)) = \\min(34 \\times 6, 34 + 193) = \\min(204, 227) = 204\\).\n*   \\(f(35) = \\min(35 \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil, 35 + f(34)) = \\min(35 \\times 6, 35 + 204) = \\min(210, 239) = 210\\).\n\nThe calculation shows that for \\(n=35\\), the logarithmic partitioning method provides the more efficient covering.\n\n<<<210>>>"
