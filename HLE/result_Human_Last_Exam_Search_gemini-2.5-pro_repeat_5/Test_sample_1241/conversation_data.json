    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, denoted as $\\pi_i$, for the given system, we must solve the system of linear equations that arises from setting the time derivatives to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe provided system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) \\\\\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) \\\\\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\n$$\nwith the normalization condition $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t) = 1$.\n\nThe problem is described as a \"Kolmogorov-Chepmen system,\" more commonly known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations (or master equation), which describe the evolution of probabilities in a Markov process. A fundamental property of such systems is the conservation of total probability, meaning $\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum_i P_i(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's examine the sum of the given derivatives:\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3'$\n$= (-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}) + (-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}) + (\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}) + (\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3})$\nCombining terms with the same $P_i(t)$ yields:\n$= P_0(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_1(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_2(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_3(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})$\n$= -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$\n\nFor the total probability to be conserved, this sum must be zero. Since $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this would imply $P_0(t) = 0$ for all time, leading to a trivial, non-physical solution where all probabilities become zero. This indicates a likely typographical error in the second equation for $P_1'(t)$. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term for a flow from state $i$ to state $j$ appears as $+\\lambda_{ij}P_i$ in the equation for $P_j'$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should therefore be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n\nBy making this standard correction, the system conserves probability, and we can find a meaningful stationary distribution. The corrected system at steady state ($\\pi_i' = 0$) is:\n1. $0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1$\n2. $0 = 0.019 \\pi_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) \\pi_1 + 0.392 \\pi_2 + 0.008 \\pi_3$\n3. $0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3$\n5. $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive the relationships between the probabilities:\n*   From (4), since $\\lambda_{23} = \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$, we have $\\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n*   From (3), $0.4 \\pi_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 = 0.4 \\pi_2$, which gives $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n*   From (1), $0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1$, so $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (5) to find the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$$ \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) \\pi_1 = 1 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{707}{19} \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707} $$\n\nWith the value of $\\pi_1$, we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$$ \\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$$ \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707} $$\n\nThis fraction evaluates to approximately 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
