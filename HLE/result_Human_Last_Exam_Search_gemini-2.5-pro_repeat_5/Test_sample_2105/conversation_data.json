    "### Inability to Calculate Topological Indices Prevents Final Answer\n\nThe major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. The disulfide bond (S-S) is cleaved during reduction, and each sulfur atom is subsequently bonded to a hydrogen atom, yielding two molecules of perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S).\n\nTo determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for this molecule, including hydrogen atoms, specialized chemoinformatics software or computational tools are required. The Wiener index is the sum of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a molecular graph, while the Szeged index is a related distance-based topological index. The inclusion of hydrogen atoms is a critical parameter in the calculation.\n\nWhile the structure of perylene-3-thiol is well-defined and the methodologies for calculating these indices are established, the actual computation for a molecule of this size (33 atoms, including hydrogens) is complex and cannot be performed manually. Access to a computational chemistry tool capable of handling SMILES or other chemical structure formats and calculating these specific topological indices with the inclusion of hydrogens is necessary.\n\nDespite identifying potential tools like the Wolfram Language, which has functions for both the Szeged and Wiener indices with an option to include hydrogens, the practical execution of these calculations to obtain the numerical values has not been possible. Without the specific numerical values for both the Szeged and Wiener indices of perylene-3-thiol (including H), the final ratio cannot be determined.\n\nTherefore, due to the inability to perform the necessary calculations, a final numerical answer cannot be provided.\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio as I cannot perform the required calculations.>>>"
