    "To solve this competitive programming problem with the highest memory efficiency, we need to minimize the memory allocated for variables.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nThe task is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case. The strings have a guaranteed equal length, between 1 and 100 characters.\n\n1.  **Input:** Two strings.\n2.  **Processing:** Compare them character by character, treating 'a' and 'A' as the same.\n3.  **Output:** \"-1\" if the first is smaller, \"1\" if the first is larger, and \"0\" if they are equal.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nA memory-efficient approach involves using the smallest possible data types and avoiding unnecessary variables.\n\n*   **String Storage:** We must read the two strings into memory to compare them. Since the maximum length is 100, we need character arrays of size 101 to accommodate the string and the terminating null character (`\\0`). `char` is the standard choice and is 1 byte in size.\n*   **Looping:** A loop is needed to iterate through the strings. Instead of a 4-byte `int` for the loop counter, a 1-byte `char` is sufficient, as the index will only go up to 99.\n*   **Auxiliary Variables:** We can avoid extra variables to store intermediate results (like the comparison outcome or lowercase characters) by performing the comparison and printing directly within the loop.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C code for this problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Buffers to hold the two strings.\n    // Size 101 for max length of 100 + null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read the strings from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // Use a 'char' for the loop counter to save memory,\n    // as the length is at most 100.\n    for (char i = 0; s1[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char c1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char c2 = tolower(s2[i]);\n\n        if (c1 < c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        } else if (c1 > c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe problem asks for the total memory in bytes used for the variables. Let's calculate the size of each variable declared in the `main` function. On typical competitive programming platforms (using a GCC compiler), the data type sizes are standard.\n\n*   `char s1[101];`: This is an array of 101 characters. The size of `char` is 1 byte. Total = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n*   `char s2[101];`: Same as above. Total = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n*   `char i;`: The loop counter is a single character variable. Total = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   `char c1;`: Variable to hold the lowercase version of a character from the first string. Total = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   `char c2;`: Variable to hold the lowercase version of a character from the second string. Total = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables:\n\nm = 101 (s1) + 101 (s2) + 1 (i) + 1 (c1) + 1 (c2) = **205 bytes**.\n\n<<<205>>>"
