    "The letter that should appear next in the sequence is M.\n\nThe sequence ZXXCVYBN is derived from the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard. If you examine the keyboard, you will notice that the letters are formed by a specific pattern:\n\n*   The main sequence follows the bottom row of letters from left to right: **Z, X, C, V, B, N, M**.\n*   The given sequence inserts an extra letter after every two letters of this main sequence.\n*   The pattern is constructed by taking a letter and then the letter immediately to its right.\n    *   **Z** is followed by **X**.\n    *   **X** is followed by **C**.\n    *   **C** is followed by **V**.\n    *   **V** is followed by B (but a Y is inserted). This appears to be a common variation or a mistake in the puzzle's transcription, as the prevailing pattern relates to the keyboard rows. However, the sequence gets back on track.\n    *   **Y** is followed by **B**.\n    *   **B** is followed by **N**.\n*   Following this pattern, the next pair would start with N. The letter to the right of N on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard is **M**.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
