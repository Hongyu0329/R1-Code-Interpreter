    "The ground space degeneracy of a quantum error-correcting code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits encoded. For the toric code on a given surface, the number of logical qubits is determined by the topology of that surface, including its genus and the number and type of its boundaries (or holes).\n\nThe toric code can be defined on a surface with different types of boundaries, principally \"smooth\" (also known as closed or dual) and \"rough\" (also known as open or primal). These boundary conditions dictate which type of anyonic excitation can terminate at the boundary. Specifically, charge-like excitations (created by string-like Pauli Z operators) can terminate on rough boundaries, while flux-like excitations (created by string-like Pauli X operators) can terminate on smooth boundaries.\n\nThe problem specifies a system with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This is typically understood as punctures on a planar surface, which itself has an outer boundary. The number of logical qubits can be determined by counting the number of independent logical operators. A logical qubit is defined by a pair of non-commuting logical operators, a logical X (`L_X`) and a logical Z (`L_Z`).\n\nLet's consider the surface to be a plane with a specified outer boundary, say, a rough boundary.\n\n1.  **Contribution from Smooth Holes:** For each of the `n` smooth holes, we can define a pair of logical operators.\n    *   A logical Z operator (`L_Z`) can be constructed as a string of Pauli-X operators that connects the smooth hole to the rough outer boundary. Since there are `n` such holes, we can define `n` independent operators of this type.\n    *   The corresponding logical X operator (`L_X`) is a closed loop of Pauli-Z operators that encircles the smooth hole.\n    These `n` pairs of (`L_X`, `L_Z`) operators form `n` independent logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Contribution from Rough Holes:** Similarly, for each of the `m` rough holes, we can define another set of logical operators.\n    *   A logical X operator (`L_X`) can be constructed as a string of Pauli-Z operators that connects the rough inner hole to the rough outer boundary. With `m` rough holes, we can define `m` such independent operators.\n    *   The corresponding logical Z operator (`L_Z`) is a closed loop of Pauli-X operators encircling the rough hole.\n    These `m` pairs of (`L_X`, `L_Z`) operators form another `m` independent logical qubits.\n\nThe set of logical operators associated with the smooth holes commutes with the set of logical operators associated with the rough holes. Therefore, the total number of independent logical qubits `k` is the sum of the qubits contributed by each type of hole.\n\nTotal logical qubits `k = n + m`.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is `2^k`.\nTherefore, the ground space degeneracy is `2^(n+m)`.\n\nThis result is consistent with statements found in the literature, for example, in \"Generalized surface codes and packing of logical qubits\", which indicates that for a planar lattice punctured with `b` holes of a single type (e.g., closed/smooth), the code encodes `k = b` qubits, implying an additive contribution from each hole when an appropriate outer boundary is chosen.\n\nComparing our result with the given answer choices:\nA. 2^(m+n)\nB. 2^(m+n-2)\nC. 2^(m+n+2)\nD. 2^(2m)\nE. 2^(2n)\nF. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)\n\nThe calculated degeneracy `2^(n+m)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
