    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is most fundamentally known as the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(k, ω). However, in practice, different terminology is more common depending on the specific analysis domain.\n\nWhen considering only the temporal Fourier transform of the correlation function, the commonly used term is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. If the correlation is between two different detectors, it is referred to as the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. These frequency-domain analyses are a standard part of reactor noise analysis.\n\nThe **Feynman-alpha method** is a related, but distinct, time-domain technique. It analyzes the variance-to-mean ratio of neutron counts over a given time interval to determine reactor kinetic parameters. While it deals with the same underlying neutron correlations, it is not the Fourier transform of the pair correlation function itself. The Feynman-alpha and PSD methods are often used as complementary techniques for analyzing neutron noise in nuclear systems.\n\nThe term **dynamic structure factor** is the most precise physical description for the space-time double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function and is used in the broader context of neutron scattering and transport theory.\n\n<<<The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is called the dynamic structure factor, S(k, ω), although in the context of routine reactor noise analysis, the temporal Fourier transform is more commonly referred to as the Power Spectral Density (PSD).>>>"
