    "An integral surgery on a knot can produce a homology sphere only if the surgery coefficient is ±1. The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). We will analyze the results of ±1 surgery on each of these knots.\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot result in the 3-sphere, S³. The 3-sphere represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image.\n    *   Performing a +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the Poincaré homology sphere, Σ(2,3,5).\n    *   A -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil is equivalent to a +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil, which results in the mirror image of the Poincaré homology sphere, -Σ(2,3,5).\n    *   These two manifolds are distinguished in the homology cobordism group by the Rokhlin invariant (or the closely related d-invariant). The d-invariant of Σ(2,3,5) is -2, while the d-invariant of its mirror is +2. Since these invariants are non-zero, both manifolds represent non-trivial elements in the homology cobordism group, and since the invariants are different, they represent distinct elements.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is isotopic to its mirror image.\n    *   A +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produces the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7).\n    *   Since the knot is amphichiral, a -1 surgery results in the oppositely oriented manifold, -Σ(2,3,7).\n    *   Crucially, the figure-eight knot is a slice knot. For any slice knot, ±1 surgery on it results in a homology sphere that bounds an integral homology ball. This means that the resulting manifold is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere. Therefore, both +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produce the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. This is consistent with the fact that the d-invariant of Σ(2,3,7) is 0.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The unknot yields one element: the trivial element.\n*   The figure-eight knot also yields the trivial element.\n*   The trefoil knot yields two distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of three distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings: the trivial element, and the two elements from surgery on the trefoil knot.\n\n<<<3>>>"
