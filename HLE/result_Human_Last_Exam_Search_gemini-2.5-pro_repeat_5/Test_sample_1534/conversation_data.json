    "### Brain Regions Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe in the Dwarf Cuttlefish\n\nIn the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions lying adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. These structures, along with the palliovisceral lobe itself, are part of a larger division known as the posterior subesophageal mass (PSM).\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex structure comprised of 32 to 38 distinct lobes. These lobes are organized into larger masses, including the supraesophageal and subesophageal masses, which are situated around the esophagus. The subesophageal mass is further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior sections.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass and is involved in controlling escape movements and inking. This region of the brain projects through an opening in the cranial cartilage at the back of the head.\n\nDetailed neuroanatomical studies of *Sepia* species have identified a \"palliovisceral lobe complex,\" which, in addition to the main palliovisceral lobe, includes the posterior chromatophore lobes and the vasomotor lobes. The posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) of the mantle, while the fin lobes control the movement of the fins. Studies on the closely related *Sepia officinalis* have also identified a posterior posterior chromatophore lobe (PPCL) and a magnocellular lobe within the posterior subesophageal mass, in proximity to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nA 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish confirms the close association of these lobes in the posterior region of the brain. Therefore, the most direct answer to which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes."
