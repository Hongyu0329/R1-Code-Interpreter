When the local median function is iteratively applied to a binary black and white image, the process is equivalent to a morphological filtering operation that evolves the shapes within the image. This iterative process will continue until the image reaches a fixed point, meaning it no longer changes with further applications of the filter. The ultimate effect on the edges of the image is that they are smoothed, and the regions they enclose are simplified.

This phenomenon is mathematically described as motion by mean curvature. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what occurs:

*   **Edge Smoothing:** Any sharp corners on the boundaries between black and white regions will be rounded off. For instance, the sharp corners of a white square on a black background will become curved. This is because the pixels at the tips of sharp, convex corners are surrounded by a majority of pixels of the opposite color, causing them to flip.
*   **Edge Motion:** The edges will move based on their curvature.
    *   **Convex Boundaries:** Edges that are convex from the perspective of a white region (e.g., the boundary of a white circle) will move inward. The shape will shrink over successive iterations.
    *   **Concave Boundaries:** Edges that are concave (e.g., the boundary of a black hole within a white region) will move outward, effectively filling the hole.
*   **Annihilation of Small Features:** Small or thin objects, where the size is comparable to the filter radius $\delta$, will be quickly eliminated. A small white spot will disappear, and a small black spot will be filled in. This is a key characteristic of median filtering's utility in noise removal.
*   **Convergence to a Stable State:** The iterative process is guaranteed to converge to a root image or fixed point in a finite number of iterations. For any enclosed shape (like a white object on a black background), this evolution means the shape will continuously smooth and shrink until it completely disappears. The only theoretically stable structures are perfectly straight lines that span the entire image, but on a finite grid, any closed shape will eventually be eliminated.

Therefore, as $t\rightarrow\infty$, all edges that form closed boundaries will ultimately vanish. The image will converge to a constant state, either entirely black or entirely white, depending on the initial geometry and proportions of the black and white areas. The edges first become smoother and rounder, then the shapes they define shrink and disappear.
