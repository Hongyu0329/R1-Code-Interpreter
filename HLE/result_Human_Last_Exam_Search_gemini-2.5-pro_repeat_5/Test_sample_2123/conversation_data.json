    "The surname is that of the English poet Alexander Pope.\n\nThis name appears in the Russian version of Joseph Brodsky's essay \"To Please a Shadow\" (*На угождение тени*). The essay was originally written in English and later translated into Russian by Brodsky himself.\n\nIn a passage describing Vienna, Brodsky writes about its wide boulevards. The original English sentence concludes with a reference to Sigmund Freud: \"...felt like a city designed by someone with a normal Oedipus complex who on top of that had read his **Freud**.\"\n\nHowever, in his own Russian translation, Brodsky replaces \"Freud\" with the name of the 18th-century English poet: \"...производила впечатление города, спроектированного человеком с нормальным эдиповым комплексом, которому при этом удалось прочесть всего **Попа**.\" This translates to \"...gave the impression of a city designed by a man with a normal Oedipus complex, who had moreover managed to read all of **Pope**.\"\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
