    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by the following transformation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ represents the set of generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ form a probability distribution, so $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are given by $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the flow of information from the system to the environment. It can be constructed using the Stinespring dilation theorem. If the Kraus operators of the original channel are $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel maps the input density matrix $\\rho$ to a state in the environment. The environment can be represented by a Hilbert space of dimension equal to the number of Kraus operators, which is at most $d^2$.\n\nThe action of the complementary channel is given by:\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_l^\\dagger) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\nwhere $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the $d^2$-dimensional environment space.\n\nSubstituting the Kraus operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, we get:\n$[\\Lambda^c(\\rho)]_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k \\rho U_l^\\dagger) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_l^\\dagger U_k)$\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is equivalent to the dimension of the subspace spanned by the output states $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ over all possible input density matrices $\\rho$. Let's determine the dimension of this subspace.\n\nThe mapping from an input operator $\\rho$ to the output matrix $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ is a linear map, let's call it $L$. The domain of this map is the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_d$, which has dimension $d^2$. The codomain is the space of $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_{d^2}$. The rank of the channel is the dimension of the image of this map, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(L))$.\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, we have:\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(L)) = \\text{dim}(\\text{Dom}(L)) - \\text{dim}(\\text{Ker}(L))$\nHere, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Dom}(L)) = d^2$. The kernel of the map, $\\text{Ker}(L)$, consists of all input operators $\\rho$ for which $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = 0$. This means:\n$\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_l^\\dagger U_k) = 0$ for all $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$.\n\nTo find the *maximal* rank, we can choose the parameters $p_k$ of the Pauli channel. Let's consider the case where all probabilities are non-zero, i.e., $p_k > 0$ for all $k$. A qudit depolarizing channel is an example of such a channel. In this case, the condition for $\\rho$ to be in the kernel simplifies to:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\rho U_l^\\dagger U_k) = 0$ for all $k,l$.\n\nThe product of two generalized Pauli operators, $U_l^\\dagger U_k$, is proportional to another generalized Pauli operator, $U_m$. As $k$ and $l$ range over all their possible values, the set of operators $\\{U_l^\\dagger U_k\\}$ spans the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_d$. Therefore, the condition is equivalent to $\\text{Tr}(\\rho O) = 0$ for all operators $O \\in \\mathcal{M}_d$. This implies that $\\rho$ must be the zero operator.\n\nThus, for a Pauli channel with all $p_k > 0$, the kernel of the map $L$ is trivial, i.e., $\\text{dim}(\\text{Ker}(L)) = 0$.\nThe rank of the complementary channel is then:\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(L)) = d^2 - 0 = d^2$.\n\nIf any of the probabilities $p_k$ are zero, the set of operators $\\{ \\sqrt{p_k p_l} U_l^\\dagger U_k \\}$ may not span the full space of $d \\times d$ matrices, potentially leading to a non-trivial kernel and a rank lower than $d^2$. Therefore, the maximal rank is achieved when the channel has full Kraus rank, corresponding to all $p_k$ being non-zero.\n\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d^2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit.>>>"
