    "To find the separatrix of the system, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The equilibrium points are the solutions to $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:**\n    Set $u'(t) = 0$:\n    $(u-1)u^2 = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n    Now substitute these values into $d'(t) = 0$:\n    *   If $u=0$: $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   If $u=1$: $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stability of Equilibrium Points:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   At **(1, 0)**:\n        $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n    *   At **(1, -1)**:\n        $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n    *   At **(0, 0)**:\n        $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization fails, and this is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n3.  **Find the Separatrices:**\n    Separatrices are trajectories that separate regions of different qualitative behavior, and they are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. The saddle point of this system is (1, -1). We need to find its stable and unstable manifolds.\n\n    *   **Stable Manifold:** The eigenvector for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ is found by solving $(J - (-2)I)v = 0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 3v_u=0 \\implies v_u=0$.\n        The eigenvector is in the direction $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means the stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line at (1, -1). In fact, the line **u = 1** is an invariant manifold, and it serves as the stable manifold for the saddle point.\n\n    *   **Unstable Manifold:** The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is found by solving $(J - 1I)v = 0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\n        The eigenvector is in the direction $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is tangent to a line with slope -2 at the point (1, -1).\n\n    We can test if a curve of the form $d=f(u)$ is an invariant curve of the system. Let's test the polynomial $d = -u^2$.\n    If $d = -u^2$, then $d'(t) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(u-1)u^2 = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n    Substituting $d=-u^2$ into the original equation for $d'$:\n    $d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n    The expressions match, so **d = -u^2** is an invariant curve.\n\n    This parabola passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) and (1, -1). At the point (1, -1), its slope is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$, which at $u=1$ is -2. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector of the saddle point. Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nThe separatrices are the stable ($u=1$) and unstable ($d=-u^2$) manifolds of the saddle point. The unstable manifold $d=-u^2$ separates trajectories that are drawn towards the origin from those that escape to $d \\to -\\infty$. This is often considered the principal separatrix.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
