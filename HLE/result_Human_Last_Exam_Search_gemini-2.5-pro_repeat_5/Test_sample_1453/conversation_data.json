    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and then analyze the amino acids at the core positions based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### 1. Heptad Repeat Analysis\n\nA coiled-coil is characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues, which form the core of the structure, while the other positions are generally exposed to the solvent.\n\nLet's align the given 32-residue sequence to identify this pattern. The most plausible register that places hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions is an `(e f g a b c d)n` assignment starting from the first residue.\n\n*   **Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Register:** `e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n\nThis alignment reveals the following residues at the critical 'a' and 'd' positions for four complete heptads:\n\n*   **'a' positions:** Alanine (A) at residue 4, Alanine (A) at 11, Alanine (A) at 18, and Alanine (A) at 25.\n*   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L) at residue 7, Leucine (L) at 14, Leucine (L) at 21, and Leucine (L) at 28.\n\nTherefore, the hydrophobic core of this coiled-coil is defined by a consistent pattern of **Alanine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions**.\n\n### 2. Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State\n\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) due to the precise packing requirements of the hydrophobic core.\n\n*   **Leucine at the 'd' Position:** The presence of Leucine at the 'd' position is the defining characteristic of a \"leucine zipper,\" a motif that strongly favors the formation of a **dimeric** (two-stranded) coiled-coil. Studies have shown that leucine is the most stabilizing amino acid at the 'd' position for a dimer, and substituting it with other residues, including the much smaller alanine, significantly destabilizes the dimeric structure. The consistent presence of leucine at all 'd' positions in the given sequence is a powerful indicator of a dimeric state.\n\n*   **Alanine at the 'a' Position:** In a parallel dimer, the side chains at the 'a' positions of the two helices pack against each other. The ideal residues for this position in a dimer are beta-branched amino acids like Isoleucine (I) or Valine (V), as seen in the well-studied GCN4 dimer. Alanine, having a very small methyl side chain, packs less efficiently against another alanine, which could create a small cavity in the hydrophobic core. This suboptimal packing at the 'a' position might reduce the overall stability of the dimer compared to one with Isoleucine or Valine.\n\n*   **Considering Alternatives:**\n    *   **Trimer:** Trimers are often favored by a more uniform distribution of hydrophobic residues, such as having Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions. The highly asymmetric A-L pattern of the given sequence would not pack efficiently in a trimeric structure.\n    *   **Tetramer:** Tetramers are typically promoted by having a large amino acid like Leucine at the 'a' position and a beta-branched one like Isoleucine at the 'd' position. An arrangement with only small Alanine residues at the 'a' positions would likely create a large, destabilizing cavity in the core of a tetramer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDespite the suboptimal packing provided by Alanine at the 'a' positions, the overwhelmingly strong preference of Leucine for the 'd' position of a dimer makes a **dimeric state** the most probable conformation. The leucine zipper motif is a dominant factor in determining the oligomeric state, and the sequence provided is a classic example of this motif.\n\n<<<A>>>"
