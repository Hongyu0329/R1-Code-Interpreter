The expression for the Electrical Double-Layer (EDL) potential distribution $\psi(y)$ in the microchannel is given by:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1 + \beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(\frac{H}{2} - y))}{\sinh(kH)}$
where:
*   $y$ is the transverse coordinate across the channel height, ranging from $-H/2$ at the bottom plate to $H/2$ at the top plate.
*   $z_1$ is the intrinsic zeta potential of the bottom surface.
*   $\beta$ is the slip length.
*   $k$ is the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter.
*   $H$ is the height of the microchannel.
*   $\sinh$ is the hyperbolic sine function.
