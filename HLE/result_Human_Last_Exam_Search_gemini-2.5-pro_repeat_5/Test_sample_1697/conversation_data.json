    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF, followed by methyl iodide, proceeds through a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) mechanism.\n\nThe starting molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring: a tertiary amide group (-CONEt2) and a tertiary amine group (-NMe2). Both of these groups direct the deprotonation (lithiation) to a position ortho to themselves. The tertiary amide is generally a stronger directing group than the tertiary amine.\n\nThe available ortho positions are:\n*   **Position 2:** Ortho to the amide group and ortho to the amine group.\n*   **Position 4:** Ortho to the amine group.\n*   **Position 6:** Ortho to the amide group.\n\nThe combination of sec-butyllithium (a strong base) and TMEDA (a chelating agent that increases the reactivity of the organolithium reagent) facilitates the removal of a proton from the aromatic ring. The most acidic proton is at the 2-position because it is situated ortho to both directing groups, receiving an additive effect on its acidity. Therefore, the lithium atom selectively replaces the hydrogen at the 2-position, forming a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\nThis aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I). The lithium atom is displaced, and a methyl group is introduced at the 2-position.\n\nThe final product obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
