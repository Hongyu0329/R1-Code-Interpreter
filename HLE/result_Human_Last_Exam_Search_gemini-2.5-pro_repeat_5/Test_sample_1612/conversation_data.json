    "In the history of Major League Baseball, there have been 23 players who have won the batting Triple Crown. This prestigious and unofficial honor is achieved when a player leads their respective league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nThe total number of Triple Crowns is 28, as four players have accomplished the feat more than once. Oscar Charleston holds the record with three Triple Crowns, which he won in the Negro Leagues. The other multiple winners are Rogers Hornsby, Ted Williams, and Josh Gibson, each winning it twice.\n\nThe inclusion of statistics from seven Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 into the official MLB historical record in 2020 added eight players to the list of Triple Crown winners.\n\nHere is a list of all 23 MLB Triple Crown winners:\n\n**American League**\n*   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n*   Ty Cobb (1909)\n*   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n*   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n*   Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n*   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n*   Frank Robinson (1966)\n*   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n*   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n**National League**\n*   Paul Hines (1878)\n*   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n*   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n*   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n*   Chuck Klein (1933)\n*   Joe Medwick (1937)\n\n**Negro Leagues**\n*   Oscar Charleston (1921, 1924, 1925)\n*   Heavy Johnson (1923)\n*   Mule Suttles (1926)\n*   Willie Wells (1930)\n*   Josh Gibson (1936, 1937)\n*   Lennie Pearson (1942)\n*   Ted Strong (1942)\n\n**American Association**\n*   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012, which was the first time the feat had been accomplished in 45 years.\n\n<<<23>>>"
