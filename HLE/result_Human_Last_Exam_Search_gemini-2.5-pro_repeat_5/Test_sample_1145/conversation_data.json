    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box in a specific interval is determined by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function is given by ψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a).\n\nFor the quantum state n = 2, the wave function is ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a). The probability density is therefore P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a).\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a. This probability is calculated by the integral:\n\nP = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\n\nApplying this identity, the integral becomes:\n\nP = (2/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (1/2) [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n\nP = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\nP = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin(A) - sin(B) = 2cos((A+B)/2)sin((A-B)/2):\n\nA = 2.02π, B = 1.98π\n(A+B)/2 = 2π\n(A-B)/2 = 0.02π\n\nSo, sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = 2cos(2π)sin(0.02π) = 2sin(0.02π).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for P:\n\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * 2sin(0.02π) = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nFor a small angle z (in radians), sin(z) can be approximated by the Taylor series z - z³/6. Let z = 0.02π.\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]\nP ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)²/12 ]\nP ≈ (0.02π)² / 12\nP ≈ (0.0004π²) / 12\nP ≈ (π²/3) * 10⁻⁴\n\nUsing π² ≈ 9.8696:\n\nP ≈ (9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁴ ≈ 3.2899 * 10⁻⁴\n\nAn alternative approach is to recognize that for n=2, the wave function has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box (x = 0.5a). Since the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is very small and centered around this node, the probability will be very small. We can approximate the probability density function near the node using a Taylor expansion. The result of this calculation also yields a very small probability.\n\nA more direct calculation gives:\nP ≈ (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nLet's re-verify the Taylor expansion of the final probability expression:\nP = z/(2π) - sin(z)/(2π) where z = 0.02π.\nP ≈ (1/2π) * (z - (z - z³/6)) = z³ / (12π)\nP = (0.02π)³ / (12π) = (0.000008π³) / (12π) = (8 x 10⁻⁶ π²) / 12 = (2/3)π² x 10⁻⁶\nP ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
