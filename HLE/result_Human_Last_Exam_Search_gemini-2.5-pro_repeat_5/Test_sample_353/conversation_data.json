    "The $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle for a numerical method is the largest angle $\\alpha$ for which the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\ne 0 \\}$ is contained within the method's region of absolute stability. For the Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4), the region of stability is the unbounded region outside a closed lobe in the right half-plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent line from the origin to this lobe.\n\nThe exact value of this angle has been a subject of study, with numerical approximations being available for decades and the precise analytical expression being derived more recently. According to the work of Gander and Wanner, who simplified the derivation of the exact values first found by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 is a complex expression.\n\nThe stability boundary is described by the locus of points $\\mu(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j$. The angle $\\alpha$ is the maximum value of $\\arg(-\\mu(\\theta))$. The tangent of this angle, let's call it $p_0 = \\tan(\\alpha)$, is found by maximizing the ratio of the imaginary part of $-\\mu$ to its real part. The exact expression for this maximum for BDF4 is given as:\n\n$p_0 = \\left( -\\frac{51844971}{14086400} + \\frac{5765167}{70432000}\\sqrt{2033} \\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}}$\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is the arctangent of this expression. Numerical evaluation of this expression yields an angle of approximately $73.35^\\circ$, which is consistent with established numerical results for BDF4.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left( \\left( -\\frac{51844971}{14086400} + \\frac{5765167}{70432000}\\sqrt{2033} \\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}} \\right)$\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left( \\left( -\\frac{51844971}{14086400} + \\frac{5765167}{70432000}\\sqrt{2033} \\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}} \\right)$>>>"
