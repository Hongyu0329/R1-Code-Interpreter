    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\n*   **xl** is 40 (50 - 10).\n*   **mmm** is 3000 (1000 + 1000 + 1000).\n*   **mmcmxlix** is 2949. This is broken down as MM (2000), CM (900), XL (40), and IX (9).\n\nNow, we can write the equation with modern numbers:\n\n40 / 3000 - 2949\n\nNext, we solve the equation:\n\n1.  First, perform the division: 40 ÷ 3000 = 0.01333...\n2.  Then, perform the subtraction: 0.01333... - 2949 = -2948.98667...\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the answer is -2948.9867.\n\n<<<-2948.9867>>>"
