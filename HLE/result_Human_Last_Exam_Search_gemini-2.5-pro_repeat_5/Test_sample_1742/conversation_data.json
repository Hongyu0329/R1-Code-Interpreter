    "In the representation theory of the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, there is a unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module. For hereditary algebras like this one, $\\tau$-tilting modules are equivalent to classical tilting modules. A tilting module is a slice module if and only if it is \"faithful,\" meaning its annihilator is the zero ideal. A module that is not faithful is called \"unfaithful.\"\n\nThe task is to find the unique unfaithful tilting module. A module is unfaithful if the intersection of the annihilators of its indecomposable direct summands is non-zero. The indecomposable projective modules of this algebra are faithful. Consequently, any tilting module containing a projective summand is faithful and thus a slice module.\n\nTherefore, the non-slice tilting module must be composed entirely of non-faithful indecomposable modules. For the algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the indecomposable modules that are not faithful are:\n*   $S_1$ (the simple module at vertex 1)\n*   $S_2$ (the simple module at vertex 2)\n*   $I_2$ (the injective envelope of the simple module at vertex 2)\n\nA tilting module must have a number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands equal to the number of simple modules of the algebra, which is three in this case. Thus, the unique candidate for the non-slice $\\tau$-tilting module is the direct sum of these three modules: $M = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\nTo confirm this, we must verify that $M$ is indeed a tilting module. For a hereditary algebra, this requires checking that $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(M, M) = 0$. Calculations confirm that for any pair of direct summands $X, Y$ from $\\{S_1, I_2, S_2\\}$, the extension group $\\operatorname{Ext}_A^1(X, Y)$ is zero.\n\nSince this module is composed solely of non-faithful modules, it is itself not faithful. Because it is an unfaithful tilting module, it cannot be a slice module. Its uniqueness stems from the fact that it is the only possible combination of three non-faithful indecomposable modules.\n\n<<<The unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$.>>>"
