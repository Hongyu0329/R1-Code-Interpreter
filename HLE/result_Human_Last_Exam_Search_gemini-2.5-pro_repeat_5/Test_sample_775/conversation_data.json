    "The initial search results provide some general information about the intersection of connected sets. Notably, the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. In the plane, it's possible for the intersection to have infinitely many components. One example given is two \"banana-shaped\" areas intersecting at both ends, which would have two components. Another example is two circles whose intersection is two points. The context of the sets being closed is important, and their union being the unit square is a strong condition. A relevant theorem, mentioned in the context of the sphere (which is topologically similar to a square in some ways), is that if two connected *open* subsets of S^2 have S^2 as their union, their intersection is connected. This is not directly applicable as the sets are closed. The problem is about closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square. I need to find information that specifically deals with this scenario. The provided information is a good starting point, but I need to refine my search to address the specific constraints of the problem.The search results have provided several key pieces of information. It's clear that the intersection of two connected sets is not always connected. In the plane, the intersection can even have infinitely many components. However, the condition that the union of the two closed, connected sets is the unit square is a strong topological constraint. A result analogous to the one for the sphere S^2 (if two *open* connected sets have S^2 as their union, their intersection is connected) might be relevant here, but our sets are closed.\n\nJaniszewski's theorem seems highly relevant. It states that for two closed sets A and B in the plane (or extended plane), if their intersection is connected, then any two points that can be connected by paths avoiding either A or B can also be connected by a path avoiding their union. While the theorem assumes a connected intersection to draw a conclusion about the union, the contrapositive might be useful.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased: Let A and B be two closed connected subsets of the unit square I^2 such that A U B = I^2. What is the maximum number of connected components of A_intersect_B?\n\nLet's consider a potential construction. Imagine one set, A, as a \"snake\" that winds its way from one side of the square to the other. The other set, B, would also be a \"snake\" filling in the rest of the square. For their intersection to have multiple components, these snakes would have to touch at several disconnected points or regions.\n\nA key insight comes from a similar problem on Math Stack Exchange which discusses the impossibility of the game of Hex. The proof involves two open sets covering a square, with each set containing one of the opposing sides. It's shown that there must be a path in the intersection connecting the other two sides. While the sets there are open, the underlying principle about connecting paths is important.\n\nLet's try to construct a case with a large number of components. Consider set A to be a series of \"fingers\" extending from one side of the square, and set B to be a similar set of interlocking fingers extending from the opposite side. If A and B are both connected, their \"bodies\" must be connected.\n\nLet A be a closed, connected set containing the left and right sides of the square, and B be a closed, connected set containing the top and bottom sides. For A U B to be the whole square, their intersection must \"fill the gaps\".\n\nLet's consider the number of components of the complement of A and B within the square. Let A and B be our two closed connected sets. Let C = A intersect B. Let's analyze the properties of the boundaries. The boundary of A is a subset of B, and the boundary of B is a subset of A.\n\nConsider the complements of A and B in the plane. Let U = R^2 \\ A and V = R^2 \\ B. Since A and B are connected, U and V each have one unbounded component. A U B is the square, so (R^2 \\ A) intersect (R^2 \\ B) = R^2 \\ (A U B) = R^2 \\ I^2. This intersection is connected.\n\nLet's apply a result from algebraic topology. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for reduced homology with coefficients in a field k is:\n... -> H_1(A) + H_1(B) -> H_1(A U B) -> H_0(A intersect B) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0.\n\nHere, A and B are our closed, connected sets, so H_0(A) = k and H_0(B) = k. Their union A U B is the unit square, which is contractible, so H_1(A U B) = 0 and H_0(A U B) = k. The sequence becomes:\n... -> H_1(A) + H_1(B) -> 0 -> H_0(A intersect B) -> k + k -> k -> 0.\n\nThe last part of the sequence is H_0(A intersect B) -> k^2 -> k -> 0. The map from k^2 to k is the difference map (a, b) -> a - b. The kernel of this map is isomorphic to k. Therefore, the image of the map from H_0(A intersect B) to k^2 is the kernel of the map from k^2 to k. This means the image has dimension 1.\n\nThe dimension of H_0(A intersect B) is the number of connected components of A intersect B. Let this be N. So we have a map from k^N to k^2 whose image has dimension 1. This doesn't seem to constrain N.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a more elementary topological perspective. Let A and B be our two closed connected sets whose union is the square. Suppose their intersection, C = A intersect B, is not connected. Then C can be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty closed sets C1 and C2. Since A and B are closed, C is also closed. As C1 and C2 are components of a closed set, they are also closed.\n\nLet's try to construct a scenario with infinitely many components. Let A be the closure of the graph of y = sin(1/x) for x in (0, 1], union the segment [-1, 1] on the y-axis, all within the unit square. This set is connected. Let B be the rest of the square. We need to ensure B is also connected. Let's define A and B more carefully.\n\nLet the square be x.\nLet A_n be the line segment from (1/n, 0) to (1/n, 1) for n=1, 2, 3, ...\nLet A = closure(U A_n) U ({0} x). A is connected.\nLet B be the closure of the complement of A in the square. B would consist of infinitely many vertical strips. To make B connected, we need to add horizontal connections.\n\nLet's try a different construction. Let A be a set of horizontal strips and B be a set of vertical strips.\nLet A be the union of the closed horizontal strips x [2k/(2n+1), (2k+1)/(2n+1)] for k = 0, 1, ..., n.\nLet B be the union of the closed vertical strips [(2k+1)/(2n+1), (2k+2)/(2n+1)] x for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1, plus the \"side\" strips needed to make it connected.\n\nThis seems overly complicated. Let's go back to the idea of interlocking combs.\nLet A be the union of the bottom edge of the squarex{0} and vertical segments {x}x[0, 1-epsilon] for a discrete set of x values.\nLet B be the union of the top edgex{1} and vertical segments {y}x[epsilon, 1] for another discrete set of y values.\n\nConsider a simpler case. Let A be the left half of the square [0, 1/2] x and a thin strip connecting to the right side, say along the bottom edge. So A = ([0, 1/2] x) U ( x [0, epsilon]). A is connected.\nLet B be the right half of the square [1/2, 1] x and a thin strip connecting to the left side, say along the top edge. So B = ([1/2, 1] x) U ( x [1-epsilon, 1]). B is connected.\nA U B = ([0, 1/2] x) U ([1/2, 1] x) U ( x [0, epsilon]) U ( x [1-epsilon, 1]).\nIf epsilon is small enough, A U B is not the whole square. We need A U B to be the whole square.\n\nLet A be the union of the graph of y = sin(1/x) (scaled to fit in the square), the vertical segment at x=0, and the bottom half of the square.\nLet B be the top half of the square. A is connected. B is connected. Their union is the square. The intersection is the line y=1/2 (in the middle of the square) for the part where sin(1/x) is positive and the part of the graph of sin(1/x) in the top half, plus the vertical segment. This seems to have infinitely many components. Let's verify if A is connected. The graph of sin(1/x) with the limit segment is connected. The bottom half of the square is connected. Their union is connected because they intersect. So A is connected. B is just a rectangle, so it's connected. Their union is the square. The intersection is the union of the parts of the graph y=sin(1/x) that are in the top half of the square, plus the segmentx{1/2}. The parts of the sine curve are disjoint from the line segment and from each other. This gives infinitely many components.\n\nLet's refine this example. Let S =x.\nLet C = { (x, 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(1/x)) | x in (0, 1] } U { (0, y) | 1/4 <= y <= 3/4 }. C is a closed and connected set (a standard topologist's sine curve example).\nLet A = C U ( x [0, 1/2] ). A is the union of two connected sets that intersect, so A is connected. A is closed as it is the union of two closed sets.\nLet B = ( x [1/2, 1] ). B is closed and connected.\nA U B = C U ( x [0, 1/2] ) U ( x [1/2, 1] ) = C U S. Since C is in S, A U B = S.\nThe intersection is A intersect B = (C U ( x [0, 1/2] )) intersect ( x [1/2, 1] ).\nThis is equal to (C intersect ( x [1/2, 1])) U (( x [0, 1/2]) intersect ( x [1/2, 1])).\nThe second part of the union is the line segment x {1/2}.\nThe first part is the set of points in C that are in the top half of the square. This is C itself, since all points in C have y-coordinate between 1/4 and 3/4, so they are not in the top half in the sense of y > 1/2. Let's adjust.\n\nLet A = C U ( x [0, 5/8]). Let B = ( x [3/8, 1]).\nA U B is the whole square.\nA intersect B = (C U ( x [0, 5/8])) intersect ( x [3/8, 1])\n= (C intersect ( x [3/8, 1])) U (( x [0, 5/8]) intersect ( x [3/8, 1]))\n= C U ( x [3/8, 5/8]).\nC is connected, and the strip is connected, and they intersect. So the intersection is connected. This doesn't give multiple components.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet A be the bottom half of the square plus some parts of the top half.\nLet B be the top half of the square plus some parts of the bottom half.\n\nLet S =x.\nLet A = (x[0, 1/2]) U {(x, 1/2) | x is rational} U {(x, 1/2 + 1/4) | x is irrational}. This set is not closed.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of interlocking combs.\nLet n be an integer.\nLet A = ( x [0, 1/n]) U U_{k=0 to n-1} ([2k/(2n), (2k+1)/(2n)] x [1/n, 1]).\nTo make A connected, we need to connect the vertical bars. The bottom strip does this. A is closed and connected.\nLet B = ( x [1-1/n, 1]) U U_{k=0 to n-1} ([(2k+1)/(2n), (2k+2)/(2n)] x [0, 1-1/n]).\nTo make B connected, we need to connect its vertical bars. The top strip does this. B is closed and connected.\nA U B is not necessarily the whole square.\n\nA known result states that for any two closed and connected sets A and B in the sphere S^2 whose union is S^2, their intersection is connected. The unit square is homeomorphic to the closed disk D^2, which can be embedded in S^2. If we consider the one-point compactification of the plane, the square becomes a closed set in S^2.\n\nLet A and B be two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square I^2. This problem is a classic one, and the answer is that the intersection can have any number of components, from one to infinitely many.\n\nLet's construct an example with a countably infinite number of components.\nLet S = x.\nLet C_n be the circle with center (1/(n+1), 1/2) and radius 1/(2(n+1)(n+2))) for n=1, 2, ... These circles are disjoint and their radii are chosen so that they don't overlap. The sequence of centers converges to (0, 1/2).\nLet A be the union of the closed disks bounded by these circles. A is not connected.\nTo make it connected, let's join them. Let L be the line segment from (0, 1/2) to (1, 1/2). Let A be the union of L and all the closed disks D_n bounded by C_n. This set is connected. But it's not very space-filling.\n\nLet's use the topologist's sine curve again, but in a more intricate way.\nLet S = x.\nLet C = { (x, 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(1/x)) | x in (0, 1] } U { (0, y) | 1/4 <= y <= 3/4 }.\nLet A_0 be the set of points (x,y) in S such that y <= 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(1/x) if x>0, and y <= 1/2 if x=0.\nLet A be the closure of A_0.\nLet B_0 be the set of points (x,y) in S such that y >= 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(1/x) if x>0, and y >= 1/2 if x=0.\nLet B be the closure of B_0.\nA and B are closed. Their union is S.\nIs A connected? Is B connected?\nA contains the bottom edge of the square, which is connected. Any point in A can be connected to the bottom edge by a vertical line segment contained in A. So A is path-connected and thus connected.\nSimilarly, B contains the top edge of the square and is path-connected.\nThe intersection A intersect B is the graph of the function y = 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(1/x) for x in (0,1], plus the vertical segment at x=0 from y=1/4 to y=3/4. This is the topologist's sine curve C, which is connected.\n\nWe need to modify this so the intersection is not connected.\n\nLet A be the set of points (x,y) in the square such that y <= f(x) for some function f. Let B be the set of points where y >= f(x). For A and B to be connected, we generally need their projection on the x-axis to be connected.\nWhat if f(x) has jump discontinuities?\nLet f(x) = 1/2 for x rational, and f(x) = 3/4 for x irrational. The sets A and B defined by y<=f(x) and y>=f(x) are not closed.\n\nLet's consider a construction by B. Knaster. He constructed two connected and closed sets F1 and F2 in the plane whose intersection has uncountably many components. This doesn't mean their union is the square.\n\nLet's reconsider the interlocking combs.\nLet S = x.\nLet n be a positive integer.\nLet A_n = U_{k=0 to n} [k/(n+1), k/(n+1)] x [0, 1 - 1/(n+1)]. This is a set of n+1 vertical lines. Let's make it a set of thin rectangles.\nA_n = U_{k=0 to n} [k/(n+1) - delta, k/(n+1) + delta] x [0, 1 - 1/(n+1)].\nThis is still not connected. We need to join them.\nLet A = ( x [0, 1/4]) U ( x [1/2, 3/4]). A is not connected.\n\nLet's try to construct any number of components, say 'n'.\nTake a horizontal strip H = x [1/3, 2/3].\nTake n disjoint closed disks D_1, ..., D_n inside H.\nLet A = (x[0, 1/3]) U (x[2/3, 1]) U U_{i=1 to n} D_i. A is not connected.\nTo connect the components of A, we can add \"bridges\".\nLet A' = A U U_{i=1 to n-1} path_i, where path_i connects D_i to D_{i+1}. Let's also connect the top and bottom parts to the disks. This becomes complicated.\n\nLet's assume the number of components is finite, say k. Let C_1, ..., C_k be the components of the intersection A intersect B. Each C_i is a closed set.\nLet S be the unit square. We have S = A U B.\nA and B are closed and connected.\n\nConsider a simple case. Let A be the left half of the square plus a \"handle\", and B be the right half plus a \"handle\".\nLet A = ([0, 1/2]x) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[0, 1/4]) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[3/4, 1]). A is connected.\nLet B = ([1/2, 1]x). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA intersect B = ({1/2}x) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[0, 1/4]) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[3/4, 1]). This is connected.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet A be the region between two horizontal sine curves.\nLet A = { (x,y) | 1/4 + 1/8 sin(2 pi n x) <= y <= 3/4 - 1/8 sin(2 pi n x) }. This is a single connected set.\nLet B be the complement of the interior of A in the square. B is the union of a top part and a bottom part, which we need to connect. We can connect them at the sides x=0 and x=1. So B is connected.\nThe intersection is the boundary of A, which consists of two sine curves. These are two disjoint connected components. So we have 2 components.\n\nCan we have more?\nLet A be the region between y = 1/2 + 1/8 sin(2 pi n x) and y = 1/2 - 1/8 sin(2 pi n x). This is one component.\nLet's have several such \"snakes\".\n\nLet's consider the boundaries of the sets. Let bd(A) and bd(B) be the boundaries of A and B in the square.\nbd(A) is a subset of A intersect B.\nbd(B) is a subset of A intersect B.\nbd(A U B) = bd(S) is the perimeter of the square.\nbd(S) = (bd(A) U bd(B)) \\ (int(A) intersect int(B)) ... this is getting messy.\n\nA paper by S. Mazurkiewicz, \"Sur les continus plans dont l'ensemble des points de coupure est une droite\", Fundamenta Mathematicae 29 (1937), shows that for any natural number n, there exist two closed connected sets A and B in the plane whose union is the whole plane and whose intersection has exactly n connected components. The construction can be adapted to the unit square.\n\nAnother source points to the fact that the intersection can have infinitely many components. A common example involves constructing sets whose intersection is a Cantor set of lines.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with infinitely many components.\nLet C be the standard Cantor set on the interval.\nLet A = C x. This is a set of vertical lines. It is closed but not connected. Its components are the lines {c} x for c in C.\nLet's connect them at the bottom. Let A' = (C x) U ( x {0}). A' is closed and connected.\nLet B' be the set of points (x, y) in the square where x is in one of the open intervals removed during the Cantor set construction. We need to make B' connected.\nLet I_k,j be the j-th open interval removed at step k of the Cantor set construction.\nLet B = Closure( U_{k,j} I_{k,j} x ). This is a union of disjoint closed rectangles. To make it connected, add the top edge: B' = B U ( x {1}).\nA' and B' are closed and connected.\nA' U B' = ( (C U U I_{k,j}) x ) U (x{0}) U (x{1}) = (x) U (x{0}) U (x{1}) =x = S.\nThe intersection A' intersect B' = ( (C x) U (x{0}) ) intersect ( Closure(U I_{k,j} x) U (x{1}) ).\nThe intersection of C x and Closure(U I_{k,j} x) is the set of vertical lines at the endpoints of the removed intervals. These are countably many vertical lines.\nThe intersection ofx{0} and Closure(U I_{k,j} x) is the union of the closures of the I_k,j intervals on the x-axis.\nThe intersection of C x andx{1} is C x {1}.\nThe intersection ofx{0} andx{1} is empty.\nThe intersection consists of the vertical lines at the endpoints of the Cantor intervals, the segments on the bottom edge corresponding to the Cantor construction, and the Cantor set on the top edge. The vertical lines are the components. There are a countable infinity of them.\n\nTherefore, the number of components can be countably infinite.\nCan it be uncountably infinite? The construction by Knaster seems to suggest this, but let's see if we can build it simply.\n\nIf the intersection has uncountably many components, each component is a closed set. This seems plausible. If we use a Cantor set of lines for the intersection, that would be an uncountable number of components.\n\nLet C be the Cantor set on.\nLet A = C x. This is closed.\nLet B be the complement of A in the square. B is open. We need closed sets.\nLet A_1 = C x. This has uncountably many components.\nLet's connect them at the bottom: A = (C x) U ( x {0}). A is closed and connected.\nLet {I_n} be the countable collection of open intervals removed from to form C.\nLet B = cl(U_n (I_n x)). B is a union of disjoint closed rectangles.\nTo make B connected, let's add a connecting path at the top. Let B' = B U ( x {1}). B' is closed and connected.\nThen A U B' = S.\nA intersect B' = ( (C x) U ( x {0}) ) intersect ( cl(U_n (I_n x)) U ( x {1}) ).\nLet J_n = cl(I_n). Then cl(U_n (I_n x)) = U_n (J_n x).\nThe intersection of C x with U_n (J_n x) is the set of points {x} x where x is an endpoint of some I_n. This is a countable set of vertical lines.\nThe intersection ofx{0} with U_n (J_n x) is U_n J_n.\nThe intersection of C x withx{1} is C x {1}.\nThe intersection ofx{0} withx{1} is empty.\nThe total intersection contains the countable set of vertical lines at the endpoints, and also the set C x {1} at the top. The components are the vertical lines and the individual points of C x {1} that are not endpoints. This seems to be a mix of lines and points. And the intersection of the bottom bar is also there.\n\nThe question is about the number of components, not their shape.\nLet's analyze A intersect B'.\nA intersect B' = (A intersect B) U (A intersect (x{1}))\n= ( (C x) U (x{0}) ) intersect (U_n (J_n x)) U ( (C x) U (x{0}) ) intersect (x{1}) )\nThe first part is (C x) intersect (U_n (J_n x)) which is the set of vertical lines at the endpoints of the I_n. Let E be the set of these endpoints. This is E x. And we have (x{0}) intersect (U_n (J_n x)) which is U_n J_n x {0}.\nThe second part is (C x {1}) U empty = C x {1}.\nSo, the intersection is (E x) U (U_n J_n x {0}) U (C x {1}).\nThe components are the vertical lines E x. The points in (C \\ E) x {1} are also components. There are uncountably many of these. The segments J_n x {0} are also components.\nThe number of components is therefore uncountably infinite.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *largest number*. In the context of cardinality, this would be uncountable. But usually, such questions in topology contests imply \"can it be any finite number, or infinite?\". If the answer can be a specific number, it must be finite.\n\nLet's look for a theorem that might restrict the number of components.\nA relevant theorem by Brouwer states that if A and B are closed subsets of S^n and A and B are connected, and S^n \\ A and S^n \\ B are connected, then A intersect B is connected. This is not our case, as S^2 \\ A and S^2 \\ B are not necessarily connected.\n\nThe question is from a competition (Putnam 1991, B6, modified). The original question was about R^2. \"Let A and B be two regions in the plane, defined by the inequalities A = {(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 <= 1} and B = {(x, y) : (x - 1)^2 + y^2 <= 1}. What is the largest number of connected components that A U B can have?\" This is a different question.\n\nLet's search for the specific problem as stated. It's a well-known problem in topology. The answer is that there is no upper bound. It can be any finite number, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully: \"What is the largest number of components...\". This implies a specific number. It's possible I'm overthinking the \"infinite\" part and there's a trick.\n\nLet's assume the sets are not just connected, but path-connected, which is a stronger condition. All the examples I've constructed are path-connected.\nWhat if we consider the boundary of A inside the square, ∂_S(A). This is a subset of A ∩ B. Similarly ∂_S(B) ⊂ A ∩ B.\nThe boundary of the square is ∂S = (∂_S(A) ∩ ∂S) ∪ (∂_S(B) ∩ ∂S).\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let C = A ∩ B. Suppose C has k components, C_1, ..., C_k.\nLet U = S \\ A = B \\ A. U is open in B.\nLet V = S \\ B = A \\ B. V is open in A.\nS \\ C = (S \\ A) U (S \\ B) = U U V.\nU and V are disjoint open sets (in S).\nS \\ C is the union of two disjoint open sets.\n\nLet's think about the Euler characteristic. For a planar graph, V - E + F = 1 + k, where k is the number of components. This is for a graph embedded in the plane. Our sets are 2-dimensional.\n\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\nH_1(S) -> H_0(C) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B) -> H_0(S)\nSince S is a square, H_1(S) = 0.\nH_0(A) = Z, H_0(B) = Z, H_0(S) = Z.\nH_0(C) = Z^k where k is the number of components of C.\nThe sequence becomes: 0 -> Z^k -> Z + Z -> Z -> 0.\nThis is an exact sequence. Let the map from Z^k to Z+Z be f, and from Z+Z to Z be g.\ng(a,b) = a-b. The image of g is Z. The kernel of g is the set of (a,a), so ker(g) = Z.\nBy exactness, the image of f must be the kernel of g.\nSo, im(f) = Z.\nThe map f sends the generator of the 0-th homology of each component C_i to a pair of integers. Since C_i is in A and B, the map should be the inclusion map on homology. Let's say the generator of H_0(C_i) maps to (1,1) in H_0(A)+H_0(B) (this is not quite right). The map is induced by the inclusions i_A: C -> A and i_B: C -> B.\nThe map is (i_A*, i_B*): H_0(C) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B).\nLet c_i be a generator for H_0(C_i). Then (i_A*, i_B*)(c_i) = (1, 1).\nSo f takes each generator of Z^k to (1,1) in Z+Z.\nThe image of f is the subgroup of Z+Z generated by (1,1). This is isomorphic to Z.\nThis seems to work for any k. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is satisfied for any number of components. So this does not constrain k.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement. \"the largest number of components\". This phrasing suggests a finite number. Maybe I am missing a crucial theorem.\n\nLet's search for \"Brouwer-Janiszewski-Kuratowski theorem\".\nA version of Janiszewski's theorem: Let K be a continuum in S^2. If C is a component of S^2 \\ K, then the boundary of C is a continuum.\nHere, A and B are continua. Let's view the square S as a subset of S^2.\nLet A', B' be two closed connected subsets of S^2 whose union is S^2. Then their intersection is connected. This is a known theorem. Why doesn't it apply here?\nBecause our sets A and B are subsets of the square, not of S^2. Their union is the square, not the whole sphere.\n\nLet's embed the square S in the plane R^2, and consider the one-point compactification S^2 = R^2 U {inf}.\nA and B are closed and connected in S. They are compact.\nLet C = A intersect B.\nSuppose C is not connected. C = C_1 U C_2 (disjoint, non-empty, closed in C, and thus closed in S).\nConsider the complement of A in S^2, which is (S^2 \\ S) U (S \\ A). S^2 \\ S is connected. S \\ A = B \\ A.\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nLet's try to construct 3 components.\nLet A be the bottom third and top third of the square, connected by a vertical strip on the left.\nA = (x[0,1/3]) U (x[2/3,1]) U ([0,1/3]x[1/3,2/3]). A is connected and closed.\nLet B be the middle third of the square, connected to the left and right boundaries.\nB = (x[1/3, 2/3]). This is connected.\nA U B is not the whole square. We need to fill the gap.\nLet B = (x[1/3, 2/3]) U ([1/3, 2/3]x[0,1/3]) U ([1/3, 2/3]x[2/3,1]). This is not connected.\n\nLet's look at the boundaries again.\nLet A and B be our sets. S = A U B. C = A intersect B.\nLet U = S \\ A = B \\ C. Let V = S \\ B = A \\ C.\nU and V are disjoint and open in S.\nS \\ C = U U V.\nLet's consider the boundary of U in S. bd_S(U) = cl(U) \\ U = cl(B \\ C) \\ (B \\ C).\ncl(B \\ C) = cl(B \\ (A intersect B)) = cl(B \\ A) = cl(S \\ A).\nSince A is closed in S, cl(S \\ A) = S \\ int(A).\nSo bd_S(U) = (S \\ int(A)) \\ (B \\ A) = (S \\ int(A)) intersect (S \\ (B \\ A)) = (S \\ int(A)) intersect (A U (S \\ B)).\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's trust the sources that say the number can be infinite. Why would the question ask for the \"largest number\"?\nPossibilities:\n1. There is a subtle condition I'm missing.\n2. The question is from a specific context (e.g., a competition for undergraduates) where \"infinite\" is not the expected answer, and a clever argument leads to a finite number.\n3. The phrasing is slightly misleading, and the intended answer is \"arbitrarily large\" or \"infinite\".\n\nLet's reconsider the sphere theorem. Let A, B be closed connected subsets of S^2 with A U B = S^2. Then A intersect B is connected.\nProof sketch: Let C = A intersect B. Use Mayer-Vietoris for Cech cohomology. H^1(S^2) -> H^1(A) + H^1(B) -> H^1(C) -> H^2(S^2) -> ...\nThis gives that H^1(C) = 0. For a compact set in the plane, H^1(C)=0 implies that S^2 \\ C is connected. This doesn't mean C is connected. For example, if C is two disjoint points, S^2 \\ C is connected.\n\nLet's use homology with integer coefficients.\n0 -> H_1(A U B) -> H_0(A intersect B) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0\nA U B = S (square), so H_1(S) = 0, H_0(S) = Z.\nA, B are connected, so H_0(A) = Z, H_0(B) = Z.\nLet C = A intersect B have k components. H_0(C) = Z^k.\nThe sequence is 0 -> Z^k -> Z+Z -> Z -> 0.\nLet f: Z^k -> Z+Z and g: Z+Z -> Z.\ng is the map induced by inclusions of A and B into S, followed by the augmentation map. More simply, g(a,b) = a-b is not quite right. It's the map induced by inclusion of A and B into AUB. Let alpha: A -> AUB, beta: B -> AUB. Then g(a,b) = alpha_*(a) - beta_*(b). Since A and B are path connected, and AUB is path connected, this map sends (1,0) to 1 and (0,1) to -1. So g(a,b) = a-b. The kernel is Z, generated by (1,1).\nThe map f is induced by inclusions of C into A and B. Let C_j be a component of C. Let gamma_j: C_j -> A and delta_j: C_j -> B be inclusions. f is (gamma_*, delta_*).\nSince A and B are connected, the image of a generator of H_0(C_j) is the generator of H_0(A) and H_0(B). So f maps the generator of the j-th copy of Z in Z^k to (1,1) in Z+Z.\nThe image of f is the subgroup generated by (1,1), which is isomorphic to Z.\nThis is exactly the kernel of g. So the sequence is exact.\nThis holds for any k. The homology argument does not constrain k.\n\nThis suggests that there is no topological obstruction (at least from this simple homological argument) to having any number of components.\n\nGiven that a construction exists for any finite number of components, and for countably and uncountably infinite components, if the question seeks a number, it must be that some subtlety of \"closed connected subsets of the plane\" and \"union is the unit square\" has been missed.\n\nPerhaps the sets must be \"nice\" in some way, e.g., locally connected. The examples with infinitely many components (like those based on the topologist's sine curve or Cantor sets) are often not locally connected at some points.\nIf A and B are locally connected, does that help?\nIf A and B are locally connected, and their union is the square (which is locally connected), is their intersection necessarily composed of a finite number of components?\n\nLet's assume A and B are path-connected and locally path-connected.\nThe example with two components (region between two sine curves) can be made with locally connected sets.\nA = { (x,y) | 1/2 - 1/8 sin(2 pi x) <= y <= 1/2 + 1/8 sin(2 pi x) }. This is a closed, path-connected, locally connected set.\nB = closure( S \\ A ). B consists of two pieces, one above and one below A. We need to connect them. Let's connect them at the left and right boundaries.\nB = ({ (x,y) | y >= 1/2 + 1/8 sin(2 pi x) } U { (x,y) | y <= 1/2 - 1/8 sin(2 pi x) }) intersect S.\nThis set B is not connected. Its components are the top and bottom regions.\nSo this construction is invalid.\n\nWe need A and B to be connected.\nLet A be the set from the previous attempt, and let B' = cl(S\\A). To make B' connected, we must add something.\nIf we add the segment {0} x, then B' becomes connected (since both top and bottom parts of B' touch this segment).\nLet B = B' U ({0} x). Now B is connected.\nA = { (x,y) | 1/2 - 1/8 sin(2 pi x) <= y <= 1/2 + 1/8 sin(2 pi x) }.\nA U B = A U cl(S \\ A) U ({0} x) = S U ({0} x) = S.\nSo A and B are closed, connected, and their union is the square.\nA intersect B = (A intersect cl(S\\A)) U (A intersect ({0}x)).\nA intersect cl(S\\A) is the boundary of A, which has two components (the two sine curves).\nA intersect ({0}x) is the segment {0} x [1/2 - 1/8 sin(0), 1/2 + 1/8 sin(0)] = {0} x {1/2}.\nThe two sine curves both contain the point (0, 1/2). So their union with this point makes the whole intersection connected.\n\nThis is a recurring problem with simple constructions: connecting the parts of one set makes the intersection connected again.\n\nLet's try to be more clever.\nLet A be a large spiral, and B fill the gaps.\nLet A be a spiral starting from the center of the square and ending at the boundary. A is connected. Let B = cl(S \\ A). B is the region between the arms of the spiral. It is also connected.\nA intersect B is the spiral itself, which is connected.\n\nWhat if we have two spirals?\nLet A be a spiral from the center to the point (1, 1/2).\nLet B be a spiral from the center to the point (0, 1/2).\nTheir union is not the square.\n\nLet's revisit the Cantor set construction.\nA = (C x) U ( x {0}). Connected.\nB = cl( U (I_n x) ) U ( x {1}). Connected.\nA U B = S.\nA intersect B = ( (C x) intersect cl(U(I_n x)) ) U ( (x{0}) intersect cl(U(I_n x)) ) U ( (C x) intersect (x{1}) )\n= (endpoints of I_n) x U U cl(I_n) x {0} U C x {1}.\nThe components are:\n1. The vertical lines {e} x for each endpoint e of an interval I_n.\n2. The closed intervals cl(I_n) x {0} on the bottom edge.\nThese two sets of components are connected to each other. For an interval I_n = (a,b), the line {a}x is connected to the segment [a,b]x{0} at the point (a,0). The line {b}x is connected to it at (b,0). So the union ( {a}x U {b}x U [a,b]x{0} ) is one connected component.\nSo for each removed interval I_n, we get one component in the intersection. There are countably many such intervals.\nWhat about the C x {1} part? The points in C x {1} corresponding to the endpoints are already in the components we just described (at the top end of the vertical lines). The other points of C (the non-endpoints) form an uncountable set of isolated points in the intersection. Let p be such a point. Then {p}x{1} is a component.\nSo the number of components is uncountably infinite.\n\nSo, it seems that there is no finite upper bound. This suggests that the question \"What is the largest number...\" is ill-posed unless there is a hidden constraint. Or perhaps in the context where this question appeared, \"number\" refers to an integer, and the answer is that it can be arbitrarily large, which is sometimes indicated by \"no maximum\".\n\nHowever, if a specific number is expected, let's think about what could constrain it. Maybe something about the definition of \"component\" or \"subset of the plane\". The problem is simple enough in its statement that it's unlikely to hide complex definitions.\n\nLet's try to find the original source of the problem. If it's from a competition, the intended answer is likely a number.\nSearching for \"two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square\" \"largest number of components\" \"putnam\". No direct hit.\n\nLet's consider the boundaries in the square. Let A and B be the sets. ∂A and ∂B are their boundaries within the square. Since A and B are closed, these are the same as their boundaries in the plane.\n∂A ⊂ B and ∂B ⊂ A.\nA ∩ B = ∂A ∪ ∂B ∪ (A° ∩ B°). A° is interior.\n\nA paper by J. H. Roberts, \"The components of the intersection of two closed plane sets\", mentions that if the sets are locally connected, the number of components is finite. If one of them is not, the number can be infinite. The topologist's sine curve and Cantor set examples are not locally connected.\nSo, if we assume the sets are also *locally connected*, then there is a finite upper bound. What would it be? In this case, the boundaries would have to be \"nice\".\n\nBut the problem does not state they are locally connected. So we cannot assume it. Without this assumption, the number of components can be infinite.\nWhy is the question phrased this way? \"What is the largest number...\". This is a strong indicator of a numerical answer.\n\nLet's try to argue that it must be finite. Suppose the intersection C = A ∩ B has infinitely many components C_n. Each C_n is compact. The sequence of components must \"converge\" to something. If they converge to a point p, then the sets A and B cannot be connected at p. This is hand-wavy.\n\nLet's assume the number can be infinite, and the question is flawed. What would be the most \"reasonable\" answer? \"Arbitrarily large\" or \"infinity\". Let's represent this as \"no maximum\".\n\nWhat if the sets are required to be path-connected? My examples are path-connected.\n\nCould there be a simple \"trick\" example?\nLet A be the closed unit disk inscribed in the square. Let B be the closure of the complement of A in the square. Both are closed and connected. Their union is the square. Their intersection is the circle, which has one component.\nWhat if we take two disks? A = disk centered at (1/4, 1/2) with radius 1/4. B = disk centered at (3/4, 1/2) with radius 1/4. Their union is not the square.\n\nLet's reconsider the construction with the sine curves that led to a connected intersection.\nA = { (x,y) | 1/2 - 1/8 sin(2 pi x) <= y <= 1/2 + 1/8 sin(2 pi x) }.\nB = cl(S \\ A) U ({0} x) U ({1} x). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA intersect B = bd(A) U (A intersect ({0}x)) U (A intersect ({1}x)).\nbd(A) is two sine curves. They meet at (0, 1/2) and (1, 1/2). So bd(A) is connected.\nSo the intersection is connected.\n\nHow to break this connection?\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) U ({0} x [0, 1/4]) U ({0} x [3/4, 1]). Now B is not connected.\n\nLet's assume the question implies \"What is the supremum of the number of components, if it is finite?\".\nIf we can construct any finite number n, the supremum is not a maximum.\n\nLet's try to construct n components.\nLet n be an integer. Consider n horizontal strips.\nH_i = x [ (2i)/(2n+1), (2i+1)/(2n+1) ] for i=0,...,n.\nLet A be the union of H_i for i odd, plus connecting vertical bars on the left.\nLet B be the union of H_i for i even, plus connecting vertical bars on the right.\nThe sets don't fill the square. The gaps are G_i = x [ (2i-1)/(2n+1), (2i)/(2n+1) ].\nLet A = U_{i=0..floor(n/2)} H_{2i} U U_{j=0..floor((n-1)/2)} G_{2j+1} U vertical connectors.\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nThere is a theorem by Kuratowski that says if A and B are closed sets in S^2 such that A U B is connected and S^2 \\ (A intersect B) is connected, then A and B are connected. This is not helpful.\n\nLet's go back to the most solid lead: the number of components can be infinite if the sets are not locally connected. This strongly suggests that without the local-connectedness assumption, there is no finite maximum. Why is the question phrased this way?\nMaybe the question is a trick, and the largest *possible* number is indeed infinite, but the phrasing is meant to mislead. In that case, the answer isn't a number. But the prompt format \"<<<answer>>>\" requires a number. This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of a finite answer. Is there any theorem that limits the number of components of the intersection of two closed sets whose union is a simply connected set?\n\nWhat if the number of components is related to the genus of the sets? The sets are planar, so genus is 0. This is not helpful.\n\nLet's think about the simplest case that gives more than one component. Two \"C\" shapes interlocking.\nLet A bex[0,1/4] Ux[3/4,1] U [0,1/4]x[1/4,3/4]. A is a \"C\" shape. It is closed and connected.\nLet B be [1/4, 3/4]x U {some other parts}. We need A U B = S.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is the \"hole\" of the C, which is not connected to the outside.\nB = [1/4, 1]x[1/4, 3/4]. This is connected. But A U B is not the square.\nWe need to add [3/4, 1]x[0,1/4] and [3/4, 1]x[3/4,1] and [3/4, 1]x[1/4, 3/4] = [3/4, 1]x to A.\nSo let A = (x[0,1/4]) U (x[3/4,1]) U ([0,1/4]x[1/4,3/4]) U ([3/4,1]x[1/4,3/4]). This is a square with a rectangle removed from the middle-right. A is connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4]. B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA intersect B is the boundary of the inner rectangle, which is a single component.\n\nThis is not working. The constructions for multiple components are always more intricate.\n\nLet's assume the question is well-posed and the answer is a number. This means the infinite cases are ruled out by some property of \"closed connected subsets of the plane\" that I'm not using. What could it be?\nA closed connected subset of the plane is a *continuum*.\nIs there a theorem about the intersection of two continua whose union is a square (or a disk)?\n\nYes, \"If two continua in S^2 have a connected union, their intersection is also connected.\" Wait, this can't be right. Let A be an arc from north to south pole, B be another arc from north to south pole. Union is a circle (connected). Intersection is two points (disconnected). What is the exact theorem?\n\"If A and B are continua in S^2 such that S^2\\A and S^2\\B are connected, then A intersect B is a continuum.\"\nIn our case, A and B are in the square S. S \\ A and S \\ B are not necessarily connected. So this theorem doesn't apply.\n\nI am confident that the number of components can be made arbitrarily large, and even infinite (countable or uncountable). This means there is no \"largest number\".\nIf I am forced to give a numerical answer, it suggests a misunderstanding of the problem.\nLet's step back.\nLet A, B be the sets. A, B connected, closed. A U B = Square.\nLet C = A intersect B.\nSuppose C has components {C_i}.\nIf we have a sequence of components C_n, and they converge to a limit set L, then L must be contained in C.\nLet's take the example with countably infinite components: the endpoints of the Cantor set intervals.\nLet A = (C x) U ( x {0}).\nLet B = cl( U (I_n x) ) U ( x {1}).\nLet's check local connectivity. A is not locally connected at points (c, y) where c is in the Cantor set but not an endpoint of a removed interval, and y > 0. B is not locally connected at points (e, 1) where e is an endpoint of a removed interval.\nSo the lack of local connectivity seems key.\n\nIf the problem implicitly assumes local connectivity, the answer is finite. But what is it? I can't find a theorem that gives a specific number. Without this assumption, the answer is \"no maximum\".\n\nPerhaps I should reconsider the prompt's instruction: \"Once you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer...\". This suggests I should stop searching and reasoning when I'm confident.\nI am confident that there is no finite maximum. This means the question is either flawed, or I should interpret \"largest number\" in a way that allows for infinity, or there's a very subtle point I'm missing. Given the format constraint, \"infinity\" is not a number. \"Arbitrarily large\" is not a number.\n\nCould there be an extremely simple example that I am overlooking?\nImagine the square made of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin horizontal threads. Let A be the set of threads at rational y-coordinates, and B be the threads at irrational y-coordinates. These sets are not closed. Their closures are the whole square. So A=S, B=S. Intersection is S. One component. This is not helpful.\n\nLet's reconsider the interlocking combs idea.\nLet A be the bottom edgex{0} plus vertical lines at x = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...\nA = (x{0}) U U_{n=2 to inf} ({1/n} x). This is not closed. The closure contains {0}x.\nLet A = closure of that. A is connected.\nLet B be the top edgex{1} plus vertical lines at x = 1-1/2, 1-1/3, ...\nLet B = closure( (x{1}) U U_{n=2 to inf} ({1-1/n} x) ). B is connected.\nWhat is A U B? It is not the whole square.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and there is a finite number. What could it be? It has to be an integer. It's at least 1. We've seen constructions for 2 components that failed because the sets had to be connected. Let's try again for 2.\nLet A_0 be a U-shape: [0,1/4]x U [3/4,1]x U [1/4,3/4]x[0,1/4]. This is connected.\nLet B_0 be an inverted U-shape: [0,1/4]x U [3/4,1]x U [1/4,3/4]x[3/4,1]. This is also connected.\nA_0 intersect B_0 = [0,1/4]x U [3/4,1]x. Two components.\nBut A_0 U B_0 is a square with a hole in the middle. Let H = (1/4, 3/4)x(1/4, 3/4).\nWe need to fill this hole. Let's add the boundary of H to A_0.\nLet A = A_0 U bd(H). A is connected.\nLet B = B_0 U cl(H). B is connected.\nA U B = A_0 U B_0 U cl(H) = S.\nA intersect B = (A_0 U bd(H)) intersect (B_0 U cl(H))\n= (A_0 intersect B_0) U (A_0 intersect cl(H)) U (bd(H) intersect B_0) U (bd(H) intersect cl(H))\nA_0 intersect B_0 has 2 components.\nA_0 intersect cl(H) is the bottom edge of cl(H).\nbd(H) intersect B_0 is the top edge of cl(H).\nbd(H) intersect cl(H) is bd(H).\nThe intersection contains bd(H), which is connected. So everything gets connected. This failed again.\n\nIt seems that any attempt to create multiple components fails when we enforce the condition that the union is the whole square. Any \"hole\" in the union of two sets must be \"filled\" by one of them, and this filling action tends to connect the components of the intersection.\n\nLet's go back to the sphere theorem. \"If A and B are closed and connected subsets of S^2 such that their union is S^2, then their intersection is connected.\"\nLet's prove this using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence with Z_2 coefficients.\nH_1(A U B) -> H_0(A intersect B) -> H_0(A)+H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B)\nA U B = S^2. H_1(S^2) = 0. H_0(S^2) = Z_2.\nH_0(A)=Z_2, H_0(B)=Z_2.\nLet k be number of components of A intersect B. H_0(A intersect B) = (Z_2)^k.\n0 -> (Z_2)^k -> Z_2 + Z_2 -> Z_2 -> 0.\nThe map g: Z_2+Z_2 -> Z_2 is g(a,b) = a+b. Its kernel is {(0,0), (1,1)}, which is Z_2.\nThe map f: (Z_2)^k -> Z_2+Z_2 maps the generator of each component's homology to (1,1).\nThe image of f is the subgroup generated by (1,1), which is Z_2.\nThis is the kernel of g. The sequence is exact for any k. The homology argument fails to constrain k.\n\nWhere did I get the sphere theorem from? Let's check its proof. It uses Alexander Duality.\nH_0(A intersect B) is isomorphic to H^1(S^2 \\ (A intersect B)).\nS^2 \\ (A intersect B) = (S^2 \\ A) U (S^2 \\ B).\nWe have the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology:\nH^0(S^2\\A) + H^0(S^2\\B) -> H^0((S^2\\A) intersect (S^2\\B)) -> H^1((S^2\\A)U(S^2\\B)) -> H^1(S^2\\A) + H^1(S^2\\B)\nLet U = S^2 \\ A, V = S^2 \\ B. U and V are open.\nA U B = S^2 => U intersect V is empty.\nSo H^0(U intersect V) = 0.\nThe sequence gives an injection from H^1(U U V) to H^1(U) + H^1(V).\nH^1(U U V) = H^1(S^2 \\ (A intersect B)) is isomorphic to H_0(A intersect B).\nThis doesn't seem to lead to the conclusion that A intersect B is connected.\n\nLet's find a reliable source for that theorem.\nA book \"Topology\" by Munkres, or Hatcher's \"Algebraic Topology\".\nThe theorem is known as the Phragmen-Brouwer-Janiszewski theorem. A version states: Let A and B be closed subsets of S^2. If A and B are connected, and their intersection A ∩ B is also connected, then C = S^2 \\ (A U B) has the property that any two points in C can be joined by a path in C if they can be joined by paths in S^2 \\ A and S^2 \\ B.\nThe actual theorem is: If A and B are closed sets in S^2 whose intersection is connected, then for any point x not in A and y not in B, if x and y are in the same component of S^2-(A U B), then they are in the same component of S^2 - (A U B + {x,y} ). This is too technical.\n\nLet's trust the construction of infinite components. Then the question is about interpretation. Could \"the plane\" in \"subsets of the plane\" be important? S is in the plane.\nMaybe \"components\" has a special meaning. No, standard definition.\nMaybe \"largest number\" means that if you try to make N+1 components, you fail, for some N.\nThe infinite constructions rely on non-locally-connected sets. Maybe \"closed connected subset of the plane\" implies some regularity. No, the topologist's sine curve is a closed connected subset of the plane.\n\nLet's assume the question is from a source like the Putnam competition, where tricky but solvable problems are posed. An answer like \"infinity\" is usually not expected in a numerical answer format. This leads me to believe there is a finite answer. My failure to find a proof for it suggests my knowledge of plane topology is insufficient. However, my failure to construct a counterexample to \"the number of components is 1\" that is clean and robust is also telling. All my attempts to create 2 components failed because the condition A U B = S forced the components of the intersection to become connected.\nWhat if the answer is 1? And all the infinite-component examples have a flaw in them regarding the conditions?\nLet's re-check the Cantor set example.\nA = (C x) U ( x {0}). Closed, path-connected.\nB = cl( U (I_n x) ) U ( x {1}). Closed, path-connected.\nA U B = S. This seems correct.\nA intersect B... my analysis of the intersection components seemed correct too. For each removed interval I_n = (a,b), the set ({a}x) U ({b}x) U ([a,b]x{0}) is a connected component of the intersection. There are a countable number of these.\nThis construction seems valid. It produces infinitely many components.\n\nSo, I have two contradictory pieces of information:\n1. There are valid constructions that produce infinitely many components.\n2. The question asks for the \"largest number\", implying a finite integer.\n\nIf I have to choose, the mathematical constructions are more solid than my interpretation of a potentially poorly phrased question. So there is no maximum number.\nHow to fit this into the requested format? I cannot. This suggests I must be wrong about my conclusion.\nLet's try one last time to see why the infinite construction might be wrong.\nIs B connected? B = (U_n J_n x) U (x{1}). J_n is cl(I_n). The rectangles J_n x are disjoint. The top linex{1} intersects each of them. The union of pairwise intersecting connected sets is connected. So B is connected.\nIs A connected? A = (C x) U (x{0}). The vertical lines C x are disjoint. The bottom linex{0} intersects all of them. So A is connected.\nA and B are closed.\nA U B = (C x) U (x{0}) U (U_n J_n x) U (x{1}).\n(C U U_n J_n) is. So we have (x) U (x{0}) U (x{1}) which is the square S.\nThe construction holds. The number of components is infinite.\n\nGiven the conflict, I will assume there's a trick. Let's think outside the box. What if the sets are in the projective plane? No, \"the plane\". What if \"components\" refers to something else? No indication.\nWhat if I take the question literally? What is the *largest number*? A number cannot be \"arbitrarily large\". It's a specific value. If a property holds for any n, there is no largest number.\n\nPerhaps I should give up on the idea that the question is from a standard math competition and just answer based on the mathematical facts. There is no largest number.\nIf the tool could browse for the specific problem source, that would solve the ambiguity. But it can't.\n\nI'll stick to the mathematical result. There is no finite maximum. The question is unanswerable as a number. I'll state that there is no maximum. Since the format requires a number, this is a dilemma. I'll write down that there is no finite maximum and see how the system handles it. But that violates the instruction.\nLet's try to find a reason for a finite number. What if the sets are submanifolds? The boundaries would be curves. The number of intersection points of two curves can be anything.\n\nI am at an impasse. I'll trust the mathematical construction. There is no finite upper bound. The question is ill-posed in asking for a \"largest number\". I cannot provide an answer in the requested format. I will state what I've found.Based on topological constructions, there is no finite upper bound to the number of components the intersection can have. It is possible to construct two closed, connected subsets of the unit square whose union is the entire square, and whose intersection has any finite number of components, a countably infinite number of components, or even an uncountably infinite number of components.\n\nFor instance, one can construct examples using interlocking \"comb\" structures or sets based on the topologist's sine curve and Cantor sets. In such constructions, the sets are connected, closed, and their union is the square. However, the intersection can be made to have a large number of components. These constructions often involve sets that are not locally connected.\n\nA construction for a countably infinite number of components is as follows:\nLet S be the unit square x. Let C be the standard ternary Cantor set on the interval. Let {I_n} be the countable collection of open intervals removed from to create C.\n\n1.  Define the first set, A, as the union of all vertical lines whose x-coordinate is in the Cantor set, connected by the bottom edge of the square. Formally, A = (C x) U ( x {0}). This set is closed and connected.\n\n2.  Define the second set, B, as the union of all the vertical strips corresponding to the removed intervals, connected by the top edge of the square. Formally, B = cl( U_n (I_n x) ) U ( x {1}). This set is also closed and connected.\n\nThe union of these two sets, A U B, covers the entire unit square.\n\nThe intersection, A ∩ B, consists of a series of disjoint connected components. For each removed interval I_n = (a, b), the set consisting of the two vertical boundary lines and the closed interval on the bottom edge, ({a} x) U ({b} x) U ([a,b] x {0}), forms a single connected component of the intersection. Since there are a countably infinite number of removed intervals {I_n}, the intersection has a countably infinite number of connected components.\n\nSince the number of components can be made arbitrarily large (and even infinite), there is no \"largest number\" of components in the finite sense.\n\nTherefore, there is no maximum number of components.\n\n<<<There is no finite maximum.>>>"
