    "Assuming the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge and limiting the available epistemic states to only Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise that are distinct from Gettier-style issues.\n\n### 1. The Infinite Regress of Justification\n\nThe JTB theory posits that for a belief to be considered knowledge, it must be justified. However, the theory itself does not specify what form this justification must take. This leads to a classic philosophical issue known as the regress problem. If a belief (B1) is justified by another belief (B2), then B2 must also be justified. This, in turn, requires another justifying belief (B3), and so on, creating an endless chain of justifications.\n\nThis problem is particularly acute within the constraint of only two epistemic statesâ€”Knowledge and Belief. If a belief can only be justified by another belief, we are led into an infinite regress, meaning no belief can ever be ultimately justified. The alternative would be for the justification to rest on something that is not a mere belief. Within the given constraints, the only other available state is \"Knowledge.\" However, if the justification for a belief to become knowledge rests upon pre-existing knowledge, the definition becomes circular. We would be defining knowledge in terms of itself, which is a logically fallacious way to construct a definition.\n\n### 2. The Problem of Epistemic Gradation\n\nThe second problem arises from the binary and rigid nature of the stipulated epistemic states: one either possesses \"Knowledge\" or a \"Belief.\" This framework fails to account for the nuanced reality of our cognitive lives, where we hold beliefs with varying degrees of confidence and certainty. For example, one's belief that \"it might rain tomorrow\" is held with a different level of conviction than the belief that \"2+2=4.\"\n\nThe JTB model, especially in this simplified two-state system, treats all beliefs that fall short of knowledge as epistemically equal. It lacks the vocabulary to describe degrees of justification or belief. This is problematic because much of our reasoning and decision-making is based on beliefs that we consider more or less likely to be true, even if they don't meet the high bar for \"Knowledge.\" By forcing all epistemic states into the rigid categories of either complete knowledge or mere belief, the model presents an oversimplified and inadequate picture of human epistemology.\n\n<<<The two problems the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, under the given constraints, are the infinite regress of justification and the problem of epistemic gradation. The former arises because a belief requires justification, which in turn requires justification, leading to an endless chain or circular reasoning. The latter is a result of the model's inability to account for varying degrees of belief and certainty, forcing a simplistic binary distinction between knowledge and belief.>>>"
