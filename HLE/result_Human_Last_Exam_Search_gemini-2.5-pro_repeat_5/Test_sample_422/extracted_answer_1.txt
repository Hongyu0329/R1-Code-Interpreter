The two problems the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, under the given constraints, are the infinite regress of justification and the problem of epistemic gradation. The former arises because a belief requires justification, which in turn requires justification, leading to an endless chain or circular reasoning. The latter is a result of the model's inability to account for varying degrees of belief and certainty, forcing a simplistic binary distinction between knowledge and belief.
