    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nSet $x'(t) = 0$ to find the equilibria:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. We can analyze the stability by checking the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at each equilibrium point. The derivative is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\n1.  **Stability of x = 0:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\n2.  **Stability of x = 1:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$. This means that for $x < 1$, $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving away from $x=1$.\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$. This means that for $x > 1$, $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium at $x=1$ is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nThis means the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
