An upper bound for the maximum norm (interpreted as the fundamental unit \(\varepsilon_0\)) in relation to the covolume (interpreted as \(V = \sqrt{D}\), where \(D\) is the discriminant) for a real quadratic field defined by a squarefree natural number \(N\) is given by \(\varepsilon_0 \le \exp\left(\frac{\sqrt{D}}{4} \log(D) + \frac{\sqrt{D}}{2}\right)\). A simplified, but less precise, form is \(\varepsilon_0 \le \exp\left(\frac{V}{2} (\log(V) + 1)\right)\).
