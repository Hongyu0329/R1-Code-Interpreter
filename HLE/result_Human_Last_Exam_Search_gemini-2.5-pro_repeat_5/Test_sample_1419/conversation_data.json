    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, also known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is directly proportional to ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nThe beta function for the coupling constant *u* at one-loop order is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + bu²\nwhere *b* is a positive constant that depends on the specific conventions used for the coupling constant and the momentum cutoff.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0, yields the non-trivial fixed point u*:\n-ϵu* + b(u*)² = 0\nu*(b*u* - ϵ) = 0\n\nThis gives two fixed points: the Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at:\nu* = ϵ / b\n\nFor a single-component (N=1) scalar field, the dimensionless coupling constant u* is often expressed as:\nu* = (8π²/3)ϵ\n\nMore generally, for an O(N)-symmetric model, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\nu* = (8π²ϵ) / (N+8)\n\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of ϵ is linear in ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (8π²/3)ϵ>>>"
