    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to analyze the range of IP addresses each network covers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given networks:**\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n        *   The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n        *   The `/19` subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Combine the address ranges:**\n    The two networks represent a contiguous block of IP addresses. The first range ends at `172.20.127.255`, and the second begins at `172.20.128.0`. Therefore, the total address range to be matched is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the supernet:**\n    The goal is to find a single network and wildcard mask that covers this combined range. This process is called supernetting or route summarization.\n    *   **Total Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Let's convert the starting and ending addresses' third octets to binary to find the common bits:\n        *   `96` = `01100000`\n        *   `159` = `10011111`\n    *   Because the very first bits differ, a simple summarization into a single larger, standard CIDR block isn't possible without including a large number of unwanted addresses. Specifically, the smallest standard CIDR block that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`, which is too broad.\n\n4.  **Determine the ACL Entry:**\n    However, the question asks for the smallest *ACL entry* in `network address wildcard` format. In access control lists, the wildcard mask is used to specify which bits of an address to check. A `0` in a wildcard mask bit means the corresponding bit in the address must match, while a `1` means the bit does not have to match.\n\n    We can summarize the contiguous range `172.20.96.0 - 172.20.159.255` into a single ACL entry. Let's analyze the third octet again:\n    *   The range of the third octet is from 96 to 159.\n    *   In binary, this is from `01100000` to `10011111`.\n    *   Let's find the bits that change within this range. The first two bits `01...` and `10...` both change. The bits that are constant are not immediately obvious.\n\n    Let's re-examine the combined block. The total number of addresses is 2 * (2^(32-19)) = 65,536, which is a /18 network (2^14 = 16,384 addresses). Let me re-calculate the number of addresses. A /19 has 2^(32-19) = 2^13 = 8,192 addresses. Two such networks have 2 * 8,192 = 16,384 addresses. This corresponds to a /18 subnet (32-18=14, so 2^14 = 16,384 addresses).\n\n    A `/18` network covers a range of 64 in the third octet. Our range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. The number of addresses in the third octet is `159 - 96 + 1 = 64`. This confirms it is the size of a /18 block.\n\n    The ACL entry can therefore be represented as the starting address of the range and a wildcard mask corresponding to a /18 subnet.\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0` (the first address in the range).\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** A `/18` mask is `255.255.192.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. To get the inverse, you subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.192.0` = `0.0.63.255`.\n\n    So, the single ACL entry that covers the entire range is `172.20.96.0` with the wildcard mask `0.0.63.255`. This entry will match any IP address from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
