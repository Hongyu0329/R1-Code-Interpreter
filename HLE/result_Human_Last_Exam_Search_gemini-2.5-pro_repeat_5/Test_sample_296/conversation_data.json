    "**The Grigorchuk group possesses exactly seven subgroups of index 4.**\n\nThis conclusion is derived from the group's abelianization, which is the quotient group G/G', where G' represents the commutator subgroup. For the Grigorchuk group, its abelianization is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, denoted as C₂ x C₂ x C₂.\n\nA fundamental theorem in group theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of a group G containing its commutator subgroup G' and the subgroups of its abelianization G/G'. This correspondence preserves the index of the subgroups. Therefore, the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is equivalent to the number of subgroups of index 4 in C₂ x C₂ x C₂.\n\nThe group C₂ x C₂ x C₂ has an order of 2³ = 8. A subgroup of index 4 in a group of order 8 will have an order of 8 / 4 = 2. Subgroups of order 2 are cyclic and are each generated by a unique element of order 2.\n\nIn C₂ x C₂ x C₂, every element other than the identity has an order of 2. The elements of this group can be represented as triplets (a, b, c), where a, b, and c can be either 0 or 1. The identity element is (0, 0, 0). The non-identity elements are:\n(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1).\n\nThere are a total of 7 such non-identity elements. Each of these 7 elements generates a distinct subgroup of order 2. For instance, the element (1, 0, 0) generates the subgroup {(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0)}. Since each of these subgroups consists of the identity and one other unique element, they are all distinct.\n\nConsequently, there are 7 subgroups of order 2 in C₂ x C₂ x C₂. This directly implies that the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<7>>>"
