A single-site catalyst composed of a Constrained-Geometry Zirconium or Hafnium complex supported on sulfated alumina is the optimal combination. The catalyst's function can be switched between olefin polymerization (in the absence of H₂, lower temperatures) and polyolefin degradation (in the presence of H₂, higher temperatures) by controlling the reaction conditions.
