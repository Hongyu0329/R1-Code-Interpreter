The proposed research approach is not ecologically valid. The primary reason is the fundamental difference between the visual systems of humans and the principal predators of bumblebees, which are birds. Birds are tetrachromatic and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, a spectrum invisible to the trichromatic vision of humans. Since bumblebees and the flowers they forage on possess UV patterns, human observers are blind to a crucial component of the warning signal. This sensory mismatch means that human-based similarity rankings cannot be a reliable proxy for the way avian predators perceive and generalize these signals. Therefore, the resulting clusters would not accurately reflect the functional mimicry syndromes as they operate in their natural, ecological context.
