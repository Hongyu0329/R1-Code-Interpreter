    "The VC dimension of a class of sets (or concepts) is the maximum size of a set of points that can be shattered by the class. In the context of logic, a formula with free variables defines a set of assignments for those variables. The VC dimension of a logic is the maximum VC dimension of any of its formulas over any possible structure.\n\nLet the schema be $S = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, where each $P_i$ is a unary predicate. The logical language is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. This means the formulas are constructed from atomic formulas $P_i(x)$, logical constants $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false), using only conjunction ($\\land$) and existential quantification ($\\exists$).\n\n**1. Characterizing the Definable Sets**\n\nLet's consider a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this logic. A set of elements $\\{a | \\phi(a) \\text{ is true}\\}$ in a given structure is a \"concept\". The class of all such sets definable by the logic is the \"concept class\".\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are unary, each atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$ where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$.\n\nWe can group the conjuncts in $\\psi$ by the variable they contain:\n$\\psi(x, \\bar{y}) = \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{y_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_{y_m}(y_m)$\nwhere each $\\psi_v(v)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the variable $v$. For example, $\\psi_x(x) = P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n\nThe formula $\\phi(x)$ is logically equivalent to:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\psi_{y_1}(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_m \\psi_{y_m}(y_m))$\n\nIn any given structure, each subformula $\\exists y_k \\psi_{y_k}(y_k)$ is a sentence (it has no free variables). Therefore, it is either true or false.\n*   If any of these sentences is false in the structure, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false), which defines the empty set.\n*   If all these sentences are true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n\nThus, any set definable by a formula in this logic is either the empty set, or a set definable by a quantifier-free formula of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The formula $\\top$ defines the entire universe.\n\nThe collection of definable sets (the concept class, $\\mathcal{C}$) is therefore a subset of:\n$\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\{ \\{x \\mid \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\} \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$\nSince the empty conjunction is $\\top$, the universe is included.\nThere are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets of predicates, so there are at most 16 non-trivial definable sets, plus the empty set.\n\n**2. Upper Bound on the VC Dimension**\n\nA set $Y$ of size $d$ is shattered by a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ if every one of its $2^d$ subsets can be obtained by intersecting $Y$ with a set from $\\mathcal{C}$. This requires that there are at least $2^d$ distinct concepts in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe number of formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ is $2^4 = 16$. Including $\\bot$, we have at most 17 distinct definable sets. To shatter a set of size $d$, we need to be able to generate $2^d$ subsets. Therefore, we must have $2^d \\le 17$, which implies that $d \\le 4$.\n\nSo, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is at most 4.\n\n**3. Lower Bound on the VC Dimension**\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must construct a structure and a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.\n\nLet $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$ be a set of four distinct elements in our universe.\nLet the four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ be defined on the elements of $Y$ as follows:\n$P_i(y_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$, for $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nWe need to show that any subset of $Y$ can be generated by a formula of the form $\\phi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nLet an arbitrary subset of $Y$ be $Y' \\subseteq Y$. Let $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be the index set such that $Y' = \\{y_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$. We need to find a set of predicates $I$ such that the formula $\\phi_I(x)$ is true for all $x \\in Y'$ and false for all $x \\in Y \\setminus Y'$.\n\nLet's choose the index set for our formula to be $I = J^c = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$. The formula is $\\phi_{J^c}(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in J^c} P_i(x)$.\n\nLet's test whether an element $y_k$ satisfies this formula:\n$\\phi_{J^c}(y_k)$ is true $\\iff \\forall i \\in J^c, P_i(y_k)$ is true.\nBy our definition of the predicates, $P_i(y_k)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq k$.\nSo, $\\phi_{J^c}(y_k)$ is true $\\iff \\forall i \\in J^c, i \\neq k$.\n\n*   If $k \\in J$: Then for any $i \\in J^c$, we have $i \\neq k$ (since $J$ and $J^c$ are disjoint). Thus, the condition $\\forall i \\in J^c, i \\neq k$ is satisfied, and $\\phi_{J^c}(y_k)$ is true.\n*   If $k \\notin J$ (i.e., $k \\in J^c$): The condition $\\forall i \\in J^c, i \\neq k$ is not satisfied, because we can choose $i=k$, which is in $J^c$, and $k=k$. Thus, $\\phi_{J^c}(y_k)$ is false.\n\nThis shows that the formula $\\phi_{J^c}(x)$ defines exactly the set $Y' = \\{y_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$. Since this works for any subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$, the set $Y$ is shattered.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that a set of size 4 can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
