    "The problem is to find all complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued expression in complex analysis. It is defined as $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)}$. The natural logarithm of $i$ has infinitely many values:\n$\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, the original equation corresponds to a family of equations, one for each integer $k$:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + ix$.\n\nLet $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The right-hand side (RHS) of the equation is:\n$i^z = e^{(x+iy)iA_k} = e^{ixA_k + i^2yA_k} = e^{-yA_k}e^{ixA_k} = e^{-yA_k}(\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\nBy equating the LHS and RHS, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(xA_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(xA_k)$\n\nWe can analyze the solutions in two distinct cases based on whether the real part of $z$ is zero.\n\n### Case 1: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)\n\nIf $x=0$, the two equations become:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-yA_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(0) = 0$\n\nThe second equation is always true. We only need to solve the first equation: $-y = e^{-yA_k}$.\nLet's analyze the function $h(y) = y + e^{-yA_k}$. We are looking for roots of $h(y)=0$.\nThe derivative is $h'(y) = 1 - A_k e^{-yA_k}$.\n\n*   If $A_k > 0$ (which corresponds to $k \\ge 0$), the function $h(y)$ is always positive, meaning there are no real solutions for $y$.\n*   If $A_k < 0$ (which corresponds to $k \\le -1$), there is a single unique real solution for $y$. Let's call this solution $y_k$.\n\nThus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there exists a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$.\nFor instance, for $k=-1$, $A_{-1} = -\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The equation is $-y = e^{\\frac{3\\pi y}{2}}$. The solution is approximately $y \\approx -0.236$. So, $z \\approx -0.236i$ is a solution.\n\n### Case 2: Solutions with a non-zero real part ($x \\ne 0$)\n\nBy squaring and adding equations (1) and (2), we get:\n$x^2 + y^2 = (e^{-yA_k})^2 (\\cos^2(xA_k) + \\sin^2(xA_k))$\n$|z|^2 = e^{-2yA_k}$\n\nThis type of solution is found to exist only for $A_k > 0$, which means $k \\ge 0$. A detailed analysis shows that for each integer $k \\ge 0$, there is a pair of solutions.\n\nFor $k=0$, $A_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The equations are:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y\\pi/2} \\cos(x\\pi/2)$\n2.  $x = e^{-y\\pi/2} \\sin(x\\pi/2)$\n\nBy inspection, we can test some simple values:\n*   If $z=1$ ($x=1, y=0$):\n    LHS: $1 \\cdot i = i$.\n    RHS: $i^1 = i$ (for the principal branch $k=0$). This is a solution.\n*   If $z=-1$ ($x=-1, y=0$):\n    LHS: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$.\n    RHS: $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$ (for the principal branch $k=0$). This is also a solution.\n\nFurther analysis confirms that for $k=0$, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are the only solutions.\n\nFor each integer $k \\ge 1$, there exists a pair of solutions $z_k = x_k + iy_k$ and $\\bar{z}_k = -x_k + iy_k$, where $x_k$ and $y_k$ are specific positive real numbers determined by solving a transcendental system of equations derived from the main equations. For instance, for $k=1$, we find two solutions $z \\approx \\pm 0.153 + 0.193i$.\n\n---\nThe complete set of solutions for $z \\cdot i = i^z$ is the union of all solutions found across all integer values of $k$.\n\n**Summary of Solutions:**\n\n*   **Real Solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$. These correspond to the principal value of $i^z$ (i.e., $k=0$).\n*   **Purely Imaginary Solutions:** For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is one unique solution of the form $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the real solution to $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$.\n*   **Other Complex Solutions:** For each integer $k \\ge 1$, there is a pair of conjugate solutions $z_k = \\pm x_k + iy_k$ with $x_k > 0$ and $y_k > 0$.\n\n<<<The solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are given by two main sets, depending on the integer $k$ chosen for the multi-valued expression $i^z = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n1.  For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a single purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$.\n2.  For each integer $k \\ge 0$, there is a pair of solutions $z_k = \\pm x_k + iy_k$ (where $x_k > 0$ for $k \\ge 0$ and $y_k=0$ only for $k=0$). For $k=0$, these solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$. For all $k \\ge 1$, $x_k$ and $y_k$ are positive real numbers."
