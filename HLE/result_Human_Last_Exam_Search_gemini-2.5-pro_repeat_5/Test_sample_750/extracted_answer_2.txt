The solutions to the equation $z \cdot i = i^z$ are given by two main sets, depending on the integer $k$ chosen for the multi-valued expression $i^z = e^{z \cdot i(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi)}$.
1.  For each integer $k \le -1$, there is a single purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $-y = \exp(-y(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi))$.
2.  For each integer $k \ge 0$, there is a pair of solutions $z_k = \pm x_k + iy_k$ (where $x_k > 0$ for $k \ge 0$ and $y_k=0$ only for $k=0$). For $k=0$, these solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$. For all $k \ge 1$, $x_k$ and $y_k$ are positive real numbers.
