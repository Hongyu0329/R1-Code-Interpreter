    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$, which represents the fixed points of the composite function $h(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the properties of the functions $f$, $g$, and $h$.\n-   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, and its derivative $f'(x)$ is always positive. This implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. For a cubic polynomial $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$, the condition $f'(x)>0$ for all $x$ requires the leading coefficient $a$ to be positive.\n-   Similarly, $g(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial with $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, which means it is also a strictly increasing function with a positive leading coefficient.\n-   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n-   The derivative of the composite function is $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. Since both $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive, $h'(x)$ is also always positive. This means $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of real roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x = 0$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Thus, the number of fixed points cannot exceed 9.\n\nTo determine if 9 fixed points are possible, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots. In our case, $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. If we can show that $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ can have at most 8 real roots, then $P(x)=0$ can have at most 9 real roots.\n\nLet's analyze the number of roots of $h'(x) = 1$. This is equivalent to finding the number of extrema of the function $P(x) = h(x) - x$. The number of extrema of $P(x)$ is the number of roots of $P'(x) = h'(x)-1$. The number of roots of $h'(x) = 1$ is related to the number of inflection points of $h'(x)$, which are the roots of $h''(x)$.\n\nLet's find the degree of $h''(x)$:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$\n$h''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be general cubic polynomials:\n-   $g(x)$ is of degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is of degree 2, and $g''(x)$ is of degree 1.\n-   $f(x)$ is of degree 3, so $f'(x)$ is of degree 2, and $f''(x)$ is of degree 1.\n\nNow let's determine the degree of each term in the expression for $h''(x)$:\n-   The first term is $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$. The degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $1 \\times 3 = 3$. The degree of $(g'(x))^2$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. So, the degree of the first term is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n-   The second term is $f'(g(x))g''(x)$. The degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. The degree of $g''(x)$ is $1$. So, the degree of the second term is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nSince both terms have the same degree, the degree of $h''(x)$ is at most 7 (it could be lower if the leading terms cancel, but with general choices of coefficients, they do not). A polynomial of degree 7 can have at most 7 real roots.\n\nThis implies:\n-   $h''(x) = 0$ has at most 7 real roots.\n-   $h'(x)$ has at most 7 local extrema.\n-   A polynomial with 7 local extrema can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at most 8 times. So, $h'(x) = 1$ has at most 8 real roots.\n-   By Rolle's Theorem, if $h'(x)-1=0$ has at most 8 real roots, then $h(x)-x=0$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\nThis confirms that the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9. It is possible to construct such polynomials $f$ and $g$ that achieve this maximum, although the explicit construction is complex. The construction involves choosing the parameters of $f$ and $g$ such that the polynomial $h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, leading to 8 local extrema for $h'(x)$, which can then be made to oscillate around the value 1 to create 8 roots for $h'(x)=1$. With the appropriate vertical shifts, this can result in 9 distinct real roots for $h(x)-x=0$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
