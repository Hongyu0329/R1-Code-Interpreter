No, it is not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in the given 3D Hamiltonian with only Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. While the DMI prevents the soliton from collapsing, the ground state of this system would be a helical or spiral phase, not a localized soliton. Additional terms, most commonly an external magnetic field, are required for stabilization.
