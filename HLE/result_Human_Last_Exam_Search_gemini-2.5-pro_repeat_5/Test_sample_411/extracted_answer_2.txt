(a) The diversity orders are:
*   **For $\mathbf{S}_a$**: The diversity order is 1.
*   **For $\mathbf{S}_b$**: The diversity order is 1.
*   **For $\mathbf{S}_c$**: The diversity order is 2.

(b) Assuming "directivity" is a typo for "diversity", the code that provides the maximum diversity is **$\mathbf{S}_c$**, as it achieves the full diversity order of 2.
