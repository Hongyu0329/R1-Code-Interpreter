    "While there are several mushroom genera that contain species with a distinct blue coloration, there are no known mushroom-forming fungi that produce a blue spore print. The premise of a single genus with this characteristic is a common misconception. The color of a mushroom's cap or flesh does not determine the color of its spores.\n\nSeveral well-known blue mushrooms have spore prints of entirely different colors:\n\n*   **Entoloma hochstetteri**, famous for its vibrant all-blue appearance and its feature on New Zealand's fifty-dollar note, actually has a reddish-pink spore print. Some sources may also describe it as purplish or deep red-brown.\n\n*   **Lactarius indigo**, another striking blue mushroom, produces a cream or pale yellowish spore print.\n\n*   **Stropharia caerulea**, commonly known as the Blue Roundhead, has a dark purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n\n*   Mushrooms that stain blue, such as *Panaeolus cyanescens*, do not have blue spores; this particular species has a black spore print. Similarly, some species within the genus *Psilocybe* are known for their blue-bruising reaction, but they typically have a lilac-brown to dark purple-brown spore print.\n\nMushroom spore prints are a crucial characteristic for identification and most commonly come in shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple, and black. While green spore prints are rare, belonging to mushrooms like the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, a blue spore print has not been documented in the fungal kingdom.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
