    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is determined by the structure of the Weyl group of $G$.\n\nA key result in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields states that the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of so-called $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure acts on the Weyl group.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of split type. In the case of a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\n\nWhen the Frobenius action is trivial, the $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes. Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed, for instance by R. Carter in 1972. The result of this computation is that the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
