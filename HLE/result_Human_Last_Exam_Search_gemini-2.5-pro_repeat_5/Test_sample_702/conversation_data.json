    "The question asks for the connectivity of the map `f: Σ ( ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6 ) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`. This is a question in algebraic topology, concerning the relationship between loop spaces, suspensions, and smash products.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n*   **Connectivity:** A map `g: X → Y` is `k`-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to its homotopy fiber being `(k-1)`-connected.\n*   **n-Sphere (Sⁿ):** The generalized sphere in `n+1` dimensions. An n-sphere is `(n-1)`-connected.\n*   **Loop Space (ΩX):** The space of all continuous maps from the circle `S¹` to a space `X`, based at a point.\n*   **Reduced Suspension (ΣX):** The space formed by taking the product of `X` with an interval and collapsing the \"top\" and \"bottom\" copies of `X` as well as a line segment `{x₀} × I` to a single point.\n*   **Smash Product (X ∧ Y):** The quotient of the product space `X × Y` by the wedge sum `X ∨ Y`.\n\n### The Map and Relevant Theorem:\n\nThe map in question is a specific instance of a more general map, often called the generalized James-Hopf map or Samelson product map, given by:\n`S(A, B): Σ(ΩA ∧ ΩB) → Ω(A ∧ B)`\n\nA key result by Brayton Gray provides the connectivity of this map. In his work on generalized Whitehead products, Gray established the following theorem:\n\n**Theorem (Gray):** If `A` is `m`-connected and `B` is `n`-connected, then the map `S(A, B)` is `(m+n+1)`-connected.\n\n### Applying the Theorem:\n\nWe can apply this theorem to the specific spaces in the question:\n\n1.  **Space A = S⁴:** The 4-sphere `S⁴` is `(4-1) = 3`-connected. Therefore, `m = 3`.\n2.  **Space B = S⁶:** The 6-sphere `S⁶` is `(6-1) = 5`-connected. Therefore, `n = 5`.\n\nUsing Gray's theorem, the connectivity of the map is calculated as:\n`m + n + 1 = 3 + 5 + 1 = 9`\n\nThus, the map `f: Σ ( ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6 ) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is 9-connected. This means that the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to degree 8 and a surjection in degree 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
