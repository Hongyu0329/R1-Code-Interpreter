    "Let K be a convex domain in the plane. The problem asks for the minimum area of K such that it intersects every line given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nFirst, let's establish what it means for the convex set K to intersect these lines. For K to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, the set of values of the linear function `f(x, y) = px + qy` for `(x, y)` in K must contain 1. This means that the minimum value of `f(x,y)` on K must be less than or equal to 1, and the maximum value must be greater than or equal to 1.\n\nA crucial observation comes from considering a specific subset of the given lines:\n*   For `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n\nSince K must intersect all these lines, we can deduce properties about its size.\n*   The fact that K intersects `x = 1` implies that there is at least one point in K with an x-coordinate of 1. Therefore, the maximum x-coordinate in K must be at least 1 (`x_max ≥ 1`).\n*   Similarly, intersecting `x = -1` implies that the minimum x-coordinate in K must be at most -1 (`x_min ≤ -1`).\n*   The width of K in the x-direction, which is `w_x = x_max - x_min`, must therefore be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   Following the same logic for the lines `y = 1` and `y = -1`, the width of K in the y-direction, `w_y`, must also be at least 2.\n\nFor any convex set in the plane, there is a relationship between its area (A) and its widths in two orthogonal directions (`w_x` and `w_y`). A known theorem in convex geometry states that `A ≥ (w_x * w_y) / 2`.\n\nApplying this theorem with the derived minimum widths:\n`A ≥ (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`.\nThis establishes that the area of any such convex domain must be at least 2.\n\nNow, we need to determine if an area of 2 is achievable. Let's consider the convex domain `D` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This shape is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (0, -1).\n\nThe area of this diamond-shaped region `D` is `(2 * 2) / 2 = 2`.\n\nNext, we must verify if this domain `D` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. The set of values of `f(x, y) = px + qy` for `(x, y)` in `D` is the interval `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]`. For `D` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, the value 1 must be within this interval. This requires `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n\nSince `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. If `p` is non-zero, then `|p| ≥ 1`. If `q` is non-zero, then `|q| ≥ 1`. Therefore, `max(|p|, |q|)` is always greater than or equal to 1. This confirms that the domain `D` intersects all the specified lines.\n\nSince we have established a lower bound of 2 for the area and found a convex domain with an area of 2 that satisfies all the conditions, we can conclude that the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
