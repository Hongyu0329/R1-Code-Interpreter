    "When an icosahedron tank is placed on one of its triangular faces, it rests with a horizontal base and a parallel top face. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the plane that divides the tank into two equal volumes is a horizontal plane located exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces. This plane passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\nThe shape of the water surface when the tank is half-filled will be the shape of this central cross-section. The cross-section of an icosahedron, when sliced by a plane parallel to a facial plane and passing through its center, is a regular hexagon. This occurs because the slicing plane intersects six of the icosahedron's edges that are positioned around its \"equator\" relative to the top and bottom faces.\n\nTherefore, the surface of the water will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
