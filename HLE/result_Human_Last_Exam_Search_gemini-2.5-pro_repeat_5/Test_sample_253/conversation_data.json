    "Following the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule 20 times results in the binary pattern **111111101110111011101**.\n\nRule 110 is an elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is defined by the binary sequence 01101110, which is the decimal number 110. This sequence specifies the output for each of the eight possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe evolution from a single '1' after 20 iterations is a complex and specific pattern. While the initial generations might seem simple, the pattern's complexity grows over time, exhibiting a behavior that is on the edge between stability and chaos. After 15 steps, the pattern generated from a single black cell is a known sequence. Continuing this process for 20 steps yields the final resulting pattern. The rule's ability to generate such complex structures from a simple starting condition is a key reason it has been proven to be capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<111111101110111011101>>>"
