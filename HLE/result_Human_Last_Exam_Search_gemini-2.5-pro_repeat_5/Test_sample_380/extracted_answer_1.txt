The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial. To properly calculate the normalized magnetic helicity of AIC waves, which propagate along the local magnetic field, it is necessary to use the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field. This is because the polarization of the wave is defined relative to this local field direction. Using components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation that is generally not accurate at the L1 point.
