    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we first need to understand how fractional values are constructed in this game.\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, the values of finite games are dyadic rational numbers, which are fractions with a denominator that is a power of two. The representation of such a number is directly related to its binary expansion.\n\nA number between 0 and 1 is represented by a \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces. The value of such a stalk is determined by the sequence of its colored edges starting from the ground. The rule is as follows: if the binary representation of the number is $0.b_1b_2b_3...$, then the $i$-th edge from the ground is blue if $b_i = 1$ and red if $b_i = 0$. The value of a blue edge at position $i$ contributes $\\frac{1}{2^i}$ to the total value, while a red edge at that position contributes 0.\n\nLet's apply this to the number $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n\n1.  **Convert the fraction to binary:**\n    $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary is $0.1101_2$. This can be seen by converting the numerator, 13, to binary, which is $1101$, and then placing it after the binary point corresponding to the denominator $16 = 2^4$.\n    This binary expansion represents the sum:\n    $1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + 0 + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Hackenbush stalk:**\n    The binary representation $0.1101_2$ dictates the color of each piece in the stalk, starting from the piece connected to the ground.\n    *   The first digit after the binary point is **1**, so the first piece is **Blue**.\n    *   The second digit is **1**, so the second piece is **Blue**.\n    *   The third digit is **0**, so the third piece is **Red**.\n    *   The fourth digit is **1**, so the fourth piece is **Blue**.\n\n3.  **Count the number of pieces:**\n    The resulting stalk, from the ground up, is Blue-Blue-Red-Blue.\n    *   Number of blue pieces: 3\n    *   Number of red pieces: 1\n    The total number of pieces required is the sum of the red and blue pieces.\n\nTotal pieces = 3 (blue) + 1 (red) = 4.\n\nTherefore, 4 pieces are needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n<<<4>>>"
