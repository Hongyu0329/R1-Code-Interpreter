    "The problem asks for the largest value of $p$ for which the integral $I(a_1, ..., a_9)$ is not in the space $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This is a question about the threshold for the $L^p$ integrability of a function defined by an oscillatory integral. The threshold is determined by the decay rate of the integral as its parameters tend to infinity.\n\nLet the integral be denoted by $I(a)$, where $a = (a_1, ..., a_9)$. The function $I(a)$ is an oscillatory integral whose phase is a polynomial in the integration variables $(x, y)$. The decay rate of such an integral as $|a| \\to \\infty$ is determined by the structure of this polynomial phase. The set of $p$ for which $I(a)$ belongs to $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is typically an interval of the form $(p_0, \\infty)$. The question asks for the largest $p$ for which $I(a)$ is *not* in $L^p$, which corresponds to the endpoint $p_0$.\n\nThe value of $p_0$ is determined by the trade-off between the decay rate of $I(a)$ and the dimension of the subspace of parameters $a$ for which this decay rate occurs. The integrability threshold is given by the supremum of the ratio $d/\\sigma$ over all strata of the parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^9$, where $d$ is the dimension of the stratum and $\\sigma$ is the decay exponent of the integral on that stratum (i.e., $|I(a)| \\sim |a|^{-\\sigma}$).\n\nLet's analyze the decay for different choices of the parameter vector $a$:\n1.  **Generic case**: For a generic vector $a$, the phase polynomial has a non-degenerate stationary point inside the domain of integration. This leads to a decay rate of $\\sigma=1$. This behavior occurs on an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^9$, so the dimension of this stratum is $d=9$. This would suggest a threshold of $d/\\sigma = 9$.\n\n2.  **Quadratic phase**: If we set $a_1=a_2=0$ and $a_6=...=a_9=0$, the phase is purely quadratic: $\\phi(x,y) = a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2$. This occurs on a subspace of dimension $d=3$.\n    *   If the quadratic form is non-degenerate (i.e., $4a_3a_5 - a_4^2 \\neq 0$), the decay rate is $\\sigma=1$.\n    *   If the quadratic form is degenerate (e.g., a perfect square like $(x+y)^2$), which happens on a cone of dimension $d=2$ within the 3D subspace, the decay rate is slower, with $\\sigma=1/2$. This configuration gives a threshold candidate of $d/\\sigma = 2/(1/2) = 4$.\n\n3.  **Cubic phase**: The slowest decay rates typically arise from the highest order terms in the phase. Let's consider the case where the linear and quadratic terms are zero, i.e., $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=0$. The phase is then a homogeneous cubic polynomial: $\\phi(x,y) = a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$. This scenario corresponds to a subspace of parameters of dimension $d=4$.\n    *   For a generic choice of $(a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$, the phase is a non-degenerate cubic polynomial. A scaling argument shows that the integral decays with a rate of $\\sigma = 2/3$. This is a known result for oscillatory integrals with a homogeneous polynomial phase of degree $k=3$ in $n=2$ dimensions ($\\sigma=n/k$). This gives a threshold candidate of $p_0 = d/\\sigma = 4/(2/3) = 6$.\n    *   Within this 4-dimensional subspace, there are lower-dimensional subspaces where the decay is even slower. For instance, if $a_7=a_8=a_9=0$, the phase is $a_6x^3$. The integral reduces to a one-dimensional integral with decay rate $\\sigma=1/3$. This happens on a 1-dimensional subspace ($d=1$), giving a threshold candidate of $d/\\sigma = 1/(1/3) = 3$. Similarly, for a phase like $a_7x^2y$, the decay rate is $\\sigma=1/2$ on a 1-dimensional subspace, yielding a threshold candidate of $d/\\sigma=2$.\n\nTo find the overall integrability threshold $p_0$, we must find the maximum of these $d/\\sigma$ values. Comparing the candidates:\n*   $p_0=9$ (from the generic case)\n*   $p_0=4$ (from degenerate quadratic phases)\n*   $p_0=6$ (from generic cubic phases)\n*   $p_0=3$ (from pure cubic phases like $x^3$)\n*   $p_0=2$ (from mixed cubic phases like $x^2y$)\n\nThe integral over the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^9$ converges only if the integrals over all these regions converge. This requires $p$ to be strictly greater than the maximum of all these threshold candidates. The dominant contribution to the divergence of the integral $\\int |I(a)|^p da$ comes from the stratum with the largest value of $d/\\sigma$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the highest value for the ratio $d/\\sigma$ is 6, which arises from the 4-dimensional subspace where the phase is a generic cubic polynomial. Therefore, the function $I(a)$ is in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ if and only if $p>6$. The set of $p$ for which $I(a)$ is not in $L^p$ is $(0, 6]$. The largest value in this set is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
