    "Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in what is now Lạng Sơn Province, Vietnam. This took place during the Battle of Chi Lăng in 1427.\n\nIn 1426, Mu Sheng, along with General Liu Sheng, was dispatched to quell the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi. In September 1427, the Ming army was ambushed by Lê Lợi's forces at Chi Lăng Pass. The battle was a decisive victory for the Vietnamese, resulting in the death of Liu Sheng and forcing Mu Sheng to retreat. The engagement at Chi Lăng, located in the modern Chi Lăng District of Lạng Sơn Province, was a critical event that led to the withdrawal of Ming forces and the re-establishment of Vietnamese independence.\n\nPrior to this, in 1408, Mu Sheng had been defeated by the forces of Trần Ngỗi. However, the 1427 defeat at Chi Lăng, which involved the destruction of a large Ming army and the death of its chief commander, is considered his first major and catastrophic defeat in the region.\n\n<<<Lạng Sơn Province>>>"
