    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must first identify all possible valid expression structures (templates) of length 5, and then, for each structure, count how many combinations of T (True) and F (False) make the expression evaluate to True.\n\nThe provided operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`. We will also assume standard left-to-right associativity for operators of the same precedence (e.g., `T|F|T` is evaluated as `(T|F)|T`).\n\nThe valid templates for a 5-symbol expression and the number of true expressions for each are enumerated below:\n\n### Category 1: Expressions with three variables and two operators (no parentheses)\nThese expressions have the form `V1 op1 V2 op2 V3`, where `V` is a variable (T or F) and `op` is an operator (& or |). For these to be unambiguous without parentheses, either the operators must have different precedence, or we must assume associativity.\n\n1.  **`V & V | V`**: Parsed as `(V&V)|V`. This is true if `V3` is T (4 combinations for V1, V2), or if `V3` is F and `V1&V2` is T (1 combination: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n2.  **`V | V & V`**: Parsed as `V|(V&V)`. This is true if `V1` is T (4 combinations for V2, V3), or if `V1` is F and `V2&V3` is T (1 combination: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n3.  **`V & V & V`**: Parsed as `((V&V)&V)`. This is true only if all three variables are T. (1 expression: `T&T&T`).\n4.  **`V | V | V`**: Parsed as `((V|V)|V)`. This is true unless all three variables are F. This gives 2Â³ - 1 = 7 expressions.\n\n*   *Category 1 Total: 5 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 18*\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with negations (no parentheses)\nThese templates involve the `!` operator, whose high precedence simplifies parsing.\n\n5.  **`!!V op V`**: Parsed as `(!(!V)) op V`. Since `!!V` always evaluates to T, this simplifies to `T op V`.\n    *   `&`: `T&V` is true if `V` is T. `!!T&T` and `!!F&T`. (2 expressions).\n    *   `|`: `T|V` is always true. (4 expressions).\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 = 6.\n6.  **`V op !!V`**: Symmetric to the above. Total: 6.\n7.  **`!V op !V`**: Parsed as `(!V) op (!V)`.\n    *   `&`: `!V&!V` is true only if both `!V` are T, meaning both `V` are F (`!F&!F`). (1 expression).\n    *   `|`: `!V|!V` is true unless both `!V` are F, meaning both `V` are T. This leaves 3 true combinations.\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n8.  **`!!!!V`**: Parsed as `!(!(!(!V)))`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to T. `!!!!F` evaluates to F. (1 expression).\n\n*   *Category 2 Total: 6 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 17*\n\n### Category 3: Expressions involving parentheses\nThese templates use parentheses to group sub-expressions.\n\n9.  **`(V op V)`**:\n    *   `&`: `(T&T)` is true. (1 expression).\n    *   `|`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true. (3 expressions).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n10. **`((V))`**: `((T))` is true. (1 expression).\n11. **`V op (V)`**:\n    *   `&`: `T&(T)` is true. (1 expression).\n    *   `|`: `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` are true. (3 expressions).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n12. **`(V) op V`**: Symmetric to the above. Total: 4.\n13. **`!(!V)`**: `!(!T)` is true. (1 expression).\n14. **`(!(V))`**: `(!(F))` is true. (1 expression).\n15. **`!((V))`**: `!((F))` is true. (1 expression).\n16. **`(!!V)`**: `(!!T)` and `(!!F)` are both true. (2 expressions).\n17. **`!!(V)`**: `!!(T)` and `!!(F)` are both true. (2 expressions).\n\n*   *Category 3 Total: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 20*\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   Category 1: 18\n*   Category 2: 17\n*   Category 3: 20\n\nTotal True Expressions = 18 + 17 + 20 = 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
