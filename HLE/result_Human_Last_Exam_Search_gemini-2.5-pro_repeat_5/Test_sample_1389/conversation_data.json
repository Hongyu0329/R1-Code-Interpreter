    "To determine whether `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates, overestimates, or underestimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, it is essential to define the terms and model the scenario.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing (AON) Vaccine:** This type of vaccine provides complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the rest. For example, a vaccine with 90% AON efficacy would make 90% of recipients fully immune, while the remaining 10% would be as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Leaky Vaccine:** In contrast, a leaky vaccine provides partial protection to all vaccinated individuals, reducing their probability of infection upon each exposure.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate of the disease in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`). The formula is `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** Commonly, vaccine efficacy is calculated as `VE = 1 - IRR`. This formula measures the relative reduction in disease in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy:** This refers to the reduction in the probability of infection for a vaccinated individual per single exposure to the pathogen.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's model an all-or-nothing vaccine with an efficacy of **VE<sub>AON</sub>**. This means that a proportion, **VE<sub>AON</sub>**, of the vaccinated population is fully immune (0% chance of infection), and the remaining proportion, **(1 - VE<sub>AON</sub>)**, is fully susceptible, just like the unvaccinated population.\n\n1.  **Incidence Rate in the Unvaccinated (`IR_u`):** This is the baseline rate at which unvaccinated individuals get the disease.\n\n2.  **Incidence Rate in the Vaccinated (`IR_v`):** In the vaccinated group, only the non-protected portion, `(1 - VE_AON)`, can get sick. This subgroup will get sick at the same rate as the unvaccinated population (`IR_u`). The fully protected portion contributes zero to the incidence. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is `IR_v = IR_u * (1 - VE_AON)`.\n\n3.  **Calculating `1 - IRR`:** Now, we substitute the expression for `IR_v` into the standard vaccine efficacy formula:\n    *   `VE = 1 - IRR`\n    *   `VE = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`\n    *   `VE = 1 - (IR_u * (1 - VE_AON)) / IR_u`\n    *   `VE = 1 - (1 - VE_AON)`\n    *   `VE = VE_AON`\n\n    This shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly measures the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\n4.  **Relating to Per-Exposure Efficacy:** The concept of a single \"per-exposure efficacy\" value is most direct for a leaky vaccine. For an AON vaccine, the effect is heterogeneous:\n    *   For the **VE<sub>AON</sub>** proportion that is fully protected, their per-exposure probability of infection is zero, meaning their per-exposure efficacy is 100%.\n    *   For the **(1 - VE<sub>AON</sub>)** proportion that is not protected, their per-exposure probability of infection is unchanged, meaning their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n\n    To define a single \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for the entire vaccinated group, one must average across this heterogeneity. The average per-exposure efficacy for the group is:\n    `(VE_AON * 100%) + ((1 - VE_AON) * 0%) = VE_AON * 100%`\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the value calculated from `1 - IRR` is **VE<sub>AON</sub>**, and the average per-exposure efficacy for the group is also **VE<sub>AON</sub>**, the formula `1 - incidence rate ratio` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
