    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers would recognize as a reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel is centered on the conflict between the Gothic Wolfings and the invading Romans, and there are discussions about the Romans' character and societal structure, the narrative does not contain a scene where a character observes and recounts Roman religious beliefs, specifically alluding to the myth of the twin brothers suckled by a she-wolf.\n\nThere is a passage in the book where the character Wood-Sun recounts a memory from her fantastical childhood, mentioning a \"she-wolf great and grisly,\" but this is part of her personal history and not a description of Roman mythology.\n\n<<<There is no such character or description in the novel.>>>"
