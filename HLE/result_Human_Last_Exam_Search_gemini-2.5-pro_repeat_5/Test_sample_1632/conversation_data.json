    "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), on a two-dimensional square lattice (Manhattan lattice) is a known sequence in mathematics.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value of a(10) is 44,100. The number of possible walks grows rapidly with the number of steps. For instance, a(1) is 4, a(2) is 12, a(3) is 36, and by the time n reaches 20, the number of walks is 897,697,164.\n\nThere is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, and it remains a challenging computational problem. Mathematicians and physicists use various algorithms and estimation methods to determine these values.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
