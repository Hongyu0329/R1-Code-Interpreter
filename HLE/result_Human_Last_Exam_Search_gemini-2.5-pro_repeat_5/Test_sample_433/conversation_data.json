    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines, a single-dose ampule must be used immediately after it has been opened or punctured in a sterile environment. Once an ampule is opened, it becomes an open system and cannot be stored for any period.\n\nAmpules are designed for single-dose administration, and because they cannot be resealed after being opened, any remaining contents must be discarded. This is to prevent the potential for contamination. Therefore, the beyond-use date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule from the time of puncture is immediate.\n\n<<<Immediate use; it should not be stored for any period of time.>>>"
