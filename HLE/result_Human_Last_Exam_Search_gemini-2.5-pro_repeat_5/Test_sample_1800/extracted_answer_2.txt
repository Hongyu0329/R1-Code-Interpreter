The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the specific catalytic reaction and catalyst composition. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, optimal performance is often seen with Ni content in the range of 7-12.5 wt%. For water splitting, particularly the Oxygen Evolution Reaction, a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio has shown promising results, while a 1:2 Ni/Ce ratio has been found to be optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.
