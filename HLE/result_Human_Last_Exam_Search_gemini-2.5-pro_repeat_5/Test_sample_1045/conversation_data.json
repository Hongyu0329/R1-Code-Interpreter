    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first calculate the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then multiply by the number of each atom in the molecule.\n\n### Basis Set Definition (6-31G)\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence double-zeta basis set. Here's a breakdown of the notation:\n*   **6**: The core orbitals are described by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **31**: The valence orbitals are split into two functions (double-zeta). The inner valence shell is described by a contracted function made of 3 primitives, and the outer valence shell is described by a single primitive Gaussian function.\n\n### Contracted Functions per Atom\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom (C):**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** 1 contracted function.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** These are split.\n        *   Inner shell (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz): There is one s-function and one set of three p-functions. This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Outer shell (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz'): This also has one s-function and one set of three p-functions. This gives another 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 contracted functions.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (valence inner) + 4 (valence outer) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom (H):**\n    *   **Core:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n    *   **Valence (1s orbital):** This is split into two functions.\n        *   Inner shell (1s): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Outer shell (1s'): 1 contracted function.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n### Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of functions for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Total from 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   **Total from 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   **Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nA 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
