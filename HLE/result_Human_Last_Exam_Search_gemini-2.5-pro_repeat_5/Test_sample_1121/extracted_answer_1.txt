The number of non-Clifford gates is not a fixed value for the implementation of a universal quantum computer; it is dependent on the algorithm being run. For a proof-of-principle simulation on a distance-3 code, demonstrating the capability to perform **one** such gate is the essential requirement. For implementing a useful computer with a distance-5 code and a 1% physical error rate, the premise is flawed, as this error rate is too high for the given code distance to allow for the reliable creation of the millions or billions of non-Clifford gates required for complex algorithms.
