    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the 4-point DFT for the given sequence.\n\n### 1. Define the sequences\nLet the two 4-point sequences be `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\nTheir 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) are given as `X(k)` and `H(k)`, respectively.\n`X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe new 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n### 2. The Goal\nWe need to find the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. Let's call this `Y_4(k)`.\n\nThe formula for the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence `y(n)` is:\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * exp(-j * 2π * nk / 4)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThis can be calculated in two ways.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation via Aliasing\n\nCalculating a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence involves aliasing (or folding) the sequence in the time domain. We create a 4-point sequence `z(n)` by summing the first half and the second half of `y(n)`:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe 4-point DFT of `y(n)` is then the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`.\n\n**Step 2a: Find `x(n)` and `h(n)` by Inverse DFT (IDFT)**\n\nThe formula for the 4-point IDFT is:\n`x(n) = (1/4) * Σ_{k=0 to 3} X(k) * exp(j * 2π * nk / 4)`\n\nFor `x(n)` from `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`:\n`x(0) = (1/4) * (1 + j - 1 - j) = 0`\n`x(1) = (1/4) * (1 + j(j) - 1(-1) - j(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0`\n`x(2) = (1/4) * (1 - j - 1 + j) = 0`\n`x(3) = (1/4) * (1 - j(j) - 1(-1) + j(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1`\nSo, `x(n) = [0, 0, 0, 1]`.\n\nFor `h(n)` from `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`:\n`h(0) = (1/4) * (0 + 1+j + 1 + 1-j) = 3/4`\n`h(1) = (1/4) * (0 + j(1+j) - 1 - j(1-j)) = (1/4) * (j-1 - 1 - j-1) = -3/4`\n`h(2) = (1/4) * (0 - (1+j) + 1 - (1-j)) = (1/4) * (-1-j + 1 - 1+j) = -1/4`\n`h(3) = (1/4) * (0 - j(1+j) - 1 + j(1-j)) = (1/4) * (1-j - 1 + 1+j) = 1/4`\nSo, `h(n) = [0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25]`.\n\n**Step 2b: Construct `y(n)` and `z(n)`**\n\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n`y(n) = {0, 0.75, 0, -0.75, 0, -0.25, 1, 0.25}`\n\nNow, create the aliased sequence `z(n)`:\n`z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n`z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 0.75 + (-0.25) = 0.5`\n`z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n`z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -0.75 + 0.25 = -0.5`\nSo, `z(n) = [0, 0.5, 1, -0.5]`.\n\n**Step 2c: Calculate the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`**\n\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 3} z(n) * exp(-j * 2π * nk / 4)`\n`Y_4(0) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1`\n`Y_4(1) = 0 * (1) + 0.5 * (-j) + 1 * (-1) + (-0.5) * (j) = -1 - j`\n`Y_4(2) = 0 * (1) + 0.5 * (-1) + 1 * (1) + (-0.5) * (-1) = -0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 1`\n`Y_4(3) = 0 * (1) + 0.5 * (j) + 1 * (-1) + (-0.5) * (-j) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n### Method 2: Using DFT Properties (More Elegant)\n\nA known property of the DFT is that the M-point DFT of an N-point sequence (where M is a factor of N) is equivalent to the M evenly spaced samples of the N-point DFT. In this case, the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n`Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n**Step 3a: Find the 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)`**\n\nThe 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be found using the 4-point DFTs of the even (`x(n)`) and odd (`h(n)`) samples of `y(n)`. The formula is:\n`Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_8 = exp(-j * 2π / 8)`.\n\nWe only need to calculate `Y_8(k)` for even `k`: k = 0, 2, 4, 6.\n\n`k=0`: `Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n`k=2`: `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n`k=4`: `Y_8(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n`k=6`: `Y_8(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 3b: Assemble the 4-point DFT**\n\n`Y_4(0) = Y_8(0) = 1`\n`Y_4(1) = Y_8(2) = -1 - j`\n`Y_4(2) = Y_8(4) = 1`\n`Y_4(3) = Y_8(6) = -1 + j`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe 4-point DFT of the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}` is:\n`[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
