    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThe prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n**2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $p_i$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This means the orders of the individual characters $\\chi_i$ must be divisors of 6, and their combined lcm must be 6. For this to happen, the set of orders must contain at least one element divisible by 2 and at least one element divisible by 3.\n\n**3. Orders of Primitive Characters for Prime Conductors**\n\nFor a prime conductor $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The number of primitive characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $p-1$ (and $k>1$), and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's determine the number of primitive characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 for each prime factor of $d$:\n*   $p_1=7$: $p_1-1=6$. Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $N_1(7) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (the principal character, not primitive).\n    *   $N_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   $p_2=13$: $p_2-1=12$. Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $N_1(13) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (not primitive).\n    *   $N_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   $p_3=19$: $p_3-1=18$. Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $N_1(19) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (not primitive).\n    *   $N_2(19) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(19) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(19) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   $p_4=31$: $p_4-1=30$. Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $N_1(31) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (not primitive).\n    *   $N_2(31) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(31) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(31) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nThe orders of the primitive characters for these prime conductors can only be 2, 3, or 6. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n\n**4. Counting the Combinations of Orders**\n\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)=6$. Let $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. A character is primitive if its order is greater than 1.\nLet $A$ be the set of all possible tuples of orders of primitive characters. The orders can be 2, 3, or 6. There are $1+2+2 = 5$ primitive characters for each prime factor. Thus, there are $5^4=625$ total combinations of primitive characters.\n\nLet's find the combinations where the lcm is *not* 6.\n*   **Case 1: lcm is 1.** This is not possible as all characters are primitive and have order > 1.\n*   **Case 2: lcm is 2.** This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Since the orders must be greater than 1, all $o_i$ must be 2. There is only one character of order 2 for each prime factor ($N_2(p)=1$). So there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$ such combination.\n*   **Case 3: lcm is 3.** This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{1, 3\\}$. All $o_i$ must be 3. There are two characters of order 3 for each prime factor ($N_3(p)=2$). So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$ such combinations.\n\nThe total number of choices for the tuple of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ is the product of the number of primitive characters for each prime:\nTotal primitive combinations = $(1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThe number of combinations where the order is 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the order is not 6.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total combinations) - (combinations of order 2) - (combinations of order 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
