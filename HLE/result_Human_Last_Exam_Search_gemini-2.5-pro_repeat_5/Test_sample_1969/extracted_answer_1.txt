The exact amount of money that $p_k$ gets is given by the formula $c_k$:
$c_k = k \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \left[ \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - k \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \right]$
where $S_1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is the sum of the first $n$ integers and $S_2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ is the sum of the first $n$ squared integers. A more compact version of the formula is $c_k = k \cdot S_1 \cdot (S_1^2 - kS_1 + S_2)$.
