    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to factorize the conductor $N$.\nThe prime factorization of $N$ is:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of Dirichlet characters associated with its prime-power factors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We require this order to be 6:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nLet's determine the number of choices for each primitive component character and their possible orders:\n\n1.  **Conductor $2^2=4$**: The multiplicative group of integers modulo 4, $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is only one primitive character modulo 4, which is the non-principal character. Its order is 2.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n2.  **Conductor $3^2=9$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo 3. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The orders of these primitive characters must be multiples of 3. In a cyclic group of order 6, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ elements of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ elements of order 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (2 with order 3, and 2 with order 6).\n\n3.  **Conductor 7**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(7)-1=5$. The number of characters of a specific order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n4.  **Conductor 11**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide the order of $\\chi$, which is 6. Thus, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. Since $\\chi_{11}$ must be primitive, its order must be greater than 1, so its order must be exactly 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n5.  **Conductor 13**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide 6, so it must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. Since $\\chi_{13}$ is primitive, its order must be greater than 1. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of combinations of these primitive characters such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\nThe possible orders are:\n*   $k_4 = 2$\n*   $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_{11} = 2$\n*   $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be 6.\n*   The presence of $\\chi_4$ (with order 2) ensures that the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   The choice of $\\chi_9$ (with order 3 or 6) ensures that the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Furthermore, all possible orders are divisors of 6, so their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. Therefore, for any valid combination of primitive component characters, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThus, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
