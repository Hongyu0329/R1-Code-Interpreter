    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is not readily identifiable from available information.\n\nExtensive searches for this specific scene in Oscar-nominated films, as well as in a broader range of movies, did not yield a definitive match. While several critically acclaimed and Oscar-nominated films feature pivotal and memorable bus scenes, such as *Incendies* (2010), *The Graduate* (1967), and *Midnight Cowboy* (1969), none of the available plot summaries or scene descriptions mention the detail of a character saying \"Thank you\" upon boarding the bus as the direct cause of their sealed fate.\n\nIt is possible the film is not Oscar-nominated or that the specific details of the scene may be slightly different from how they are recalled.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as my search did not yield a conclusive result.>>>"
