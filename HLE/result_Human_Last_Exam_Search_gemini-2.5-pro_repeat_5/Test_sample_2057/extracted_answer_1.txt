Four people replied "Yes". The distribution of hats is a repeating pattern of two white hats followed by two black hats, with one exception where there is a single black hat (a rotation of W-W-B-B-W-W-B-B-B is invalid). The only possible valid configuration is a rotation of B-W-W-B-B-W-W-B-B, which has 5 black hats and 4 white hats.
