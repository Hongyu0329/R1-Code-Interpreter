    "An isometric embedding of a metric space $X$ with metric $d_X$ into a normed space $B$ with norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_B$ is a map $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ holds. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings, where $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and $B$ is a Banach space.\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible number is at least 0.\n\nTo determine if the number of embeddings can be 0, we need to find a specific example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which no isometric embedding exists.\n\nConsider the following two cases:\n\n### Case 1: Trivial Banach Space\n\nLet $B$ be the trivial Banach space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a valid Banach space. Its norm is defined as $\\|0\\| = 0$, and it is complete. The cardinality of this space is $K=1$.\n\nLet $X$ be a finite ultrametric space with at least two distinct points, for example, $X = \\{a, b\\}$ with the metric $d(a, b) = 1$ and $d(a, a) = d(b, b) = 0$. This space is ultrametric because the strong triangle inequality, $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$, holds for all combinations of points in $X$.\n\nFor an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ to exist, the following condition must be met:\n$\\|f(a) - f(b)\\| = d(a, b)$\n\nSince the only available point in $B$ is the zero vector, we must have $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$. Plugging this into the condition:\n$\\|0 - 0\\| = 1$\n$0 = 1$\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, no isometric embedding exists from this space $X$ into the Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$. In this case, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n### Case 2: Non-trivial Banach Space\n\nIt is also possible to have zero embeddings even when the Banach space is non-trivial.\n\nLet $X$ be an ultrametric space consisting of three points, $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$, with the distance defined as $d(x, y) = 1$ for $x \\neq y$, and $d(x, x) = 0$. This space is ultrametric because for any three distinct points $x, y, z$, we have $d(x, z) = 1 \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z)) = \\max(1, 1) = 1$.\n\nLet the Banach space be the set of real numbers, $B = \\mathbb{R}$, with the standard absolute value as the norm, $\\|\\cdot\\| = |\\cdot|$.\n\nSuppose an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists. Let $f(a) = u$, $f(b) = v$, and $f(c) = w$. According to the definition of an isometric embedding, the following must be true:\n1.  $|u - v| = d(a, b) = 1$\n2.  $|v - w| = d(b, c) = 1$\n3.  $|u - w| = d(a, c) = 1$\n\nFrom condition 1, $u - v = \\pm 1$.\nFrom condition 2, $v - w = \\pm 1$.\n\nWe can express $u - w$ as $(u - v) + (v - w)$. Let's examine the possible values of $u - w$:\n*   If $u - v = 1$ and $v - w = 1$, then $u - w = 1 + 1 = 2$. So $|u - w| = 2$.\n*   If $u - v = 1$ and $v - w = -1$, then $u - w = 1 - 1 = 0$. So $|u - w| = 0$.\n*   If $u - v = -1$ and $v - w = 1$, then $u - w = -1 + 1 = 0$. So $|u - w| = 0$.\n*   If $u - v = -1$ and $v - w = -1$, then $u - w = -1 - 1 = -2$. So $|u - w| = 2$.\n\nIn all possible cases, the value of $|u - w|$ is either 0 or 2. Neither of these is equal to 1, which contradicts condition 3. Therefore, no such isometric embedding can exist from this three-point ultrametric space into $\\mathbb{R}$. The number of embeddings is 0.\n\nSince it is possible to choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that the number of isometric embeddings is 0, and the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
