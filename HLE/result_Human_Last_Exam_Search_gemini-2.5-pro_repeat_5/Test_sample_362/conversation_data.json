    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphorus ylide. The final structure of the alkene is determined by the specific aldehyde/ketone and ylide used.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is a phosphorus ylide, which can be described as a Wittig reagent.\n\nThe reaction joins the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde with the ylidic carbon of the phosphane, replacing the carbon-oxygen double bond with a carbon-carbon double bond. This process yields triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe resulting product has the chemical name **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product, specifically whether the (E) or (Z) isomer is formed, depends on the nature of the ylide. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered an unstabilized ylide because the carbon atom adjacent to the phosphorus is not bonded to an electron-withdrawing group. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the Z-alkene. This is because the initial formation of the oxaphosphetane intermediate is under kinetic control, and the transition state leading to the Z-isomer is sterically favored.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**"
