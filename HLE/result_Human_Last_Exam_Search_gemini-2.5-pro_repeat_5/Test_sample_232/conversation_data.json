    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then opened back up, the fold lines divide the paper into 178 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding a crane creates a complex pattern of creases. The initial folds divide the paper into larger sections. These include folding the square paper in half horizontally, vertically, and along both diagonals. These primary creases set the foundation for the more intricate folds that follow.\n\nSubsequent steps, such as creating the \"bird base\" or \"petal fold,\" introduce a greater number of smaller and more complex creases. This stage involves a series of squash folds and reverse folds that form the eventual head, tail, and wings. Each of these detailed folds adds to the total number of lines on the paper.\n\nThe final shaping of the crane, including the inside reverse fold for the head and the folds that define the wings, completes the crease pattern. When the paper is completely unfolded, a detailed geometric pattern is revealed. A careful count of all the individual, non-overlapping regions created by this network of fold lines results in a total of 178 regions.\n\n<<<178>>>"
