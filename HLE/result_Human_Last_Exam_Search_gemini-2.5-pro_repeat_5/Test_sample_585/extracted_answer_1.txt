**Σ' = (I - 1/2 * [δ_hat]x) * Σ * (I - 1/2 * [δ_hat]x)^T**

Where:
*   **Σ'** is the post-reset 3x3 covariance matrix of the attitude deviation.
*   **Σ** is the pre-reset 3x3 covariance matrix of the attitude deviation.
*   **I** is the 3x3 identity matrix.
*   **[δ_hat]x** is the skew-symmetric matrix of the estimated attitude deviation vector δ_hat that is being reset. For δ_hat = [δ_x, δ_y, δ_z]^T, the skew-symmetric matrix is:
    ```
      [ 0  -δ_z   δ_y]
      [ δ_z   0  -δ_x]
      [-δ_y   δ_x   0]
    ```
