Within the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) as the arc-length parameter separation |s′−s| approaches zero reveals a leading-order behavior dominated by the negative of the arc-length separation itself, with higher-order corrections systematically incorporating the local geometry of the boundary. The generating function is defined as H(s, s′) = -‖γ(s′) - γ(s)‖, where γ(s) represents the point on the boundary corresponding to the arc-length parameter s.

A rigorous expansion of H(s,s′) for small |s′−s| is given by:
H(s, s′) = -|s′ - s| [1 - (κ(s)²/24)(s′ - s)² - (κ(s)κ'(s)/24)(s′ - s)³ + O((s′ - s)⁴)]

The leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) is therefore:
**H(s,s′) ~ -|s′ - s|**

This linear term establishes that for infinitesimally short chords, the generating function is primarily the negative arc-length distance.

The influence of the boundary's local curvature, κ(s), is revealed in the higher-order terms of the expansion. The first and most significant geometric correction is of order (s′ - s)³ and is proportional to the square of the curvature, κ(s)². This term, -|s′ - s| * -(κ(s)²/24)(s′ - s)², elucidates the nuanced interplay between the geometry and the dynamics. The fact that the curvature appears as κ(s)² indicates that the initial geometric effect on the dynamics is independent of the sign of the curvature. This demonstrates how the local shape of the boundary, through its curvature, perturbs the otherwise simple linear relationship for short billiard trajectories. Further refinement of the dynamics is captured by the subsequent term involving the derivative of the curvature, κ'(s), which shows the impact of the non-uniformity of the boundary's curve.
