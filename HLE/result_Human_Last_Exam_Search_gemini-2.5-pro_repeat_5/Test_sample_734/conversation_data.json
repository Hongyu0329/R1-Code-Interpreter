    "The Christian theological tradition that first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall, is **Reformed theology**, particularly as systematized in the **Westminster Confession of Faith** (1646) and expounded by theologians such as **Louis Berkhof** and **Herman Bavinck**.\n\nThe key terminology includes the distinction between **general providence** (*providentia ordinaria*) and **special providence** (*providentia extraordinaria*), with the underlying principle of **divine concurrence** (*concursus divinus*).\n\nHere is how this framework addresses both theological events:\n\n*   **Alterations at the Fall:** According to Reformed theology, the Fall of Man introduced a corrupted nature that is transmitted to all of humanity. The Westminster Confession of Faith states that by Adam's sin, our first parents \"became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body\". It further explains that this corrupted nature is \"conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation\". This establishes that the natural laws of procreation were affected by the Fall, now serving as the means of transmitting original sin. God's **general providence**, through the principle of **divine concurrence**, upholds this altered natural order.\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth of Jesus:** The virgin birth is understood as an act of **special providence**. The Westminster Confession affirms that Christ was \"conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her substance\". Theologian Herman Bavinck explains that this supernatural conception was necessary to exempt Christ from original sin, which is passed down through ordinary human generation. The virgin birth represents an instance where God, through **special providence**, works \"without, above, and against\" the established natural laws. This demonstrates a unique application of **divine concurrence** to bring about the incarnation for the purpose of redemption, intervening in the very laws that were altered in their consequence by the Fall.\n\nIn summary, it is within the systematic framework of Reformed theology, especially as articulated in the Westminster Confession of Faith and its commentators, that a consistent terminology was developed to describe God's work in relation to the laws of nature in both their fallen, ordinary state and in the extraordinary, redemptive event of the virgin birth.\n\n<<<Herman Bavinck and the Westminster Confession of Faith>>>"
