    "<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\nHere is a justification for this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Properties of the function *f*\n\nFirst, we establish some fundamental properties of any continuous function $f$ that satisfies the given equation.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** The function $f$ must be one-to-one (injective). To see this, suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing, it is injective, so we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Therefore, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### 2. Ruling out strictly decreasing solutions\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n*   A strictly decreasing continuous function $h(x) = f(x) - x$ goes from $+\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ to $-\\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a unique point $x_0$ such that $h(x_0)=0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$. This point $x_0$ is a unique fixed point of the function $f$.\n*   If we apply the given functional equation at this fixed point, we get $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   However, the equation also states that $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n*   This leads to the conclusion that $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. This equation has no real solutions, as the graph of $y=x$ never intersects the graph of $y=e^x$.\n*   This contradiction proves that there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\n### 3. Analyzing strictly increasing solutions\n\nSince we have ruled out decreasing functions, any solution must be strictly increasing.\n*   If $f$ is strictly increasing, the composition $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with the fact that $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n*   For any strictly increasing solution, the inequality $x < f(x) < \\exp(x)$ must hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   $f(x)$ cannot equal $x$, as that would imply $x = e^x$.\n    *   The continuous function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is never zero, so it must be either always positive or always negative.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$, then applying the increasing function $f$ gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$, which means $\\exp(x) < f(x)$. This results in the contradiction $\\exp(x) < f(x) < x$, which is impossible since $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$.\n    *   Therefore, it must be that $f(x) > x$ for all $x$. Applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x)) > f(x)$, which means $\\exp(x) > f(x)$. This confirms the inequality $x < f(x) < \\exp(x)$.\n\n### 4. Construction and Cardinality\n\nThe existence of such functions, known as functional square roots, is a known result in mathematics. We can show that there are uncountably many such functions by construction:\n1.  **Choose an initial value:** Start by defining the value of $f(0)$. Let $f(0) = c$. Based on the inequality derived above, we must have $0 < c < \\exp(0)$, which means $c \\in (0, 1)$. There are uncountably many choices for $c$, as any real number in this interval is a valid choice.\n2.  **Define the function on an initial interval:** For each choice of $c$, we must define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$. It must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0, c]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(c)]$. We know $f(0) = c$ and $f(c) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. So, we need to choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$.\n3.  **Uncountably many choices:** There are uncountably many such functions $\\phi$. For instance, for any real number $k > 0$, the function $\\phi_k(x) = c + (1-c)\\left(\\frac{x}{c}\\right)^k$ is a valid choice. Different values of $k$ yield different functions.\n4.  **Extension to all of $\\mathbb{R}$:** Once $f$ is defined on $[0, c]$, its definition is uniquely determined for all other real numbers by the functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and the requirement of continuity and monotonicity. For example, for any $y \\in [c, 1]$, we can find a unique $x \\in [0, c]$ such that $y=f(x)$. We must then define $f(y) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. This process can be extended iteratively to cover the entire real line.\n\nSince there are uncountably many choices for the initial value $c$ and, for each $c$, uncountably many choices for the function on the initial interval, the set of solutions is at least uncountable.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers. Since the set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nGiven that the number of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude that the cardinality of the set is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
