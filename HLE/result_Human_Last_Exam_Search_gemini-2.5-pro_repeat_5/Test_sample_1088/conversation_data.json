    "The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation specifies how the atomic orbitals of an atom are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions.\n\nHere is a breakdown for hydrogen and second-row atoms (like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen), which are commonly used with this basis set.\n\n### Understanding the 6-311G** Notation:\n*   **6-**: The core atomic orbitals are represented by a single contracted basis function, which is a linear combination of **6 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **-311**: The valence atomic orbitals are described by three basis functions (a \"triple-zeta\" basis set). The first is a contraction of **3 primitive Gaussians**, while the second and third are single, uncontracted **primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **G**: Indicates that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n*   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonds.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **d-type polarization functions** to \"heavy\" atoms (atoms other than hydrogen and helium). In this context, this is a set of 5 uncontracted d-functions.\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **p-type polarization functions** to hydrogen atoms. This is a set of 3 uncontracted p-functions.\n\n### Calculation of Primitive Gaussians per Atom:\n\n**For a Hydrogen Atom (H):**\n*   A hydrogen atom has one 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals.\n*   **Valence 1s orbital**: Described by the \"311\" split, meaning it is represented by functions composed of 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (`**`)**: The second asterisk adds one set of three p-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **3** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (for the s-orbital) + 3 (for polarization) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**For a Second-Row Atom (e.g., Carbon, C):**\n*   A carbon atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n*   **Core 1s orbital (`6-`)**: Represented by a contraction of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence 2s orbital (`-311`)**: Represented by functions made from 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence 2p orbitals (`-311`)**: There are three 2p orbitals (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂). Each is described by functions made from 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives. This results in 3 × 5 = **15** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (`*`)**: The first asterisk adds one set of five d-type polarization functions, each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **5** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Carbon**: 6 (core) + 5 (2s valence) + 15 (2p valence) + 5 (polarization) = **31 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nThis calculation can be verified with an example like methanol (CH₃OH). Using the numbers above, the total primitive Gaussians would be 31 (for C) + 31 (for O) + 4 × 8 (for H) = 94. This matches the number cited in the literature for methanol with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set, which is equivalent to 6-311G**.\n\nIt is important to note that for atoms in the third row and beyond (e.g., Silicon), the 6-311G notation does not always follow this simple breakdown and often refers to more complex basis sets like those developed by McLean and Chandler.\n\n**In summary:**\n*   A **hydrogen atom** has **8** primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set.\n*   A **second-row atom (Li-Ne)** has **31** primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n<<<A hydrogen atom has 8 primitive Gaussians and a second-row atom (Li-Ne) has 31 primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.>>>"
