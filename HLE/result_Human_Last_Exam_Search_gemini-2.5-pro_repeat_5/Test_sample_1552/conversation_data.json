    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is a functional of the background geometry and the gauge field. The spectral action is given by `Tr(f(D/Λ))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator, `f` is a suitable test function, and `Λ` is a cutoff scale. The asymptotic expansion of the spectral action in powers of `Λ` is determined by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the operator `D²`.\n\nThe second coefficient in this expansion is `a₂`, which is obtained by integrating a local density, `a₂(x)`, over the four-dimensional manifold `M`:\n\n`a₂ = ∫_M a₂(x) d⁴x √g`\n\nFor a Dirac spinor in a representation of dimension `d(r)` of the gauge group, the local density `a₂(x)` is given by:\n\n`a₂(x) = \\frac{d(r)}{16\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) - \\frac{1}{240}R^2 + \\frac{1}{240}R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{7}{1440}R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right)`\n\nHere:\n*   `d(r)` is the dimension of the representation of the gauge group for the spinor field.\n*   `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n*   `R` is the scalar curvature.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu}` is the Ricci curvature tensor.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n*   `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the field strength tensor of the gauge field, and `tr` denotes the trace over the gauge group generators.\n\nThis coefficient contains the standard Yang-Mills action term for the gauge field, alongside gravitational terms involving squares of the curvature, which correspond to higher-order gravity corrections. In the context of the spectral action, the term proportional to `a₂` in the expansion provides the kinetic terms for the gauge fields and modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n\n<<<`a₂ = \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\frac{d(r)}{16\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) - \\frac{1}{240}R^2 + \\frac{1}{240}R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{7}{1440}R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right)`>>>"
