    "The haiku \"The Bays\" describes the end of the war in the Pacific in August 1945.\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the turbulent end of World War II, marked by the atomic bombs and the impending surrender of Japan.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** points to August 30th (2 x 15 = 30). On this day in 1945, General Douglas MacArthur arrived at Atsugi airfield in Japan to oversee the occupation, a profound \"wind of change\" for the nation.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** signifies the surrender of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure by his people.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a question pointing to the locations central to these events. In late August 1945, the Allied fleet, including the USS *Missouri*, first anchored in Sagami Bay on August 27th before entering Tokyo Bay to prepare for the formal surrender ceremony.\n\nThe answer, in alphabetical order, is the names of these two bays.\n\n<<<Sagami, Tokyo>>>"
