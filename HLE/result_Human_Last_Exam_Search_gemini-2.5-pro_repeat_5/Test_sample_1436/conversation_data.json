    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. The phrase \"a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions\" can be interpreted in a few ways. Assuming the context of a simple scalar field theory, such as φ⁴ theory, a \"field contraction\" corresponds to an internal line (propagator) in a diagram.\n\nFor a diagram with two vertices, four field contractions imply four internal lines. In φ⁴ theory, this must be a vacuum diagram, as each of the two vertices provides four field legs, and four internal lines will use all eight legs. There are two possible connected diagrams that fit this description:\n\n1.  A diagram where the two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators.\n2.  A \"dumbbell\" shaped diagram where each vertex has one loop (a self-contraction), and the two vertices are connected by the remaining two propagators.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, a reasonable interpretation is that \"four field contractions\" refers to the contractions *between* the two distinct vertices. This uniquely specifies the first case.\n\nFor the diagram with two vertices connected by four propagators:\n*   The four propagators are identical and can be permuted in 4! ways.\n*   The two vertices are also identical and can be interchanged, which gives a factor of 2!.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these factors.\n\nS = (Number of permutations of internal lines) × (Number of permutations of vertices)\nS = 4! × 2!\nS = 24 × 2\nS = 48\n\nA video lecture on the topic confirms that for a diagram with two vertices and four identical propagators between them, the symmetry factor is calculated as 4! multiplied by 2. A problem set from a quantum field theory course also lists the symmetry factor for a two-vertex vacuum diagram connected by four lines as 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
