  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem of information theory and combinatorics, disguised as a story. Let's break down the relevant information to find the solution.\n\n1.  **The Encoding Symbols (from the \"Ching\"):**\n    *   The Ching book contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" represents 2 states (yin or yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" represents the 5 elements (fire, water, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique states for each symbol is 2 (states of yin/yang) × 5 (states of wuxing) = 10 possible unique symbols.\n\n2.  **The Message Alphabet (from the \"Shu\"):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters described in the Shu.\n    *   This character set consists of 120 unique Chinese characters. This is the \"alphabet\" for the secret message.\n\n3.  **The Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to determine how many of the 10-state Ching symbols are required to represent one of the 120 possible message characters.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of Ching symbols needed to encode one character. The number of combinations possible with `k` symbols must be greater than or equal to the number of characters we need to represent (120).\n    *   With `k=1` symbol: 10¹ = 10 combinations (not enough to represent 120 characters).\n    *   With `k=2` symbols: 10² = 100 combinations (still not enough).\n    *   With `k=3` symbols: 10³ = 1000 combinations (this is sufficient to represent all 120 characters).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   Since each character of the secret message requires 3 symbols from the Ching book for its encoding, we can find the maximum length by dividing the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols per character.\n    *   Total symbols in the Ching: 9999.\n    *   Symbols per message character: 3.\n    *   Maximum message length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character = 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\nThe other details, such as the 3000 characters in the Shu, the computer vision recognition time (12 ms), and the computation time for operations (10 ns and 30 ns), are extraneous information not needed for the calculation.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
