    "The problem of finding the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and whose sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is a well-known open problem in additive number theory. The exact value of $c$ is not known, but there are established lower and upper bounds.\n\nA simple and elegant construction provides a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. The size of this set is approximately $N/3$. The sum of any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ satisfies $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. However, any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. Thus, the sumset $A+A$ cannot contain any squares. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nFor a long time, it was conjectured by Paul Erdős that the value of $c$ is exactly $1/3$. However, this conjecture has been disproven. Through more complex constructions, mathematicians have found sets with a greater density.\n\nThe current best-known lower and upper bounds for $c$ are:\n*   **Lower Bound:** It has been shown that there exist constructions of such sets $A$ with a density greater than $1/3$. The best-known result, due to Sándor Z. Kiss, establishes that $c \\ge 11/27$.\n*   **Upper Bound:** It has been proven that $c \\le 1/2$. This bound comes from considering the graph where vertices are the integers from 1 to $N$ and edges connect pairs that sum to a square. The set $A$ must be an independent set in this graph.\n\nThe problem of determining the exact value of $c$ remains unsolved. The gap between the best known lower bound of $11/27 \\approx 0.4074$ and the upper bound of $1/2$ is an active area of research.\n\nSince the question asks for the largest number $c$ for which existence is proven, the best-established lower bound should be provided.\n\n<<<11/27>>>"
