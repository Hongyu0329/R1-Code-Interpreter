    "**An American in Paris (1951)** was the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nThe iconic Parisian landmark is visible during the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence. This elaborate dream sequence, which cost half a million dollars and took a month to shoot, features sets inspired by the works of famous painters. One of the key settings for this ballet is a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where the Luxor Obelisk is a central monument.\n\nThe ballet's centerpiece is a fountain modeled after those in the Place de la Concorde, and the sequence was designed to evoke the style of painter Raoul Dufy's depictions of the location. Multiple sources confirm that Gene Kelly's character, Jerry Mulligan, dances through this recreation of the Place de la Concorde. While much of the film was shot on MGM's backlot in Hollywood, it successfully captured the essence of Paris, with the Place de la Concorde being a key featured location in the imaginative ballet finale.\n\nPrior Best Picture winners were either set in different locations or, if set in Paris, were filmed on studio sets that did not include the famous landmark. For instance, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), though set in Paris, had studio-built sets of other Parisian locations. Later winners, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also featured Parisian scenes, but *An American in Paris* is the first to have depicted the Place de la Concorde and its famous obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
