    "The human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor, also known as GABRR1, is a protein that forms ligand-gated chloride channels. Like other subunits in its family, it features four transmembrane (TM) domains and a significant intracellular loop connecting the third and fourth transmembrane segments (TM3-TM4).\n\nBased on the protein sequence data for human GABRR1 (UniProt accession number P24046), the transmembrane domains are located at specific amino acid positions. The third transmembrane domain (TM3) spans residues 343-365, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) spans residues 458-479.\n\nThe linker domain between TM3 and TM4 therefore consists of the amino acid sequence from position 366 to 457. An analysis of this specific 92-amino acid sequence reveals the presence of a single Cysteine (C) residue at position 385.\n\n<<<1>>>"
