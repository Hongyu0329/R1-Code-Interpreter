    "The sound produced by human muscle twitches occurs at very low frequencies. Research shows that the most significant frequencies are below 20 Hz, with the main frequencies being even lower, below 4 Hz. To determine which animal might hear this, we must compare this frequency range to the hearing capabilities of the animals listed.\n\n*   **Human (E):** The typical human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since the primary sound of a muscle twitch is below 20 Hz, humans cannot hear them.\n*   **Dog (A):** A dog's hearing range is generally between 40 Hz and 60,000 Hz. Their low-frequency hearing is not as good as humans', meaning they cannot hear sounds below approximately 40-67 Hz. Therefore, a dog could not hear a muscle twitch.\n*   **Bat (B):** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation. Their hearing range typically starts at several hundred or even a thousand hertz, with the lowest recorded limit for any bat species being around 500-700 Hz. They are unable to hear the low frequencies of a muscle twitch.\n*   **Whale (D):** The hearing range of whales varies. While many toothed whales specialize in high frequencies, baleen whales are known to hear very low, infrasonic sounds. Some baleen whales can hear frequencies as low as 7 to 16 Hz. This range overlaps with some of the sound produced by a muscle twitch.\n*   **Herring (C):** Herring are fish with a specialized hearing system that allows them to detect a wide range of frequencies. Notably, they are sensitive to low frequencies and can show escape responses to infrasonic sounds as low as 5 Hz. This puts the sound of a human muscle twitch, especially its chief frequencies below 4 Hz, right at the edge of their hearing threshold.\n\nComparing the candidates, both certain whales and herring have hearing ranges that extend into the low frequencies produced by muscle twitches. However, the herring's documented sensitivity to infrasound down to 5 Hz makes it a very strong candidate to detect such a faint, low-frequency event.\n\n<<<C>>>"
