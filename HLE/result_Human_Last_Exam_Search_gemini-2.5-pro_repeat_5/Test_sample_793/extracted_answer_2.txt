The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is **Atrazine at a concentration of 1.84 x 10⁻⁵ μg/L**.

The effect of the mixture at this concentration is **additive**, based on the concentration addition model. However, with a calculated Toxic Index of approximately 1.89 x 10⁻⁷, which is substantially below the threshold of 1, the combined toxicological risk to the protected algal community is negligible.
