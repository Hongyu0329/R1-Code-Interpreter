    "To ensure a symmetric key is secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, its length must be sufficient to withstand brute-force attacks that are quadratically faster due to Grover's algorithm. This algorithm effectively halves the bit strength of a symmetric key.\n\nThe current standard for strong symmetric encryption, AES-128, which has 128-bit security against classical computers, would have its security reduced to 64 bits against a quantum computer, making it vulnerable. To maintain a security level of 128 bits, which is considered secure for the foreseeable future, the key length must be doubled.\n\nTherefore, a symmetric key of 256 bits is recommended to provide a post-quantum security level of 128 bits. This is because a quantum computer would require approximately 2^128 operations to break a 256-bit key, a task that remains computationally infeasible. For this reason, algorithms like AES-256 are considered to be quantum-resistant.\n\nBased on this, the minimum required length for a symmetric key to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
