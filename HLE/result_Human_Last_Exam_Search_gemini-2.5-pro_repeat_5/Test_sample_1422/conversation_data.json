    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the minimum number of vertices required to form a two-loop Feynman diagram is one.\n\nThis is possible in a theory with a quartic interaction term, such as the common $\\phi^4$ theory. In this case, a single interaction vertex has four lines coming out of it. To form a two-loop diagram, these lines can be connected to themselves in pairs. This creates a \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubble diagram.\n\nA vacuum bubble is a valid Feynman diagram that contributes to the vacuum energy of the system. The number of loops (L) in a connected Feynman diagram is given by the formula L = I - V + 1, where I is the number of internal lines (propagators) and V is the number of vertices. For the figure-eight diagram:\n*   There is **1 vertex** (V=1).\n*   There are **2 internal lines** (I=2), as the four lines from the vertex are paired up.\n*   This results in L = 2 - 1 + 1 = **2 loops**.\n\nTherefore, a two-loop diagram can be constructed with just a single vertex. It is impossible to have fewer than one vertex, as vertices represent the interactions that create loops. While diagrams with external particles (like those for scattering processes) require more vertices, the question asks for the absolute minimum, which includes vacuum diagrams. For example, the two-loop \"sunset\" self-energy diagram requires two vertices.\n\nIn theories with only a cubic ($\\phi^3$) interaction, a minimum of two vertices is required to form a two-loop diagram, as a single three-line vertex cannot form any loops.\n\n<<<1>>>"
