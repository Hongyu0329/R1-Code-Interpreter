    "Until 1950, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome featured a unique wooden cobblestone pavement. This feature was removed by the city administration due to frequent complaints from citizens about falls caused by grease applied to the sloping surface to preserve the wood.\n\nThe wooden cobblestones, known as \"sanpietrini in legno,\" were a distinctive characteristic of the square. After their removal in 1950, the piazza was paved with asphalt. The few remaining wooden cobblestones were reportedly donated to the Salesian Convent in Castro Pretorio and repurposed for a driveway entrance.\n\nOver its long history, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations. In the 15th century, Pope Eugenius IV had market stalls and other obstructions cleared from the front of the Pantheon. The central fountain was built in the 16th century, with the Egyptian obelisk added in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, twin bell towers that had been added to the Pantheon were demolished.\n\n<<<wooden cobblestone pavement>>>"
