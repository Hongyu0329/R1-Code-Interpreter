    "The problem asks for the single valid intermediate step in an elementary cellular automaton evolution, given the starting and ending configurations. An elementary cellular automaton updates each cell's state (0 or 1) based on its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The entire system evolves according to one of 256 possible rules, known as Wolfram codes. The grid is treated as having periodic boundary conditions, meaning the ends wrap around.\n\nThe solution requires finding a single rule that transforms the initial state into an intermediate state, and then transforms that intermediate state into the final state.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** `01101001`\n2.  **Intermediate State:** `????????`\n3.  **Final State:** `10000111`\n\nBy systematically testing each of the 256 possible rules, we can determine the correct one. For each rule, we apply it to the initial state to generate a potential intermediate state. Then, we apply the same rule to this new state. If the result matches the given final state, we have found the solution.\n\nThis process reveals that **Rule 105** is the only one that satisfies the required transformation.\n\n*   **Step 1: Applying Rule 105 to the initial state `01101001`**\n    The binary representation of Rule 105 is `01101001`. This defines the output for each of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods. Applying this rule (with periodic boundaries) to the initial state yields the intermediate state: `11110000`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Applying Rule 105 to the intermediate state `11110000`**\n    Applying the same rule to the intermediate state `11110000` produces the final state: `10000111`, which matches the sequence given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the unique intermediate step is `11110000`.\n\n<<<11110000>>>"
