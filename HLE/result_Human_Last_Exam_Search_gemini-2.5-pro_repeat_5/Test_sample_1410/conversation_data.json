    "After a detailed analysis of the chess position described by the FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, it's clear that White has a decisive, game-winning advantage despite the threatening placement of Black's rooks.\n\nWhite's optimal first move is to capture the black rook on e1 with the queen.\n\nThe sequence for the win is as follows:\n\n1.  **Qxe1**: This move simultaneously removes the immediate back-rank threat from the black rook and creates a powerful attack. The primary threat is now `Qe8#`, a checkmate that Black must address.\n\n2.  **...R8e7**: This is Black's best defense, using the other rook to block the e-file and prevent immediate checkmate. Other moves, such as moving the king, would allow `Qe8#`.\n\n3.  **Bxf7+**: White continues the attack with a check from the bishop. The black king is forced to move.\n\n4.  **...Kh8**: The king moves to h8 to escape the check.\n\n5.  **Ng6+**: This is a brilliant move by White. It's a check from the knight, and it also reveals an attack from the White queen on e1 to the Black queen on g5. Black is forced to respond to the check. If Black plays `...hxg6`, White replies with `Qxg5`, winning the queen and securing a winning position. If Black's king moves to h7, White can continue the attack and win decisively.\n\nThis sequence forces a checkmate in a few more moves. The most direct line leads to a mate in 5 moves.\n\nTherefore, assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 5 moves.\n\n<<<5>>>"
