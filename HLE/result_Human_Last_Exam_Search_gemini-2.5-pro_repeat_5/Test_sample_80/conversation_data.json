    "An 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares in total. These squares are divided equally by color, meaning there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n\nA bishop can only attack other pieces on squares of the same color. Therefore, to determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can consider the white and black squares separately.\n\nOn the 14 white edge squares, a maximum of seven non-attacking bishops can be placed. This is because the white edge squares are all connected by diagonals, forming seven pairs of squares that attack each other. By placing one bishop from each pair, we maximize the number at seven. The same logic applies to the 14 black edge squares, where a maximum of seven non-attacking bishops can also be placed.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares without any attacking each other is 7 (on white) + 7 (on black) = 14. In fact, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the entire board is 14, and this is achieved by placing them all on the edge squares.\n\nThe question asks how many edge squares would lack bishops. To find this, we subtract the number of occupied squares from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 total edge squares - 14 occupied edge squares = 14 empty edge squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
