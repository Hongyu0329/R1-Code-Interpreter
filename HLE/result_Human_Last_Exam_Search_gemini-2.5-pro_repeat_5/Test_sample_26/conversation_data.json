    "The question asks for the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. There is a potential ambiguity in the phrasing. A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface (a 4-dimensional real manifold). However, in much of the mathematical physics and algebraic geometry literature, the term \"quintic\" or \"quintic threefold\" refers to a quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$, which is a celebrated example of a Calabi-Yau threefold (a 6-dimensional real manifold). Given the context of advanced topological invariants, it is most likely that the question concerns this more commonly studied object. We will proceed under the assumption that $X$ is a smooth quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$.\n\nA smooth quintic threefold $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$ has the following properties:\n*   **Dimensionality**: It is a 3-dimensional complex manifold, and thus a 6-dimensional real manifold.\n*   **Connectivity**: By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^4$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^4)$ for $k < 3$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^4$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^4) = 0$), it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n*   **Homology**: The Betti numbers of a smooth quintic threefold are well-known. In particular, the third Betti number is $b_3(X) = \\dim H_3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 204$. The second Betti number is $b_2(X) = 1$.\n\nTo determine the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, we can use rational homotopy theory. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Formality**: As a compact KÃ¤hler manifold, the quintic threefold $X$ is a \"formal space\" in the sense of Sullivan. This implies that its rational homotopy type is entirely determined by its rational cohomology algebra.\n*   **Minimal Models**: For a simply connected formal space, the ranks of its rational homotopy groups can be computed from its Betti numbers via the theory of Sullivan minimal models. The rank of $\\pi_k(X)$ is the dimension of the $k$-th graded piece of the space of generators, $V^k$, of the minimal model.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    1.  The number of generators of degree 2, $\\dim V^2$, is equal to the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$. For the quintic threefold, $b_2(X)=1$.\n    2.  The number of generators of degree 3, $\\dim V^3$, which equals the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, contributes to the third cohomology group of the model.\n    3.  In the minimal model, the differential of a degree 3 generator, $d y \\in d(V^3)$, must lie in the space of wedge products of lower-degree generators. In this case, $dy$ must lie in $\\wedge^2 V^2$. Since $V^2$ is one-dimensional, $\\wedge^2 V^2 = 0$.\n    4.  Therefore, the differential must be zero on all degree-3 generators: $d(V^3) = 0$.\n    5.  This implies that the third cohomology of the minimal model is simply the space of generators $V^3$ itself (as there are no coboundaries of degree 3 from $V^2$ or $V^1$).\n    6.  Thus, the dimension of $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ must equal the dimension of $V^3$.\n\nSince $b_3(X) = 204$, the dimension of $V^3$ must be 204. As the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the dimension of $V^3$, we conclude that the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 204.\n\n<<<204>>>"
