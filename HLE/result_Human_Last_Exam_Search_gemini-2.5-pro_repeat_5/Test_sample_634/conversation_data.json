    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the property that relates the GCRD to the rank of a composite matrix. Two polynomial matrices are considered right coprime if their GCRD is a unimodular matrix. A polynomial matrix is unimodular if its determinant is a non-zero constant.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nTwo polynomial matrices, in this case P1(s) and P2(s), are right coprime if and only if the composite matrix formed by stacking them has full column rank for all complex values of 's'. Let's form this composite matrix M(s):\n\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThe matrix M(s) has 4 rows and 2 columns. Its rank is at most 2. To check if the matrices are right coprime, we need to verify if the rank of M(s) is 2 for all values of s. The rank is 2 if we can find a 2x2 submatrix with a non-zero determinant.\n\nLet's consider the submatrix formed by the last two rows, which is P2(s) itself:\ndet(P2(s)) = det([[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]) = (s)(1) - (0)(-s - 1) = s\n\nThis determinant is non-zero for all s â‰  0. This means that for any complex number s except for s=0, the rank of M(s) is 2.\n\nNow, we must check the case where s = 0:\nM(0) = [, [-1, 0],, [-1, 1]]\n\nTo determine the rank of M(0), we can look for a 2x2 submatrix with a non-zero determinant. Let's consider the submatrix formed by the second and fourth rows:\ndet([[-1, 0], [-1, 1]]) = (-1)(1) - (0)(-1) = -1\n\nSince this determinant is -1 (which is non-zero), the rank of M(0) is 2.\n\nBecause the rank of the composite matrix M(s) is 2 for all complex values of s, the matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two right coprime matrices is any unimodular matrix. A unimodular matrix is a square polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant. The simplest and most common choice for the GCRD in such cases is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
