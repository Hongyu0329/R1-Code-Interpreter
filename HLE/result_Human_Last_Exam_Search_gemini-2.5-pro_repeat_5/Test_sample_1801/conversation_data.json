    "While there is no evidence to suggest that any Nobel laureates were featured in the infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercials for Enron, two Nobel Peace Prize recipients were connected to the company through a prestigious award it sponsored.\n\nThe two Nobel laureates who received the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service were:\n\n*   **Nelson Mandela:** The former President of South Africa and 1993 Nobel Peace Prize winner received the Enron Prize in 1999 for his \"unrelenting commitment to peace.\" The award was presented at an event sponsored by Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.\n\n*   **Mikhail Gorbachev:** The former President of the Soviet Union and 1990 Nobel Peace Prize recipient was awarded the Enron Prize in 1997.\n\nThe Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service was established by Enron in the mid-1990s and awarded by Rice University's Baker Institute to recognize outstanding individuals for their contributions to public service. Other recipients of the award included former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign, which aired in 2000, was known for its surreal and ambitious tone but does not appear to have featured any Nobel laureates. The tagline was intended to be a \"rallying cry of a new generation of business,\" a sentiment that now carries a bitter irony in light of the company's scandalous collapse in 2001.\n\n<<<Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev>>>"
