    "Following a detailed search for information regarding Svetlana Gileva's performance in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, it is not possible to determine the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" she performed.\n\nWhile reviews confirm that Svetlana Gileva danced in this production in 2015, there are no publicly available videos or detailed choreographic analyses of this specific performance that would allow for a count of a particular step. The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard term in ballet terminology and does not appear in descriptions of Forsythe's work, which is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet and its athletic, off-center movements. Without a precise definition of this step within the context of Forsythe's choreography or a visual record of the performance, an accurate count cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question.>>>"
