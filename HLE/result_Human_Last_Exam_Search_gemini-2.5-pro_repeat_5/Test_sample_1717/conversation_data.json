    "Based on analysis of the health scaling of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, there is no theoretical maximum health given an infinite number of players. The health increases with each additional player, and the amount of health added per player also appears to increase or at least not decrease towards zero.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu starts with 3,640 health for a single player. With additional players, its health increases as follows:\n*   **2 Players:** 4,913\n*   **3 Players:** 6,976\n*   **4 Players:** 9,565\n*   **5 Players:** 12,504\n*   **Up to 9 players:** The health continues to increase with each player.\n\nThe formula for this health scaling is not a simple linear progression. For each player added, the percentage of base health added increases. For example, the second player adds a 35% health bonus, but the third player contributes to a total bonus of approximately 92% over the base health.\n\nData derived from community analysis of the game's source code suggests that this trend of increasing health per player continues. The health added for each new player from the second to the ninth player is a positive value that does not approach zero. If this trend continues, the total health would increase indefinitely as more players are added.\n\nWhile some multiplayer games cap the number of players that contribute to difficulty scaling (often at a value like 255, the maximum value of a byte), there is no information in the provided search results to indicate such a cap exists for Terraria's boss health scaling.\n\nTherefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu would also approach infinity.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
