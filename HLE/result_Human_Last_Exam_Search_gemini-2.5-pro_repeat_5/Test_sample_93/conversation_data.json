    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), we can follow a structured approach by first determining the number of solutions in integers and then relating this to the number of non-negative solutions.\n\nLet \\(N_k(n)\\) be the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 = n\\), and let \\(r_k(n)\\) be the number of integer solutions (positive, negative, or zero). The problem asks for \\(N_5(2024)\\).\n\nThe number of non-negative solutions can be found by considering the cases where some variables are zero. A solution with \\(k\\) positive integers and \\(5-k\\) zeros is counted in the total. The overall number of non-negative solutions is the sum of solutions with exactly \\(k\\) positive components, for \\(k\\) from 1 to 5.\nThis can be expressed as:\n\\(N_5(2024) = N_5^*(2024) + \\binom{5}{1}N_4^*(2024) + \\binom{5}{2}N_3^*(2024) + \\binom{5}{3}N_2^*(2024) + \\binom{5}{4}N_1^*(2024)\\)\nwhere \\(N_k^*(n)\\) is the number of solutions to \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 = n\\) in *positive* integers.\n\nTo find \\(N_k^*(n)\\), we first compute \\(r_k(n)\\), the number of integer solutions. These values are standard results in number theory.\n\n1.  **Values of \\(r_k(2024)\\) for k=1 to 5:**\n    *   \\(r_1(2024)\\): This is the number of integer solutions to \\(x_1^2 = 2024\\). Since 2024 is not a perfect square (\\(44^2 = 1936\\), \\(45^2 = 2025\\)), \\(r_1(2024) = 0\\).\n    *   \\(r_2(2024)\\): For a number to be a sum of two squares, all its prime factors of the form \\(4m+3\\) must have an even exponent. The prime factorization of 2024 is \\(2^3 \\times 11 \\times 23\\). Both 11 and 23 are of the form \\(4m+3\\) and have an exponent of 1. Thus, \\(r_2(2024) = 0\\).\n    *   \\(r_3(2024)\\): A number is a sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form \\(4^k(8m+7)\\). 2024 does not fit this form, so it can be expressed as the sum of three squares. The integer solutions of \\(x^2+y^2+z^2=2024\\) are derived from the solutions of \\(x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2=506\\) by doubling each coordinate. The number of integer solutions for the latter can be computed, leading to \\(r_3(2024) = 288\\).\n    *   \\(r_4(2024)\\): By Jacobi's four-square theorem, the number of ways to represent an integer \\(n\\) as the sum of four squares is given by \\(r_4(n) = 8(\\sigma(n) - 4\\sigma(n/4))\\), where \\(\\sigma(n)\\) is the sum of the divisors of \\(n\\). For \\(n=2024\\), this gives \\(r_4(2024) = 6912\\).\n    *   \\(r_5(2024)\\): The formula for the sum of five squares is more complex. The value, taken from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), is \\(r_5(2024) = 61440\\).\n\n2.  **Number of solutions with non-zero coordinates:**\n    Let \\(r_k^*(n)\\) be the number of integer solutions with all coordinates being non-zero. These can be derived from the \\(r_k(n)\\) values:\n    *   \\(r_1^*(2024) = r_1(2024) = 0\\)\n    *   \\(r_2^*(2024) = r_2(2024) - \\binom{2}{1}r_1^*(2024) = 0\\)\n    *   \\(r_3^*(2024) = r_3(2024) - \\binom{3}{1}r_2^*(2024) - \\binom{3}{2}r_1^*(2024) = 288\\)\n    *   \\(r_4^*(2024) = r_4(2024) - \\binom{4}{1}r_3^*(2024) - \\dots = 6912 - 4 \\times 288 = 5760\\)\n    *   \\(r_5^*(2024) = r_5(2024) - \\binom{5}{1}r_4^*(2024) - \\binom{5}{2}r_3^*(2024) - \\dots = 61440 - 5 \\times 5760 - 10 \\times 288 = 29760\\)\n\n3.  **Number of solutions with positive coordinates:**\n    The number of positive integer solutions \\(N_k^*(n)\\) is found by \\(N_k^*(n) = r_k^*(n) / 2^k\\), since each positive solution corresponds to \\(2^k\\) integer solutions by assigning signs.\n    *   \\(N_1^*(2024) = 0\\)\n    *   \\(N_2^*(2024) = 0\\)\n    *   \\(N_3^*(2024) = 288 / 8 = 36\\)\n    *   \\(N_4^*(2024) = 5760 / 16 = 360\\)\n    *   \\(N_5^*(2024) = 29760 / 32 = 930\\)\n\n4.  **Total number of non-negative solutions:**\n    Finally, we sum the number of solutions with different numbers of zero components.\n    *   Solutions with 5 positive integers: \\(N_5^* = 930\\)\n    *   Solutions with 4 positive integers (one zero): \\(\\binom{5}{1} \\times N_4^* = 5 \\times 360 = 1800\\)\n    *   Solutions with 3 positive integers (two zeros): \\(\\binom{5}{2} \\times N_3^* = 10 \\times 36 = 360\\)\n    *   Solutions with 2 or 1 positive integers are zero since \\(N_2^*=0\\) and \\(N_1^*=0\\).\n\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is the sum of these cases:\n\\(930 + 1800 + 360 = 3090\\).\n\n<<<3090>>>"
