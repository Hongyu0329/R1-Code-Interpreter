    "In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs can have several meanings. A common interpretation, especially in the context of chromatic numbers, is the **graph join**, often denoted by \\( G_1 + G_2 \\). The join of two graphs is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding all possible edges between the vertices of the two graphs.\n\nLet \\( G \\) be the graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), denoted as \\( C_n \\). Assuming the \"sum\" refers to the join operation, the graph \\( G \\) is the join of three copies of \\( C_n \\), which can be written as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n\nThe key property of the chromatic number of a join of graphs is that it is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers. For two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This is because every vertex in \\( G_1 \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( G_2 \\), so the sets of colors used to color \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\) must be disjoint.\n\nThis principle extends to the join of three graphs. Therefore, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) is:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) (where \\( n \\geq 3 \\)) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n*   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must choose \\( n \\) such that the chromatic number of \\( C_n \\) is maximized. The maximum chromatic number for a cycle is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is an odd integer.\n\nThus, for any odd \\( n \\geq 3 \\), the chromatic number of \\( G \\) will be:\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \\)\n\nIf \\( n \\) were even, the chromatic number would be \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). The maximal value is therefore 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
