    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle is determined by the densest possible arrangement of the smaller circles. This is a well-known problem in mathematics known as circle packing.\n\nThe optimal packing for 14 circles in a circle has been proven. According to the established results in the field, the ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles is a key determinant. Specifically, for 14 circles, the minimal ratio has been calculated to be approximately 1.670183528370.\n\nThis means that if the radius of each of the 14 smaller circles is one, the radius of the large circle that can contain them is 1.670183528370. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 1.670.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
