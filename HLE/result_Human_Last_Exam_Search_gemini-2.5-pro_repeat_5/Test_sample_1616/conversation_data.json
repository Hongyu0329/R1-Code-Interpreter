    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short when it is in the third-to-last syllable (or earlier) of a word. This process explains the vowel differences in pairs like *serene* /səˈriːn/ and *serenity* /səˈrɛnəti/, or *derive* /dɪˈraɪv/ and *derivative* /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word provided:\n\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel /aɪ/ (from Middle English /iː/) in the root word *derive* becomes the short vowel /ɪ/ in the four-syllable word *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel /iː/ in *serene* shortens to /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. The related word *grateful* has a long vowel /eɪ/ (from Middle English /aː/), which is shortened to /æ/ in the trisyllabic word *gratitude*.\n*   **southern**: The vowel shortening in *southern* is considered a case of trisyllabic laxing by historical linguists. Although the modern word is disyllabic, its older form, *sūtherne*, was pronounced with three syllables (/ˈsuː.ðər.nə/) at the time the rule was active, causing the long /uː/ to shorten.\n*   **pleasant**: This disyllabic word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing because the rule requires the word to have at least three syllables. The vowel shortening seen in the pair *please* /pliːz/ and *pleasant* /ˈplɛzənt/ is due to a different process, often called disyllabic laxing, or because the word was borrowed from Old French *plaisant* with an already short vowel.\n*   **shadow**: This word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing for two reasons. First, it is a disyllabic word. Second, its Old English ancestor, *sceadu*, already had a short vowel /æ/ in its first syllable. Since there was no long vowel to begin with, it could not be shortened by this rule. The vowel change in the pair *shade/shadow* is an example of a different type of laxing.\n\nWhile *pleasant*, *southern*, and *shadow* are all technically words that have not undergone trisyllabic laxing in their modern forms, *shadow* is the most distinct example as its root vowel was short from its Old English origins.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
