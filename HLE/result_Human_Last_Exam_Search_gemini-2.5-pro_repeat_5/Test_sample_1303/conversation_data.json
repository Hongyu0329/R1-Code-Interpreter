    "### Inconclusive Findings on Protein-Ligand Interactions with CHEMBL4803817\n\nEfforts to identify small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 have been unsuccessful due to the inability to retrieve the specific protein targets of this compound from publicly available resources.\n\nInitial investigations into the ChEMBL database characterized CHEMBL4803817 as a small molecule with the molecular formula C24H29N5O3. The compound's ChEMBL entry indicates bioactivity against nine distinct protein targets. However, the identities of these specific targets could not be determined through targeted searches.\n\nFurther attempts to uncover this information involved searching for compounds with high similarity to CHEMBL4803817. One such compound, CHEMBL4792551, was identified with 100% similarity. Despite this close relationship, searches for the protein targets of CHEMBL4792551 were equally unfruitful.\n\nWithout the crucial information of the protein targets for either CHEMBL4803817 or its close analog, it is not possible to identify other small molecules that would exhibit similar protein-ligand interactions. The specific data regarding which proteins these compounds interact with remains within the ChEMBL database and is not accessible through general web search queries.\n\nTherefore, a definitive list of small molecules that interact with the same protein targets as CHEMBL4803817 cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<The specific protein targets of CHEMBL4803817 and its similar compounds are not available in the public search results, which makes it impossible to identify other small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with them.>>>"
