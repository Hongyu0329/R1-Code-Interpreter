The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{2}P_{i-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2}P_{i+1}(t)$, where indices are modulo $N$.
The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ is a circulant matrix with $A_{i, i-1} = 1/2$ and $A_{i, i+1} = 1/2$ for all $i$, and all other entries being zero.
Applying $\hat{A}$ to the proposed eigenvector $v_k$ with components $(v_k)_j = e^{ijk_n}$ (using $i$ as the imaginary unit):
$(\hat{A}v_k)_j = \frac{1}{2}e^{i(j-1)k_n} + \frac{1}{2}e^{i(j+1)k_n} = e^{ijk_n}\left(\frac{e^{-ik_n} + e^{ik_n}}{2}\right) = \cos(k_n)e^{ijk_n}$.
This confirms the vectors are eigenvectors with eigenvalues $\lambda_n = \cos(k_n) = \cos(2\pi n/N)$.
The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0=1$. The second-largest eigenvalue corresponds to $n=1$ (and $n=N-1$), which is $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$.
The rate of relaxation is determined by the spectral gap, $1 - \lambda_1$.
Thus, the rate of relaxation is $1 - \cos(2\pi/N)$.
