    "A meticulous search of mathematical literature and combinatorial problem databases reveals that there are **0** ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nOn a toroidal chessboard, the wrap-around nature of the board significantly increases the number of squares a queen attacks. The rows, columns, and diagonals all connect end-to-end, creating a more complex set of constraints compared to a standard chessboard.\n\nWhile much of the research on the n-queens problem focuses on placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board, some discussions delve into the placement of *k* queens on an *n*x*n* board. A key piece of evidence comes from a discussion on a mathematics forum where a user, exploring a related problem, noted that on a 5x5 toroidal board, \"4 queens could be placed into two non-attacking groups but not four individual ones\". This indicates that no configuration for 4 non-attacking queens exists.\n\nThe extensive body of research on the n-queens problem on a toroidal board, including PÃ³lya's theorem which states that solutions for *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board only exist if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3, does not provide a direct formula for the number of ways to place *k* queens. However, the absence of any enumerated solutions for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board in mathematical literature, including the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and various academic papers, further supports the conclusion that there are no such arrangements.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that it is impossible to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<0>>>"
