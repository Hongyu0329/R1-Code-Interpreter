    "While the identity of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not readily available in easily accessible records, historical research points to comprehensive lists of the town's officials being compiled in academic publications.\n\nThe 15th century is recognized as a \"golden age\" for Bardejov, a period of significant prosperity and development when the town enjoyed the status of a free royal town. This era was marked by a well-established administrative structure, which included a town council and a judge, known as a \"richtár\".\n\nEvidence from the period, such as correspondence addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\" around 1461, confirms the existence of this office at the specific time of the inquiry.\n\nDetailed lists of Bardejov's judges and town council members throughout the Middle Ages are known to exist within specialized historical texts. Notably, the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková is cited as containing such lists in its appendices.\n\nFurthermore, another academic work, \"Średniowieczny Bardiów i jego kontakty z Małopolską\" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, is referenced as having established a definitive list of Bardejov's 15th-century judges.\n\nDespite the confirmation that these lists exist, the specific name of the judge who held office in 1461 is contained within these academic volumes and is not available in publicly accessible digital formats. Therefore, while we know a judge was in place, their name remains within the pages of these scholarly works.\n\n<<<The identity of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not definitively available in the provided search results. However, the search confirms that the town had a judge (richtár) and a town council during this period. Key academic sources, specifically \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata.
