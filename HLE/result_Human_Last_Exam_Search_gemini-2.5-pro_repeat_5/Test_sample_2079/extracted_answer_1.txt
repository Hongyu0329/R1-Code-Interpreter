The identity of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not definitively available in the provided search results. However, the search confirms that the town had a judge (richtár) and a town council during this period. Key academic sources, specifically "Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)" by Mária Fedorčáková and "Średniowieczny Bardiów i jego kontakty z Małopolską" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, are identified as containing lists of Bardejov's medieval judges. Without direct access to the appendices or specific pages of these books, the name of the judge for the year 1461 cannot be provided.
