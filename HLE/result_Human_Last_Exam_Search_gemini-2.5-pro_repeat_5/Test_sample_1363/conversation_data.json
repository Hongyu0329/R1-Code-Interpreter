    "In ballroom dancing, \"overturning\" a turn means to rotate more than the standard prescribed amount for that figure. The possibility of doing this without violating the dance's core principles varies significantly between the different dances.\n\n*   In **Slow Foxtrot** and **Quickstep**, overturning certain figures is not only possible but is a standard, named technique. For example, there is a recognized \"Overturned Reverse Spin\" in Quickstep and overturned variations of the Reverse Turn and Natural Weave in Foxtrot. These have their own proper technique.\n*   In the **Viennese Waltz** and **English Waltz**, while standard turns have a set amount of rotation, dancers often overturn or underturn them for floorcraft, such as navigating a corner. It is considered difficult but possible to overturn a Reverse Turn in the Viennese Waltz to get around a corner. The Waltz technique, with its sway and rise and fall, can be adapted to accommodate this extra rotation.\n*   The **European Tango** is distinct from the other dances. Its technique is characterized by sharp, staccato actions, a flat plane with no rise and fall, and a very specific type of body rotation without sway. The standard Reverse Turn in Tango is designed to be progressive, moving down the line of dance with a precise amount of turn (e.g., a total of 3/8 over the main steps). Attempting to overturn this figure would necessitate introducing elements that are contrary to Tango's fundamental technique, such as sway, lifting, or breaking the frame's connection. Doing so would be considered a disregard for the correct technical execution of the dance. While there are named \"overturned\" figures in Tango, like the \"Overturned Five Step\" or variations of the \"Natural Twist Turn,\" these are distinct patterns and not an overturning of the *basic Reverse Turn* itself.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a standard Reverse Turn without disregarding its foundational technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
