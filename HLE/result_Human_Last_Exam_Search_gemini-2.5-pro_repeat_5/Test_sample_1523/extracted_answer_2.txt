In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:

(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)

where:
*   ϕ(τ, **x**) is the neutral scalar field, a function of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates **x**.
*   β = 1/T is the inverse temperature.
*   D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
*   m is the mass of the scalar field.

This inner product is integrated over the Euclidean spacetime, with the imaginary time direction being compactified to the interval [0, β].
