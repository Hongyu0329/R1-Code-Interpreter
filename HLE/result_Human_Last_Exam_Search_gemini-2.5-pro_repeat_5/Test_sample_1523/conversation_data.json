    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by Z, is expressed through the functional integral formalism. This involves an integral over all possible configurations of the field that are periodic in imaginary time.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n\nZ = ∫Dϕ *exp*(-S_E[ϕ])\n\nHere, S_E[ϕ] represents the Euclidean action for the scalar field ϕ. The integration ∫Dϕ is a functional integral over all field configurations ϕ(τ, **x**) that are periodic in the imaginary time coordinate τ with a period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature.\n\nFor a free, neutral scalar field with mass m, the Euclidean action is defined as:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x [ ½(∂_τϕ)² + ½(∇ϕ)² + ½m²ϕ² ]\n\nwhere τ is the imaginary time and **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n\nThe quadratic part of this action can be written in a more general form using an operator, D_ϕ. Through integration by parts and applying the periodic boundary conditions for ϕ in the imaginary time direction (which makes the boundary terms vanish), the action can be expressed as:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the operator D_ϕ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n\nD_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n\nThe inner product of two real functions, f and g, over a given domain is generally defined as the integral of their product over that domain. In the context of the functional integral for the partition function of a scalar field, the \"functions\" are the field configurations, and the domain is the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime (with the time dimension being compactified).\n\nTherefore, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by the integral of the product of the field ϕ and the action of the operator D_ϕ on ϕ over this Euclidean spacetime:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) [D_ϕϕ(τ, **x**)]\n\nSubstituting the explicit form of the operator D_ϕ, we get:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThis expression for the inner product is directly related to the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, specifically, it is equal to twice the action: (ϕ, D_ϕ) = 2S_E[ϕ].\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere:\n*   ϕ(τ, **x**) is the neutral scalar field, a function of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates **x**.\n*   β = 1/T is the inverse temperature.\n*   D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n*   m is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nThis inner product is integrated over the Euclidean spacetime, with the imaginary time direction being compactified to the interval [0, β]."
