    "The outer hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.\n\nThe question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of this outer hull. Since the outer hull is a regular icosahedron, its surface is already composed of 20 triangles. Therefore, the minimal triangulation is the set of these faces.\n\nThe great icosahedron itself also has 20 triangular faces, but they intersect each other. The visible surface from the outside, however, forms a regular icosahedron.\n\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
