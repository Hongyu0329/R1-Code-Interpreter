    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the \"7 Deer\" notation, discovered at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala. This date corresponds to the 260-day Maya divination calendar and has been radiocarbon dated to between 300 and 200 B.C.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers, including David Stuart of the University of Texas at Austin, who found painted mural fragments within the Las Pinturas pyramid. These fragments, when pieced together, revealed the glyph for \"7 Deer\". This finding is significant as it pushes back the earliest evidence of the Maya calendar by several centuries. Prior to this discovery, the oldest known Maya calendar records dated to between 300 and 900 A.D.\n\nWhile other Mesoamerican civilizations also developed writing systems, the San Bartolo finding is currently the earliest securely dated calendrical notation. For instance, the Zapotec civilization has an artifact, Monument 3 from San José Mogote, which may contain a calendar day-name \"1 Earthquake\" and is dated to 500–600 BCE. However, the dating of this monument has been subject to scholarly debate.\n\nThe Olmec civilization is credited with one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica, with the Cascajal block dating to around 900 BCE, though this artifact does not contain a date. An Epi-Olmec stela from Chiapa de Corzo does bear a Long Count date equivalent to 36 BCE, but this is considerably later than the San Bartolo date.\n\nThe \"7 Deer\" inscription is not just a record of a date but is also considered a crucial piece of evidence for understanding the development of Mesoamerican writing, science, and religion. The 260-day calendar, of which \"7 Deer\" is a part, was a cornerstone of Mesoamerican culture and is still used by some contemporary Maya communities.\n\n<<<300-200 B.C.>>>"
