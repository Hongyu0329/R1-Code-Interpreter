    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow a systematic procedure. The core idea is to find the controllable canonical form of the dual system and then transpose the resulting matrices to obtain the observer canonical form for the original system.\n\n### 1. Define the System and its Dual\n\nThe original system is given by:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [,,]\nC = [,]\n\nThe dual system is defined by (A_d, B_d), where A_d = A^T and B_d = C^T.\nA_d = A^T = [,,]\nB_d = C^T = [,,]\n\n### 2. Analyze Observability and Determine Indices\n\nFirst, we check the observability of the original system (A, C). The observability matrix is constructed from the rows of C and their successive multiplications by A. Let the rows of C be c1 = and c2 =.\n\n- c1 =\n- c2 =\n- c1*A =\n\nThese three vectors are linearly independent, which means the system is observable and has a state dimension of n=3. We can determine the observability indices (v1, v2) by checking for linear dependencies in the sequence {c1, c2, c1*A, c2*A, ...}. We already have three independent vectors {c1, c2, c1*A}. The next vector in the sequence is c2*A =. We can see that c2*A = 1 * c2 + 1 * (c1*A). Since c2*A is linearly dependent on the preceding vectors in the sequence {c1, c2, c1A}, the observability index associated with c2 is v2=1. The index for c1 is v1=2 because c1*A was required to form a basis. The sum of the indices v1 + v2 = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the system order.\n\n### 3. Transformation to Controllable Canonical Form of the Dual System\n\nBy the principle of duality, the controllability indices (u1, u2) of the dual system (A_d, B_d) are the same as the observability indices of the original system, so (u1, u2) = (2, 1). We construct a transformation matrix `P` to convert the dual system into its controllable canonical form. This transformation is built using a specific selection of vectors from the dual system's controllability matrix.\n\nThe standard procedure involves constructing a matrix `S` from the controllability chains:\nS = [b1, A_d*b1, b2], where b1 and b2 are the columns of B_d.\nb1 =^T\nA_d*b1 =^T\nb2 =^T\n\nSo, S = [,,]. The inverse of this matrix is calculated as:\nS_inv = [[-1, 1, 1],, [1, 0, -2]].\n\nThe transformation matrix `P` is constructed from rows of `S_inv`. The specific rows are determined by the controllability indices. We take the last row corresponding to each input chain.\n- For the first input (index u1=2), we take the 2nd row of S_inv: v1_T =.\n- For the second input (index u2=1), we take the 3rd row of S_inv: v2_T = [1, 0, -2].\n\nThe transformation matrix `P` is then formed as:\nP = [[v1_T], [v1_T * A_d], [v2_T]]\nP = [,, [1, 0, -2]]\n\n### 4. Determine the New C Matrix\n\nThe controllable canonical form of the dual system has an input matrix B_c = P * B_d.\nB_c = [,, [1, 0, -2]] * [,,]\nB_c = [,,]\n\nThe observer canonical form of the original system is obtained by transposing the matrices of the controllable canonical form of the dual system. The new output matrix C_o for the original system is the transpose of the new input matrix B_c of the dual system.\n\nC_o = B_c^T\n\nTherefore, the new matrix C is:\nC_o = [,]\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
