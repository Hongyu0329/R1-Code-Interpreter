    "The problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can coexist as induced subgraphs within a single graph of 128 vertices.\n\n### Understanding the Terminology\n\n*   **Graph:** A collection of vertices and edges, where each edge connects a pair of vertices. The graph in question has n = 128 vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size *k* is also known as a complete graph, denoted K_k.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices, the induced subgraph consists of those vertices and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices within that subset in the original graph.\n*   **Clique Number (ω(G)):** The size of the largest clique in a graph G.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Relationship between Clique Sizes:** If a graph *G* contains a clique of size *k* as an induced subgraph, it means there is a set of *k* vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in that set. If we take any subset of *j* vertices (where *j* < *k*) from this *k*-vertex clique, this smaller subset will also form a clique of size *j*. This new clique of size *j* is also an induced subgraph of *G*.\n\n2.  **Set of Attainable Clique Sizes:** This observation implies that if the largest clique in a graph *G* has a size of ω(G), then the graph *G* must also contain induced subgraphs that are cliques of all sizes from 1 to ω(G). Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in *G* is {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}. The number of different clique sizes is simply ω(G).\n\n3.  **Maximizing the Number of Clique Sizes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible value of ω(G) for any graph *G* with 128 vertices.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum Clique Number:** A graph with *n* vertices can have a clique of at most size *n*. To achieve the maximum possible clique size, we can consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n5.  **The Solution:** For the complete graph K_128, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. Thus, its clique number is ω(K_128) = 128. Based on our earlier reasoning, this graph contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. For any integer *k* between 1 and 128, we can simply select any *k* vertices from K_128, and they will form a clique of size *k* as an induced subgraph.\n\nTherefore, the set of different clique sizes in K_128 is {1, 2, ..., 128}, and the number of these sizes is 128. Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique larger than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
