This case requires a phased approach prioritizing medical stabilization of the patient's diabetes, followed by acute dental trauma management, and finally, a definitive prosthetic solution. The specific procedures involve:
1.  **Immediate Phase:** Medical referral for diabetes management (HbA1c 7.5%), wound debridement of the sockets (replantation is not viable after 28 hours), systemic antibiotics, and pain control.
2.  **Healing Phase:** Monitoring of tissue healing and confirmation of improved glycemic control before proceeding with definitive treatment.
3.  **Prosthetic Phase:** Fabrication of a removable partial denture.

**Cells of Interest:**
The key cells are those involved in wound healing, whose function is impaired by uncontrolled diabetes. These include **neutrophils** and **macrophages** (impaired infection control), **fibroblasts** (poor soft tissue formation), and **osteoblasts/osteoclasts** (delayed and poor quality bone healing). The **periodontal ligament (PDL) cells** on the avulsed teeth were rendered non-viable by the prolonged extra-oral time.

**Denture Plan:**
*   **Denture Type and Material:** A **Cast Metal Removable Partial Denture** with a Cobalt-Chromium framework and acrylic teeth/saddle is recommended. This provides superior support and stability compared to temporary options. The design must accommodate the patient's **Skeletal Class III malocclusion (SNB 88Â°)**.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Rationale:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **left central incisor** and **left second premolar** will be the primary abutments, providing direct support and retention for the denture.
    *   **Indirect Retention/Stabilization:** To prevent the denture from rocking, the framework will extend to the **contralateral (right) side** of the arch, engaging teeth like the **right premolar and/or molar** for essential stability and indirect retention. This cross-arch design is critical for the long-term success of the prosthesis and the health of the supporting teeth.
