    "## The Brazza: The Largest French Ship Sunk by a U-Boat Before the 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship sunk by a German U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the motor passenger ship **Brazza**. The vessel, with a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 10,387 tons, was torpedoed by the U-37 on May 28, 1940.\n\nThe *Brazza*, owned by the Compagnie Française de Navigation à Vapeur Chargeurs Réunis, was en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca when it was attacked approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain. The ship sank in less than five minutes, resulting in the loss of 379 lives, including 79 crew members and 299 passengers.\n\nAnother significant loss for the French merchant marine during this period was the steam merchant **Bretagne**, which had a GRT of 10,108 tons. It was sunk by the U-45 on October 14, 1939. While close in size to the *Brazza*, the *Bretagne* was slightly smaller in terms of gross register tonnage.\n\nIt is important to note that gross register tonnage is a measure of a ship's internal volume, not its weight or displacement. While displacement figures for these specific merchant vessels are not readily available in historical records, GRT provides a reliable metric for comparing their relative sizes.\n\nThe only French warship confirmed to be sunk by a U-boat during this timeframe was the submarine *Doris*, which was a much smaller vessel with a submerged displacement of 765 tons. The *Doris* was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940. Larger French warships, such as the battleship *Bretagne*, were sunk by other means, in the case of the battleship, by British naval fire at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940, after the armistice.\n\n<<<Brazza>>>"
