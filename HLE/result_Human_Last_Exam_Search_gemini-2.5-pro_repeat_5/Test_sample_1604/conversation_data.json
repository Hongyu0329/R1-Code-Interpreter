    "### The Battle of Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, is the latest historically depicted battle in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\nLady Elizabeth Butler, a renowned British military painter, created a significant body of work throughout her career, capturing scenes from various British military campaigns of the 19th and early 20th centuries. To determine the latest historical battle she depicted, a chronological review of the events portrayed in her paintings is necessary.\n\nHer notable works and the historical dates of the battles they represent include:\n\n*   **\"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\"**: This painting depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which was fought on June 16, 1815, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   **\"Scotland Forever!\"**: One of her most famous works, it portrays the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   **Crimean War Paintings**: Works such as \"The Roll Call,\" \"Balaclava,\" and \"The Return from Inkerman\" depict scenes from the Crimean War, which took place between 1853 and 1856.\n*   **\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\"**: This painting captures the battle at Rorke's Drift on January 22-23, 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   **\"Floreat Etona!\"**: This work depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek on January 28, 1881, during the First Boer War.\n*   **\"Tel-el-Kebir\"**: This painting shows the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, which occurred on September 13, 1882, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   **\"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\"**: This work, completed in 1927, portrays the Retreat from Mons which took place in August 1914 during World War I.\n*   **\"The Charge of The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February, 1916\"**: This painting depicts a charge during the Senussi Campaign in Egypt in 1916.\n*   **\"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\"**: This painting illustrates the Battle of Huj, fought on November 8, 1917, during the Sinai and Palestine campaign of World War I.\n*   **\"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\"**: Completed in 1929, this was one of her last paintings and depicts a scene from World War I in Flanders. While the conflict in Flanders continued until 1918, the painting does not depict a specific, dated event that can be placed definitively later than the Battle of Huj.\n\nBased on the specific historical dates of the battles depicted, the Battle of Huj on November 8, 1917, is the latest identifiable military engagement painted by Lady Butler.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
