**H_x(x,z) = 0**
**H_z(x,z) = H_a - sign(x) * (J_c * d / D) * (w - a)**

where:
*   **`H_x`** and **`H_z`** are the components of the magnetic field in the x and z directions, respectively.
*   **`H_a`** is the applied magnetic field in the z-direction.
*   **`sign(x)`** is the sign function, which is +1 for `x > 0` and -1 for `x < 0`.
*   **`J_c`** is the critical current density of the superconductor.
*   **`d`** is the thickness of each strip.
*   **`2w`** is the width of each strip.
*   **`D`** is the stacking interval between the strips.
*   **`a`** is the position of the flux front, which is implicitly related to `H_a` by the equation provided above.
