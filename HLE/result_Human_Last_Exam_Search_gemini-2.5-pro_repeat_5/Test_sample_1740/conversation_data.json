    "To date, a total of **12** members of the let-7 family, which are encoded by 13 genes, have been identified in humans.\n\nThe let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that play crucial roles in developmental timing and tumor suppression. These members are highly conserved across different species.\n\nIn humans, the let-7 family consists of the following mature miRNAs:\n\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nSome of these mature miRNAs are encoded by more than one gene. For example, there are three genes that code for let-7a (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3) and two that code for let-7f (let-7f-1 and let-7f-2). While there are slight variations in the reported numbers across different studies, with some identifying 9 or 10 members, the most frequently cited and detailed sources point to 12 distinct let-7 coding genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
