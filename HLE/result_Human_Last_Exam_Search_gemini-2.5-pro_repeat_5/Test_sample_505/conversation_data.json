    "In two separate patches of surface code, where each patch has two holes, a maximum of 4 logical qubits can be encoded.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **Encoding Qubits with Holes:** In the surface code, a type of topological quantum error correction, logical qubits are encoded by creating topological features on a 2D lattice of physical qubits. Introducing \"holes\" or \"punctures\" into a surface code patch is a standard method to encode logical qubits.\n*   **Qubits per Patch:** For a planar surface code patch (which has a topological genus of zero), the number of logical qubits it can encode is directly related to the number of holes it contains. A single patch with two holes can encode two logical qubits. This can be understood through the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits, `g` is the genus (0 for a flat patch), and `b` is the number of distinct boundaries. A patch with two holes has three boundaries (one outer boundary and two inner boundaries for the holes), so `k = 2(0) + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n*   **Combining Patches:** The problem specifies two distinct patches of surface code. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n*   **Total Calculation:** Each of the two patches encodes 2 logical qubits. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
