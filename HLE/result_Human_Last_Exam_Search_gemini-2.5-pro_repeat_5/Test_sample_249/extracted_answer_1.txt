The minimum possible value for the diameter of the tree $G$ is given by the following piecewise function of $n$ and $m$:

Let $k = n+2-m$ be the number of internal vertices. The minimum diameter is:
- **2**, if $k=1$ (which means $m=n+1$).
- **3**, if $k=2$ (which means $m=n$).
- **4**, if $k \ge 3$ and $2m \ge n+1$.
- **$n+3-m$**, if $k \ge 3$ and $2m < n+1$.

These conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all valid inputs for $n$ and $m$ (positive integers, with $m \ge 2$ for any tree with more than 2 vertices).
