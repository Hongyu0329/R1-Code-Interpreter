    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent (Φ_k(x′)) and the membership grade of the consequent (μG_k_j(y_j)). A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nCommon t-norm operations include the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, the minimum operator is frequently used.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\n\nRule Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7\n\nIf the product t-norm were used, the result would be:\n\nRule Activation Level = Φ_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\nRule Activation Level = 0.63\n\nAssuming the most commonly used t-norm (minimum) for this calculation.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
