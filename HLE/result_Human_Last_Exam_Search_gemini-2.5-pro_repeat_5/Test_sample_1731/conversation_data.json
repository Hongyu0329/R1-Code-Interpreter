    "Using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the insights provided by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, one can determine the equilibrium properties of a system by identifying its most probable macroscopic state. These theorems formalize the idea that for a system with many independent components, the probability of observing a macroscopic state far from the average is exponentially small. The equilibrium state, therefore, corresponds to the configuration with the highest probability, which in statistical mechanics is the state with the maximum entropy.\n\nFor the Bose case of light quanta (photons), which are indistinguishable bosons, we seek the distribution of particles among energy levels that maximizes the system's entropy, subject to the physical constraints. This procedure is justified by Sanov's theorem, which connects the probability of a given distribution to its relative entropy; maximizing the physical entropy is equivalent to finding the most probable distribution.\n\nThe process to find the equilibrium values is as follows:\n\n1.  **Combinatorics of Bose-Einstein Statistics**: The number of ways (microstates, W) to distribute *nᵢ* indistinguishable photons into *gᵢ* states at energy level *εᵢ* is given by:\n    W = Πᵢ [(nᵢ + gᵢ - 1)! / (nᵢ! * (gᵢ - 1)!)]\n\n2.  **Entropy Maximization**: The entropy (S) of the system is given by Boltzmann's formula, S = k\\_B ln(W), where k\\_B is the Boltzmann constant. Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers, the entropy can be expressed as:\n    S = k\\_B Σᵢ [gᵢln(1 + nᵢ/gᵢ) + nᵢln(1 + gᵢ/nᵢ)]\n\n    To find the equilibrium distribution, this entropy is maximized under the constraint of a constant total energy, E = Σᵢ nᵢεᵢ. A crucial property of light quanta is that their number is not conserved, which means the chemical potential (μ) is zero. This maximization procedure yields the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n    ⟨nᵢ⟩ = gᵢ / [exp(εᵢ / k\\_B T) - 1]\n    where ⟨nᵢ⟩ is the average number of photons in the states at energy *εᵢ* and T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy**: The mean energy (E) of the system at equilibrium is the sum of the energies of all photons, weighted by their distribution across the energy levels. For a continuous spectrum of energy states, this sum becomes an integral over the density of states, g(ε):\n    E = ∫₀^∞ [ε * g(ε) / (exp(ε / k\\_B T) - 1)] dε\n    The specific form of the density of states g(ε) depends on the system's dimensionality and properties (e.g., for photons in a 3D box, g(ε) ∝ ε²).\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Entropy**: The equilibrium value of the entropy is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. This leads to the following expression for the entropy of a photon gas:\n    S = (E/T) + k\\_B Σᵢ gᵢln(1 - exp(-εᵢ / k\\_B T))\n\n    In its integral form for a continuous spectrum, this is:\n    S = (E/T) + k\\_B ∫₀^∞ g(ε)ln(1 - exp(-ε / k\\_B T)) dε\n\nThese expressions for the mean energy and entropy represent the equilibrium values for the Bose case of light quanta, derived from the fundamental principle, supported by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, that the equilibrium state of a macroscopic system is its most probable one.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (E):**\nE = ∫₀^∞ [ε * g(ε) / (exp(ε / k\\_B T) - 1)] dε\n\n**Entropy (S):**\nS = (E/T) + k\\_B ∫₀^∞ g(ε)ln(1 - exp(-ε / k\\_B T)) dε\n>>>"
