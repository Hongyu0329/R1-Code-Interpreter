    "To determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views, it is necessary to understand both the theorem's conditions and the nature of critical-level views.\n\n### Critical-Level Views\nIn population ethics, critical-level views state that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their welfare is above a certain positive \"critical level.\" A person's life contributes positively to the overall value of the population only if their well-being exceeds this critical level. If a person's life is worth living (i.e., has positive welfare) but falls below this critical level, adding them to the population is considered to make the outcome worse.\n\n### Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\nGustaf Arrhenius has proposed several impossibility theorems demonstrating that no single theory of population ethics can simultaneously satisfy a set of seemingly plausible conditions. The sixth theorem uses the following five conditions:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** A more equal population of the same size is better if everyone in it has higher welfare.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** Gives some priority to the worse-off, but not absolute priority.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** A large number of people at a low positive welfare level can be better than a small number of people at a very high welfare level.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding a person with negative welfare (a life not worth living) makes the population worse than adding a person with positive welfare.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** For any existing population, there is a better population that consists of the original people plus one additional person with a positive welfare level.\n\n### The Violation\nThe condition violated by critical-level views is **Weak Quality Addition**. Hereâ€™s why:\n\nThe Weak Quality Addition principle asserts that for any population, it is possible to make it better by adding at least one person with some positive level of welfare.\n\nCritical-level views directly contradict this. According to a critical-level view, if an added person's welfare is positive but *below* the critical level, the new population is judged to be worse, not better. Since critical-level theories posit a specific threshold below which positive welfare contributes negatively to the population's total value, they deny that the addition of *any* life with positive welfare can be an improvement. This is a direct violation of the Weak Quality Addition condition.\n\nThe other conditions are not necessarily violated:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, and Non-Elitism** can be compatible with critical-level views, depending on the specific formulation.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism** is generally upheld by critical-level views, which agree that adding lives with negative welfare is bad.\n\n<<<E>>>"
