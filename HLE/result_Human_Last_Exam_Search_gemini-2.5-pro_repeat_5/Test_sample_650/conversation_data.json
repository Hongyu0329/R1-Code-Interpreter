    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we analyze the number of elementary operations performed as a function of the input size `n`.\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;`: These are two assignment operations, which take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This is an integer division.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: This involves a multiplication and a subtraction.\n    *   Assuming that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers of the magnitude of `n` can be performed in constant time, this entire step takes constant time, `O(1)`. This is a standard assumption in the analysis of such algorithms unless a specific computational model (like bit complexity) is required.\n\n2.  **While Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which executes as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Initially, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. Effectively, the value of `q` is divided by `c` in each iteration.\n    *   The loop continues until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by a constant `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) until the result is 0 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`.\n    *   Specifically, the loop will run `k` times, where `c^k ≤ n < c^(k+1)`. Taking `log_c` of this inequality gives `k ≤ log_c(n) < k+1`. This means the number of iterations `k` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   **Inside the loop (Step 2.1):** The operations `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_{i} := x — qc` are a fixed number of elementary arithmetic and assignment operations. Therefore, the work done inside each iteration is constant, `O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Total Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the time complexity of the work inside the loop, plus the time for initialization.\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n    *   Total Time = `O(1) + ⌊log_c(n)⌋ × O(1)`\n    *   This simplifies to `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Simplification using Logarithm Properties:**\n    *   According to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)` for any base `b`.\n    *   If we choose `b=2`, then `log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`.\n    *   Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_2(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored.\n    *   Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of divisions, which is logarithmic with respect to `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
