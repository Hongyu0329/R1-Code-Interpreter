    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter H.\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is composed of two adjacent buildings, which are connected, and it shares an internal courtyard with the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\". An aerial view of the school complex reveals that the two main buildings of the respective institutes are parallel to each other and are connected in the middle by a smaller structure, thus creating a distinct \"H\" shape.\n\n<<<H>>>"
