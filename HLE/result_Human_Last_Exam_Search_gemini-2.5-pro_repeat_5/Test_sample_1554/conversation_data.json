    "**Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign into categories that can be understood as symptoms and signals.\n\nAjdukiewicz, known for his work in logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language, made a distinction between different types of signs. According to his analysis, one state of affairs can be an \"indication, i.e. symptom\" of another. This is distinct from a \"signal,\" which he defined as an \"artificially generated phenomenon, whose detection, in connection with the awareness of a certain convention, leads as a motive to a conclusion regarding the occurrence of another phenomenon or to a certain decision.\"\n\nIn essence, for Ajdukiewicz, a symptom (or indication) has a natural relationship with the thing it signifies, much like a falling barometer is a symptom of impending rain. A signal, on the other hand, relies on an established convention for its meaning. Both indications and signals were considered by Ajdukiewicz to fall under the more general concept of a sign. While the term \"hallmark\" is not a specific technical term in Ajdukiewicz's philosophy, it can be understood as referring to this broader category of signs which he then breaks down into these distinct types.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
