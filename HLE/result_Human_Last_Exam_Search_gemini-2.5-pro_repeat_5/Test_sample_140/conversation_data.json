    "The search results did not directly answer the question. They were about Rubik's cubes or other unrelated cube problems. However, the logical deduction I performed seems solid and self-consistent. The method of partitioning the cube and calculating the number of blocks that fit in each partition, and the fact that two different partitioning strategies yielded the same result, gives confidence in the answer.\n\nHere's the reasoning broken down:\n\n1.  **Volume-Based Upper Bound**: The volume of the large cube is 15x15x15 = 3375 cubic units. The volume of a single block is 9x1x1 = 9 cubic units. A simple division gives a theoretical maximum of 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks. However, this doesn't account for the geometric constraints of packing.\n\n2.  **Partitioning Strategy**: A common method for solving such packing problems is to partition the larger container into smaller boxes and see how many blocks fit in each. A logical way to partition the 15x15x15 cube is based on the length of the block, which is 9. We can decompose the 15-unit length into 9 + 6.\n\n    This partitions the 15x15x15 cube into eight rectangular boxes:\n    *   One 9x9x9 cube\n    *   Three 9x9x6 boxes\n    *   Three 9x6x6 boxes\n    *   One 6x6x6 cube\n\n3.  **Filling the Partitions**:\n    *   **9x9x9 cube**: This can be perfectly filled with 9x1x1 blocks. The number of blocks is (9x9x9) / 9 = 81 blocks.\n    *   **9x9x6 boxes (3 of them)**: In these boxes, the 9-unit length of the blocks can be aligned with either of the 9-unit dimensions of the box. The number of blocks in each is (9x9x6) / 9 = 54 blocks. Total for the three boxes: 3 * 54 = 162 blocks.\n    *   **9x6x6 boxes (3 of them)**: Here, the 9-unit length of the blocks must be aligned with the 9-unit dimension of the box. The number of blocks in each is (9x6x6) / 9 = 36 blocks. Total for the three boxes: 3 * 36 = 108 blocks.\n    *   **6x6x6 cube**: A 9x1x1 block cannot fit inside a 6x6x6 cube because its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the cube (6). Therefore, 0 blocks can be placed in this remaining space.\n\n4.  **Total Calculation**: Summing the blocks from each partition gives the total number of blocks that can fit:\n    81 + 162 + 108 + 0 = 351 blocks.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that it is possible to fit 351 blocks. The leftover space is a single 6x6x6 cube, which cannot be filled. This strongly suggests that 351 is the maximum number.\n\n<<<351>>>"
