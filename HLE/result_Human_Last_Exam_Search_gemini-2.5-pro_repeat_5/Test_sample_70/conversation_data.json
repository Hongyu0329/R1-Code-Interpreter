    "The linear algebraic rank of a flag, when viewed as a matrix, is determined by the number of linearly independent rows or columns in its design. The condition that the rank is maximal implies that the different colors of the flag are represented by numerical values that do not create artificial linear dependencies. For instance, if colors are represented by distinct non-zero numbers, this condition is generally met for simple geometric patterns.\n\nFirst, the rank of the flag of Denmark must be determined. The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design is composed of two fundamental row patterns: rows that are entirely red except for the white vertical bar of the cross, and rows that form the horizontal bar of the white cross. Let's represent red by the value `r` and white by `w`, where `r â‰  w` to ensure maximal rank.\n\nA row passing through the horizontal part of the cross will be a vector consisting only of the value `w`. A row passing through the red field will be a vector containing mostly `r` values, with a segment of `w` values corresponding to the vertical part of the cross.\n\nSince all rows in the horizontal white stripe are identical, they contribute only one vector to the row space. Similarly, all rows in the upper red field are identical to each other, and all rows in the lower red field are identical. Furthermore, the rows of the upper and lower red fields are themselves identical. Therefore, the row space of the Danish flag's matrix is spanned by just two distinct vectors, making its rank 2.\n\nThe task is to identify African flags with a rank of 2. This requires finding flags whose designs are based on two linearly independent patterns. Such designs typically include:\n*   Bicolors with a simple vertical or horizontal division.\n*   Trisection flags where two sections are the same color (e.g., a triband of the pattern A-B-A).\n*   Flags with a layout that combines a vertical band with two horizontal bands, resulting in two unique row or column patterns.\n\nFlags with complex symbols such as stars, emblems, triangles, or chevrons, as well as those with diagonal divisions or more than three simple, non-repeating stripes, will generally have a rank greater than 2.\n\nAfter analyzing the flags of all 54 sovereign African nations, the following flags are identified as having a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag consists of three vertical stripes, with the outer stripes being green and the inner stripe being white. This green-white-green pattern (A-B-A) results in only two unique column vectors: a green vector and a white vector. Thus, its rank is 2.\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin features a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. The rows of this flag are of two types: an upper row type containing green and yellow, and a lower row type containing green and red. These two row types are linearly independent, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a similar structure to Benin's flag. It consists of a vertical white band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of red and green. This design also produces two unique, linearly independent row patterns (white/red and white/green), resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria>>>"
