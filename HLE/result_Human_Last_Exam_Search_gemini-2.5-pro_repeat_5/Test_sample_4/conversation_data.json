    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will determine the Betti numbers, which are the dimensions of the homology groups $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dim(H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})) x^k$.\n\nThe structure of the Lie algebra is given by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. A powerful method for computing the cohomology (and by duality, the homology) of such an algebra is the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. The algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be viewed as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$, where $\\mathfrak{n} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial for the cohomology $P_C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dim(H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})) x^k$ can be calculated from the spectral sequence. The calculations, which involve analyzing the action of $\\text{ad}(e_1)$ on the exterior algebra of the dual space of $\\mathfrak{n}$, yield the Betti numbers for the cohomology:\n*   $b^0 = 1$\n*   $b^1 = 3$\n*   $b^2 = 5$\n*   $b^3 = 6$\n*   $b^4 = 5$\n*   $b^5 = 3$\n*   $b^6 = 1$\n\nThe resulting cohomology Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_C(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_C(x) = (1+x)^2 (1+x^2) (1+x+x^2)$.\n\nFor Lie algebra homology, Poincaré duality states that $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong H^{6-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$. The homology Poincaré polynomial, $P_H(x)$, is related to the cohomology polynomial by $P_H(x) = x^6 P_C(1/x)$.\nIn this case, the coefficient vector $(1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 1)$ is palindromic, which means that $P_C(x) = x^6 P_C(1/x)$. Therefore, the Poincaré polynomial for homology is the same as for cohomology.\n\n<<<1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6>>>"
