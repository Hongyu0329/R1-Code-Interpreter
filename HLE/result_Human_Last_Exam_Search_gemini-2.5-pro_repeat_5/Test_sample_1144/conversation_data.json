    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first determine the uncertainty in the momentum and the momentum of the electron separately.\n\n### Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by:\n\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the position of the electron:\nΔx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit (p)\n\nFrom the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in a specific orbit is quantized and is given by:\n\nL = n ⋅ ħ\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, the principal quantum number (n) is 1.\nL = 1 ⋅ ħ = ħ\n\nThe angular momentum is also defined as L = p ⋅ r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius (r₁) is the Bohr radius, which is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\np ⋅ r₁ = ħ\np = ħ / r₁\np = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum (Δp/p)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum:\n\nRatio = Δp / p = (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)\nRatio = r₁ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\nSubstituting the values for the Bohr radius and the uncertainty in position:\n\nRatio = (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 ⋅ 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nRatio = (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\nRatio = 5.29 / 2\nRatio = 2.645\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
