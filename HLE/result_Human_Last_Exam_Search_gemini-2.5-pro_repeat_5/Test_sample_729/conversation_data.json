    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G for some integer k. Specifically, H = <{g^k | g ∈ G}>. The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has a precise structure that determines its power subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², y⁻¹xy = x⁻¹ >\n\nTo find the number of power subgroups, we analyze the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of its elements for various integers k.\n\n1.  **When k is an odd integer:** For any odd k, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements, <(Q_128)ᵏ>, is the group Q_128 itself. This is because the map g ↦ gᵏ is a permutation of the group elements, meaning the set of k-th powers is the same as the set of original elements, which of course generates the whole group. This gives us the first power subgroup: **Q_128**.\n\n2.  **When k is an even integer:** Let k = 2j. The set of k-th powers consists of elements (xⁱ)ᵏ = xⁱᵏ and (xⁱy)ᵏ = (x³²)ʲ. The subgroup generated by these powers is <x^(gcd(k, 64))>. We examine the distinct subgroups that can be formed this way:\n    *   For k=2, we get the subgroup <x²>, a cyclic group of order 32.\n    *   For k=4, we get <x⁴>, a cyclic group of order 16.\n    *   For k=8, we get <x⁸>, a cyclic group of order 8.\n    *   For k=16, we get <x¹⁶>, a cyclic group of order 4.\n    *   For k=32, we get <x³²>, a cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   For k=64, we get <x⁶⁴>, which is the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\nThese are all the distinct power subgroups that can be generated. Counting them, we have Q_128 itself, and the six cyclic subgroups generated by the even powers of x.\n\nIn total, the distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128 are:\n*   Q_128\n*   <x²>\n*   <x⁴>\n*   <x⁸>\n*   <x¹⁶>\n*   <x³²>\n*   {1}\n\nThere are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
