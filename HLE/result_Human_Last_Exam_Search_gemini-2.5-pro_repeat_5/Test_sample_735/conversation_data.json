    "There are **11** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also known as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by the work of Michael Giudici, Sarah Hart, and Chimere Anabanti. A key result in this classification is that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nThe finite groups that have been identified to contain these sets are:\n\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆ (the symmetric group S₃), D₈, D₁₀\n*   **The Alternating group:** A₄\n\nThis classification relies on detailed case-by-case analysis of the structure of the group and the properties of the product-free sets within them. For instance, in the cyclic group of order 8, C₈, generated by an element *g*, the set {*g*, *g*⁴, *g*⁷} is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3. Similarly, the alternating group A₄, which has order 12, also contains such a set. The dihedral group D₆, of order 6, is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃ and is another example from the list.\n\nThe complete list of these groups and the specific product-free sets they contain was systematically tabulated as part of the research that proved no such groups of order greater than 24 exist.\n\n<<<11>>>"
