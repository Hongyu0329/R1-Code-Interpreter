    "The search results confirm the structure of the semidihedral group SD_2^n. Specifically, result gives the presentation `<r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>`. For the semidihedral group of size 512, the order is 2^9, so n=9. The presentation is `<r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>`.\n\nA power subgroup is a subgroup H of a group G such that H = {g^k | g ∈ G} for some integer k. I need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nMy analysis was as follows:\nLet G = SD_512. The elements of G are of the form r^i and sr^i for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\n1.  **Case 1: k is odd.**\n    *   For g = r^i, g^k = (r^i)^k = r^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1, so the set {r^(ik) | 0 ≤ i < 256} is the entire cyclic subgroup <r>.\n    *   For g = sr^i, we first find the order of such elements. (sr^i)^2 = sr^i * sr^i = s(r^i s) r^i = s(s r^-i) r^i = r^-i * r^i = 1. So, all elements of the form sr^i have order 2.\n    *   Therefore, if k is odd, (sr^i)^k = sr^i.\n    *   The set of k-th powers G^k is {r^(ik)} ∪ {sr^i} = <r> ∪ s<r> = G.\n    *   So, for any odd integer k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **Case 2: k is even.**\n    *   For g = r^i, g^k = r^(ik). The set of these elements forms the subgroup <r^k>.\n    *   For g = sr^i, since k is even, (sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^(k/2) = 1^(k/2) = 1.\n    *   The set of k-th powers G^k is <r^k> ∪ {1} = <r^k>.\n    *   We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form <r^k> where k is an even integer.\n    *   The subgroup <r^k> of the cyclic group <r> of order 256 is determined by gcd(k, 256).\n    *   Since k is even, we can write k = 2^a * m where a ≥ 1 and m is odd.\n    *   gcd(k, 256) = gcd(2^a * m, 2^8) = 2^min(a, 8).\n    *   Since a must be at least 1, the possible values for min(a, 8) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n    *   This gives 8 distinct values for the generator of the subgroup: r^2, r^4, r^8, r^16, r^32, r^64, r^128, r^256.\n    *   These correspond to 8 distinct subgroups: <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^128>, <r^256>={1}.\n\nSo, in total, we have 1 (from odd k) + 8 (from even k) = 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe logic appears sound and self-consistent. The search results did not provide a direct formula for the number of power subgroups, but they confirm the fundamental properties of the semidihedral group that the derivation is based on. The derivation seems robust.\n\nThe power subgroups are:\n1.  G (for k=1)\n2.  <r^2> (for k=2)\n3.  <r^4> (for k=4)\n4.  <r^8> (for k=8)\n5.  <r^16> (for k=16)\n6.  <r^32> (for k=32)\n7.  <r^64> (for k=64)\n8.  <r^128> (for k=128)\n9.  {1} (for k=256)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups.\n\nI am confident in my derivation. The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 2^n is n. For size 512 = 2^9, the number is 9.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n- Definition of semidihedral group SD_512: Confirmed.\n- Definition of power subgroup: Confirmed.\n- Analysis of G^k for odd k: Seems correct. G^k = G.\n- Analysis of G^k for even k: Seems correct. G^k = <r^k>.\n- Counting the number of distinct subgroups <r^k> for even k: The number of subgroups of a cyclic group <r> of order 2^8 is 9. These are of the form <r^d> where d|256. <r^d> = <r^k> if gcd(d, 256) = gcd(k, 256). For <r^d> to be a power subgroup for an even k, we need gcd(d, 256) = gcd(k, 256) for some even k. Let d=2^m. gcd(d, 256)=2^m. gcd(k, 256) must be a power of 2, say 2^j. Since k is even, j >= 1. So the subgroups <r^(2^m)> for m=1, ..., 8 are power subgroups. What about m=0, i.e., <r>? We need gcd(1, 256) = 1 = gcd(k, 256) for some even k. This is not possible as gcd(k, 256) is at least 2 for even k. So <r> is not a power subgroup generated by an even exponent. It is also not G, so it's not a power subgroup at all.\n- Total count: 1 (G itself) + 8 (proper subgroups of <r>) = 9.\n\nThe reasoning holds.\n\n<<<9>>>"
