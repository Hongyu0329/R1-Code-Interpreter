    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    The dissolution of aluminum hydroxide in water is represented by the equation:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant (K_sp) expression is:\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻:**\n    The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant (K_f) expression is:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we can use the charge balance equation for the system. The ions in solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]. Let's denote x = [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = K_sp / x³\n*   From the K_f expression: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴ = K_f (K_sp / x³) x⁴ = K_f * K_sp * x\n*   From the autoionization of water (K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴): [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = K_w / x\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the charge balance equation gives:\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_f * K_sp * x)\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for x:\n3*K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + K_f*K_sp*x⁴\n(1 + K_f*K_sp)x⁴ - K_w*x² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_f * K_sp = (1.1 x 10³¹) * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nThe equation becomes a quadratic in terms of x²:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)(x²)² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)(x²)² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for x² yields:\nx² ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total solubility S:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (K_sp / x³) + (K_f * K_sp * x)\nS = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³) + ((5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸))\nS ≈ (4.45 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS ≈ 1.775 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹>>>"
