    "Zero.\n\nThere are no historical, post-biblical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*. The characters in the epic poem are primarily biblical figures or personifications of abstract concepts.\n\nThe named characters in *Paradise Lost* include:\n\n*   **Biblical figures:** Adam, Eve, God the Father, the Son of God (Jesus), and the archangels Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel. Satan and his followers, such as Beelzebub, Moloch, and Belial, are also drawn from biblical or theological sources.\n*   **Personified concepts:** Sin and Death are presented as characters, the offspring of Satan.\n*   **Classical and pagan figures:** Milton equates some of the fallen angels with pagan deities from various ancient cultures, such as Adonis (Thammuz), Ashtaroth, and Baalim.\n\nThe only contemporary of Milton mentioned by name in the poem is the astronomer Galileo Galilei. While some biblical characters, like the archangel Raphael, are venerated as saints in certain Christian traditions, they are not \"historical saints\" in the sense of individuals who lived and were canonized after the biblical era. Scholarly analysis and character lists of *Paradise Lost* do not indicate the presence of any named historical saints.\n\n<<<0>>>"
