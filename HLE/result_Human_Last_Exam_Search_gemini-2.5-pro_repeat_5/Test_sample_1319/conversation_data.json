    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida** in Crete, with a height of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in Homer's epic poem, playing significant roles in the narrative as settings for divine intervention and observation of the Trojan War. An examination of their respective elevations reveals their standing in relation to the home of the gods, Mount Olympus, which is the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet).\n\nThe mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, apart from Mount Olympus, include:\n\n*   **Mount Ida in Crete:** This is the highest mountain on the island of Crete, standing at 2,456 meters. In mythology, it is known as the birthplace of Zeus.\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located in northeastern Greece, this mountain has a peak elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Homer mentions it in the *Iliad*, and it was a significant landmark in antiquity.\n\n*   **Mount Ida in Turkey (Kaz Dağı):** Situated near the ancient city of Troy, this mountain, from which the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War, has a height of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** The highest peak on the island of Samothrace, Mount Fengari, reaches an elevation of 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). In the *Iliad*, the god Poseidon is said to have observed the Trojan War from its summit.\n\nBy comparing their heights, Mount Ida in Crete is the tallest of these historically significant mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, second only to Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida in Crete>>>"
