    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should typically open from the button with a 2.5x raise is J5s.\n\nStandard preflop opening ranges for the button position are quite wide, as you are in the most profitable position and only have two players left to act. In a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is even greater, which can lead to opening an even wider range of hands.\n\nDifferent preflop charts may have slight variations, with some suggesting J6s as the cutoff. However, more comprehensive and modern GTO-based ranges for 100 big blind cash games often extend to opening all suited jacks down to J5s from the button. One source even provides a memorization technique for button opening ranges in a 100 big blind cash game by remembering the weakest hands in each category, listing J5s as the weakest suited jack to open.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
