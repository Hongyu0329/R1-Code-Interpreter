    "A perfluoronanocar is a hypothetical molecule where the hydrogen atoms of a nanocar are replaced by fluorine atoms. The term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules designed to resemble macroscopic vehicles, and various designs exist. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar depends on the specific structure of the nanocar in question.\n\nTo determine the number of fluorine atoms, one must first identify the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure. For instance:\n\n*   One specific model, a \"flexible Nanocar,\" has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. In a perfluorinated version of this molecule, the 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by 34 fluorine atoms.\n*   Another nanocar design has a chemical formula of C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O. A perfluorinated version of this structure would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms are substituted with fluorine. Thus, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar's structure.\n\n<<<34 or 274, depending on the nanocar structure>>>"
