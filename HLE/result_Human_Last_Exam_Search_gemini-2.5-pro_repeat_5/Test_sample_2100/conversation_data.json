    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the explorer Vitus Bering. The search for his final resting place, a question echoed in Voznesensky's poetry, concluded in 1991 when his grave was discovered.\n\nA Danish-born captain in the Russian navy, Vitus Bering led two major expeditions to explore the northern Pacific. During his second voyage in 1741, his ship was wrecked on a remote, uninhabited island off the Kamchatka Peninsula. Bering and many of his crew perished there and were buried on the island, which now bears his name, Bering Island.\n\nFor centuries, the exact location of his grave was unknown. The answer to the question \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" emerged in August 1991, when a Russian-Danish archaeological expedition unearthed the skeletal remains of Bering and five other sailors. This discovery in the early 1990s aligns with the timeframe mentioned in the question.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
