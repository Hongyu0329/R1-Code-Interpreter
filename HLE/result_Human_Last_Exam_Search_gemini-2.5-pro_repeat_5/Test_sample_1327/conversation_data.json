    "Let's analyze the sequence to find the pattern.\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\n\nFirst, let's look at the relationship between consecutive terms. We can try to express each term as a function of the previous term.\n*   11 = 2 × 2 + 7\n*   23 = 2 × 11 + 1\n*   51 = 2 × 23 + 5\n*   119 = 2 × 51 + 17\n\nThis pattern can be described by the formula: `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + k`, where `k` is a sequence of numbers.\nThe sequence of `k` starting from the second term is: 1, 5, 17.\n\nNow, let's find the pattern within the sequence of `k` (1, 5, 17).\n*   The difference between 5 and 1 is 4.\n*   The difference between 17 and 5 is 12.\n\nThe differences are 4 and 12. We can observe that the second difference (12) is 3 times the first difference (4). This suggests a geometric progression for the differences.\nThe next difference in this pattern would be 12 × 3 = 36.\n\nUsing this, we can find the next term in the sequence `k`.\n*   Next `k` = 17 + 36 = 53.\n\nFinally, we can find the missing number in the original sequence using this next value of `k`.\n*   Next term = 2 × 119 + 53\n*   Next term = 238 + 53\n*   Next term = 291\n\nThe pattern holds consistently from the third term onwards, with the first two terms acting as initial values for the recurrence relation. The next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
