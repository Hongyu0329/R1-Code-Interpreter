    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Analyze the given information\nWe are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nFrom the chain rule for mutual information, we have the identity:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\nAnd also:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n\nThis allows us to calculate $I(X;Z)$:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$, which gives $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nWe can also find the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$.\nThe values are consistent.\n\n### 2. Use the properties of W\nWe are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so $H(W|Z)=0$. This condition leads to the formation of a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$.\n\n### 3. Establish a relationship for I(X;Y|W)\nWe can express the desired quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ using the chain rule for mutual information in several ways. One useful identity is:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n### 4. Relate the terms using general identities\nLet's find another expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ to establish constraints. Using the chain rule again:\n$I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$.\n$I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nEquating these gives:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$. Therefore, $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBecause $W$ is a function of $Z$, we have $I(X;Z,W) = I(X;Z)$. Thus, $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - I(X;Z|Y,W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the sum $S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n### 5. Find the minimum value of S\nLet's find a key relationship between the terms in $S$. We can use the chain rule on $I(X; Z, W | Y)$:\n$I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)$ because $W$ is a function of $Z$.\n$I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nSo, we have the crucial identity:\n$I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for the sum $S$:\n$S = I(X;W) + (5 - I(X;W|Y)) = 5 + I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nTo minimize $S$, we must maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n### 6. Maximize the difference term\nLet's analyze the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. The Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$. Since we have the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$, we can apply a conditional version of this inequality:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n\nSo, $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) \\le 5 - I(X;W)$. Since $I(X;W) \\ge 0$, a loose upper bound for the difference is 5.\n\nHowever, let's consider the structure of the information. The information that $Z$ provides about $X$ can be split into a part that is shared with $Y$, $I(X;Y;Z)=1$, and a part that is unique to $Z$ (with respect to $Y$), $I(X;Z|Y)=5$.\n\nLet's model this with independent information \"atoms\" A, B, C with entropies $H(A)=1, H(B)=2, H(C)=5$.\n*   Let $X$ contain the information $(A,B,C)$.\n*   Let $Y$ contain the information $(A,B)$, so $I(X;Y) = H(A,B) = 3$.\n*   Let $Z$ contain the information $(A,C)$, so $I(X;Z) = H(A,C) = 6$.\nThis model satisfies all the given conditions. Now $W$ is a function of $Z \\sim (A,C)$.\n\nThe term to maximize becomes:\n$I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = I((A,B,C); f(A,C) | (A,B)) - I((A,B,C); f(A,C))$\nThis can be simplified to $H(W|A) - H(W) = -I(A;W)$.\n\nTo maximize this difference, we must minimize $I(A;W)$. The minimum value of mutual information is 0. This occurs when $W$ is independent of $A$. We can choose $W$ to be a function of $C$ alone (e.g., $W=C$), or a constant. Both are valid functions of $Z \\sim (A,C)$.\n\nIf we choose $W$ such that $I(A;W)=0$, the maximum value of the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n### 7. Calculate the final answer\nWith the maximum value of $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ being 0, we can find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + 0 = 3$.\n\nLet's check this using the other expression:\nThe minimum value of $S = 5 + (I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y))$ is $5 - 0 = 5$.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - S_{min} = 8 - 5 = 3$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The largest possible value is achieved when $W$ is constructed from the part of $Z$ that is independent of what $Y$ knows about $X$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
