    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and has a confrontation with an oncoming car is the 1985 movie *The Goonies*, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nIn the film, the teenage character Brand (played by Josh Brolin) is forced to ride a small, pink girl's bicycle. During his ride, he is antagonized by the film's secondary antagonist, Troy Perkins (played by Steve Antin), who is driving his father's convertible. In the scene, Troy pulls his car alongside Brand, grabs his arm, and then speeds up, dragging Brand and the tiny bike along before letting go and sending him flying off the road.\n\nWhile Brand doesn't pedal *directly toward* the oncoming car in a game of chicken, it is a memorable scene featuring a teenager on a pink bicycle having a dangerous encounter with a car.\n\n<<<The Goonies>>>"
