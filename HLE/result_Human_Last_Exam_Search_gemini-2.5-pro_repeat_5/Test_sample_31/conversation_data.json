    "To fully and uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present, a solver must see a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the information required to distinguish between all possible permutations of the last layer's edges and corners. While many speedcubers use a \"2-sided recognition\" method, which involves looking at the six stickers visible on two adjacent faces (e.g., the front and right faces), not all six stickers are necessary.\n\nThe key points are:\n*   **Information required:** To distinguish between all 21 cases, enough stickers must be observed to resolve any potential ambiguity. For example, some different PLL cases can have the exact same edge permutation (like the Aa and Ab perms), meaning corner stickers must be seen to tell them apart.\n*   **Sufficiency of 5 stickers:** A set of five stickers can be chosen that provides enough information to identify every case uniquely. For example, observing the two side-stickers of one corner piece and the single side-sticker of three of the four edge pieces is sufficient. This combination identifies the exact corner piece in that specific location and also determines the complete permutation of all four edges.\n*   **Insufficiency of 4 stickers:** There are pairs of PLL cases that cannot be distinguished with only four stickers. For some ambiguous cases, it is necessary to carefully observe 5 of the 6 stickers available in a two-sided view to make a correct identification, as changing any single one of those five could result in a different valid PLL case.\n\nIt is a known concept in the speedcubing community that while 2-sided recognition (viewing 6 stickers) is common practice, the minimum required is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
