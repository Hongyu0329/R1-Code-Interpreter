The final state of the system is not a single deterministic state but rather a probabilistic one, contingent on the measurement outcome of ququint A. The measurement collapses the entangled system into one of five possible states, each with a specific probability as detailed above. For example, with a probability of 3/10, the measurement will yield $|2\rangle_A$, and the system will collapse into the state $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
