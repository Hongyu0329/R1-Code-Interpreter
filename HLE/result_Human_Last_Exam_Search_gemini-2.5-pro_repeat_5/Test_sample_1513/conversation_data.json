Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, located about 1,931 to 2,075 kilometers away.\n*   **Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera:** The town of Hanga Roa is situated on the island's west coast in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes Maunga Terevaka and Rano Kau. The island itself is of volcanic origin, formed by these volcanoes, and the landscape, including the bay, is a direct result of this volcanic activity. The Rano Kau volcano features a large caldera near the town.\n*   **The bay shares the town's name:** The town is named Hanga Roa, which in the Rapa Nui language means \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\". The town sits on this bay, which serves as its main harbor.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
