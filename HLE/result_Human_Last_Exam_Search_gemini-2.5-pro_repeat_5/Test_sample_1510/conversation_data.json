    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry operations. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotational and reflectional symmetries present, ignoring any translational components. A point group of order 2 can be one of two types:\n*   **C₂ (Cyclic group of order 2):** This group contains a single 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁ (Dihedral group of order 2):** This group is equivalent to a single reflection.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2:** This group has 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections. Its point group is C₂.\n*   **pm:** This group has parallel reflection axes and no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n*   **pg:** This group only contains glide reflections with parallel axes. The linear part of a glide reflection is a reflection, so its point group is D₁.\n*   **cm:** This group contains parallel reflection axes and glide reflection axes. Its point group is D₁.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For example, the group *p1* has a point group of order 1 (C₁), while groups like *pmm* and *pmg* have a point group of order 4 (D₂).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of four wallpaper groups whose point groups have an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
