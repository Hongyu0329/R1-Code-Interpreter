    "The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. A solution does not exist for certain values of the parameter λ. These values are determined by the eigenvalues of the integral operator.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y:\n`K(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis property allows the transformation of the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations. Any solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. By substituting the kernel into the equation and defining constants `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy`, we arrive at a system of `n` linear equations for these constants.\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere:\n*   `c` is the vector of constants `[c₀, c₁, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n*   `b` is a constant vector with components `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\n*   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this equation has no solution if `det(I - λA) = 0` and the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`. The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe condition for the existence of a solution when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `A` is that the function `f(x) = 1` must be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator corresponding to the eigenvalue `1/λ`. Since the kernel `K(x, y)` is symmetric, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and the condition simplifies to `f(x)` being orthogonal to the eigenfunction `φ(x)` of the original operator.\n\nThis orthogonality condition is `∫₀¹ 1 * φ(x) dx ≠ 0`. The analysis shows that this condition is equivalent to the first component (`d₀`) of the corresponding eigenvector `d` of matrix `A` being non-zero.\n\nThrough analysis for small values of `n` (n=1, 2, 3), it has been shown that this condition holds for all eigenvalues. For example:\n*   For **n=1**, the matrix `A` is `[1]`, with eigenvalue `μ=1`. The corresponding `λ` is `1/μ = 1`.\n*   For **n=2**, the matrix `A` is `[[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`. The eigenvalues are `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`, which leads to `λ = -6 ± 4√3`. For both eigenvalues, the condition for no solution is met.\n\nTherefore, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where the entries are given by A_jk = 1/(j+n-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
