    "For a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a standard formula when the frequencies 'a' and 'b' meet certain conditions.\n\nThe given curve is (cos(9t), sin(5t)). Here, the frequencies are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nThe conditions for the standard formula for the number of self-intersections are as follows:\n1.  The frequencies 'a' and 'b' must be integers. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5 are both integers.\n2.  The frequencies 'a' and 'b' must be coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n3.  For the specific formula to be applied, we check the parity of 'a' and 'b'. Here, both a = 9 and b = 5 are odd numbers.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve where both frequencies 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nThis formula is generally applicable for Lissajous figures of the form x(t) = sin(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), or x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = cos(bt). The curve x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is also a Lissajous figure, where there is a phase difference of π/2 between the x and y components compared to a sine/sine or cosine/cosine curve. This phase difference does not alter the number of self-intersections unless it causes the curve to become degenerate by passing through the origin (0,0).\n\nTo check if the curve passes through the origin, we would need cos(9t) = 0 and sin(5t) = 0 for the same value of 't'.\n- cos(9t) = 0 implies 9t = (k + 1/2)π for some integer k.\n- sin(5t) = 0 implies 5t = mπ for some integer m.\n\nEquating the expressions for 't' gives (k + 1/2)π / 9 = mπ / 5, which simplifies to 5(2k + 1) = 18m. The left side of the equation is always odd, while the right side is always even. This equality is impossible, meaning there is no value of 't' for which both x and y are zero. Therefore, the curve does not pass through the origin.\n\nSince the curve is not degenerate, we can apply the standard formula.\n\nPlugging the values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
