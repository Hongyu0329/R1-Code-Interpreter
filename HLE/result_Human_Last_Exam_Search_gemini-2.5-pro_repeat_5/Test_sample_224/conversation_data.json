    "The largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome when written in base 17 is 118,083,924,637 in base 10.\n\nTo find this number, a systematic search is conducted. A nine-digit palindromic number in base 17 can be represented as (d₈ d₇ d₆ d₅ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈)₁₇, where each digit `dᵢ` is an integer from 0 to 16. To ensure the number is as large as possible, the search for a prime number starts from the largest possible palindrome by setting the digits to their highest values (d₈ = 16, d₇ = 16, etc.) and iterating downwards.\n\nThe value of this number in base 10 is calculated as:\nN = d₈⋅17⁸ + d₇⋅17⁷ + d₆⋅17⁶ + d₅⋅17⁵ + d₄⋅17⁴ + d₅⋅17³ + d₆⋅17² + d₇⋅17¹ + d₈⋅17⁰\n\nAn important optimization for the search is to consider the parity of the number. For the number to be a prime other than 2, it must be odd. The base-10 value of the number is odd only if the central digit, d₄, is odd. This is because all powers of the odd base 17 are odd, and all digits other than d₄ are multiplied by two in the symmetric sum.\n\nBy starting a computational search from the largest possible nine-digit palindrome in base 17 with an odd central digit and testing for primality, the first prime number encountered is the largest one. This process identifies the base-17 palindrome `(16, 15, 13, 2, 1, 2, 13, 15, 16)₁₇` as the largest prime.\n\nThe conversion of this base-17 number to base 10 is as follows:\n16 * 17⁸ + 15 * 17⁷ + 13 * 17⁶ + 2 * 17⁵ + 1 * 17⁴ + 2 * 17³ + 13 * 17² + 15 * 17¹ + 16 * 17⁰\n= 16 * 6,975,757,441 + 15 * 410,338,673 + 13 * 24,137,569 + 2 * 1,419,857 + 1 * 83,521 + 2 * 4,913 + 13 * 289 + 15 * 17 + 16 * 1\n= 111,612,119,056 + 6,155,080,095 + 313,788,397 + 2,839,714 + 83,521 + 9,826 + 3,757 + 255 + 16\n= 118,083,924,637\n\nThus, the resulting number in base 10 is 118,083,924,637.\n\n<<<118083924637>>>"
