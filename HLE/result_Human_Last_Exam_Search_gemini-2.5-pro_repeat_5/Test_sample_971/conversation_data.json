    "It is not documented in the available resources how many single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of Don Quixote with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile it is widely reported that Natalia Osipova's portrayal of Kitri was celebrated for its \"breathtaking technique\" and that she was known for \"tossing off multiple pirouettes with a laugh,\" a precise count of this specific ballet step is not available in performance reviews or articles. Descriptions of her dancing in this role often refer to her \"dizzying series of revolutions\" and impressive turns, but do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown of the Act I variation from her 2008 performances. There are mentions of her performing \"awesome triple spins\" in the wedding act, but this does not pertain to the Act I variation.\n\nVideos of Osipova's 2008 performance are available online, but a written analysis or count of the pirouettes in question is not present in the accompanying descriptions. Without a specific choreographic analysis, which is not available in the search results, it is impossible to provide an exact number.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question with the given information.>>>"
