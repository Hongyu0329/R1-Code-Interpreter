    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to understand the Galois group of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the polynomial\nThe given polynomial $p(x)$ can be factored. By grouping terms, we find:\n$p(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$p(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$p(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the factors\n**For $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\nThe roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n**For $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\nWe first check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, we see that 3 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term (3). Therefore, $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quintic polynomial is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. To determine which subgroup it is, we can analyze the number of real roots. The derivative is $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The real roots of the derivative are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$, which means $f_2(x)$ has at most three real roots. We evaluate $f_2(x)$ at several points:\n*   $f_2(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11$\n*   $f_2(-1) = -1 + 9 + 3 = 11$\n*   $f_2(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5$\n*   $f_2(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17$\nThe sign changes indicate three real roots, one in each of the intervals $(-2, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, and $(1, 2)$. Thus, $f_2(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. For an irreducible polynomial of prime degree with exactly two non-real roots, a known theorem states its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the full symmetric group. Hence, the Galois group of $f_2(x)$ is $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_2$ is the splitting field of $f_2(x)$. The degree of this extension is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K/Q\nThe splitting field of $p(x)$ is $K = K_1 K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } f_2)$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $G_1 \\times G_2 \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of the group is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}][K_2:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_1 \\cap K_2 : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\n\nWe must determine the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_2$. The subfields of $K_2$ correspond to subgroups of $S_5$. Quadratic subfields correspond to subgroups of index 2. The only proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$, which has index 2. The fixed field of $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f_2(x)$. For a polynomial $x^n+ax+b$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$. For $f_2(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. Since $-14863419 / 2$ is not a square of a rational number, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. Thus, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of this group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the degrees of normal sub-extensions\nBy the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$. We are looking for the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$ are of two types: products of normal subgroups, and \"skew\" subgroups.\nThe product normal subgroups that are proper and non-trivial are:\n1.  $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: The order is 2. The index is $240/2 = 120$.\n2.  $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: The order is 60. The index is $240/60 = 4$.\n3.  $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: The order is 120. The index is $240/120 = 2$.\n4.  $C_2 \\times A_5$: The order is $2 \\times 60 = 120$. The index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThere is also one \"skew\" normal subgroup. This subgroup arises from the non-trivial homomorphism from $S_5$ to $C_2$, given by the sign function sgn: $S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong C_2$. The graph of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup:\n5.  $H = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$. The order of this subgroup is $|S_5| = 120$. The index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible indices are $\\{120, 4, 2\\}$. These are the possible degrees for the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
