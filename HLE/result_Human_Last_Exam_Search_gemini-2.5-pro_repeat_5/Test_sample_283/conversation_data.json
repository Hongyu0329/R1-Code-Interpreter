    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication with a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth 4, we must first understand the structure of an HSS matrix and the algorithm for matrix multiplication.\n\nAn HSS matrix is represented by a set of smaller matrices called \"generators,\" which are organized according to a hierarchical tree structure. For the purpose of this problem, we will assume a perfect binary tree, which is standard for HSS representations unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe matrix multiplication algorithm, whether with a vector or another matrix, involves traversing this tree in two passes: an \"up-sweep\" from the leaves to the root, and a \"down-sweep\" from the root to the leaves. During these passes, the generator submatrices at each node of the tree are accessed and used in computations.\n\nThe primary types of generator submatrices in an HSS representation are:\n*   **D matrices:** These represent the diagonal blocks of the matrix and are located at the leaf nodes of the tree.\n*   **U and V matrices:** These are basis matrices used to compress the off-diagonal blocks. A pair of U and V matrices is associated with each node in the tree.\n*   **B matrices (or R and W translation matrices):** These matrices link the bases of child nodes to their parent node and represent the off-diagonal interactions between sibling blocks. For each pair of sibling nodes, there are two such `B` matrices.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of nodes and subsequently the number of generator submatrices for a perfect binary tree of depth 4. A perfect binary tree with a depth `d` of 4 (where the root is at level 0 and the leaves are at level 4) has:\n*   A total of **`2^(d+1) - 1`** nodes. For d=4, this is `2^5 - 1 = 31` nodes.\n*   The number of **leaf nodes** is **`2^d`**. For d=4, this is `2^4 = 16` leaf nodes.\n*   The number of **internal (non-leaf) nodes** is the total number of nodes minus the number of leaf nodes, which is `31 - 16 = 15`.\n\nWith this information, we can count the number of each type of generator submatrix:\n*   **D submatrices:** There is one `D` matrix for each leaf node. This gives us **16** `D` submatrices.\n*   **U and V submatrices:** There is one `U` matrix and one `V` matrix for every node in the tree. With 31 nodes, this results in **31** `U` submatrices and **31** `V` submatrices.\n*   **B submatrices:** These are associated with pairs of sibling nodes. In a perfect binary tree, every internal node is a parent to a pair of siblings. Since there are 15 internal nodes, there are 15 pairs of sibling nodes. For each sibling pair, there are two `B` matrices that define the interaction between them. Therefore, the number of `B` submatrices is `15 * 2 = 30`.\n\nDuring the matrix multiplication process, all of these generator submatrices are accessed. To find the total number of submatrices accessed, we sum the counts of each type:\n\nTotal submatrices = (Number of D matrices) + (Number of U matrices) + (Number of V matrices) + (Number of B matrices)\nTotal submatrices = 16 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 108\n\n<<<108>>>"
