    "Determining the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic, the *Aeneid*, requires a journey into both the real and mythological worlds, as the poem seamlessly blends both. The three longest rivers that find a place in the narrative are the Eridanus, the Araxes (modern Aras), and the Tiber.\n\n**Eridanus:** This river, mentioned in Book VI of the *Aeneid*, holds a dual identity that makes it arguably the longest. In Greek mythology, the Eridanus was a great river, sometimes associated with major real-world rivers like the Po in Italy or the Nile in Egypt. Geologists have also given the name Eridanus to a massive prehistoric river that flowed from Lapland through the area of the modern-day Baltic Sea and into the North Sea, with an estimated length of about 2,700 kilometers (approximately 1,677 miles). Given its mythological and geological vastness, the Eridanus stands as the most extensive river referenced in the epic.\n\n**Araxes (Aras) River:** The Araxes river, known today as the Aras, is mentioned in Book VIII of the *Aeneid*. This significant transboundary river of the Caucasus rises in Turkey and flows along the borders with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran before joining the Kura River. With a total length of 1,072 kilometers (666 miles), the Aras is a major real-world river that plays a part in the geography of the Aeneid's world.\n\n**Tiber River:** Central to the latter half of the *Aeneid*, the Tiber River is the third-longest river in Italy. Aeneas and his followers finally reach their destined homeland on its banks. The Tiber flows for 406 kilometers (252 miles) from the Apennine Mountains through Rome to the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its divine personification, Tiberinus, appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming he has reached his fated home.\n\nOther notable rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid* include the mythological rivers of the underworld such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, and Cocytus. While the Styx is described as circling the underworld multiple times, implying great length, and Plato even described the mythological Acheron as the second greatest river after Oceanus, they do not have defined terrestrial lengths that can be definitively compared to the real-world rivers mentioned in the poem. The actual Acheron river in Greece, with which the mythological one is associated, is only 52 kilometers long.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Eridanus, the Araxes (Aras), and the Tiber.>>>"
