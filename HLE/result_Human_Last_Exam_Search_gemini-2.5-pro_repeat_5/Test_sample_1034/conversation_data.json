    "To determine the number of integer values for the side length AC in triangle ABC such that there are two possible values for the side length AB, we must analyze the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines.\n\nGiven a triangle ABC with:\n*   `BC = S`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `AC` is the side length we are examining.\n*   `AB` is the side length for which there are two possible values.\n\nThe condition for the existence of two distinct triangles (and thus two possible lengths for side AB) is given by the inequality:\n\n`BC * sin(B) < AC < BC`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n*   `BC = S`\n*   `sin(B) = sin(30°) = 0.5`\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n`S * 0.5 < AC < S`\nor\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\nThe problem states that `S = SNYWR`. Without a defined value for SNYWR from the problem source, a common method in such puzzles is to assign numerical values to letters based on their alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...).\n\nThe alphabetical positions for the letters in SNYWR are:\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nSumming these values gives the value of S:\n`S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`\n\nNow, we substitute `S = 99` into our inequality for AC:\n`99 / 2 < AC < 99`\n`49.5 < AC < 99`\n\nWe are asked for the number of *integer* values of AC. The integers that satisfy this inequality are those greater than 49.5 and less than 99. These are the integers from 50 to 98, inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of these integers, we calculate:\nNumber of values = (Last Integer) - (First Integer) + 1\nNumber of values = 98 - 50 + 1 = 49\n\nThus, there are 49 integer values for AC for which two possible values for side length AB exist.\n\n<<<49>>>"
