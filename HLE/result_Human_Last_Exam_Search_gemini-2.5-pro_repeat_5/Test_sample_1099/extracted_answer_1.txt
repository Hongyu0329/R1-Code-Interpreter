To simulate the correlations from a general set of POVM measurements on a singlet state, the minimal resources required by a local hidden variable model are, on average: **two bits of classical communication** and **zero non-signaling PR-Boxes**.

Alternatively, if the measurements are restricted to only projective measurements, the simulation is possible with either **one bit of classical communication** or **one non-signaling PR-Box** (with no communication).
