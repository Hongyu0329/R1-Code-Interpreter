    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a humorous combination of the name of the car brand Mercedes-Benz and the chemical compound benzene. The name arises from the visual similarity between the three-pointed star logo of Mercedes-Benz and one of the ways benzene's structure is depicted.\n\nA molecule of benzene (C₆H₆) consists of a ring of six carbon atoms, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. The \"mercedesbenzene\" molecule is simply a playful name for a standard benzene ring, implying that the arrangement of double bonds within the ring resembles the famous logo.\n\nTherefore, the fictitious molecule mercedesbenzene would have 6 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<6>>>"
