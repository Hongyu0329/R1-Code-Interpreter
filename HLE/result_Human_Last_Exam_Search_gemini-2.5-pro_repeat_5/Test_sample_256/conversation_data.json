    "**The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₂ in Schoenflies notation.**\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive data compiled by Eckard Specht on the best known packings of equal circles in a circle, which is a widely referenced resource in this field. For a packing of 1135 circles, the established optimal arrangement exhibits a C₂ symmetry. This notation signifies that the arrangement has a single twofold rotational axis of symmetry.\n\n<<<C₂>>>"
