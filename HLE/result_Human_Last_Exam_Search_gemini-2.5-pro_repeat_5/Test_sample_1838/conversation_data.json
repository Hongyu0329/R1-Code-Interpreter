    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that lie on the line.\n\n### Bresenham's Line Algorithm\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient way to draw a line between two points on a grid of pixels. It uses integer arithmetic to determine the next pixel to plot, which makes it fast.\n\nHere are the steps for a line with a slope less than 1:\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Start at the first point (1,1).**\n\n4.  **Iterate and determine the next pixel:**\n    For each step in the x-direction, we evaluate the decision parameter `p`.\n    *   If `p < 0`, the next pixel is (x+1, y), and we update `p` with `p = p + 2Δy`.\n    *   If `p ≥ 0`, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), and we update `p` with `p = p + 2Δy - 2Δx`.\n\n### Generating the Pixels\n\nFollowing the algorithm, the sequence of pixels is:\n\n1.  **(1, 1)**\n2.  **(2, 1)** (Since p = -2 < 0)\n3.  **(3, 2)** (p is updated to 6, so p ≥ 0)\n4.  **(4, 2)** (p is updated to -6, so p < 0)\n5.  **(5, 3)** (p is updated to 2, so p ≥ 0)\n6.  **(6, 3)** (p is updated to -10, so p < 0)\n7.  **(7, 3)** (p is updated to -2, so p < 0)\n8.  **(8, 4)** (p is updated to 6, so p ≥ 0)\n9.  **(9, 4)** (p is updated to -6, so p < 0)\n10. **(10, 5)** (p is updated to 2, so p ≥ 0)\n11. **(11, 5)**\n\n### The Central Pixel\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe 6th pixel generated by the algorithm is **(6, 3)**.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
