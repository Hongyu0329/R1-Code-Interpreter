    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger topological system. The Chern number of this composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its individual components.\n\nThe Chern number is an additive topological invariant. This means that for a system composed of multiple subsystems, the total Chern number is the algebraic sum of the Chern numbers of each part, assuming they are of the same chirality. In this case, both insulators have a Chern number of +1.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the combined junction is calculated as:\nC_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThis principle is supported by the bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates the bulk topological invariant (the Chern number) to the number of conducting edge states at the boundary of the material. Each Chern insulator with C=1 individually hosts one chiral edge state. When joined together, the combined system will have two chiral edge states propagating along its outer boundary, corresponding to a total Chern number of 2. The negligible tunneling allows the two systems to merge into a single topological bulk, and at the internal interface between them, the edge states gap out since the difference in their Chern numbers is |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nResearch on stacking multiple layers of topological insulators has experimentally and theoretically confirmed that combining C=1 layers can create a system with a higher Chern number, such as C=2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
