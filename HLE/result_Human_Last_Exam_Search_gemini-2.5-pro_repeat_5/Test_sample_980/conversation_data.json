    "The provided sequence of numbers is: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nAn analysis of this sequence reveals that it does not follow a simple mathematical progression, such as an arithmetic or geometric sequence. The differences between consecutive terms do not show a regular pattern.\n\nHowever, a search for the numbers in the sequence suggests a strong connection to the bus line numbers of the Budapest public transportation system (BKK). Many of the numbers in the sequence, such as 111, 41, 67, 93, 62, 36, 49, 10, and 124, correspond to actual bus routes in Budapest. For instance, BKK operates bus lines with these numbers. Night buses in Budapest are numbered in the 900s, which is consistent with the range of numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe repetition of numbers (e.g., 67, 67, 67 and 124, 124, 124) and the seemingly random order suggest that this sequence is likely not a mathematical puzzle but rather a log of real-world data, such as a record of bus sightings or a person's bus journeys. A search result containing a snippet of a document with a long list of numbers, including some from the query, further supports this theory, indicating the sequence may be an extract from a larger dataset.\n\nGiven that the sequence is likely not based on a mathematical rule, predicting the \"next\" number with certainty is not possible without the original context or the complete data log. However, if a pattern must be inferred from the existing sequence, we can observe the following at the end of the sequence: `... 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`.\n\nA notable feature is the presence of pairs of identical numbers throughout the sequence (e.g., 111, 111; 62, 62; 36, 36; 49, 49). The sequence ends with a single `124` following a `36`. A plausible continuation of this pattern of pairs would be another `124` to form a pair.\n\nTherefore, based on the weak pattern of paired numbers observed in the sequence, the most logical guess for the next number is 124.\n\n<<<124>>>"
