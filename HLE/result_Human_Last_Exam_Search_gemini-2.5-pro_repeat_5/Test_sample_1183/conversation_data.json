    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is D3h.\n\nThe provided SMILES string describes a derivative of hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC). The core structure, HBC (C42H18), is a large, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon which possesses D6h symmetry. In the specified molecule, three hydrogen atoms of the HBC core are symmetrically substituted with ethynyl groups (-C≡CH).\n\nVisualizing the molecule using chemical structure generators confirms that it has a planar core with the three ethynyl groups arranged in a threefold symmetric or \"triskelion\" pattern. This specific substitution reduces the overall symmetry from D6h to D3h.\n\nThe symmetry elements that define the D3h point group for this molecule are:\n*   **One C3 principal axis of rotation:** This axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane and passes through the center of the molecule. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n*   **Three C2 axes of rotation:** These axes lie in the plane of the molecule, are perpendicular to the C3 axis, and are separated by 120°. Each C2 axis passes through the molecular center.\n*   **One horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This is the plane of the molecule itself. Since the molecule is planar, reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n*   **One S3 improper axis of rotation:** Coincident with the C3 principal axis.\n\nThe combination of these symmetry elements unequivocally assigns the molecule to the D3h point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
