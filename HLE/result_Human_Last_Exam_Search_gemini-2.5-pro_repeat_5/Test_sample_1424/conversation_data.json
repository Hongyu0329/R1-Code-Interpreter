    "## The Bare Green's Function and its Dependence on Energy Eigenvalues in the Feynman Path Integral Formalism\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀, for a non-interacting particle exhibits a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship is most transparently seen when the Green's function is expressed in energy-momentum space, where it takes the form of a propagator with poles at the energy eigenvalues of the system.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, describes the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another without any interactions. In the path integral formalism, this is calculated by summing over all possible paths between the initial and final points, with each path weighted by a phase factor determined by the classical action of the free particle.\n\nThe time-ordered two-point Green's function for a non-interacting particle is defined as:\n$G_0(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \\langle 0 | T[\\hat{\\psi}(x_f, t_f) \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x_i, t_i)] | 0 \\rangle$\n\nThis vacuum expectation value can be expressed as a path integral over all field configurations. For a non-interacting system, this integral can be performed, and it is equivalent to the quantum mechanical propagator.\n\nThe propagator, K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i), which gives the amplitude for a particle to travel from (x_i, t_i) to (x_f, t_f), can be represented through a spectral decomposition by inserting a complete set of energy eigenstates, |k⟩, of the free particle Hamiltonian, H₀, with corresponding energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ (where H₀|k⟩ = ϵₖ|k⟩):\n\n$K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \\langle x_f | e^{-iH_0(t_f - t_i)} | x_i \\rangle = \\sum_k \\langle x_f | k \\rangle \\langle k | e^{-iH_0(t_f - t_i)} | x_i \\rangle$\n$K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \\sum_k \\psi_k(x_f) \\psi_k^*(x_i) e^{-i\\epsilon_k(t_f - t_i)}$\n\nHere, ψₖ(x) are the single-particle wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates. This expression explicitly shows how the propagator in real-time depends on the sum over all energy eigenvalues, each weighted by an oscillatory phase factor.\n\nTo make the functional dependence even clearer, it is standard to perform a Fourier transform of the Green's function with respect to the time difference (t = t_f - t_i) and the spatial coordinates to move into energy-momentum space. The Green's function in terms of energy (E) and momentum (k) is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, E) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt e^{iEt} G_0(k, t)$\n\nSubstituting the spectral representation into this Fourier transform yields the central result for the bare Green's function:\n\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nwhere η is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures the correct causal structure (the \"iϵ prescription\"). A similar expression can be derived for the imaginary-time Green's function used in many-body theory, where the denominator becomes $i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k$, with ωn being the Matsubara frequencies.\n\nFrom this final expression, the functional dependence is clear: the bare Green's function, G₀, is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable E and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. It is a function that has simple poles in the complex energy plane located precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This relationship is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, as it directly links the propagation of free particles to their energy spectrum.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ that is most clearly expressed in energy-momentum space.
