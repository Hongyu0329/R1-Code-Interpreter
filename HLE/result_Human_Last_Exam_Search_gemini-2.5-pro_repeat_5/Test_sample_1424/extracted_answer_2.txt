In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ that is most clearly expressed in energy-momentum space. The relationship is given by:

$G_0(k, E) = \frac{1}{E - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$

This shows that G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy E and the energy eigenvalue ϵₖ, with a simple pole at each single-particle energy.
