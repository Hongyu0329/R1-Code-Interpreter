    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a trans-disubstituted cyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The use of a strong, bulky base with an alkyl halide favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry and Conformation**: For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon must be in an anti-periplanar (or anti-diaxial) arrangement. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. To minimize steric strain, the bulky methyl group will preferentially occupy an equatorial position in the chair conformation. This forces the bromine atom into an axial position.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev)**: With the bromine in an axial position, there are two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) with axial hydrogens that are anti-periplanar to the bromine.\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen from C2 would lead to the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen from C6 would lead to the less substituted alkene, 3-methylcyclohexene (the Hofmann product).\n*   **Role of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, sterically hindered base. Due to its size, it preferentially attacks the less sterically hindered proton. The axial hydrogen on C6 is more accessible than the axial hydrogen on C2, which is closer to the equatorial methyl group. Therefore, the bulky base will preferentially remove the proton from C6.\n\nThis preference for the removal of the less hindered proton leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene as the major product. Thus, 3-methylcyclohexene is the principal product of the reaction.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
