    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method traditionally emphasizes maintaining a square and stable torso and hips, while the Balanchine style often encourages a more dynamic use of the body, which includes allowing the hip to open.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, the cambré derrière is executed with a strong sense of lifting up through the spine and bending from the upper back, while keeping the hips aligned and square to the front. The focus is on creating a beautiful, controlled curve without displacing the lower body.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, extended lines. This is often achieved by allowing for more freedom in the hips. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style is the use of an open hip, particularly in arabesques, to give the illusion of a higher leg line. This principle of a more mobile and less rigid hip alignment extends to other movements as well, including the cambré derrière, where a subtle \"swaying\" of the hips might be used to achieve a more dynamic and visually striking position.\n\nWhile there are also differences in arm and head placement, the fundamental approach to the hips—squared and stable in Vaganova versus potentially open and dynamic in Balanchine—is a significant distinguishing factor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
