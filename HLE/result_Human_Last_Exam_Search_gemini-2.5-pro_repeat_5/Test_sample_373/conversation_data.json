    "In a barbell graph with 10 nodes, the nodes are divided into two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each. A single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge, connects these two cliques.\n\nTo find the probability of sampling this bottleneck edge in uniform gossiping, we first need to calculate the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n1.  **Edges within each clique**: A complete graph with 'n' nodes has n * (n-1) / 2 edges. For the 5-node cliques in our barbell graph, the number of edges in each is:\n    5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n\n2.  **Total edges**: Since there are two such cliques, the total number of edges within the cliques is 10 + 10 = 20. Adding the single bottleneck edge that connects the two cliques, the total number of edges in the graph is 21.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, each edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected. Therefore, the probability of sampling any specific edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is:\nProbability = 1 / (Total Number of Edges) = 1/21.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
