    "Let the first cube, C₁, be represented by the set of points (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1). The length of the main diagonal is |**d**| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, C₂, is shifted by a distance of 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first cube. This corresponds to a translation by a vector **T** that has a magnitude of 1/2 and is in the direction of the main diagonal.\n\nFirst, we find the unit vector **u** in the direction of the main diagonal:\n**u** = **d** / |**d**| = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3)\n\nNext, we determine the translation vector **T** by multiplying the unit vector by the shift magnitude:\n**T** = (1/2) * **u** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))\n\nThe second cube, C₂, is the translation of C₁ by the vector **T**. Therefore, the coordinates (x', y', z') of any point in C₂ can be described by:\nx' = x + 1/(2√3)\ny' = y + 1/(2√3)\nz' = z + 1/(2√3)\nwhere (x, y, z) is a point in C₁.\n\nThis means C₂ is defined by the inequalities:\n1/(2√3) ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n1/(2√3) ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n1/(2√3) ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region where the inequalities for both C₁ and C₂ are satisfied. We find the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate:\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] is [1/(2√3), 1].\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] is [1/(2√3), 1].\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] is [1/(2√3), 1].\n\nThe intersection volume is a smaller cube with a side length, `s`, equal to the length of these intervals:\ns = 1 - 1/(2√3)\n\nThe volume of the intersection is s³:\nVolume = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\nTo simplify this expression:\nVolume = ( (2√3 - 1) / (2√3) )³\nVolume = (2√3 - 1)³ / (2√3)³\nVolume = ( (2√3)³ - 3(2√3)²(1) + 3(2√3)(1)² - 1³ ) / (8 * 3√3)\nVolume = ( 24√3 - 3(12) + 6√3 - 1 ) / (24√3)\nVolume = ( 30√3 - 36 - 1 ) / (24√3)\nVolume = (30√3 - 37) / (24√3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can write this as:\nVolume = 30√3 / (24√3) - 37 / (24√3)\nVolume = 5/4 - 37√3 / (24 * 3)\nVolume = 5/4 - 37√3 / 72\n\nThe volume of the intersection is 5/4 - (37√3)/72.\n\n<<<5/4 - (37*sqrt(3))/72>>>"
