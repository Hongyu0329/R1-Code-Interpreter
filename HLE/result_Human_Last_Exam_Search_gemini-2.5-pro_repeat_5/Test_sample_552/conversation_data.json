    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nAn examination of the paper reveals very few citations overall. The primary citation is to one of his own previous works. Historical accounts of the paper discuss its theoretical basis in the kinetic theory of heat and its profound impact on proving the existence of atoms, but they do not mention any lectures being cited as a direct source for his ideas. Einstein himself noted in the paper that his knowledge of the experimental work on Brownian motion was limited at the time of writing.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
