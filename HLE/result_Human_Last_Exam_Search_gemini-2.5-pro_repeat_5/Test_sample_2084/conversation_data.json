    "The provided SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` is not valid. However, the reaction conditions—a solution of 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water—strongly suggest an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a ketal. Ketals hydrolyze in acidic aqueous solutions to yield a ketone (or aldehyde) and a diol.\n\nBased on the fragments in the invalid SMILES string (`CC` for a methyl group, `C1=CC=CC=C1` for a phenyl group, and a bicyclic ether structure suggested by `12COC`), a plausible starting material is the ketal formed from acetophenone and isosorbide.\n\nThe hydrolysis of this ketal yields two products:\n1.  **Acetophenone**: The ketone, with the chemical formula C₈H₈O. Its molar mass is approximately 120.15 g/mol.\n2.  **Isosorbide**: The diol, with the chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₄. It is a bicyclic compound derived from D-glucose. Its molar mass is 146.14 g/mol.\n\nComparing the molar masses, isosorbide has the higher molar mass.\n\n<<<O[C@H]1CO[C@H]2[C@H]1OC[C@@H]2O>>>"
