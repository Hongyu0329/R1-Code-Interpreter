    "There are 1,582 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. This result is based on the work of Mark Watkins, who completed the classification of imaginary quadratic fields for all class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A046125 lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number n. For n=48, the value is 1,582.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number is a classic problem in number theory, known as the Gauss class number problem. While it is known that for any given class number there are only a finite number of such fields, explicitly computing this number can be a significant challenge. The complete list for class number 48 was determined as part of a larger project to solve the problem for all class numbers up to 100.\n\n<<<1582>>>"
