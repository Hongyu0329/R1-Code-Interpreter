    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A, we can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe matrix is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\(\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\)\nis calculated as \\( a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\nSubstituting the values from matrix A:\n<ul>\n    <li>a = 2, b = -1, c = -1</li>\n    <li>d = -1, e = 2, f = -1</li>\n    <li>g = -1, h = -1, i = 2</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\ndet(A) = 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1)((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1)((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\ndet(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the entries in each row is zero (2 - 1 - 1 = 0). This implies that the vector \\(^T\\) is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. If a matrix has an eigenvalue of 0, its determinant is 0.\n\nThe information regarding the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is extraneous to the explicit request of computing the determinant of the provided matrix. The search results discuss the Markov quiver in the context of cluster algebras and its relation to the Markov equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz. The provided matrix A is related to this topic, but the question is self-contained as it gives the explicit matrix for which the determinant must be calculated.\n\n<<<0>>>"
