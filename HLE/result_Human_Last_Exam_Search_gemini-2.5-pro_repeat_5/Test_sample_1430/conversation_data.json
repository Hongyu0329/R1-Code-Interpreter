    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10.\n\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus `g=3`, and let X be its 15th symmetric power, X = Sym^15(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted ρ(X), is determined by the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety of the curve C, denoted J(C).\n\nSince the degree of the symmetric power `d=15` is greater than or equal to the genus `g=3`, the variety X is a projective bundle over the Jacobian J(C). Specifically, X is a P^12-bundle over J(C). This structure leads to a direct relationship between the ranks of their Néron-Severi groups:\n\nρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1\n\nTherefore, finding the smallest and largest possible ranks of NS(X) is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum of ρ(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"generic\" genus 3 curve. A generic curve is one whose Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is the ring of integers **Z**. In this case, the Néron-Severi group of J(C) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1. This is the minimum possible rank for the Jacobian of a curve of any genus greater than zero.\n\nThus, the minimum rank for J(C) is:\nmin ρ(J(C)) = 1\n\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for X:\nSmallest ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension `g` is `g^2`. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the dimension is `g=3`, so the theoretical maximum rank is 3^2 = 9. This maximum is achieved when the Jacobian has complex multiplication (CM) and is isogenous to a product of CM elliptic curves.\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum rank is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y² = x³ - x, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers **Z**[i]. For such a product of three isogenous CM elliptic curves, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is indeed 9.\n\nThus, the maximum rank for J(C) is:\nmax ρ(J(C)) = 9\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for X:\nLargest ρ(X) = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nIn conclusion, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can be any integer value for which a corresponding curve exists, with the range of possible ranks bounded by 2 and 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
