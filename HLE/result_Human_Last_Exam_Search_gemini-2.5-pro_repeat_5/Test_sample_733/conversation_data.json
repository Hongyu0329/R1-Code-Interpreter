    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nA non-empty subset `S` of a finite group `G` is called a product-free set if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. Such a set is called maximal by inclusion (or a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not properly contained in any larger product-free set within the group `G`.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. A key result of their work is that for a maximal product-free set `S` in a group `G`, the subgroup `H = <S>` generated by `S` is a normal subgroup of `G`. Furthermore, the quotient group `G/H` must be either the trivial group (meaning `G = H`) or an elementary abelian 2-group (a direct product of copies of the cyclic group of order 2).\n\nThe structure of the possible subgroups `H = <S>` is finite and has been determined. However, since `G/H` can be an elementary abelian 2-group of any rank, and for at least some cases of `H`, it is possible to construct a valid group `G` where `S` remains a maximal product-free set, this leads to an infinite number of such finite groups `G`.\n\nFor instance, one of the possible structures for the subgroup `H=<S>` is the cyclic group of order 5, `C5`. Groups `G` can then be formed as extensions of `C5` by an elementary abelian 2-group. While the maximality condition imposes restrictions on these extensions, it does not limit the number of possibilities to a finite set.\n\nTherefore, while the structure of these groups is well-defined, there is no single finite count of them.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
