    "To determine the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = b\\sin(t)$\nwith the condition that $b=1$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $b=5$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\n\nLet's analyze the curve in two parts:\n\n**Part 1:  $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, $b=1$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = \\sin(t)$\nThis represents the upper half of a unit circle.\n*   The minimum value of $x$ is $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   The maximum value of $x$ is $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n*   The minimum value of $y$ is $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n*   The maximum value of $y$ is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\nSo, for this part of the curve, the x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n**Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, $b=5$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = 5\\sin(t)$\nThis represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   The minimum value of $y$ is $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$.\n*   The maximum value of $y$ is $5\\sin(\\pi) = 5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part of the curve, the x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from -5 to 0.\n\n**Overall Dimensions of the Figure**\nTo find the full extent of the figure, we combine the ranges from both parts:\n*   **Overall x-range:** $[-1, 1] \\cup [-1, 1] = [-1, 1]$.\n    The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Overall y-range:** $ \\cup [-5, 0] = [-5, 1]$.\n    The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Smallest Outcircling Square**\nThe smallest square that can outcircle (or circumscribe) the figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height.\nSide length of the square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square with a side length of 6 is:\nArea = side * side = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
