    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it varies for each chemical element. To determine the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule with this basis set, one must calculate the number for each atom and then sum them. The notation \"6-311G**\" can be broken down to understand this calculation. This is also commonly denoted as 6-311G(d,p).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the notation:\n*   **6-**: The core orbitals are described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **-311**: The valence orbitals are split into three contracted functions. The first is a combination of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are each single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\*** (or **(d,p)**): These represent polarization functions, which allow for a more accurate description of chemical bonds.\n    *   The first asterisk (d) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy atoms (any atom other than hydrogen). In most modern quantum chemistry programs, this consists of 5 d-functions, each being a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   The second asterisk (p) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This consists of 3 p-functions (px, py, pz), each represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n\nHere are the calculations for a few example atoms:\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   It has no core orbitals, only a 1s valence orbital.\n*   The **311G** part means its single valence orbital is described by 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   The second asterisk (**p**) adds a set of three p-functions, each being a single primitive, for a total of 3 additional primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen: 5 + 3 = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom (and other first-row elements like N and O):**\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** For both the 2s and the three 2p orbitals, the description is the same. Each is represented by a set of contracted and primitive functions. The s and p valence shells are described by a combination of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians. So for the valence s and p orbitals, we have (3+1+1) for the s-shell and (3+1+1) for the p-shell. This leads to a total of 10 primitives for the valence shell. However, in Pople-style basis sets, the exponents for s and p valence shells are shared to save computational time. Thus, there are 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 sets of primitive exponents that are used for both the s and p valence functions.\n*   Let's clarify the valence calculation: The valence shell (2s and 2p) is triple-zeta. The inner part is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the outer two parts are single primitives each. These are applied to both the s and p functions, but they share exponents. So, we have 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives for the SP shell.\n*   To be precise: there is a 1s core orbital, and for the valence shell, there are 2s and 2p orbitals.\n    *   Core 1s: 6 primitives.\n    *   Valence 2sp: This is split into three parts. The first part is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the next two are single primitives. This applies to both the 2s and 2p orbitals, and they share exponents. So, this accounts for 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   So far: 6 (core) + 5 (valence sp) = 11 primitives.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\* or d):** A set of five d-type functions is added, each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds 5 more primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Carbon: 6 (core) + 5 (valence) + 5 (polarization) = 16 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nTo get the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you would sum the count for each atom. For example, for methane (CHâ‚„), it would be 16 (for Carbon) + 4 * 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 48 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 8 for a hydrogen atom and 16 for a first-row heavy atom like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen.>>>"
