Within the framework of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) using Gaussian-based paradigms, the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable `x` and a secondary input variable `u` is defined by an Upper Membership Function (UMF) and a Lower Membership Function (LMF), which together form an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set (IT2 FS). The formulation is as follows:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
`$$\overline{\mu}_{A(x)}(u) = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{u - m(x)}{\overline{\sigma}_u}\right)^2\right]$$`

**Lower Membership Function (LMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
`$$\underline{\mu}_{A(x)}(u) = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{u - m(x)}{\underline{\sigma}_u}\right)^2\right]$$`

Where:
-   `x` is the fixed value of the primary input variable.
-   `u` is the secondary variable, with `u \in [0, 1]`.
-   `m(x)` represents the center of the Gaussian functions, which is dependent on the primary input `x`.
-   `\(\overline{\sigma}_u\)` and `\(\underline{\sigma}_u\)` are the standard deviations that define the upper and lower boundaries of the uncertainty associated with the secondary variable `u`, respectively.
