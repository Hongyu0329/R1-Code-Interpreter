    "To determine the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that form the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient way to draw lines on a grid of pixels. It uses integer arithmetic to determine which pixels to turn on to approximate a straight line.\n\nFor a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), we first calculate the differences in the x and y coordinates:\ndx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\ndy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nSince dx > dy, we will iterate along the x-axis and decide for each x-coordinate whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\nThe steps of the algorithm will produce the following sequence of pixels:\n(1, 1)\n(2, 2)\n(3, 2)\n(4, 3)\n(5, 3)\n(6, 3)\n(7, 4)\n(8, 4)\n(9, 5)\n(10, 5)\n(11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels that make up the line. Since there is an odd number of pixels, the central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe 6th pixel is (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
