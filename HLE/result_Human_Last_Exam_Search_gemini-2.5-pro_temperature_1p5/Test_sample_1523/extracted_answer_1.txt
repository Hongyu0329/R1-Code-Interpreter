In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of ϕ multiplied by the action of the operator D on ϕ over Euclidean spacetime. Specifically, for a scalar field ϕ with mass m, the operator D is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space, D = -∂_μ^2 + m^2, where ∂_μ^2 is the Euclidean Laplacian (∂_τ^2 + ∇^2). The inner product is defined as:

(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d^(d+1)x_E ϕ(x_E) (-∂_μ^2 + m^2) ϕ(x_E)

Here, the integral is over d spatial dimensions and one periodic imaginary time dimension (from 0 to β = 1/T). Integration by parts is often used to write this as ∫ d^(d+1)x_E [ (∂_μϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ], which represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field.
