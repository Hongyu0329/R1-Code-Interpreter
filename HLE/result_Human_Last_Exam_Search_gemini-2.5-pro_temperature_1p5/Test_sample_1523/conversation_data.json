    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed through a functional integral. The general form involves the exponential of the Euclidean action, `S_E`. For a free, neutral scalar field, or for the quadratic part of an interacting theory, the action is quadratic in the fields. This quadratic part can be expressed as an inner product.\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` at a finite temperature is given by:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nHere:\n*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field in Euclidean spacetime.\n*   `τ = it` is the imaginary time, which is periodic with period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature. The integration over `τ` is from 0 to `β`.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   `D` is the differential operator `D = -∂_E² + m² = - (∂_τ² + ∇²) + m²`, where `∂_E²` is the Euclidean Laplacian.\n\nThe partition function `Z` is given by the functional integral:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ e^(-½(ϕ,D_ϕ) - S_int[ϕ])\n\nwhere `S_int[ϕ]` represents the interaction terms, which are of higher order in `ϕ`. The term `½(ϕ, D_ϕ)` constitutes the Euclidean action for the free scalar field. This inner product represents the kinetic and mass terms of the field in Euclidean spacetime.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of ϕ multiplied by the action of the operator D on ϕ over Euclidean spacetime. Specifically, for a scalar field ϕ with mass m, the operator D is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space, D = -∂_μ^2 + m^2, where ∂_μ^2 is the Euclidean Laplacian (∂_τ^2 + ∇^2). The inner product is defined as:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d^(d+1)x_E ϕ(x_E) (-∂_μ^2 + m^2) ϕ(x_E)\n\nHere, the integral is over d spatial dimensions and one periodic imaginary time dimension (from 0 to β = 1/T). Integration by parts is often used to write this as ∫ d^(d+1)x_E [ (∂_μϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ], which represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field.>>>"
