    "The search results confirm that the great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n\nCritically, the search results state that the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.\n\nThe \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron is its convex hull. Triangulating this outer-hull means dividing its surface into triangles. Since the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, its surface is already composed of 20 equilateral triangles. Therefore, the minimal triangulation is the set of its own faces.\n\nThe question asks for the number of visible triangles from the outside. Since the outer hull (the regular icosahedron) is a convex shape, all of its 20 faces are visible from the outside.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which are visible from the outside, is 20.\n\nThe convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, and these faces are all equilateral triangles. Since the icosahedron is a convex polyhedron, all of its 20 triangular faces are visible from the outside. The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull, which is simply the number of faces of the convex hull if those faces are already triangles. As the faces of the regular icosahedron are indeed triangles, no further division is necessary. Thus, the minimal number of triangles is 20.\n\nFinal check:\n- What is the outer-hull of the great icosahedron? It is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron.\n- What is the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this shape? The shape's faces are already triangles, so the number of faces is the answer.\n- How many faces does a regular icosahedron have? 20.\n- Are these faces visible from the outside? Yes, because the shape is convex.\n\nThe answer is definitively 20.\nThe outer hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 triangular faces. The process of \"triangulating\" a surface means to divide it into a set of triangles. Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already made up of triangles, the minimal triangulation is simply the set of its own faces. Because the regular icosahedron is a convex shape, all of its 20 faces are visible from the outside. Therefore, the minimal number of visible triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
