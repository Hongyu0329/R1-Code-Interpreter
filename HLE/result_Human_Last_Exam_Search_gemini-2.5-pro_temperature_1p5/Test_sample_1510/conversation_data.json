    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotation and reflection symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. A point group of order 2 has two symmetry operations: the identity and one other operation which is either a rotation of 180 degrees (a 2-fold rotation) or a reflection.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups of order 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n*   **C₂:** This group contains the identity and a 2-fold (180°) rotation.\n*   **D₁:** This group contains the identity and a reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified by their point groups. The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2:** This group has a point group of C₂. It contains 2-fold rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm:** The point group for pm is D₁. This group contains reflections in parallel axes.\n*   **pg:** The point group for pg is D₁. It features glide reflections.\n*   **cm:** The point group for cm is D₁. This group includes both reflections and glide reflections.\n\nTherefore, there are four wallpaper groups (p2, pm, pg, and cm) that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
