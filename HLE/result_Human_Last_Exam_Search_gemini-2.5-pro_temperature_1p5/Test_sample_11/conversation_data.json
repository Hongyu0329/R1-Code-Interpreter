    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This legislation, enacted in 1973, marked a significant shift in Israeli jurisprudence.\n\nPrior to this law, Israeli contract law was largely based on the English common law tradition, which did not include a general, explicit duty to act in good faith. The Contracts (General Part) Law introduced this principle, most notably in two key sections:\n*   **Section 12**, which mandates that parties in a negotiation for a contract must act in a customary manner and in good faith.\n*   **Section 39**, which requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract must be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n\nThis introduction of \"good faith\" (known in Hebrew as *tom lev*) was a far-reaching innovation, influenced by continental legal systems, particularly German law, and it has become a central and \"royal principle\" in the Israeli legal system. Its application extends beyond contract law to other legal acts and obligations.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
