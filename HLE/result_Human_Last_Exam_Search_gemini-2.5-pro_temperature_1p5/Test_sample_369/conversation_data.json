    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must identify the sequence of dactyls (long, short, short) and spondees (long, long) across the six feet of the line. This requires an analysis of vowel quantities, elision, and syllabification.\n\nThe line is from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* (Book 4, line 734).\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Elision:** We must first identify where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\".\n    *   `verum ubi`: The \"-um\" of `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis` (h is ignored in scansion).\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Foot Analysis:** The line is scanned as follows:\n    `vē-r(um) u-b(i)e- | quī āt-qu(e) | hōm-nīs | cā-sū | cōn-ve-nit | ī-māgō`\n\n    *   **Foot 1 (Dactyl):** `vē-r(um) u-b(i)e-`\n        *   `vē-`: The first syllable is long by nature.\n        *   `u-`: The `u` from `ubi` is short.\n        *   `-be-`: This syllable is formed from the `b` of `ubi` and the `e` of `equi` (both eliding). The `e` is short.\n        *   Result: Long-short-short (– u u) = **D**\n\n    *   **Foot 2 (Spondee):** `quī āt-qu(e)`\n        *   `quī-`: For the meter to work, the `i` in `equi` must be treated as long. In the second declension genitive singular, this vowel is sometimes long.\n        *   `āt-`: The syllable `at` from `atque` is long by position, as the vowel `a` is followed by two consonants (`tq`). The final `-que` is elided with the next word.\n        *   Result: Long-long (– –) = **S**\n\n    *   **Foot 3 (Spondee):** `hōm-nīs`\n        *   `hōm-`: The first syllable of `hominis` is long by position because the vowel `o` is followed by two consonants (`m` and `n`).\n        *   `nīs`: The final syllable of `hominis` is long by position as it is followed by the `c` in the next word, `casu`.\n        *   Result: Long-long (– –) = **S**\n\n    *   **Foot 4 (Spondee):** `cā-sū`\n        *   `cā-`: The `a` in `casus` is long by nature.\n        *   `-sū`: As the ablative singular of a fourth-declension noun, the final `-u` is long.\n        *   Result: Long-long (– –) = **S**\n\n    *   **Foot 5 (Dactyl):** `cōn-ve-nit`\n        *   `cōn-`: This syllable is long by position, as the vowel `o` is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`).\n        *   `-ve-`: This syllable is short.\n        *   `-nit`: This syllable is short.\n        *   Result: Long-short-short (– u u) = **D**\n\n    *   **Foot 6 (Spondee):** `ī-māgō`\n        *   `ī-`: For the meter to hold, the initial `i` of `imago` must be scanned as long.\n        *   `māgō`: The final syllable is long. The anceps (final syllable) of a hexameter line is always considered long.\n        *   Result: Long-long (– –) = **S**\n\nThe resulting scansion for the line is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
