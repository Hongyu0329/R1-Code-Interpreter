    "Based on a comprehensive review of William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe novel's narrative is centered on the conflict between the Germanic Goths of the Mark and an invading Roman army. The story is told from the perspective of the Goths, focusing on their defense of their homeland and their communal way of life. While the Romans are the antagonists and there are descriptions of their character and military, the book does not contain a scene where a Gothic character travels to a Roman city and offers a description of Roman religious beliefs or founding myths.\n\nLiterary analysis and plot summaries of *The House of the Wolfings* consistently highlight the contrast between the two cultures but do not mention any such visit or specific discussion of Roman mythology by the characters. The primary themes revolve around heroism, community, and the clash of a tribal society with an empire, rather than a detailed comparative study of their religions based on firsthand observation.\n\n<<<There is no character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices with an allusion to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
