    "The first step of determining the Old English word for \"sister\" and its etymology has been successfully completed. The search results indicate that the Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\". Its etymology traces back to the Proto-Germanic \"*swestr-\" and the Proto-Indo-European \"*swésōr\". The modern English word \"sister\" is a continuation of this Old English word, but its current form with an \"i\" is noted to be due to influence from the Old Norse cognate \"systir\". This provides a clear starting point for the rest of the investigation. The next steps will need to delve into the hypothetical scenario of no Norse contact.The research so far has established that the Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster,\" and that the modern form \"sister\" is influenced by the Old Norse \"systir.\" I've also gathered information about the pronunciation of \"sweostor\" and its various forms in Middle English, such as \"suster.\"\n\nThe crucial next step is to understand the natural phonological development of \"sweostor\" into Modern English *without* the Old Norse influence. This requires looking at how similar Old English words evolved. For instance, words with the \"eo\" diphthong and how they changed over time. I need to investigate the regular sound changes that would have affected \"sweostor.\"\n\nI also need to consider the grammatical changes. The search results mention the leveling of inflections in Middle English, partly attributed to Norse influence. I need to consider how \"sweostor,\" an r-stem noun, would have evolved in its plural and possessive forms in a purely English developmental path.\n\nTherefore, the plan needs to be updated to focus more specifically on the hypothetical phonological and grammatical evolution of \"sweostor.\"Without the influence of the Norse invasions between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **Suster**, or possibly **Swester**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the linguistic journey the word would have taken:\n\n*   **The Old English Origins:** The original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor**, with common regional and later variants such as **swuster** and the Northumbrian **soester**. These forms all stem from the Proto-Germanic **\\*swestr-**.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence We Actually See:** The modern word \"sister\" did not evolve directly from the most common forms of *sweostor*. Its vowel sound was heavily influenced by the Old Norse equivalent, **systir**. The contact between Old English and Old Norse speakers led to the adoption of the Scandinavian \"i\" vowel, which eventually standardized, giving us \"sister\".\n\n*   **A Path Without the Norse:** Had the Norse never arrived, the native word *sweostor* or *swuster* would have continued its natural development into Middle and then Modern English. The most common documented form in early Middle English, which appears to be a direct descendant of the Old English variants, is **suster**. This form shows a natural smoothing of the initial \"sw\" sound influencing the vowel that follows.\n\n*   **From Middle to Modern English:** The hypothetical development would have looked like this:\n    1.  **Old English:** *swuster*\n    2.  **Middle English:** *suster*\n    3.  **Modern English:** To determine the modern form, we can observe the evolution of other words with a similar short \"u\" sound in Middle English, such as *sunu* (son) or *cuman* (come). This vowel sound, in many English dialects, typically evolved into the modern STRUT vowel /ʌ/, the \"u\" sound in \"cup\" or \"dull\". The unstressed ending \"-er\" is a standard evolution for the original \"-or\".\n\nTherefore, the pronunciation would likely be /ˈsʌstər/. The most direct and conservative spelling for this would be **Suster**. An alternative spelling could have been *Soster*, by analogy with *mother* and *brother*, where the `<o>` came to represent the same /ʌ/ sound.\n\nAlternatively, the Old English form *sweostor* could have evolved into **Swester**, similar to its German cognate *Schwester*. However, given the prevalence of the *suster* form in non-Scandinavian influenced Middle English, it represents the most probable path.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
