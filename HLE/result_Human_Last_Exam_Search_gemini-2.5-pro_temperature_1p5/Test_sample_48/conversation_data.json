    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to construct the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) by analyzing the structure of the language L. The states of the minimal DFA correspond to the equivalence classes of strings under the Myhill-Nerode relation. Two strings `u` and `v` are equivalent if for all strings `z`, `uz` is in L if and only if `vz` is in L.\n\nThe regular expression for L is:\n`L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*`\n\nLet's simplify the notation:\n*   `S = (b | c)^*`: any string consisting only of `b`'s and `c`'s (i.e., no `a`'s).\n*   `T = (a | bc | cb | bbb)^*`: strings formed by concatenating `a`, `bc`, `cb`, and `bbb`. Note that `ε` (the empty string) is in `T`.\n*   `U = (ba | bba | ca)`: the set of strings `{ba, bba, ca}`.\n\nThe language L can be rewritten as `L = (S a T U)^* S a T`.\n\nThe state of the automaton after reading a string `w` can be characterized by the suffix of `w` starting from the last occurrence of the letter `a`. If no `a` has been seen, this defines our initial state.\n\nLet's define the states of our DFA:\n\n*   **q0**: This is the initial state. It represents all strings that do not contain the letter `a`. These are strings in `S`. This state also represents strings that have completed a full `(S a T U)` cycle and are now being followed by characters from `S`. Formally, this state corresponds to prefixes in `(S a T U)^* S`. This state is non-accepting.\n    *   `w \\in q0`. If we read a `b` or a `c`, the new string `w(b|c)` is still in `(S a T U)^* S`. So, `q0 --b,c--> q0`.\n    *   If we read an `a`, the string becomes `wa`. This string is in `L` because `w \\in (S a T U)^* S` and the suffix after the `a` is `ε`, which is in `T`. Thus, we move to an accepting state.\n\n*   **qA**: This is an accepting state. It represents strings that are in the language L. The suffix of such a string after the final `a` is a member of `T`. Let's call this suffix `u`. For instance, the string `a` is in this state (`u`=`ε`). The string `abc` is also in this state (the suffix after `a` is `bc`, which is in `T`).\n    *   `w \\in qA`. We read `a`. The new string `wa` ends in `a`, so the suffix after the new last `a` is `ε`, which is in `T`. For `wa` to be in `L`, its prefix `w` must be in `(S a T U)^* S`. However, a simpler view is to consider the structure of `T`: if `u \\in T` and `a \\in T`, then `ua \\in T`. So, `...au` becomes `...a(ua)`, which is still in `L`. Thus, `qA --a--> qA`.\n    *   We read `b`. The suffix becomes `ub`. `ub` is not in `T`. We get a new suffix, `b`, which is a prefix of elements in `T` (`bc`, `bbb`) and `U` (`ba`, `bba`). This requires a new state.\n    *   We read `c`. The suffix becomes `uc`. We get a new suffix, `c`, which is a prefix of elements in `T` (`cb`) and `U` (`ca`). This requires another new state.\n\n*   **qB**: Represents strings where the suffix after the last `a` is `b`. (e.g., `...ab`). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   `w \\in qB`. We read `a`. The suffix is now `ba`. The string `ba` is in `U`. This completes a `...a T U` block (with `T` being `ε`), returning the automaton to a state equivalent to the start. Thus, `qB --a--> q0`.\n    *   We read `b`. The suffix becomes `bb`. This is a prefix for `bbb` (in `T`) and `bba` (in `U`). This requires a new state. `qB --b--> qBB`.\n    *   We read `c`. The suffix becomes `bc`. `bc` is in `T`. The string is now in `L`. Thus, `qB --c--> qA`.\n\n*   **qC**: Represents strings where the suffix after the last `a` is `c`. (e.g., `...ac`). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   `w \\in qC`. We read `a`. The suffix becomes `ca`. `ca` is in `U`. This completes a `...a T U` block. `qC --a--> q0`.\n    *   We read `b`. The suffix becomes `cb`. `cb` is in `T`. The string is now in `L`. `qC --b--> qA`.\n    *   We read `c`. The suffix `cc` is not a prefix of any valid sequence in `T` or `U`. This leads to a non-accepting trap state. `qC --c--> qDead`.\n\n*   **qBB**: Represents strings where the suffix after the last `a` is `bb`. (e.g., `...abb`). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   `w \\in qBB`. We read `a`. The suffix becomes `bba`, which is in `U`. `qBB --a--> q0`.\n    *   We read `b`. The suffix becomes `bbb`, which is in `T`. The string is in `L`. `qBB --b--> qA`.\n    *   We read `c`. The suffix `bbc` is not a prefix of any valid sequence in `T` or `U`. `qBB --c--> qDead`.\n\n*   **qDead**: A non-accepting trap state. Any transition from this state loops back to itself.\n\nNow, we have 6 states: `q0`, `qA`, `qB`, `qC`, `qBB`, `qDead`. We must check for equivalent states to ensure the automaton is minimal. Two states are equivalent if their outgoing transitions for all symbols lead to equivalent states.\n\nLet's compare `qC` and `qBB`:\n*   On `a`: `qC` goes to `q0`, `qBB` goes to `q0`. (Match)\n*   On `b`: `qC` goes to `qA`, `qBB` goes to `qA`. (Match)\n*   On `c`: `qC` goes to `qDead`, `qBB` goes to `qDead`. (Match)\n\nSince all transitions from `qC` and `qBB` lead to the same states, `qC` and `qBB` are equivalent. They can be merged into a single state. Let's call the merged state `qD`.\n\nThis gives us 5 distinct states:\n1.  `q0` (initial)\n2.  `qA` (accepting)\n3.  `qB`\n4.  `qD` (merged `qC` and `qBB`)\n5.  `qDead` (trap)\n\nLet's check if any other states can be merged.\n*   `qA` is unique because it's the only accepting state.\n*   `qDead` is unique because it cannot reach the accepting state.\n*   Comparing `q0`, `qB`, `qD`:\n    *   `q0` vs `qB`: On `a`, `q0`->`qA` while `qB`->`q0`. They are distinct.\n    *   `q0` vs `qD`: On `a`, `q0`->`qA` while `qD`->`q0`. They are distinct.\n    *   `qB` vs `qD`: On `b`, `qB`->`qD` while `qD`->`qA`. They are distinct.\n\nAll 5 states are distinguishable. Therefore, the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes the language L has 5 states.\n\n<<<E>>>"
