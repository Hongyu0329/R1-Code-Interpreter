    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first analyze the system's properties, particularly its equilibrium points and invariant lines.\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane on the upper half-plane, where $u \\geq 0$.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with qualitatively different behaviors. Often, these are invariant manifolds of the system, such as the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. A key characteristic of a separatrix is that trajectories do not cross it.\n\nLet's look for invariant horizontal lines. An invariant line $u=c$ (where c is a constant) would require $u'(t) = 0$ for all time. From the second equation, $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2$, we can see that $u'(t)=0$ if $u=0$ or $u=1$.\nThis means that the lines $u=0$ and $u=1$ are invariant sets. Any trajectory starting on one of these lines will remain on that line for all time.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of trajectories around the line $u=1$:\n1.  For any initial condition with $u > 1$, the term $(u-1)$ is positive and $u^2$ is positive. Therefore, $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 > 0$. This means that the value of $u$ will always increase for any trajectory starting above the line $u=1$.\n2.  For any initial condition with $0 < u < 1$, the term $(u-1)$ is negative and $u^2$ is positive. Therefore, $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 < 0$. This implies that the value of $u$ will always decrease for any trajectory starting between the lines $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n3.  For any initial condition on the line $u=1$, we have $u'(t)=0$, and the trajectory remains on the line $u=1$.\n\nSince trajectories starting above the line $u=1$ move further away from it (upwards), and trajectories starting below it also move away from it (downwards), no trajectory can cross the line $u=1$. The line $u=1$ acts as a boundary that separates the phase plane into two regions with distinct long-term behavior for the $u$ variable. This perfectly matches the definition of a separatrix.\n\nTo further confirm the role of this line, we can find the equilibrium points.\nIf $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2$\n$d' = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$\nSo, on the line $u=1$, there are two equilibrium points: $d=0$ and $d=-1$. This gives the points $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe line $u=1$ contains these equilibrium points and separates the phase plane into regions of fundamentally different flow patterns. Therefore, the line $u=1$ is the separatrix for this system in the upper half-plane.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the line u=1.>>>"
