Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a significantly enhanced and more polyfunctional cytokine release profile upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This would likely result in higher secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, leading to more potent anti-tumor activity but also a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome.
