    "There are exactly 12 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA complete classification of these groups was provided by Chimere Anabanti and Sarah Hart in their paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\". They proved that any such group must have an order of at most 24.\n\nThe 12 non-isomorphic groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₈\n*   **Other non-abelian groups:** A₄ (the alternating group on 4 elements), Q₈ (the quaternion group), the dicyclic group of order 12 (Q₁₂), and SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field of 3 elements, which is of order 24).\n\nThe research confirmed that the previously known list of such groups was complete, with the largest having an order of 24.\n\n<<<12>>>"
