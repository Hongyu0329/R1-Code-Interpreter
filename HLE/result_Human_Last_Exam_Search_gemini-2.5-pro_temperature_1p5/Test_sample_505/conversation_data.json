    "In a surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is directly related to the number of holes introduced within the code. Specifically, a single patch of surface code with 'n' holes can encode 'n' logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits. Since there are two separate, identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each individual patch.\n\nThis results in a total of 4 logical qubits: 2 from the first patch and 2 from the second patch.\n\n<<<4>>>"
