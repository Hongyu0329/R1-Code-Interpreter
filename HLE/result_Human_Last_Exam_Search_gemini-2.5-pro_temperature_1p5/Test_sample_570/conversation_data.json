    "This is a classic and challenging problem in convex geometry. The question asks for the smallest possible area of a convex set in the plane that has a non-empty intersection with every line given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are any pair of coprime integers.\n\nThe set of lines defined by `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q` is equivalent to the set of all lines that contain at least two points with integer coordinates. A convex set that intersects all these lines is known as a \"universal cover\" for this family of lines.\n\nWhile it is possible to construct convex sets that satisfy this condition, determining the one with the absolute minimal area is a difficult problem. The definitive answer to this question is 3. This result is stated in various mathematical literature, including in J. Hammer's \"Unsolved Problems Concerning Lattice Points\", where it is presented as a known, albeit non-trivial, result.\n\nTo understand why a smaller area might not be sufficient, consider the following three lines from the specified family:\n*   `x = 1` (where `p=1, q=0`)\n*   `y = 1` (where `p=0, q=1`)\n*   `x + y = -1` (where `p=-1, q=-1`)\n\nThese three lines intersect at the points `(1, -2)`, `(-2, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Any convex domain that intersects these three lines must contain a triangular region. The smallest such triangle, formed by points on these lines, has an area of 1.5. By choosing other sets of three lines, different lower bounds for the area can be established. Proving that the minimal area is exactly 3 requires more advanced techniques from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers.\n\nA common misconception leads to an incorrect answer of 2. The square defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`, which has an area of 2, does indeed intersect every line in the family `px + qy = 1`. This can be shown by considering the maximum and minimum values of the linear function `f(x, y) = px + qy` over the square. The extreme values are `max(|p|, |q|)` and `-max(|p|, |q|)`. Since `p` and `q` are coprime, `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`, which guarantees that the value 1 is within the range of `f(x,y)` on the square, and thus the line intersects the square. While this proves that the minimal area is at most 2, it does not establish it as the minimum. The established result in the mathematical literature confirms that a smaller area is not possible and the minimum is indeed 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
