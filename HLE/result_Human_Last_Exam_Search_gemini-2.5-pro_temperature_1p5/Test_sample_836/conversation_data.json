    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **generalized dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community and related fields. It is often denoted as  S(k,ω) or S(q,ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a pair of particles at a certain relative position **r** and time interval **t**. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the collective dynamics of the system in terms of momentum transfer (represented by the wavevector **k** or **q**) and energy transfer (represented by the angular frequency **ω**).\n\nIn the context of nuclear systems, which consist of neutrons and various isotopes, the term \"generalized\" is particularly appropriate because the scattering intensity is a weighted sum of the partial dynamic structure factors for all pairs of atomic species. This concept is crucial for interpreting inelastic neutron scattering experiments, a primary tool for investigating the structure and dynamics of materials used in and interacting with nuclear systems.\n\nWithin the specific domain of nuclear reactor noise analysis, the focus is often on the correlations in the neutron population to deduce reactor kinetic parameters. While the terminology might shift towards quantities like the power spectral density, which is the Fourier transform of the time correlation function, the underlying physical concept is directly related to the dynamic structure factor.\n\n<<<generalized dynamic structure factor>>>"
