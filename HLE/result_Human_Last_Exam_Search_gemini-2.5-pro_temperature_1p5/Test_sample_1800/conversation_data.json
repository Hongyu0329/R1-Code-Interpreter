    "### Optimal Nickel-to-Cerium Ratio Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel (Ni) to cerium (Ce) in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single definitive value, but rather depends on the specific reaction—either the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting (WS)—and the catalyst's formulation and operating conditions. Research indicates different optimal ratios for each application, highlighting the nuanced nature of catalyst design.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a critical process for producing high-purity hydrogen, studies have shown high catalytic activity across a range of Ni concentrations. For instance, Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with nickel content between 5 and 12.5 weight percent (wt%) all demonstrate significant CO conversion, with catalysts containing 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni showing nearly identical, high performance. In a different approach, a carbon-supported Ni-CeO₂ catalyst with 15 wt% Ni exhibited superior activity, reaching equilibrium conversion at 260°C. Furthermore, the introduction of a third metal, like tungsten (W), can alter the ideal composition, with a Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ catalyst showing the highest catalytic activity among the mixed oxides studied. This suggests that while a higher Ni content is generally beneficial, the specific support and presence of other elements are crucial factors.\n\nIn the realm of **water splitting** for hydrogen production, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio also varies. A computational study investigating the electronic properties of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for the water-splitting reaction found that a 3Ni/1Ce atomic ratio exhibited more favorable adsorption energy, suggesting better catalytic properties. In experimental work focused on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key half-reaction in water splitting, Ni-Ceria electrocatalysts with compositions of Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ demonstrated the highest activities. This was attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in these specific ratios. Another study on co-doped ceria for overall water splitting found that a high level of 20 mol% of Ni and Fe co-doping in a 1:1 ratio showed excellent activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER.\n\nIn summary, there is no universal ideal Ni/Ce ratio. For the WGS reaction, a nickel loading in the range of 10-15 wt% appears effective. For water splitting, both computational and experimental studies point towards a higher nickel content, with atomic ratios of 3:1 (Ni:Ce) and molar ratios leading to compositions like Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ showing enhanced performance. The optimal ratio is ultimately a function of the specific catalytic system and reaction environment."
