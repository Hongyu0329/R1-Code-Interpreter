    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which the quantity $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $x$ in the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$, where $y$ is an integer.\n\nLet $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We are looking for the number of distinct integers $x$ such that $P(x)$ is a perfect square. This is equivalent to finding integer points on the elliptic curve defined by this equation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of $P(x)$ for large absolute values of $x$.\n\nFor large positive $x$, the term $x^3$ dominates, so $P(x)$ will be positive.\nFor large negative $x$, let $x = -z$ where $z > 0$.\n$P(-z) = (-z)^3 - 16(-z)^2 - 72(-z) + 1056 = -z^3 - 16z^2 + 72z + 1056$.\nFor large $z$, $P(-z)$ will be negative, and thus cannot be a perfect square. We can find when $P(-z)$ becomes negative by finding the roots of $z^3 + 16z^2 - 72z - 1056 = 0$.\nTesting some values:\nFor $z=8$, $8^3 + 16(8^2) - 72(8) - 1056 = 512 + 1024 - 576 - 1056 = -96$.\nFor $z=9$, $9^3 + 16(9^2) - 72(9) - 1056 = 729 + 1296 - 648 - 1056 = 321$.\nThe root is between 8 and 9. Thus, for $z \\ge 9$ (i.e., $x \\le -9$), $P(x)$ is negative.\nSo, we only need to check integers $x$ from -8 upwards.\n\nLet's test integer values for $x$ starting from -8.\n$P(-8) = (-8)^3 - 16(-8)^2 - 72(-8) + 1056 = -512 - 1024 + 576 + 1056 = 96$ (not a square)\n$P(-7) = (-7)^3 - 16(-7)^2 - 72(-7) + 1056 = -343 - 784 + 504 + 1056 = 433$ (not a square)\n$P(-6) = (-6)^3 - 16(-6)^2 - 72(-6) + 1056 = -216 - 576 + 432 + 1056 = 696$ (not a square)\n$P(-5) = (-5)^3 - 16(-5)^2 - 72(-5) + 1056 = -125 - 400 + 360 + 1056 = 891$ (not a square)\n$P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$. So, $x = -4$ is a solution.\n$P(-3) = (-3)^3 - 16(-3)^2 - 72(-3) + 1056 = -27 - 144 + 216 + 1056 = 1101$ (not a square)\n$P(-2) = (-2)^3 - 16(-2)^2 - 72(-2) + 1056 = -8 - 64 + 144 + 1056 = 1128$ (not a square)\n$P(-1) = (-1)^3 - 16(-1)^2 - 72(-1) + 1056 = -1 - 16 + 72 + 1056 = 1111$ (not a square)\n$P(0) = 1056$ (not a square, since $32^2 = 1024$ and $33^2 = 1089$)\n$P(1) = 1 - 16 - 72 + 1056 = 969$ (not a square)\n$P(2) = 8 - 64 - 144 + 1056 = 856$ (not a square)\n$P(3) = 27 - 144 - 216 + 1056 = 723$ (not a square)\n$P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4^2) - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$. So, $x = 4$ is a solution.\n$P(5) = 125 - 400 - 360 + 1056 = 421$ (not a square)\n$P(6) = 216 - 576 - 432 + 1056 = 264$ (not a square)\n$P(7) = 343 - 784 - 504 + 1056 = 91$ (not a square)\n$P(8) = 512 - 1024 - 576 + 1056 = -32$ (negative, not a square)\n\nThe roots of $P(x)=0$ determine the regions where $P(x)$ is positive. We've seen one root is between -8 and -9, and another between 7 and 8. The sum of the roots of the cubic $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056=0$ is 16. If we denote the roots by $r_1, r_2, r_3$, with $r_1 \\approx -8.5$ and $r_2 \\approx 7.5$, then $r_3 = 16 - r_1 - r_2 \\approx 16 - (-8.5) - 7.5 = 17$. Let's check the value of $P(x)$ near $x=17$.\n$P(16) = 16^3 - 16(16^2) - 72(16) + 1056 = -72(16) + 1056 = -1152 + 1056 = -96$ (negative)\n$P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17^2) - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 = 11^2$. So, $x = 17$ is a solution.\n\nFor $x \\ge 18$, $P(x)$ is positive. Proving that there are no further integer solutions for $x \\ge 18$ generally requires advanced techniques from number theory (related to Baker's theory on linear forms in logarithms). However, such problems in this context usually have integer solutions that are small and can be found by testing. The established method to show there are no more solutions is to bound the polynomial between two consecutive squares.\n\nFor large $x$, we can compare $P(x)$ with the square of a polynomial-like expression.\nConsider the square of $(x^{3/2} - 8x^{1/2}) = \\sqrt{x}(x-8)$. Its square is $x(x-8)^2 = x(x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x$.\nThen $P(x) - x(x-8)^2 = (x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056) - (x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x) = -136x + 1056$.\nThis difference is negative for $x > 1056/136 \\approx 7.76$.\nSo for $x \\ge 8$, we have $P(x) < x(x-8)^2$.\n\nConsider the square of the next lower expression, e.g., $(\\sqrt{x}(x-8)-1)^2 = x(x-8)^2 - 2\\sqrt{x}(x-8) + 1$. This is not a polynomial in $x$.\nLet's consider the square of $(x^{3/2}-8x^{1/2}-1)$. Not a polynomial.\nLet's consider $(x-9)\\sqrt{x}$. Its square is $x(x-9)^2=x^3-18x^2+81x$.\n$P(x)-x(x-9)^2=2x^2-153x+1056$. For large enough $x$, this is positive. The larger root of $2x^2-153x+1056=0$ is approximately 69. So for $x\\ge69$, $x(x-9)^2 < P(x) < x(x-8)^2$. If $x$ is a perfect square, say $x=k^2$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, this implies $(k(k^2-9))^2 < (y)^2 < (k(k^2-8))^2$, which shows $y$ cannot be an integer. While this does not rule out all integers $x$, it shows that solutions are sparse for large $x$.\n\nWithout a full proof for large $x$, it is worth noting that for such problems, exhaustive search over a reasonable range containing the roots of the polynomial is expected to yield all integer solutions. We have found three integer values for $x$: -4, 4, and 17.\n\nThe integer values of $x$ for which the given quantity is a perfect square are -4, 4, and 17. Thus, there are 3 such integers.\n\nFinal list of solutions:\n1. $x = -4$, $P(-4) = 1024 = 32^2$\n2. $x = 4$, $P(4) = 576 = 24^2$\n3. $x = 17$, $P(17) = 121 = 11^2$\n\nThere are 3 such integer values for $x$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
