The probability to draw a link y_{ij} between i and j in a random graph of size N that is jointly exchangeable is given by **W(U_i, U_j)**, where U_i and U_j are independent random variables drawn from a uniform measure on, and W is a symmetric, measurable function (a graphon) which can be determined by a random measure F.
