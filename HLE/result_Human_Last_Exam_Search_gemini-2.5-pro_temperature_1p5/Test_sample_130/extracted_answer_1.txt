As $t\rightarrow\infty$, the edges of the binary image will be smoothed. Sharp convex corners will be rounded off, and sharp concave corners will be filled in. The image will converge to a "root signal" where all shapes are composed of straight lines and arcs with a radius of curvature of at least $\delta$. Small features and noise will be eliminated, while larger, straighter edges will be preserved.
