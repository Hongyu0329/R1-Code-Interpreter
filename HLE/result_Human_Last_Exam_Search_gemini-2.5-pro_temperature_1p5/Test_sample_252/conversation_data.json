    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method requires the light from a scene to be dispersed in two dimensions onto a 2D sensor. This 2D dispersion creates multiple, spectrally-smeared images of the scene on the sensor in a single snapshot. These projections are then used by a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the three-dimensional data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension).\n\nThe key optical component responsible for this 2D dispersion is a two-dimensional (2D) disperser. Historically, and for fundamental understanding, a 2D disperser was created by stacking and crossing two one-dimensional (1D) diffraction gratings at right angles to each other. Each grating disperses the light along a single axis, and combining two perpendicularly provides the necessary dispersion in two dimensions. While a single 1D grating can disperse light, it only does so along one axis, which is insufficient for the tomographic reconstruction of a 3D data cube from a single 2D image.\n\nModern systems sometimes use a single, specially fabricated component, such as a 2D holographic cross-grating or a computer-generated hologram (CGH), that acts as a 2D disperser. However, this single component is designed with a periodic structure in two orthogonal directions, effectively embodying the function of two separate gratings. There are also historical designs that utilized three crossed gratings, but this is not the minimum number required.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental minimum requirement to achieve the necessary two-dimensional dispersion for CTIS is the effect of two orthogonal diffraction gratings.\n\n<<<B>>>"
