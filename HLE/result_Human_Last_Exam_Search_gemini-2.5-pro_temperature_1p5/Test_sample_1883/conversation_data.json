    "The user is asking to predict the ratio of two isomeric products, A (cis) and B (trans), formed from the thermal electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps to arrive at the answer:\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is an electrocyclic ring closure of a conjugated polyene, specifically a decatetraene.\n2.  **Determine the number of π electrons:** Decatetraene has four double bonds, so it has 8 π electrons.\n3.  **Apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal electrocyclic reactions:** For a system with 4n π electrons (where n=2, so 8 π electrons), the thermal reaction proceeds in a conrotatory fashion. Photochemical reactions for such systems are disrotatory.\n4.  **Analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material:** The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The substituents at the ends of the reacting system (C2 and C9) are methyl groups. We need to determine their relative orientation.\n5.  **Apply FMO theory:** FMO theory focuses on the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) for thermal reactions. For an 8 π electron system, the HOMO is ψ₄. We need to determine the symmetry of the HOMO at the terminal carbons.\n6.  **Predict the product stereochemistry based on the conrotatory ring closure:** We need to visualize the two possible conrotatory rotations (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) of the terminal p-orbitals and see how the methyl and hydrogen substituents move. This will determine whether the resulting dimethylcyclooctatriene is the cis or trans isomer.\n7.  **Relate the predicted product to isomers A and B:** The problem states that the reaction produces a *cis*-isomer A and a *trans*-isomer B. Our prediction from the conrotatory closure will tell us which isomer is formed.\n8.  **Consider \"torqueoselectivity\":** While the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict conrotation, there can be a preference for one conrotatory direction over the other due to steric interactions. This is known as torqueoselectivity. We need to consider if there's a steric preference for one of the two possible conrotatory motions.\n9.  **Predict the ratio:** Based on the FMO analysis and consideration of any steric preferences, we can predict the ratio of isomers A and B. If one product is strongly favored due to orbital symmetry and steric factors, the ratio will be high. If both are formed, we need to assess the relative energies of the transition states leading to them.\n\nBased on the search results:\n*   An 8π electron system undergoes conrotatory ring closure under thermal conditions.\n*   A search result specifically mentions the cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. It states that the conrotatory ring-closure leads to *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. Another source confirms that for (2E,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, conrotatory closure gives the trans product. This highlights the importance of the starting material's stereochemistry.\n\nLet's apply this to the specific reactant: \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n\n*   The terminal double bonds are at C2 (Z configuration) and C8 (E configuration).\n*   Let's draw the molecule to visualize the positions of the methyl groups and hydrogens at the termini (C2 and C9).\n*   The system has 8 π electrons, so under thermal conditions, the reaction is conrotatory.\n*   We need to examine the HOMO (ψ₄) of the octatetraene system. The terminal p-orbitals in ψ₄ have opposite phases. To form a sigma bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction (conrotation) to bring lobes of the same phase together.\n*   Let's analyze the two conrotatory motions for \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. One conrotatory motion will lead to the cis-isomer, and the other conrotatory motion would also lead to the cis-isomer for this specific starting material, as stated in a reliable source. The formation of the trans isomer would require a disrotatory motion, which is thermally forbidden.\n*   Therefore, under thermal conditions, only one product, the cis-isomer (A), should be formed. The trans-isomer (B) should not be formed.\n\nThis means the ratio of A to B should be overwhelmingly in favor of A. Ideally, it would be 100:0, or a very high ratio approaching this.\n\nThe question implies that two isomers are formed. This could be due to several reasons not immediately obvious from a simple FMO analysis, such as a competing reaction pathway, a subsequent isomerization, or the \"forbidden\" reaction occurring to a minor extent. However, based on the primary prediction from FMO theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, one product is strongly favored. The Royal Society of Chemistry source explicitly states that for (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, \"the only reaction product formed is cis-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene\".\n\nGiven this, the ratio of cis-isomer (A) to trans-isomer (B) should be very high. The trans-isomer is the \"forbidden\" product. Therefore, the ratio A:B will be large. Without quantitative data on the energy barrier for the forbidden pathway, it's impossible to give a precise numerical ratio. However, the prediction is a strong preference for A. The question asks for a ratio prediction based on FMO theory. FMO theory predicts the formation of only the \"allowed\" product. Therefore, the predicted ratio is that only A is formed.\n\nI will proceed to formalize the step-by-step application of FMO theory to show which isomer is formed and why. Then I will conclude with the predicted ratio.\n\nFinal conclusion based on this reasoning: The reaction is predicted to be highly selective for the cis-isomer (A). The formation of the trans-isomer (B) is symmetry-forbidden. Therefore, the ratio of A to B will be very large, effectively producing only A.### Isomer Ratio Prediction via Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory\n\nUnder thermal conditions, the electrocyclic ring-closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the associated Woodward-Hoffmann rules. These principles predict a highly selective outcome for the reaction.\n\n#### Analysis of the Reaction:\n\n1.  **Electron System:** The reactant, a decatetraene, possesses four π-bonds, making it an 8π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2), the thermally induced electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n\n2.  **Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory:** In a thermal reaction, the stereochemical outcome is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the π-system. For an 8π-electron system, the HOMO is ψ₄. In this orbital, the p-orbitals at the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) have lobes of opposite phase on the same side of the molecule. To achieve constructive overlap and form the new σ-bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction—that is, in a conrotatory fashion.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant:** The starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The stereochemistry is determined by the substituents at the termini of the conjugated system, which are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom at C2, and a methyl group and a hydrogen atom at C9.\n\n4.  **Conrotatory Ring Closure:** There are two possible conrotatory pathways: both termini can rotate clockwise, or both can rotate counter-clockwise. For the given \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer, let's analyze the outcome of this rotation.\n    *   The *Z*-configuration at the C2-C3 double bond and the *E*-configuration at the C8-C9 double bond orient the methyl groups in such a way that both conrotatory motions lead to the same product.\n    *   In this specific case, the conrotatory closure forces both methyl groups to end up on the same side of the newly formed ring.\n\n5.  **Predicted Product:** As a result of the symmetry-allowed conrotatory ring closure, the exclusive product formed is the *cis*-isomer, specifically *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. The formation of the *trans*-isomer (Product B) would necessitate a disrotatory ring closure, a process that is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions for an 8π-electron system.\n\n#### Conclusion on the Ratio of Products:\n\nBased on FMO theory, the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a highly stereospecific reaction. The reaction pathway overwhelmingly favors the formation of the symmetry-allowed product. Therefore, the *cis*-isomer (A) is the sole product predicted by this theory. The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) is considered a symmetry-forbidden process and is not expected to occur to any significant extent.\n\nThus, the predicted ratio of A to B is that product A is formed exclusively, while product B is not formed at all.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is effectively >99:<1, with the reaction proceeding to form exclusively the cis-isomer (A)."
