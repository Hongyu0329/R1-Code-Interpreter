    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button with a 2.5x raise is J5s.\n\nOpening ranges from the button are wide, and in a rake-free environment, they can be even wider due to the increased profitability of stealing the blinds. While specific hand ranges can vary slightly between different pre-flop chart models, a common guideline for a 100 big blind cash game includes opening suited jacks down to J5s from the button. For example, one source suggests a button raising range that includes all suited kings, suited queens down to Q3, and suited jacks down to J5. Any suited jack with a lower kicker, such as J4s, J3s, or J2s, is typically considered too weak to be a standard open-raise, even from this advantageous position.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
