    "The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Paul Krugman**.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann's appearance in the \"Ask Why\" commercial series is documented in descriptions of the advertisements. At the time of the commercial's release, Enron was promoting itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company, and the \"Ask Why\" campaign was designed to reflect this image. The campaign featured a series of visually distinct commercials with a montage of images, including historical figures and symbols of progress, set to what was described as \"urgent\" and \"haunting\" music.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, also had a connection with Enron. He served on the company's advisory board and received a payment for his role. This association has led to him being named as the other Nobel laureate connected to the notorious advertising campaign. The campaign's goal was to influence policymakers and potential corporate clients by aligning the Enron brand with intellectualism and a questioning of the status quo.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
