    "Hypothetically, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would depend on the specific structure of the nanocar in question, as several different designs exist. The term \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon-based structure are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nTo provide a specific number, we can consider a documented example of a nanocar with a flexible chassis which has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. This particular nanocar is composed of 310 carbon atoms and 34 hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\" based on this structure, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced with fluorine atoms. The fullerene wheels, being composed solely of carbon, would not have any hydrogen atoms to be substituted and would remain unchanged. Therefore, the resulting perfluorinated molecule would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nOther nanocar designs would result in a different number of fluorine atoms if they were to be perfluorinated:\n\n*   A \"nanotruck\" with the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄ would hypothetically contain 18 fluorine atoms.\n*   The \"NANOHISPA SPARC\" nanocar, made of 70 atoms and featuring an anthracene chassis with benzene and toluene wheels, would have its own specific number of hydrogens to be replaced.\n\nWithout a universally defined structure for \"the\" nanocar, the exact number of fluorine atoms can vary. However, based on the C₃₁₀H₃₄ example, the number is determined by the count of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
