    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. This synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, preventing further reaction with the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe optimal temperature for this direct synthesis to efficiently produce Xenon tetrafluoride is approximately 400°C. Temperatures in the range of 350°C to 450°C can be used, but 400°C is widely cited as the preferred temperature for a good yield.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods and temperatures exist, they are generally less efficient for producing pure XeF₄. For instance:\n*   Flow methods using a nickel tube can be conducted between 300°C and 500°C, but this often results in significant contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n*   At lower temperatures, the formation of XeF₂ is generally favored, while at higher temperatures, xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes the more prominent product.\n*   Photochemical methods and electric discharge have also been used, but these can also lead to mixtures of xenon fluorides.\n\nTherefore, based on the established and efficient methods of synthesis, 400°C is the standard operating temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
