    "Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, it is a non-degenerate, compact, connected metric space. A continuum is hereditarily indecomposable if and only if every one of its subcontinua is indecomposable. A key property of a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is that it does not have any cut-points. Therefore, the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n\nSince $X$ is a metric continuum, it is separable and locally compact at each point except possibly a countable number of them. As $X$ is a compact metric space, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, and σ-compact metric space. Being a metric space, it is also a Tychonoff space, so its Stone-Čech compactification $\\beta Y$ is well-defined. The Stone-Čech remainder is the set $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\nThe key properties of the Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ are as follows:\n1.  Since $Y$ is a locally compact and connected space, its Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum.\n2.  The weight of the Stone-Čech remainder of a separable, σ-compact, locally compact space is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum. Since $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is such a space, the weight of $Y^*$ is $c$.\n\nWe are interested in the number of composants of $Y^*$. For this to be a meaningful question, $Y^*$ must be an indecomposable continuum. It is a known result that the Stone-Čech remainder of certain spaces can be indecomposable. For instance, the remainder of the half-line, $[0, \\infty)$, is a well-known example of a non-metrizable indecomposable continuum.\n\nThe number of composants of any indecomposable continuum is at most its topological weight. Since the weight of $Y^*$ is $c$, the maximum possible number of composants of $Y^*$ is at most $c$.\n\nThe final step is to determine if this maximum, $c$, is achievable. We can again turn to the example of the Stone-Čech remainder of the half-line, $H^* = \\beta[0, \\infty) \\setminus [0, \\infty)$. $H^*$ is not only indecomposable but also a chainable continuum. It is a classical result that every non-degenerate chainable indecomposable continuum has exactly $c$ composants. Therefore, $H^*$ has $c$ composants.\n\nThe space $[0, \\infty)$ is a locally compact, non-compact, connected metric space, which shares the relevant general topological properties with $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. The fact that there exists such a space whose remainder is an indecomposable continuum with $c$ composants demonstrates that this maximum is attainable. The hereditary indecomposability of the starting space $X$ ensures that $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected, and while it imposes further constraints on the space of continuous functions, it does not reduce the maximum possible number of composants of the remainder below $c$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.
