    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer 25. The dimension of each irrep is calculated using the hook-length formula. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we systematically identify the partitions of 25 that yield such dimensions.\n\nRepresentations with small dimensions typically correspond to partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin,\" meaning they have a small number of rows or a small number of columns. As the diagrams become more balanced, the dimensions of the corresponding irreps increase rapidly.\n\nThe following is a list of all partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $\\text{dim}(\\lambda)$, is less than 500,000. Each partition is listed with its conjugate partition, which has the same dimension.\n\n1.  **Partitions of the form (n-k, 1^k) and their conjugates (hook partitions):**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$ and its conjugate $(1^{25})$. The dimension is 1. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$ and its conjugate $(2, 1^{23})$. The dimension is 24. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$ and its conjugate $(3, 1^{22})$. The dimension is 276. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$ and its conjugate $(4, 1^{21})$. The dimension is 2,024. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$ and its conjugate $(5, 1^{20})$. The dimension is 10,626. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$ and its conjugate $(6, 1^{19})$. The dimension is 42,504. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$ and its conjugate $(7, 1^{18})$. The dimension is 134,596. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$ and its conjugate $(8, 1^{17})$. The dimension is 346,104. (2 irreps)\n\n2.  **Partitions with two rows and their conjugates:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$ and its conjugate $(2^2, 1^{21})$. The dimension is 275. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$ and its conjugate $(2^3, 1^{19})$. The dimension is 2,000. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$ and its conjugate $(2^4, 1^{17})$. The dimension is 10,350. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$ and its conjugate $(2^5, 1^{15})$. The dimension is 40,480. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$ and its conjugate $(2^6, 1^{13})$. The dimension is 123,970. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$ and its conjugate $(2^7, 1^{11})$. The dimension is 303,600. (2 irreps)\n\n3.  **Other partitions with few rows (and their conjugates):**\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$ and its conjugate $(3, 2, 1^{20})$. The dimension is 4,025. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$ and its conjugate $(3, 2^2, 1^{18})$. The dimension is 29,250. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$ and its conjugate $(3, 3, 1^{19})$. The dimension is 29,550. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1^2)$ and its conjugate $(4, 2, 1^{19})$. The dimension is 58,500. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$ and its conjugate $(3, 2^3, 1^{16})$. The dimension is 116,280. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$ and its conjugate $(3^2, 2, 1^{17})$. The dimension is 117,810. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1^2)$ and its conjugate $(4, 2^2, 1^{17})$. The dimension is 232,560. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$ and its conjugate $(4, 3, 1^{18})$. The dimension is 235,620. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1^3)$ and its conjugate $(5, 2, 1^{18})$. The dimension is 159,120. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$ and its conjugate $(3, 2^4, 1^{14})$. The dimension is 330,330. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 4, 2)$ and its conjugate $(3^2, 2^2, 1^{15})$. The dimension is 344,850. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 3, 3)$ and its conjugate $(3^3, 1^{16})$. The dimension is 336,700. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 2, 1^4)$ and its conjugate $(6, 2, 1^{17})$. The dimension is 371,820. (2 irreps)\n\nSumming these up: 8 pairs from the first category, 6 pairs from the second, and 13 pairs from the third, for a total of 27 pairs of partitions. Since no partition listed is self-conjugate, this gives 27 * 2 = 54 distinct irreducible representations. Any other partition of 25 results in an irrep with a dimension greater than or equal to 500,000.\n\nThus, there are 54 irreducible representations of $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<54>>>"
