    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is analyzed based on its core operations and loop structure.\n\nThe algorithm converts an integer `n` to its representation in a given base `c`. The central part of this algorithm is a `while` loop that executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than zero.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the algorithm's execution:\n1.  **Initialization**: The first step involves a fixed number of operations: assignments, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. This step takes constant time, O(1).\n2.  **Loop Execution**: The `while` loop continues to execute, and in each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by `c`. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, which is log_c(n). Therefore, the loop will run O(log_c(n)) times.\n3.  **Operations within the loop**: Each iteration of the loop consists of a constant number of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time, the work done inside the loop for each iteration is O(1).\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop. In this case, that is O(log_c(n)) * O(1), which simplifies to O(log_c(n)).\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, log_c(n) is equivalent to log(n) / log(c). Since `c` is a constant input (`c ≥ 2`), log(c) is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are omitted. Thus, the complexity is simplified to O(log n).\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis assumes that the arithmetic operations on `n` (division by `c` and modulo) take constant time. This is a common assumption in algorithm analysis when the numbers involved fit within a machine word (e.g., a 64-bit integer). If `n` is arbitrarily large, the time complexity of these arithmetic operations would depend on the number of bits in `n`, leading to a higher overall complexity, such as O((log n)^2). However, for the standard analysis of this algorithm with typical integer sizes, the complexity is considered O(log n).\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
