The partition function Z for a system with the grand canonical Hamiltonian H = -μN, expressed as a path integral, is given by:

Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫<sub>0</sub><sup>βħ</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(x, τ) [ħ(∂/∂τ) - μ] ψ(x, τ))

Here:
*   `∫D[ψ*, ψ]` denotes the functional integral over all field configurations.
*   `ψ*(x, τ)` and `ψ(x, τ)` are the complex or Grassmann fields at position `x` and imaginary time `τ`.
*   `β` is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T).
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `μ` is the chemical potential.
*   The fields obey periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time for bosons (ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, βħ)) and anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermions (ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, βħ)).
