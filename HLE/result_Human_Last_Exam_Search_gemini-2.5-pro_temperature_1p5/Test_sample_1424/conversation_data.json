    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of any interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, is most clearly seen in the energy-momentum representation.\n\nThe Feynman path integral is a method to compute quantum mechanical amplitudes by summing over all possible trajectories a particle can take. For a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is determined by the free Hamiltonian, H₀. The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the single-particle energies ϵₖ.\n\nAfter performing the path integral and Fourier transforming from the time domain to the frequency (energy) domain, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) for a given momentum **k** and frequency ω is found. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ is given by a simple pole structure.\n\nFor fermionic systems at zero temperature, the time-ordered bare Green's function is:\n<br>\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη sgn(ϵₖ - µ))***\n<br>\nWhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency or energy variable.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with wavevector **k**.\n*   **µ** is the chemical potential, which defines the Fermi energy at zero temperature.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal number that correctly defines the contour for the integration in the complex plane, ensuring causality.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function.\n\nThis expression can be broken down into two cases, depending on whether the single-particle state is occupied or empty.\n\n1.  For **unoccupied states** (particle states), where ϵₖ > µ:\n    The pole is slightly below the real axis.\n    ***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη)***.\n\n2.  For **occupied states** (hole states), where ϵₖ < µ:\n    The pole is slightly above the real axis.\n    ***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ - iη)***.\n\nEssentially, the bare Green's function has a simple inverse relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This reflects the fundamental principle that the Green's function describes the propagation of particles with well-defined energies in a non-interacting system. While the path integral formalism provides a powerful and elegant derivation, especially in relativistic contexts, the resulting functional form of G₀ is consistent with that obtained from other methods like canonical quantization.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in the energy-momentum representation is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. Specifically, for a fermionic system at zero temperature, the time-ordered Green's function is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη sgn(ϵₖ - µ)), where µ is the chemical potential and η is a positive infinitesimal.>>>"
