In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in the energy-momentum representation is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. Specifically, for a fermionic system at zero temperature, the time-ordered Green's function is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη sgn(ϵₖ - µ)), where µ is the chemical potential and η is a positive infinitesimal.
