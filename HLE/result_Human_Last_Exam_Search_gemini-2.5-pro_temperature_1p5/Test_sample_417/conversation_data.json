    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we must count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule. This requires a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n### Molecular Structure Analysis:\nThe molecule is **1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n1.  **Central Core**: The core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. This ring is substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This arrangement possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. Because of this symmetry, the three large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are also chemically equivalent. This means we only need to identify the unique proton environments in one-third of the molecule (one arm and one ring methyl group) to find the total number of signals.\n\n2.  **Chiral Ligand**: Each arm contains a large, chiral substituent derived from camphor: (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole. The presence of this chiral center is crucial as it affects the equivalence of nearby protons.\n\n### Counting the Proton Signals:\nLet's systematically count the sets of chemically equivalent protons:\n\n*   **Central Ring Methyl Protons (Ar-CH₃)**: The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) are equivalent due to the molecule's C3 symmetry. These 9 protons will produce a single peak.\n    *   **1 Signal**\n\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (-CH₂-)**: There are three methylene bridges linking the central ring to the indazole ligands. Due to the overall C3 symmetry, these three -CH₂- groups are equivalent. However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral ligand. This makes the two protons within each -CH₂- group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these 6 protons will give rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   **2 Signals**\n\n*   **Camphor-Indazole Ligand Protons**: We only need to count the signals for one ligand, as all three are identical by symmetry. The camphor skeleton is rigid and chiral.\n    *   **Indazole Ring Proton (H3)**: There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring. This proton is in a unique environment.\n        *   **1 Signal**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (on camphor skeleton)**: There are three methyl groups: one at position C7 and two geminal methyls at C8. Due to the inherent chirality of the camphor structure, these three methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. The two C8 methyl groups are diastereotopic.\n        *   **3 Signals**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (H4)**: The proton at the bridgehead (C4) is in a unique environment.\n        *   **1 Signal**\n    *   **Methylene Protons (H5)**: The two protons on C5 are part of a rigid, chiral ring system and are therefore diastereotopic and non-equivalent.\n        *   **2 Signals**\n    *   **Methylene Protons (H6)**: Similarly, the two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic and non-equivalent.\n        *   **2 Signals**\n\n### Summary of Peaks:\nAdding up the number of signals from each part of the molecule:\n*   From Ar-CH₃ groups: 1\n*   From -CH₂- bridge groups: 2\n*   From Indazole-H3 proton: 1\n*   From the three Indazole-CH₃ groups: 3\n*   From Indazole-H4 proton: 1\n*   From Indazole-H5 methylene protons: 2\n*   From Indazole-H6 methylene protons: 2\n\nTotal expected peaks = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **12**\n\n<<<H>>>"
