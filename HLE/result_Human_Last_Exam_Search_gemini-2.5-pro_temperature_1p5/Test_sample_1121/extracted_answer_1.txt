*   **Distance-3 Surface Code:** Approximately **4 to 7** logical non-Clifford (T) gates are required to construct a Toffoli gate, which provides universality. However, with a 1% physical gate error rate, the resulting logical gate would have a high error probability.
*   **Distance-5 Surface Code (at 1% error rate):** Approximately **700 to 7,000** physical non-Clifford (T) gates are required. This significant increase is due to the extensive magic state distillation needed to produce high-fidelity logical T-gates from noisy physical components, which is necessary to construct a reliable fault-tolerant Toffoli gate.
