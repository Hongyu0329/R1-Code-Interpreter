The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all excited Slater determinants $|\Phi_I\rangle$ that are quintuply excited or higher (e.g., hextuply, etc.). This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, which results in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian in CCSD being unable to generate excitations beyond the quadruply excited level when acting on the reference determinant.
