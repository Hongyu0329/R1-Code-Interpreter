    "To scan the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male,\" we must first identify the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and account for any metrical phenomena such as elision, which are common in Latin poetry, particularly in the comic verse of Terence. The meter is an iambic senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (S L), but frequently allows for substitutions to vary the rhythm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Original Line**: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n2.  **Syllabification & Elision**: There is a clear elision between `bene` and `esse`. The final `-e` of `bene` is dropped before the initial `e-` of `esse`. The line is scanned as:\n    `et tibi ben' esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n3.  **Syllable Quantity Analysis**:\n    *   `et`: Short. The vowel `e` is short and followed by a single consonant.\n    *   `ti-bi`: The vowels in `tibi` are naturally short. In comic meter, a word with an iambic structure (`S L`) is often shortened by a principle called *brevis brevians* to `S S`.\n    *   `ben'-`: This syllable, resulting from the elision of `-ne`, is long by position because its vowel is followed by the two consonants `n` and `s` (from `esse`).\n    *   `es-se`: The first syllable `es-` is long by position (followed by `-ss-`). The second syllable `-se` is short.\n    *   `so-li`: The `o` in `sōlus` is long by nature. The `i` in the dative form `sōlī` is also long.\n    *   `quom`: This is an archaic spelling of `cum` and is a short syllable.\n    *   `si-bi`: Like `tibi`, the vowels are naturally short, and it scans as `S S`.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, and it is not followed by two consonants, so the syllable is short.\n    *   `ma-le`: Both vowels are naturally short.\n\nThis detailed analysis results in the following sequence of long (L) and short (S) syllables, grouped into six metrical feet. The line accommodates the extra syllables through the use of \"resolutions,\" where a single long syllable is replaced by two short ones (e.g., an iamb `S L` is replaced by a tribrach `S S S`).\n\nThe resulting scansion is:\n\n<<<S S S | L L S | L L | S S S | S S S | S S>>>"
