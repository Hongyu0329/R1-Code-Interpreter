    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated posteriorly adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe cuttlefish brain is a complex structure organized around the esophagus into the supraesophageal and subesophageal masses. The palliovisceral lobe is a component of the subesophageal mass, which generally controls motor functions.\n\nSpecifically, the palliovisceral lobe is located in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass. This posterior section of the subesophageal mass also contains the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores on the mantle, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins. Studies and brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish consistently place these structures together in the most posterior part of the brain, projecting through an opening in the cranial cartilage that encases the brain. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements, such as inking, which are mediated by the funnel.\n\nThe co-localization of the palliovisceral lobe with the posterior chromatophore lobes and fin lobes in the posterior subesophageal mass indicates their adjacent positions."
