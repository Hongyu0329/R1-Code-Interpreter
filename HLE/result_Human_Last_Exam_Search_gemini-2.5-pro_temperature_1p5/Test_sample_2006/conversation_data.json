    "The haiku \"The Bays\" provides a poetic description of the end of World War II in the Pacific. The \"August tempest\" and \"winds of change\" allude to the tumultuous events of August 1945, including the atomic bombings. The line \"Twice fifteen\" is a poetic reference to August 15, the date Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender to his people. The \"divine one\" who \"yields\" is Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure in Japan.\n\nThe title itself, \"The Bays,\" points to the answer. The key locations associated with the end of the war in the Pacific are:\n*   **Hiroshima Bay**: The city of Hiroshima, the target of the first atomic bomb, is situated on the Ōta River delta which opens into Hiroshima Bay.\n*   **Nagasaki Bay**: Nagasaki, the second city to be struck by an atomic bomb, is located on a long, narrow bay.\n*   **Tokyo Bay**: The formal surrender of Japan was signed on board the USS *Missouri*, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945.\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\n\nHiroshima Bay\nNagasaki Bay\nTokyo Bay\n<<<Hiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
