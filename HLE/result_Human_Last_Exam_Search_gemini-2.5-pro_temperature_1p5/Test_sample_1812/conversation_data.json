    "The determinant of the given adjacency matrix is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant, det(A), can be computed using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nAn alternative method is to observe that the sum of the entries in each row is zero (2 - 1 - 1 = 0). This property indicates that the vector is an eigenvector of the matrix with a corresponding eigenvalue of 0. A matrix having an eigenvalue of 0 is a singular matrix, which means its determinant is 0.\n\nThe reference to the \"Markov quiver for m_(1/2) = 13\" serves as context for the origin of this specific matrix, often related to the study of Markov equations and cluster algebras. However, it does not alter the explicit matrix provided for the computation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
