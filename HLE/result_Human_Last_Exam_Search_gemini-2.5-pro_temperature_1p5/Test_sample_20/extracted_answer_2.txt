Yes, it is true that the Wasserstein regular subgradient of $J(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}W(\mu,\nu)^2$ is the trivial tangent vector at the minimum of $J$.

Here is a step-by-step justification:

1.  **The Minimum of the Functional**: The functional $J(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}W(\mu,\nu)^2$ represents half the squared Wasserstein distance from a fixed probability measure $\nu$. The Wasserstein distance $W(\mu,\nu)$ is non-negative and is zero if and only if $\mu = \nu$. Consequently, the functional $J(\mu)$ attains its unique minimum value of 0 at $\mu = \nu$.

2.  **Convexity**: The squared Wasserstein distance is a geodesically convex functional on the Wasserstein space. This means that along any geodesic path between two probability measures, the functional behaves like a convex function.

3.  **Differentiability at the Minimum**: A key property of the squared Wasserstein distance functional $J(\mu)$ is its differentiability. While it is not differentiable everywhere, it is differentiable at any measure $\mu$ for which there is a unique optimal transport plan to $\nu$. At the minimum point, $\mu=\nu$, the optimal transport map that transports $\nu$ to itself is uniquely the identity map ($T(x) = x$). This uniqueness ensures that the functional $J(\mu)$ is differentiable at $\mu=\nu$.

4.  **The Gradient at a Minimum**: For any differentiable function on a manifold (the Wasserstein space can be viewed as an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold), the gradient at a minimum point must be the zero vector. Since $\mu=\nu$ is the minimum of the differentiable function $J(\mu)$, its gradient at this point, $\nabla J(\nu)$, must be the zero tangent vector. This can also be seen by computing the gradient vector field, which is given by $x - T(x)$, where $T$ is the optimal map. At $\mu=\nu$, $T$ is the identity map, so the gradient is $x - x = 0$.

5.  **The Subgradient of a Differentiable Convex Function**: The "regular subgradient" (often simply called the subgradient in this context) of a geodesically convex functional at a point where it is differentiable is a singleton set containing only the gradient.

Combining these points, since the functional $J(\mu)$ is geodesically convex and is differentiable at its minimum $\mu=\nu$ with a gradient of zero, the regular subgradient at this point is precisely the set containing only the zero tangent vector. The zero tangent vector is the trivial tangent vector in the tangent space at $\nu$.
