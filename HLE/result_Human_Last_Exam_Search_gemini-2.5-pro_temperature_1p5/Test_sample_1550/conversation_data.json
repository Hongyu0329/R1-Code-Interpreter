    "To determine the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, a detailed analysis of their geometric properties is conducted.\n\nThe two quadrics are given by the following equations:\n1. `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nFirst, we classify each conic section. The type of conic is determined by the discriminant, B² - 4AC, from the general form Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nFor the first quadric:\nA = 164, B = -216, C = 72\nThe discriminant is (-216)² - 4 * 164 * 72 = 46656 - 47232 = -576. Since the discriminant is negative, this quadric is an ellipse. To determine if it is a degenerate conic, the determinant of its associated matrix is calculated. The determinant is -144, which is non-zero, confirming it is a non-degenerate ellipse.\n\nFor the second quadric:\nA = 864, B = -1056, C = 324\nThe discriminant is (-1056)² - 4 * 864 * 324 = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608. This also being negative suggests an ellipse. However, calculating the determinant of the associated matrix for this quadric yields a result of 0. This indicates that it is a degenerate conic.\n\nA degenerate conic of the ellipse type represents a single real point (or a pair of imaginary lines intersecting at a real point). This single point is the center of the conic. To find its coordinates, we solve the system of partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, set to zero:\n*   ∂/∂x (864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149) = 1728x - 1056y - 560 = 0\n*   ∂/∂y (864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149) = -1056x + 648y + 324 = 0\n\nSolving this linear system gives the coordinates of the point as (9/2, 41/6).\n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking if this single point lies on the first ellipse. This is done by substituting x = 9/2 and y = 41/6 into the first equation:\n\n164(9/2)² - 216(9/2)(41/6) + 72(41/6)² - 16(9/2) + 31\n= 164(81/4) - 216(369/12) + 72(1681/36) - 72 + 31\n= 41 * 81 - 18 * 369 + 2 * 1681 - 41\n= 3321 - 6642 + 3362 - 72 + 31\n= 6714 - 6714 = 0\n\nSince the equation holds true, the point (9/2, 41/6) lies on the first ellipse. Therefore, the two quadrics intersect at exactly this single point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
