    "**The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is believed to be \"3 Ajaw,\" inscribed on a ceramic cylinder seal from San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico. This artifact is associated with the Olmec civilization and is dated to approximately 650 BCE.**\n\nThis recorded date is part of the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar, a sophisticated system of timekeeping developed in the region. The glyphs on the cylinder seal are interpreted by many archaeologists as representing the day \"3 Ajaw,\" which could have been both a calendar date and the name of a ruler, a common practice in Mesoamerican cultures. However, it is important to note that this interpretation is a subject of scholarly discussion, with some researchers suggesting the symbols might be purely iconographic rather than a written date.\n\nWhile the San Andrés seal holds the earliest potential *recorded date*, the oldest known example of writing in the Americas belongs to the **Cascajal Block**, also from the Olmec civilization. Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, the block is dated to around 900 BCE. It contains 62 distinct glyphs, but these have not been deciphered as calendrical information. Therefore, the Cascajal Block represents the earliest known writing system, but the San Andrés seal is the earliest artifact currently believed to bear a specific, recorded date.\n\nOther early examples of dated monuments include Stela 12 from the Zapotec site of Monte Albán in Oaxaca, with a confirmed date of 594 BCE, and Stela C from Tres Zapotes, an Olmec site, which has a Long Count calendar date corresponding to 32 BCE. There is also evidence from astronomical alignments that the 260-day calendar was in use in the Olmec region as early as 1100 BCE, predating any known written record of a date.\n\n<<<3 Ajaw>>>"
