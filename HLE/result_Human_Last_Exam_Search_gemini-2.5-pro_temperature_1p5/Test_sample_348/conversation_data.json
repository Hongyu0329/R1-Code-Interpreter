    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_E) and the supply price equals the demand price (P_S = P_D = P_E).\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nAt equilibrium, we set the prices equal to each other:\nln(Q³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nSolving this equation for Q requires numerical methods due to its complexity. Using a computational tool to solve for the intersection of the two functions, we find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E) to be approximately **3.331**.\n\nNext, we find the equilibrium price (P_E) by substituting Q_E into either the supply or the demand function. Using the demand function:\nP_E = 18e^(-arctan(3.331)) ≈ **4.768**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves from the starting point of supply up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price. It is calculated as:\n    CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price. It is calculated as:\n    PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[∛2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nNote that the supply function is defined for Q³ - 2 > 0, so Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26.\n\n**Total Welfare (TW) = CS + PS**, which simplifies to the sum of the two integrals:\nTW = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThese integrals also need to be solved numerically.\n\n1.  **Integral of the demand curve from 0 to 3.331:**\n    ∫[0 to 3.331] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ **27.653**\n\n2.  **Integral of the supply curve from ∛2 to 3.331:**\n    ∫[1.26 to 3.331] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ ≈ **3.715**\n\nNow, we can calculate the total welfare:\nTW ≈ 27.653 - 3.715 = **23.938**\n\nThus, the total welfare is approximately 23.94.\n\n<<<23.94>>>"
