    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is given by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This corresponds to the upper half of a circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\n\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is given by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(t)$ which goes from -1 to 1.\n*   The y-values range from $5\\sin(t)$. Since $\\sin(t)$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ ranges from 0 down to -1 and back up to 0, the y-values range from $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ to 0.\n\nTo find the dimensions of the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we need to find the overall maximum and minimum x and y values.\n\n*   **Overall x-range:** The x-values for the entire curve range from -1 to 1. The total width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Overall y-range:** The y-values for the entire curve range from the minimum value of -5 (from the elliptical part) to the maximum value of 1 (from the circular part). The total height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nA square that encloses this figure must have a side length equal to or greater than the largest dimension of the figure. The dimensions are a width of 2 and a height of 6. The larger dimension is 6.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the smallest square that outcircles the figure must be 6.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
