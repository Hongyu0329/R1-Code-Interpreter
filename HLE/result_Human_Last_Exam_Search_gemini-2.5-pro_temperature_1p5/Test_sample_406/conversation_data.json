    "The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × X × Y → Z have been established in various mathematical contexts, primarily within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. An FGH-tripled fixed point is an element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, x, y) = z.\n\nThe establishment of such a fixed point generally requires the fulfillment of several key conditions related to the structure of the spaces and the properties of the functions. These conditions are typically presented in the form of a theorem.\n\n### Core Conditions for Existence\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point often involve the following elements:\n\n**1. A Partially Ordered Complete Metric Space:**\nThe sets X, Y, and Z are required to be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that in addition to being metric spaces with a notion of distance, they also have a partial order relation (commonly denoted by '≤'). Completeness ensures that Cauchy sequences converge, which is a fundamental requirement in many fixed-point theorems.\n\n**2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe function F is often required to possess a mixed monotone property. This property describes how the function behaves with respect to the partial order. For a function F: X × Y × Z → X, the mixed monotone property typically means that for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n*   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z) for any y ∈ Y and z ∈ Z.\n*   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z) for any x ∈ X and z ∈ Z.\n*   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂) for any x ∈ X and y ∈ Y.\n\nSimilar mixed monotone properties are defined for the functions G and H with respect to their arguments.\n\n**3. Contractive Condition:**\nA crucial component is a contractive-type inequality that relates the distances between the outputs of F, G, and H to the distances between their inputs. This condition ensures that successive applications of the functions bring points closer together, leading to a fixed point. A common form of this condition is that there exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n\nd(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w)) + d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w)\n\nwhere d represents the metric of the respective spaces. This is a generalization of the Banach contraction principle.\n\n**4. Existence of a Starting Point:**\nThere must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)\n\nThis condition provides a starting point for the iterative process that will converge to the tripled fixed point.\n\n**5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous. This ensures that if sequences xₙ → x, yn → y, and zₙ → z, then F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ) → F(x, y, z), and similarly for G and H.\n\nAlternatively, if the functions are not continuous, a weaker condition may suffice. For instance, if the space has the property that for any non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} that converges to x, we have xₙ ≤ x for all n, and similarly for non-increasing sequences, then the existence of a tripled fixed point can still be guaranteed without assuming the continuity of F, G, and H.\n\n### Uniqueness\n\nTo guarantee the uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point, an additional condition is typically required. This condition states that for any two tripled points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, there exists another tripled point (a, b, c) that is comparable to both. This ensures that the set of tripled points is \"connected\" with respect to the partial order, which leads to a single unique fixed point.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is contingent upon the interplay between the algebraic structure (partial order), the topological structure (complete metric space), and the analytical properties (mixed monotonicity and contractivity) of the functions and spaces involved.
