    "Answering this question requires identifying the specific map in question and then applying results from homotopy theory concerning its connectivity.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Map\n\nThe spaces involved are the suspension of a smash product of loop spaces, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the loop space of a smash product of spheres, $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Note that by the properties of smash products of spheres, $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$. Thus, the target space is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" along with the structure of the spaces strongly suggests that the map in question is the adjoint of the generalized James-Hopf invariant (also known as the second-order Hopf invariant or Samelson product map). Let's denote this map by $f$.\n\nThis map fits into a more general construction. For pointed spaces $X$ and $Y$, there is a map\n$$h: \\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y \\to \\Omega^2(X \\wedge Y)$$\nThis map is constructed from the composition of maps induced by the product on loop spaces and the smash product. The map in the user's question is the adjoint of this map $h$, given by the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction.\n$$f = \\text{adj}(h): \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$$\n\nIn our specific case, $X = S^4$ and $Y = S^6$. So the map is:\n$$f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$$\nwhich is the adjoint to the map:\n$$h: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega^2 S^{10}$$\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Map\n\nTo find the connectivity of the map $f$, we can first determine the connectivity of its adjoint, $h$. The relationship between the connectivity of a map and its adjoint is a standard result in homotopy theory. If a map $g: A \\to \\Omega B$ is $k$-connected, its adjoint $\\text{adj}(g): \\Sigma A \\to B$ is $(k+1)$-connected. This follows from the fact that the homotopy fiber of $\\text{adj}(g)$ is the loop space of the homotopy fiber of $g$, up to homotopy equivalence ($\\Omega F_{\\text{adj}(g)} \\simeq F_g$).\n\nSo, we need to find the connectivity of the map $h: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n\nA significant result in homotopy theory, due to pioneers like Toda and generalized by others, states that the James-Hopf map $h: \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q \\to \\Omega^2(S^p \\wedge S^q)$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected.\n\nFor our specific case with $p=4$ and $q=6$, the map $h$ is $(4+6-1) = 9$-connected.\n\nWe can verify this is plausible by checking the connectivity of the source and target spaces on their lowest non-trivial homotopy groups.\n*   **Source Space:** $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product of a $p$-connected and a $q$-connected space is $(p+q+1)$-connected. Thus, $A$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   **Target Space:** $B = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n    *   A space $\\Omega^k S^n$ is $(n-k-1)$-connected. So, $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is $(10-2-1) = 7$-connected.\n*   **Lowest non-trivial homotopy groups:**\n    *   Since $A$ is 7-connected, its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8(A)$. By the Hurewicz theorem and the KÃ¼nneth formula for rational homology, $\\pi_8(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_8(A; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4;\\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6;\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}$. So $\\pi_8(A)$ is non-trivial.\n    *   Since $B$ is 7-connected, its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8(B) = \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe map $h$ on this lowest level, $h_*: \\pi_8(A) \\to \\pi_8(B)$, corresponds to the Whitehead product and is known to be an isomorphism rationally, and an isomorphism of the integers integrally. This confirms that the map $h$ is at least 8-connected. The theorem stating it is 9-connected implies that the map on $\\pi_9$ is an epimorphism, which is a deeper result.\n\nAccepting the theorem that the map $h: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is **9-connected**, we can now find the connectivity of its adjoint, $f$.\n\nAs established, if $h$ is $k$-connected, its adjoint $f$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\nSince $h$ is 9-connected, the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $(9+1) = 10$-connected.\n\n"
