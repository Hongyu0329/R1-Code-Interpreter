    "The Néron-Severi group of an algebraic variety X, denoted NS(X), is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is known as the Picard number, ρ(X). This problem concerns the 15th symmetric power, X = Sym¹⁵(C), of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve C of genus g is given by the formula:\n\nρ(Symᵈ(C)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))\n\nprovided that d ≥ g. In this case, d=15 and the genus g=3, so the condition is satisfied. The problem is thus reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nFor a generic curve C of genus g, its Jacobian Jac(C) has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms, with its endomorphism ring being isomorphic to the integers, Z. In such cases, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization, and its rank is 1. For a generic genus 3 curve, the Picard number of its Jacobian is therefore 1.\n\nThus, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n\nρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe Picard number of a g-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by g². For a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the maximum possible Picard number is 3² = 9. This maximum is achieved when the Jacobian has complex multiplication by a large endomorphism algebra.\n\nAn abelian variety A of dimension g achieves this maximal Picard number ρ(A) = g² if and only if it is isogenous to Eᵍ, where E is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. A well-known example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. The genus of this curve is (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. Consequently, its Picard number is 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n\nρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(Jac(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
