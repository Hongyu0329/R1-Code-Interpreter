    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >.\n\nA power subgroup Gⁿ is the subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements in the group G. It is formally defined as Gⁿ = < gⁿ | g ∈ G >. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of Q_128, we must consider all possible integer values for n.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of two forms: `a^i` for `0 ≤ i < 64` and `a^i * x` for `0 ≤ i < 64`. We analyze the n-th powers for each type of element.\n\n1.  **Elements of the form aⁱ:**\n    *   The n-th power is simply `(a^i)ⁿ = a^(in)`. These elements generate the subgroup `<aⁿ>`, which is equivalent to `<a^d>` where `d = gcd(n, 64)`.\n\n2.  **Elements of the form aⁱx:**\n    *   The square of such an element is `(a^i * x)² = a^i * x * a^i * x = a^i * (x * a^i * x⁻¹) * x² = a^i * a⁻¹ * a³² = a³²`.\n    *   The fourth power is `(a^i * x)⁴ = (a³²)² = a⁶⁴ = 1` (the identity element). This means all elements of the form `a^i * x` have an order of 4.\n\nNow, let's determine the structure of the power subgroup Gⁿ based on whether n is odd or even.\n\n### Case 1: n is an odd integer\n\n*   The subgroup Gⁿ contains all elements of the form `(a^i)ⁿ = a^(in)`. Since n is odd, `gcd(n, 64) = 1`. Therefore, the subgroup generated by these powers, `<aⁿ>`, is equal to `<a>`, the cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n*   Gⁿ also contains the n-th powers of elements `a^i * x`. Since n is odd, we can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n    `(a^i * x)ⁿ = (a^i * x)^(2k+1) = ((a^i * x)²)^k * (a^i * x) = (a³²)^k * (a^i * x) = a^(32k+i) * x`.\n*   Since `<a>` is a subgroup of Gⁿ, `a^(32k+i)` is in Gⁿ. Because Gⁿ is a group, it must be closed under multiplication, so `(a^(32k+i))⁻¹ * (a^(32k+i) * x) = x` must also be in Gⁿ.\n*   As Gⁿ contains both the generator `a` (which generates `<a>`) and the generator `x`, it must contain the entire group Q_128.\n*   Thus, for any odd integer n, the power subgroup Gⁿ is Q_128 itself. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n### Case 2: n is an even integer\n\n*   Let n = 2k for some integer k.\n*   The n-th powers of elements `a^i` generate the subgroup `<aⁿ> = <a^(2k)>`.\n*   The n-th powers of elements `a^i * x` are `(a^i * x)ⁿ = (a^i * x)^(2k) = ((a^i * x)²)^k = (a³²)^k = a^(32k) = a^(16n)`.\n*   The element `a^(16n)` is already contained within the subgroup `<aⁿ>` because `gcd(n, 64)` divides `16n`.\n*   Therefore, for any even integer n, the power subgroup is Gⁿ = `<aⁿ> = <a^gcd(n, 64)>`.\n*   Since n is even and 64 is a power of 2, `gcd(n, 64)` must be an even divisor of 64. The even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n*   This gives us the following distinct cyclic subgroups:\n    1.  `<a²>` (e.g., for n=2) - This is the commutator subgroup of Q_128.\n    2.  `<a⁴>` (e.g., for n=4)\n    3.  `<a⁸>` (e.g., for n=8)\n    4.  `<a¹⁶>` (e.g., for n=16)\n    5.  `<a³²>` (e.g., for n=32) - This is the center of Q_128.\n    6.  `<a⁶⁴>` (e.g., for n=64) - This is the trivial subgroup `{1}`.\n*   This accounts for **six** distinct power subgroups.\n\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are:\n1.  Q_128\n2.  <a²>\n3.  <a⁴>\n4.  <a⁸>\n5.  <a¹⁶>\n6.  <a³²>\n7.  {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThere are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
