    "When the complement protein **C3b** is broken down, it facilitates the engulfment of amyloid-β by macrophages.\n\nThe process involves several steps within the complement system, a part of the innate immune system:\n\n*   **Opsonization:** C3b coats the amyloid-β plaques, tagging them for removal.\n*   **Conversion to iC3b:** C3b is then cleaved or \"broken down\" into an inactive form called iC3b (inactivated C3b).\n*   **Macrophage Recognition:** iC3b on the surface of the amyloid-β plaques is recognized by complement receptors (specifically CR3) on macrophages, including microglia in the brain.\n*   **Engulfment (Phagocytosis):** This recognition and binding process triggers the macrophage to engulf and clear the amyloid-β.\n\nTherefore, the breakdown of C3b into iC3b is a crucial step that allows macrophages to effectively identify and remove amyloid-β deposits, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that a deficiency in the complement system, particularly C3, can lead to increased accumulation of amyloid-β.\n\n<<<C3b>>>"
