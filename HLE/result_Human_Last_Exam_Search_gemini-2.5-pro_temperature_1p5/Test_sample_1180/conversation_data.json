    "The \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve is a concept from arithmetic geometry that quantifies the nature of the singularity. The calculation for the curve defined by the equation $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ requires an analysis of the curve's behavior at the prime 2.\n\nThe process involves finding a suitable model of the curve and analyzing its singularities. A key technique is to study the curve at \"infinity\" by a change of variables. Letting $x=1/u$ and $z=v/u^3$, the equation transforms to describe the behavior of the curve around its point at infinity. This transformation yields the local equation $v^2 = u(2+2u^2+u^5)$, which simplifies to $v^2 = 2u+2u^3+u^6$.\n\nThe singularity of this transformed curve at $(u,v)=(0,0)$ determines the structure of the stable reduction. The defining local equation is $v^2 - 2u - 2u^3 - u^6 = 0$. In the context of stable reduction, the nature of this singularity, which is a cusp, needs to be resolved. The \"thickness\" is an invariant related to this resolution process.\n\nFor singularities of this type, the valuation of the discriminant of the local equation provides insight. The discriminant of the polynomial $t^2 - (u^6+2u^3+2u)$ with respect to $t$ is $-4(u^6+2u^3+2u)$. With the given normalization $v(2)=1$, and assuming a generic valuation for $u$ (i.e., $v(u)=0$), the valuation of the discriminant at $u=0$ is:\n$v(-4(u^6+2u^3+2u)) = v(-4) + v(2u(u^5/2+u^2+1))$\n$= v(2^2) + v(2) + v(u) + v(u^5/2+u^2+1)$\n$= 2v(2) + v(2) + v(u) + 0$\n$= 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 + 0 = 3$.\n\nThis valuation of 3 is the key invariant associated with this singular point. In the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, this value corresponds to the thickness of the double point that arises in the stable model after resolving the cusp.\n\n<<<3>>>"
