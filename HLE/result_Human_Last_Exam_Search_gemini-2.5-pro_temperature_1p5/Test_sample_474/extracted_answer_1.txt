The proposed research approach is not ecologically valid because the visual perception of untrained humans is a poor substitute for that of the primary predators, mainly birds, which have different visual systems (e.g., UV perception). The validity is further weakened by the lack of standardization in using un-controlled "field images". While it might offer a very rough preliminary grouping, it cannot be trusted to accurately represent the functional mimicry syndromes that have evolved in response to predator learning.
