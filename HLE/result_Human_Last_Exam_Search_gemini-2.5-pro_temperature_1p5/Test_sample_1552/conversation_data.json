    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion, denoted as `a₂`, for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field on a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold is a crucial quantity in quantum field theory and spectral geometry. It encapsulates information about the interaction of the spinor field with the background gravitational and gauge fields.\n\nThe spectral action is determined by the trace of a function of the Laplacian, and its asymptotic expansion is given by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. For a massless Dirac operator `D` coupled to a gauge field `A`, the relevant operator is the square of the Dirac operator, `D²`. The heat kernel expansion for `D²` is given by:\n\nTr(e⁻ᵗᴰ²) ~ (1 / (4πt)²) * Σ_{n=0}ᵀ ∞ * tⁿ * aₙ(D²)\n\nThe second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂`, for a Dirac spinor field minimally coupled to a gauge field in four dimensions is given by the following formula:\n\n<<<`a₂ = ∫d⁴x √g * Tr[ (1/12) * F_{μν} * F^{μν} + (1/60) * R_{μνρσ} * R^{μνρσ} - (1/180) * R_{μν} * R^{μν} + (1/72) * R² ]`>>>"
