    "## Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Emerges in ϕ⁴ Theory Near Four Dimensions\n\n**The leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four spatial dimensions is given by u* = (16π²/3)ε, where ε represents the deviation from four dimensions (ε = 4 - d).**\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the renormalization group analysis of critical phenomena, famously developed by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher. It provides a way to study phase transitions and critical exponents in dimensions slightly less than four, where mean-field theory fails to capture the correct physics due to the importance of fluctuations.\n\nThe ϕ⁴ theory, a model describing a self-interacting scalar field, is a fundamental tool for understanding universality in statistical mechanics. The behavior of the system at large distances and long times is governed by the flow of its coupling constants under changes in the length scale. This flow is described by the renormalization group equations, and of particular importance is the beta function, which dictates the change of the coupling constant, `u`, with the length scale.\n\nIn `d = 4 - ε` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant `u` in the ϕ⁴ theory for a single-component scalar field is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + (3u²)/(16π²)\n\nThe fixed points of the theory are the values of the coupling `u*` for which the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the scale. Setting the above equation to zero, β(u*) = 0, reveals two possible solutions.\n\nOne is the trivial \"Gaussian\" fixed point at u* = 0, which describes a non-interacting theory. The more interesting solution is the non-trivial \"Wilson-Fisher\" fixed point. By solving for u* ≠ 0, we find:\n\n-εu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nDividing by u* (since we are looking for the non-trivial solution), we get:\n\n-ε + (3u*)/(16π²) = 0\n\nSolving for u* yields the leading order expression:\n\nu* = (16π²/3)ε\n\nThis fixed point is what governs the universal critical behavior of a wide range of physical systems, from the liquid-gas transition to the ferromagnetic transition in magnets, in dimensions close to four. The existence of this non-trivial fixed point at a small, positive value of ε allows for a perturbative treatment of critical phenomena, known as the ε-expansion.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ε>>>"
