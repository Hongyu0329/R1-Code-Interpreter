    "The rank of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. For a finitely generated abelian group, which is a direct sum of a torsion part and a free part, the rank is the rank of its free part. The torsion subgroup itself is a torsion group, also known as a periodic group. An abelian group of rank 0 is a periodic (or torsion) abelian group. Therefore, by definition, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\nFor the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is the Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, its integral cohomology ring $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is a finitely generated abelian group. It is known that any torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is 2-torsion. This means that any element of finite order in the cohomology groups has an order that is a power of 2.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. As each of these torsion subgroups is a torsion group, its rank is 0. The rank of a direct sum of groups is the sum of their individual ranks, and since all these ranks are 0, the rank of the total torsion subgroup is also 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
