    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent part, `Φ_k(x′)`, and the membership degree of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe calculation of the rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm operation used. The two most common t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n**1. Using the Minimum t-norm:**\n\nThe minimum t-norm is defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. Applying this to the given values:\n\nRule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n**2. Using the Product t-norm:**\n\nThe product t-norm is defined as `T(a, b) = a * b`. Applying this to the given values:\n\nRule Activation Level = `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level will be either **0.7** if the minimum t-norm is used, or **0.63** if the product t-norm is used. Without the specification of the exact t-norm, the answer can be one of these two values.\n\n<<<0.7 (using minimum t-norm) or 0.63 (using product t-norm)>>>"
