    "The search results primarily discuss the *n*-queens problem on a toroidal board, which is about placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board. It's known that solutions for this exist if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. For a 5x5 board, this condition holds, and there are solutions for placing 5 queens.\n\nHowever, the question is about placing 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, which is a different problem (*k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board where *k* < *n*). None of the search results directly provide the answer to this specific question. The articles and papers focus on the existence and number of solutions for the *n*-queens case, often with a focus on high-level mathematical properties and asymptotic bounds.\n\nThere is no simple formula provided for the general *k*-queens problem on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. Finding the answer would likely require a computational approach, such as a backtracking algorithm, modified to handle the wrapped-around attacks of the queens on a torus. Since my tools do not include the ability to write and run such a program, I cannot calculate the answer directly.\n\nThe search results do not contain the numerical answer to this specific combinatorial problem. Therefore, I must conclude that the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is not available in the provided search results.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to this question based on the web search results. The problem of finding the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board (where *k* is not necessarily equal to *n*) is a specific combinatorial problem for which a direct answer or a simple formula is not readily available in the searched literature. The existing research predominantly focuses on the case where the number of queens is equal to the board size (*n*-queens problem).>>>"
