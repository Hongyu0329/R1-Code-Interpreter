    "The initial step has correctly identified that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. For a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the problem is to determine the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe search results confirm that the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a known result. Specifically, search result states that the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112. It also mentions that the number of elliptic conjugacy classes is 30.\n\nThe other search results provide related information about the structure and order of $W(E_8)$ but do not directly state the number of conjugacy classes as clearly as result.\n\nTherefore, based on the information found, the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is 112. This directly answers the user's question.\n\nThe final answer is 112.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
