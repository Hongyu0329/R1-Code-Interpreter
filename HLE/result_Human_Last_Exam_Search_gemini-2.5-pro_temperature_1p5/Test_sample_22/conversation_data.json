    "True\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by the variance explained (R²), is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability (h²snp) for the same phenotype. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to the measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In essence, it is the theoretical maximum predictive power that a polygenic score, which is built from these same SNPs, could ever achieve.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the reality that a polygenic score's predictive power is almost always lower than the SNP heritability:\n\n*   **Errors in effect size estimation:** The effect sizes of individual SNPs are estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and these estimates always have some degree of error. This \"noise\" in the estimation process reduces the accuracy of the resulting polygenic score.\n*   **Differences between study populations:** Polygenic scores are often developed in a \"training\" dataset and then tested in a different \"target\" dataset. Differences in genetic ancestry, environmental exposures, and linkage disequilibrium patterns (the non-random association of alleles at different loci) between these groups can reduce the predictive accuracy of the score in the target population.\n*   **Incomplete capture of genetic effects:** Polygenic scores are constructed using a specific set of SNPs. They may not include all of the genetic variants that contribute to the heritability of a trait.\n\nWhile SNP heritability itself is an estimate and can vary, it conceptually represents the ceiling for the predictive ability of a polygenic score derived from that SNP data. Although some studies have reported instances where the out-of-sample prediction R² of a polygenic score exceeded the estimated SNP-based heritability, these are often due to specific analytical circumstances, such as heterogeneity between the cohorts used for GWAS and the prediction sample, which can lead to an underestimation of the true SNP heritability. However, the fundamental principle remains that the predictive ability of a score cannot explain more variance than is theoretically attributable to the genetic markers it is composed of.\n\n<<<True>>>"
