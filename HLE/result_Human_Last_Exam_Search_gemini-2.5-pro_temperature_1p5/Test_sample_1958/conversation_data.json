    "`Henry IV, Part 2` is the first play in which a book of the Bible is mentioned by name, in canonical order. The book mentioned is the Book of Job.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of the play, Sir John Falstaff declares, \"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.\" This is a direct reference to the Old Testament figure and the book named after him.\n\nWhile there are numerous allusions to the Book of Genesis and other early books of the Bible throughout Shakespeare's works, the explicit naming of a biblical book first occurs with Job in `Henry IV, Part 2`. For instance, in `The Merchant of Venice`, Shylock alludes to a story from Genesis. Similarly, allusions to the Book of Exodus and the Book of Proverbs appear in other plays, but direct mentions by name are less common. One source also makes an unverified claim about a mention of the \"book of Numbers\" in `Henry V`.\n\n<<<Henry IV, Part 2>>>"
