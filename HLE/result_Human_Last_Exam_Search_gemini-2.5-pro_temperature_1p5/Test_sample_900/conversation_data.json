    "In the Jete Woman solo scene from the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015, it is not possible to provide a definitive count of how many *pas de Balanchine* Svetlana Gileva performed.\n\nThe reason for this is twofold. First, William Forsythe's choreographic style is renowned for its deconstruction and reinterpretation of classical ballet vocabulary. Steps are often fragmented, accelerated, and blended into complex sequences, making the identification of a single, discrete ballet move challenging.\n\nSecond, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" does not refer to a single, universally codified step in the same way as a *grand jet√©* or a *pirouette*. Rather, it alludes to the distinctive style and technique developed by choreographer George Balanchine. While tutorials demonstrate a version of a step sometimes referred to as a \"pas de Balanchine,\" it is not a standardized part of the ballet lexicon.\n\nA video of Svetlana Gileva performing the specified solo in 2015 is available online. However, due to the fluid and abstract nature of the choreography, any attempt to count a specific number of an uncodified step would be subjective and speculative.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive count.>>>"
