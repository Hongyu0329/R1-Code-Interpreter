    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is often used interchangeably with a \"square lattice\" in the context of these walks. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is a well-studied sequence in combinatorics.\n\nThe sequence, denoted as a(n), is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The initial terms of this sequence represent the number of possible self-avoiding walks for a given number of steps.\n\nBased on the known values of this sequence, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks, a(10), has been calculated. The sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice begins as follows:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
