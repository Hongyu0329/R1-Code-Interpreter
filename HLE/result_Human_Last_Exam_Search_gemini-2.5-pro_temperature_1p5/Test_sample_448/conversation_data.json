    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002, a status it continues to hold.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas with a very short half-life, its most stable isotope, Radon-222, having a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which is found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust. Due to its rapid decay, radon exists in extremely small quantities at any given time. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is estimated to be about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n\nFor comparison, xenon is the rarest of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases. In the atmosphere, where noble gases are most concentrated, xenon is present at about 87 parts per trillion. In the Earth's crust, the abundance of xenon is approximately 0.020 parts per billion by weight. While both are exceedingly rare, the inherent instability of radon makes its overall presence in terrestrial matter significantly lower than that of xenon.\n\nThe relative abundances of the noble gases were not significantly different in 2002 than they are today. Therefore, radon was the rarest noble gas at that time as well.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
