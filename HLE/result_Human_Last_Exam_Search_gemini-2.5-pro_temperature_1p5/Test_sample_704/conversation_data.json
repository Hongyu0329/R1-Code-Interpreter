    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is G. Newton associated specific colors with notes of a musical scale, and in his system, green is represented by the note G and blue by the note A.\n\nIn his work \"Opticks,\" published in 1704, Newton divided the color spectrum into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He then mapped these colors to the notes of a Dorian musical scale starting on D. This created the following associations: Red (D), Orange (E), Yellow (F), Green (G), Blue (A), Indigo (B), and Violet (C).\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. Therefore, the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle corresponds to the musical notes G and A. The note that falls squarely within this range, representing the transition from green, is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
