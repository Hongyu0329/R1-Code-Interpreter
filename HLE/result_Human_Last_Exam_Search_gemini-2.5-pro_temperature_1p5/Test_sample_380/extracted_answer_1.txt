The local magnetic field is not considered radial for the calculation of normalized magnetic helicity at the L1 point. Instead, the calculation is performed using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction because the solar wind flows radially outwards from the Sun. This approach is justified by Taylor's "frozen-in" flow hypothesis, which is fundamental for interpreting single-spacecraft time-series data in the super-Alfv√©nic solar wind. Taylor's hypothesis dictates that the spacecraft samples spatial structures as they are advected past it by the bulk plasma flow. Since this flow is radial, the analysis framework, including the calculation of reduced magnetic helicity, is aligned with this direction. Therefore, using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z in a typical GSE coordinate system) is the standard and practical method, even though AIC waves themselves propagate along the local, often non-radial, magnetic field.
