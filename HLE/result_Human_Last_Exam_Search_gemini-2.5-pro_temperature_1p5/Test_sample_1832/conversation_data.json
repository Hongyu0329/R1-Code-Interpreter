    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric tensor, represent the gravitational field's strength.\n\nFor the Schwarzschild metric, there are 9 independent non-zero Christoffel symbols. Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), some components are equal.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nWhen counting the number of independent, non-zero symbols, we have exactly nine. If we were to count all non-zero components without considering the symmetry in the lower indices, there would be 13. However, the standard convention is to count the number of independent non-zero symbols.\n\n<<<9>>>"
