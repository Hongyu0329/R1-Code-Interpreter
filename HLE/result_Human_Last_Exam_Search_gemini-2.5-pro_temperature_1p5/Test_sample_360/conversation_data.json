    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a ligand substitution reaction occurs. The two chloride ligands are replaced by the bidentate ligand L to form the complex ion `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+`.\n\nThis product is an octahedral tris-chelate complex of the general formula `[M(AA)2(BB)]`, where M is the ruthenium ion, AA is the bipyridine (bpy) ligand, and BB is the 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) ligand. Both bpy and L are symmetric bidentate ligands.\n\nComplexes of this type are chiral, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. This chirality arises from the \"propeller-like\" arrangement of the three bidentate ligands around the central ruthenium ion. The arrangement can exist in two forms: a right-handed twist (designated as Delta, Δ) and a left-handed twist (designated as Lambda, Λ).\n\nThese two forms, Δ and Λ, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Therefore, the reaction forms two stereoisomers. Typically, the synthesis results in a racemic mixture, which is an equal a 1:1 ratio of the Δ and Λ enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
