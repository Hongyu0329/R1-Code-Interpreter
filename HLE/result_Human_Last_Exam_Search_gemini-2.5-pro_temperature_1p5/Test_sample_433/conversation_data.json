    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapter <797>, an opened single-dose ampule should not be stored for any period of time. Once a single-dose ampule is opened, it must be used immediately, and any remaining contents must be discarded.\n\nFor other types of single-dose containers, such as vials, the beyond-use date (BUD) depends on the environment in which they are punctured. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture. If punctured in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, it must be used within one hour.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules shall not be stored for any time period.>>>"
