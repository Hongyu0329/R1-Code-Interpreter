    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`, and then analyze the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions. These core residues dictate the oligomeric state through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing interactions.\n\n**1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat**\n\nA coiled-coil structure is characterized by a repeating pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids. The key hydrophobic residues are typically found at the `a` and `d` positions of the heptad repeat. In the given sequence, we can identify a recurring pattern of hydrophobic residues (Isoleucine - I, Leucine - L) spaced in a manner characteristic of a coiled coil (a 4-3-4-3 residue separation).\n\nBy aligning the sequence, we can assign the `abcdefg` positions. The most consistent and stable arrangement places the leucine and isoleucine residues in the hydrophobic core positions:\n\n*   **Sequence:** G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n*   **Position:** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b\n\nThis alignment reveals the following residues at the core positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n*   **'d' positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n\n**2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is a primary determinant of the coiled-coil's oligomeric state. Landmark studies have established a set of rules based on packing efficiency:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by having Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Leucine (L) at the `d` position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often favored by a more even distribution of Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Strongly favored by the reverse arrangement of a dimer, with Leucine (L) at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position.\n\nThe analyzed sequence has Leucine exclusively at the `a` positions and Isoleucine exclusively at the `d` positions. This `L(a)/I(d)` arrangement creates a hydrophobic core that is sterically and energetically favorable for a four-helix bundle. This specific arrangement maximizes the packing efficiency for a tetrameric structure.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and the specific sequence of hydrophobic core residues, the protein would form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
