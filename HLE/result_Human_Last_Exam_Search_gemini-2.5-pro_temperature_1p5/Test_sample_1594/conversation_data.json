    "When viewed from above, the adjacent buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter H.\n\nThe two schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti comprises two formerly separate institutions, the Liceo Classico \"Galileo Galilei\" and the Istituto Tecnico Economico \"Antonio Pacinotti\". This combined institute and the adjoining Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" share an internal courtyard.\n\nAn aerial or satellite perspective reveals that the layout of the two main buildings, connected by a central structure, creates a distinct shape. The building of the Galilei-Pacinotti institute forms one vertical bar, while the Ulisse Dini institute's building forms the other, and a connecting section with the shared courtyard area completes the shape of an 'H'.\n\n<<<H>>>"
