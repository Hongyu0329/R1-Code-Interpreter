    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative Green's function analysis. It represents the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which is the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be rearranged without changing the diagram's structure. This factor is necessary to correct for overcounting in the perturbative expansion.\n\nThe specific diagram in question features two vertices and four field contractions connecting them. This topology corresponds to a vacuum diagram in a theory with a four-point interaction, such as λφ⁴ theory. In this diagram, two distinct vertices are connected by four identical propagators.\n\nTo calculate the symmetry factor (S), we must identify all the symmetries of the diagram:\n\n1.  **Permutation of Identical Propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are indistinguishable. They can be permuted in 4! (4 factorial) ways.\n    4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n\n2.  **Permutation of Identical Vertices:** The two vertices are also identical (assuming they originate from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian). They can be swapped, which corresponds to a permutation of 2 elements, or 2! ways.\n    2! = 2 × 1 = 2.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of the number of these independent symmetry operations.\n\nS = (Number of propagator permutations) × (Number of vertex permutations)\nS = 4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48.\n\nThis can be confirmed using general formulas for symmetry factors found in the literature. For a diagram with `g` vertex permutations and `αn` sets of `n` identical lines connecting the same two vertices, the symmetry factor includes a factor of `g` and `(n!)^αn`. In this case, `g=2` and we have one set of four identical lines (`α₄=1`), yielding S = 2 × (4!)¹ = 48. A similar logic is applied to the \"theta graph\" in φ³ theory, where two vertices are connected by three lines, resulting in a symmetry factor of 2 × 3! = 12.\n\n<<<48>>>"
