    "**Where was Geoffrey Chaucer when Blanche of Lancaster died?**\n\nWhile Geoffrey Chaucer was in the service of the royal court and had close ties to the House of Lancaster, his precise whereabouts on September 12, 1368, the day of Blanche of Lancaster's death, are not definitively known.\n\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, likely from the plague. At the time, her husband John of Gaunt was overseas.\n\nHistorical records suggest a few possibilities for Chaucer's location around this period. In April 1368, he was an esquire in the retinue of Lionel of Antwerp and traveled to Italy for Lionel's wedding. After Lionel's death later in 1368, Chaucer joined the household of John of Gaunt. Other accounts place Chaucer on a diplomatic mission abroad in 1368 and on military service in France in 1369.\n\nAlthough Chaucer would later commemorate Blanche's death in his poem \"The Book of the Duchess,\" no definitive record confirms his exact location at the moment she passed away.\n\n<<<D>>>"
