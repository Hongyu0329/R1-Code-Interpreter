    "A closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is a spherical 3-manifold, which is of the form S³/Γ, where Γ is a finite subgroup of SO(4) that acts freely on the 3-sphere S³. The group Γ is the fundamental group of the manifold. The classification of such groups Γ, known as the finite spherical groups, is well-established. A finite group can act freely on S³ if and only if all of its Sylow p-subgroups for odd primes are cyclic, and its Sylow 2-subgroup is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group. A direct consequence of this is that every abelian subgroup of Γ must be cyclic.\n\nThe question asks for the number of such manifolds with a fundamental group of cardinality 10!. The order of the group is 10! = 3,628,800. The prime factorization of 10! is 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7¹.\n\nFirst, we determine which groups of order 10! can be a fundamental group of a 3-manifold.\n\n**Case 1: The Symmetric Group S₁₀**\nThe symmetric group S₁₀ has order 10!. However, it contains many subgroups that violate the conditions for a free action on S³. For example:\n*   S₁₀ contains the subgroup generated by the permutations (1 2) and (3 4). This subgroup is isomorphic to the Klein four-group (ℤ₂ × ℤ₂), which is an abelian but not a cyclic subgroup.\n*   S₁₀ contains the symmetric group S₃ (permutations of {1, 2, 3}) as a subgroup. S₃ has order 6 but is not cyclic. This violates the condition that every subgroup of order 2p (with p an odd prime) must be cyclic.\n\nTherefore, S₁₀ cannot be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\n**Case 2: Other Groups of Order 10!**\nWe must determine which, if any, groups of order 10! satisfy the necessary conditions. The finite spherical groups Γ are of the following types, or products of these with a cyclic group of relatively prime order:\n1.  Cyclic groups (Cₙ)\n2.  Dicyclic groups (Dicₙ, which includes generalized quaternion groups)\n3.  The binary tetrahedral group (2T, order 24)\n4.  The binary octahedral group (2O, order 48)\n5.  The binary icosahedral group (2I, order 120)\n\nLet Γ be a group of order 10!.\n*   If Γ is a product of 2T, 2O, or 2I with a cyclic group Cₖ of relatively prime order, the prime factors of 10! ({2, 3, 5, 7}) would have to be partitioned between the base group and Cₖ. In all these cases, Cₖ would have to be divisible by a prime that also divides the order of the base group, which violates the coprime condition. For example, if we consider Γ = 2I × Cₖ, |2I| = 120 = 2³ × 3 × 5. Then k = 10!/120 = 30240. The prime factors of 120 are {2, 3, 5}, so gcd(120, k) = 1 would mean k has no prime factors from this set. However, 30240 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, leading to a contradiction. Similar contradictions arise for 2T and 2O.\n\n*   This leaves two possibilities for the structure of Γ:\n    a) Γ is a cyclic group: **Γ = C₁₀!**\n    b) Γ is a product of a dicyclic group and a cyclic group of coprime order: **Γ = Dicₘ × Cₖ**, where 4m × k = 10! and gcd(4m, k) = 1.\n\nFor Γ = Dicₘ × Cₖ, the set of prime factors of 10!, {2, 3, 5, 7}, must be partitioned between the orders of the two factor groups. The prime 2 must belong to the order of Dicₘ. The odd prime factors {3, 5, 7} can be distributed in any way between the two. There are 2³ = 8 ways to partition the set of three odd primes. Each partition gives a unique non-cyclic group of order 10!. For instance:\n1.  P(Cₖ) = ∅, P(Dicₘ) = {2,3,5,7}. Γ = Dic₁₀!/₄.\n2.  P(Cₖ) = {3}, P(Dicₘ) = {2,5,7}. Γ = Dic₁₁₂₀₀ × C₈₁.\n...and so on for all 8 subsets of {3, 5, 7}. This gives a total of **8** distinct non-cyclic groups of order 10! that can serve as fundamental groups. For a non-cyclic finite fundamental group, the corresponding 3-manifold is unique up to homeomorphism. Thus, these 8 groups correspond to exactly **8** distinct manifolds.\n\n**Counting the Manifolds**\n\nNow we count the number of manifolds for each possible group.\n\n*   **Non-cyclic groups:** As stated, for any non-cyclic spherical group, there is precisely one closed orientable 3-manifold (up to homeomorphism) having that group as its fundamental group. Since we found 8 possible non-cyclic groups of order 10!, this gives us **8** manifolds.\n\n*   **The cyclic group C₁₀!:** Manifolds with a cyclic fundamental group Cₙ are known as lens spaces, denoted L(n, q). The number of non-homeomorphic lens spaces with fundamental group Cₙ is given by the number of orbits of the group of units (ℤ/nℤ)ˣ under the action of the group G = {id, g, h, gh} where g(q) = -q and h(q) = q⁻¹. Using Burnside's Lemma, the number of orbits is N(n) = ¼ (φ(n) + |Fix(g)| + |Fix(h)| + |Fix(gh)|).\n    *   n = 10!. φ(10!) = 10! × (1-1/2) × (1-1/3) × (1-1/5) × (1-1/7) = 3,628,800 × (8/35) = 829,440.\n    *   Fix(g) are q such that q ≡ -q (mod n) and gcd(q,n)=1. This is 2q ≡ 0 (mod n), which has no solutions for q in (ℤ/nℤ)ˣ when n is an even integer greater than 2. Thus, |Fix(g)| = 0.\n    *   Fix(h) are q such that q ≡ q⁻¹ (mod n), i.e., q² ≡ 1 (mod n). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of solutions is the product of the number of solutions modulo each prime power factor of n=2⁸⋅3⁴⋅5²⋅7. This is 4 × 2 × 2 × 2 = **32**.\n    *   Fix(gh) are q such that q ≡ -q⁻¹ (mod n), i.e., q² ≡ -1 (mod n). There are no solutions to x² ≡ -1 (mod 2⁸), so there are no solutions modulo 10!. Thus, |Fix(gh)| = 0.\n    *   The number of lens spaces is N(10!) = ¼ (829,440 + 0 + 32 + 0) = 207,360 + 8 = **207,368**.\n\nThe total number of such manifolds is the sum of the counts for the non-cyclic and cyclic cases.\n\nTotal number = (Number of manifolds from non-cyclic groups) + (Number of manifolds from the cyclic group)\nTotal number = 8 + 207,368 = 207,376.\n\n<<<207376>>>"
