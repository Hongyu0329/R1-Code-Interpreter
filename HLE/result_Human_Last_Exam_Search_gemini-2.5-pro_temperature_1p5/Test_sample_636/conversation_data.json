    "To calculate the state feedback gain matrix F, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the System and Desired Eigenvalues**: We are given the system matrices A and B, and the desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system A + BF.\n    *   A = [[-1, 1],]\n    *   B = [,]\n    *   Desired eigenvalues: -1 ± j\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**: The desired eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial. For a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues λ = α ± jβ, the polynomial is λ² - 2αλ + (α² + β²).\n    *   With eigenvalues at -1 ± j, we have α = -1 and β = 1.\n    *   The desired characteristic polynomial is:\n        P(λ) = λ² - 2(-1)λ + ((-1)² + 1²) = λ² + 2λ + 2.\n\n3.  **Form the Closed-Loop System**: Let the state feedback gain matrix be F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]. The closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF.\n    *   BF = [,] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\n    *   A_cl = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]] = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\n\n4.  **Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**: The characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M` is given by λ² - tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0.\n    *   Trace of A_cl: tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1\n    *   Determinant of A_cl: det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)f₂ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)\n    *   Expanding the determinant:\n        det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)\n        = -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄\n\n5.  **Equate Coefficients**: By comparing the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A_cl with the desired polynomial (λ² + 2λ + 2), we get a system of equations.\n    *   Comparing the λ coefficients: -(tr(A_cl)) = 2  => -(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2  => f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1\n    *   Comparing the constant terms: det(A_cl) = 2  => -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2 => -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ - 2f₄ = 3\n\n6.  **Solve for the Feedback Gain Matrix F**: We have two equations and four unknowns. This is typical for multi-input systems, as the solution for the feedback gain is generally not unique. We can find a particular solution by setting some of the elements of F to zero. Let's set the second row of F to zero, which means f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0. This simplifies the equations:\n    *   f₁ + f₂ = -1\n    *   -f₁ - 2f₂ = 3\n    *   Adding these two equations yields: -f₂ = 2, so **f₂ = -2**.\n    *   Substituting f₂ = -2 into the first equation gives: f₁ - 2 = -1, so **f₁ = 1**.\n\nThis gives a state feedback gain matrix:\nF = [[1, -2],]\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the eigenvalues of A + BF with this F:\n*   A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\n*   The characteristic equation is det(λI - (A + BF)) = λ(λ + 2) - (-1)(2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0.\n*   The roots of this equation are λ = -1 ± j. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
