    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we can construct the corresponding Hackenbush stalk. Finite Red-Blue Hackenbush boards can represent all dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form m/2^n). For values between -1 and 1, a single stalk of red and blue edges is sufficient.\n\nThe value of such a stalk is determined by its \"sign expansion,\" which can be found by reading the colors of the edges from the ground up. A blue edge corresponds to a '+' and a red edge to a '-'. The value of a stalk with colors corresponding to signs s₁, s₂, ..., sₖ is given by the sum Σ (sᵢ / 2ⁱ) for i=1 to k.\n\nWe can find the sign sequence for 13/16 using the following algorithm:\nLet x₀ = 13/16.\n1.  The first sign, s₁, is the sign of x₀, which is positive. The first piece is **Blue**.\n    The remainder is x₁ = 2 * x₀ - 1 = 2 * (13/16) - 1 = 26/16 - 16/16 = 10/16.\n2.  The second sign, s₂, is the sign of x₁, which is positive. The second piece is **Blue**.\n    The remainder is x₂ = 2 * x₁ - 1 = 2 * (10/16) - 1 = 20/16 - 16/16 = 4/16.\n3.  The third sign, s₃, is the sign of x₂, which is positive. The third piece is **Blue**.\n    The remainder is x₃ = 2 * x₂ - 1 = 2 * (4/16) - 1 = 8/16 - 16/16 = -8/16.\n4.  The fourth sign, s₄, is the sign of x₃, which is negative. The fourth piece is **Red**.\n    The remainder is x₄ = 2 * x₃ - (-1) = 2 * (-8/16) + 1 = -16/16 + 16/16 = 0.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when the remainder is 0. The sequence of pieces from the ground up is Blue, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nLet's verify the value of this stalk:\n*   Value = (+1) * (1/2) + (+1) * (1/4) + (+1) * (1/8) + (-1) * (1/16)\n*   Value = 8/16 + 4/16 + 2/16 - 1/16 = 13/16.\n\nThis construction requires 3 Blue pieces and 1 Red piece. Therefore, a total of 4 pieces are needed to represent the number 13/16.\n\n<<<4>>>"
