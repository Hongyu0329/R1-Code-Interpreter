    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the structure is defined by a hierarchical tree, which is typically a full binary tree. The depth of this tree determines the number of levels of partitioning of the matrix. A matrix multiplication operation on an HSS matrix involves accessing a set of generator submatrices associated with the nodes of this tree.\n\nFor a full binary HSS tree of depth *d*, we can determine the number of nodes at each level and the corresponding submatrices that are accessed during multiplication:\n\n1.  **Tree Structure**: A full binary tree of depth *d* has `d+1` levels (from level 0, the root, to level *d*, the leaves). The total number of nodes in such a tree is 2<sup>d+1</sup> - 1. For a depth of 4, the total number of nodes is 2<sup>4+1</sup> - 1 = 31.\n\n2.  **Submatrices at Leaf Nodes**: The leaves of the tree correspond to the diagonal blocks of the matrix partition that are stored as full matrices. These are often referred to as the `D` generator matrices. For a tree of depth 4, the number of leaf nodes is 2<sup>4</sup> = 16. Thus, there are **16** `D` submatrices.\n\n3.  **Submatrices at Non-Leaf (Internal) Nodes**: The non-leaf nodes store the compressed representations for the off-diagonal blocks. For each non-leaf node, there are typically `U` and `V` generator matrices that represent the bases for the row and column spaces of the corresponding submatrix. The number of non-leaf nodes in a full binary tree of depth 4 is (2<sup>4+1</sup> - 1) - 2<sup>4</sup> = 15. This means there are **15** `U` submatrices and **15** `V` submatrices.\n\n4.  **Off-Diagonal Interaction Submatrices**: The HSS representation also includes `B` submatrices that handle the interaction between sibling nodes in the tree. For every non-leaf node, its two children form a sibling pair. Since there are 15 non-leaf nodes, there are 15 such pairs. Each pair of siblings has two corresponding `B` matrices for the off-diagonal interactions. Therefore, the total number of `B` submatrices is 15 Ã— 2 = **30**.\n\nThe matrix multiplication algorithm on an HSS matrix consists of a pass up the tree and a pass down the tree, during which all of these `D`, `U`, `V`, and `B` generator submatrices are accessed.\n\nTherefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all these generator matrices:\nTotal submatrices = (Number of `D` matrices) + (Number of `U` matrices) + (Number of `V` matrices) + (Number of `B` matrices)\nTotal submatrices = 16 + 15 + 15 + 30 = 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
