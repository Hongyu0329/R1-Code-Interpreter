    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the given 8-point sequence, we must first determine the original 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`, from their respective DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n### 1. Find the sequence x(n) from X(k)\nThe sequence `x(n)` is the Inverse DFT (IDFT) of `X(k)`. The IDFT is given by the formula:\n`x(n) = (1/4) * Σ_{k=0}^{3} X(k) * W_4^{kn}` where `W_4 = e^{j2π/4} = j`.\n\nGiven `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`, we can see that `X(k) = j^k`. The IDFT of `j^k` corresponds to a shifted delta function. Let's calculate it explicitly:\n*   `x(0) = (1/4) * (X(0) + X(1) + X(2) + X(3)) = (1/4) * (1 + j - 1 - j) = 0`\n*   `x(1) = (1/4) * (X(0) + j*X(1) + j^2*X(2) + j^3*X(3)) = (1/4) * (1 + j*j -1*(-1) -j*(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0`\n*   `x(2) = (1/4) * (X(0) + j^2*X(1) + j^4*X(2) + j^6*X(3)) = (1/4) * (1 -1*j + 1*(-1) -1*(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 - j - 1 + j) = 0`\n*   `x(3) = (1/4) * (X(0) + j^3*X(1) + j^6*X(2) + j^9*X(3)) = (1/4) * (1 -j*j -1*(-1) +j*(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1`\n\nSo, the sequence `x(n)` is `{0, 0, 0, 1}`.\n\n### 2. Find the sequence h(n) from H(k)\nSimilarly, we find the IDFT for `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n*   `h(0) = (1/4) * (H(0) + H(1) + H(2) + H(3)) = (1/4) * (0 + 1+j + 1 + 1-j) = 3/4`\n*   `h(1) = (1/4) * (H(0) + j*H(1) + j^2*H(2) + j^3*H(3)) = (1/4) * (0 + j(1+j) -1(1) -j(1-j)) = (1/4) * (j-1-1-j-1) = -3/4`\n*   `h(2) = (1/4) * (H(0) + j^2*H(1) + j^4*H(2) + j^6*H(3)) = (1/4) * (0 -1(1+j) +1(1) -1(1-j)) = (1/4) * (-1-j+1-1+j) = -1/4`\n*   `h(3) = (1/4) * (H(0) + j^3*H(1) + j^6*H(2) + j^9*H(3)) = (1/4) * (0 -j(1+j) -1(1) +j(1-j)) = (1/4) * (1-j-1+j+1) = 1/4`\n\nSo, the sequence `h(n)` is `{0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25}`.\n\n### 3. Construct the 8-point interleaved sequence y(n)\nThe problem defines the sequence `y(n)` by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nSubstituting the values we found:\n`y(n) = {0, 0.75, 0, -0.75, 0, -0.25, 1, 0.25}`\n\n### 4. Find the 4-point DFT\nThe question asks for the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence. This is a non-standard operation that implies a reduction from 8 points to 4. A standard method for this is to use time-aliasing, where the 8-point sequence is \"wrapped\" and summed into a 4-point sequence.\nLet the aliased sequence be `y_alias(n)`. For `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n`y_alias(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`\n*   `y_alias(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n*   `y_alias(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 0.75 + (-0.25) = 0.5`\n*   `y_alias(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n*   `y_alias(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -0.75 + 0.25 = -0.5`\n\nThe resulting 4-point sequence is `y_alias(n) = {0, 0.5, 1, -0.5}`.\n\nNow, we compute the 4-point DFT of `y_alias(n)`, let's call it `Y_4(k)`.\nThe DFT formula is `Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y_alias(n) * W_4^{-kn}`.\n*   `Y_4(0) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1`\n*   `Y_4(1) = 0 - j(0.5) - 1(1) + j(-0.5) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y_4(2) = 0 - 1(0.5) + 1(1) - 1(-0.5) = -0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 1`\n*   `Y_4(3) = 0 + j(0.5) - 1(1) - j(-0.5) = -1 + j`\n\nThe 4-point DFT of the sequence is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
