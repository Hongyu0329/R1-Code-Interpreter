    "Easter Island is home to the town of Hanga Roa, which sits on a bay of the same name and is located more than 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island.\n\nEaster Island, a territory of Chile, is renowned for its extreme isolation in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It lies approximately 1,900 kilometers east of Pitcairn Island and over 3,500 kilometers west of mainland Chile, making it one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth.\n\nThe island's landscape is a direct result of volcanic activity, primarily formed by three extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, Poike, and Rano Kau. The main town and harbor of the island is Hanga Roa. In the local Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay,\" signifying that the town and the bay it is situated on share the same name.\n\nHanga Roa is located on the island's west coast, nestled in the lowlands between the Maunga Terevaka and Rano Kau volcanoes. The impressive Rano Kau volcano features a large crater lake, and from its slopes, one can enjoy panoramic views of Hanga Roa bay. While the bay itself is not a classic caldera in the way the crater of Rano Kau is, the town and its bay are intrinsically linked to the island's volcanic geography.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
