    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. When viewed as a matrix, with different colors assigned different numerical values to maximize rank, the Danish flag's structure of a single-colored cross on a solid background results in a maximal rank of 2. This is because all rows in the flag's matrix can be described as linear combinations of just two basis vectors: one representing the solid background color and another representing the color and position of the horizontal crossbar.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify African flags which also have a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2. This analysis assumes that each distinct color on a flag is assigned a unique numerical value to maximize the rank. Flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes of solid colors, for example, have a rank of 1, as all rows or columns are scalar multiples of a single vector. A flag must possess a more complex geometric structure to achieve a rank of 2.\n\nThe African nations whose flags have a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2 are:\n\n*   **Algeria:** The flag consists of a vertical bicolor of green and white, with a red crescent and star in the center. The matrix representing this flag is fundamentally defined by two basis vectors: one for the vertical color division and a second for the central symbol.\n*   **Angola:** The flag features two horizontal bands of red and black with a central gold emblem. The structure, comprising two colored stripes and a central symbol, results in a rank of 2, as all rows can be constructed from a basis vector for the stripes and a basis vector for the symbol.\n*   **Benin:** The flag is composed of two horizontal bands (yellow and red) alongside a vertical green band. The columns of its matrix representation are spanned by two linearly independent vectors: one for the solid green vertical band and another for the two-colored horizontal bands.\n*   **Egypt:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black, with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the central white stripe. The presence of the central emblem on a field of horizontal stripes gives the flag's matrix a rank of 2.\n*   **Libya:** The current flag has three horizontal stripes of red, black, and green, with a white crescent and star in the center of the middle black stripe. Similar to Egypt, the central symbol on a striped field results in a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** This flag has two horizontal bands of red and green with a white vertical band at the hoist. Much like Benin's flag, its structure is defined by two basis vectors in its column space, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Mauritania:** The flag has a green field with a gold crescent and star, and red bands at the top and bottom. The combination of the horizontal stripes and the central emblem creates a structure with a rank of 2.\n*   **Morocco:** A green pentagram (known as the Seal of Solomon) is centered on a solid red field. This design, a single symbol on a monochromatic background, is defined by two basis vectors: one for the field and one for the star.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag consists of a single white five-pointed star on a light blue field. Like Morocco, this simple design of a symbol on a solid background results in a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Egypt, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Somalia>>>"
