    "In the context of the spectral theory of automorphic forms, the question of finding an upper bound for the maximum norm of an eigenform in relation to the covolume of the underlying space is a central topic known as the sup-norm problem. The notation provided, while not standard, can be interpreted within this framework.\n\nSpecifically, for a squarefree natural number $N$, one typically considers the space $X_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\setminus\\mathbb{H}$, which is the modular curve associated with the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The covolume $(V)$ of this space is the volume of the fundamental domain, given by $V = \\text{vol}(X_0(N)) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. For squarefree $N$, the covolume is therefore directly proportional to $N$, so bounds are often expressed in terms of $N$.\n\nThe term \"maximum norm,\" denoted in the query as $(k_{k,\\infty})$, refers to the sup-norm or $L^\\infty$-norm, written as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$. These forms are joint eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and all Hecke operators. The forms are typically assumed to be $L^2$-normalized, meaning $\\|f\\|_2 = 1$. The problem then is to find the best possible upper bound for $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ in terms of the level $N$ (and thus the covolume $V$) and the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\nThe \"trivial bound\" in the level aspect, for a fixed eigenvalue and squarefree level $N$, is generally considered to be $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll N^{1/2+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Research in this area focuses on obtaining \"sub-convexity\" bounds that improve upon this exponent of $1/2$.\n\nFor Hecke-Maass newforms with a squarefree level $N$, significant progress has been made. A key result provides a hybrid bound that is uniform in both the level $N$ and the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the upper bound on its sup-norm is given by:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nThis bound was established by Abhishek Saha and generalized a previous result by Nicolas Templier. Given that the covolume $V$ is of the order $N$ for squarefree $N$, this bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume as:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon}$\n\nIf we consider the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ to be fixed and are only interested in the dependence on the level (the \"level aspect\"), this result implies the bound $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\n{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$, which is a substantial improvement over the trivial bound of $N^{1/2+\\epsilon}$.\n\n<<<$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon}$>>>"
