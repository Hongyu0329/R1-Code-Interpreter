    "The $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle for the BDFk methods is a classical result in numerical analysis. The stability region of a linear multistep method, like BDF4, determines for which step sizes $h$ and eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of a system the numerical solution remains stable. A method is called $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $|\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha$, where $z=h\\lambda$.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the exact value of the stability angle $\\alpha$ has been a subject of study, with precise values being derived more recently. This angle is determined by finding the tangent to the boundary of the stability region that passes through the origin. The angle of this tangent line with the negative real axis gives $\\alpha$.\n\nThe exact value for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle of the BDF4 method is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{870 - 9\\sqrt{2033}}}{93}\\right)$\n\nThis result can be found in academic literature, with researchers like Akrivis and Katsoprinakis providing exact expressions for the stability angles of BDF methods. The derivation involves analyzing the stability polynomial of the BDF4 method on the unit circle.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{870 - 9\\sqrt{2033}}}{93}\\right)$>>>"
