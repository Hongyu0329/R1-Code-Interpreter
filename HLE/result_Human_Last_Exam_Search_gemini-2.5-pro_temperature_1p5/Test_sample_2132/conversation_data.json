    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when treated with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. This reaction is a characteristic ring contraction of a cyclic α-halo ketone.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on information theory, considering its chemical microenvironments, stereochemistry, and symmetry. While a precise value can be calculated, it is not readily available in public databases. For instance, the PubChem database provides a \"Complexity\" value of 114 for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, but this is calculated using the Bertz complexity index, which is a different metric from the Böttcher score.\n\nTo obtain the Böttcher Molecular Complexity, one would need to use a specialized tool such as the \"Böttcher Score calculator\" web service.\n\nSince the calculated value is not available in the search results, a definitive numerical answer for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity cannot be provided.\n\n<<<The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is not publicly listed.>>>"
