    "In the Viennese Waltz, it is considered impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally disregarding the dance's technique.\n\nThe Viennese Waltz is characterized by its high speed and continuous, flowing movement, which progresses linearly down the line of dance. The technique for the reverse turn is designed to travel straight along the long sides of the ballroom. Attempting to overturn a reverse turn, which would be necessary to navigate a corner, is described as \"very difficult\" and \"extremely hard\" for the partner moving forward due to the rapid tempo.\n\nFor this reason, experienced dancers do not use an overturned reverse turn to change direction. Instead, the standard technique involves using an under-turned Natural Turn to navigate corners. This established practice underscores that forcing an overturn on a reverse turn would violate the core principles of movement, progression, and partnership that define the Viennese Waltz technique.\n\nIn other dances like the English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning various figures is a recognized and utilized part of the technical repertoire. In Tango, while the technique is precise, advanced figures like the \"Overturned Five Step\" exist, indicating that overturning is a valid technical concept within the dance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
