    "Based on the interpretation provided, which references a foundational religious and legal text, the individual \"HE\" is Moses.\n\nThe work in question is the Ten Commandments, as recorded in the biblical books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. At the end of this set of laws, the Tenth Commandment specifically addresses the desire for another's material possessions: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\"\n\nThe \"prohibition against representation\" refers to an earlier commandment, the one forbidding the creation of graven images or idols. The final commandment against coveting shifts the focus from an external act of idol-making to an internal one of desire. By addressing a sin of the mind or heart, it deals with a mental \"representation\" of a desired object, thus moving beyond the physical act of carving an image.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
