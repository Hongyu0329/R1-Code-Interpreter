    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using the principle of duality, we first consider the dual system and transform it into controllable canonical form.\n\nThe given system is:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nWith matrices:\nA = [,,]\nC = [,]\n\n### Step 1: Define the Dual System\n\nThe dual system is defined by the transposes of the original system's matrices. Let the dual system be:\nx_d(k+1) = A_d * x_d(k) + B_d * u_d(k)\ny_d(k) = C_d * x_d(k)\n\nWhere:\nA_d = A^T = [,,]\nB_d = C^T = [,,]\nC_d = B^T (In this autonomous system, B is zero, so we consider the dual of (A,C) to be (A^T, C^T) for the purpose of finding the canonical form).\n\nThe principle of duality states that the observer canonical form of a system (A, C) is given by the transpose of the controllable canonical form of its dual (A^T, C^T). Specifically, A_observer = A_controller^T and C_observer = B_controller^T.\n\n### Step 2: Transform the Dual System to Controllable Canonical Form\n\nThe dual system has a multi-input matrix B_d. The controllable canonical form is not unique in this case. A standard approach is to find a transformation based on one of the inputs (or a linear combination of them) that makes the system controllable. We will use the first input column of B_d, which corresponds to the first output row of C.\n\nLet b_d1 be the first column of B_d, so b_d1 =^T.\n\nFirst, we check if the pair (A_d, b_d1) is controllable by checking the rank of the controllability matrix Mc = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, A_d^2*b_d1].\n*   A_d * b_d1 = [,,] *^T =^T\n*   A_d^2 * b_d1 = A_d *^T = [,,] *^T =^T\n*   Mc = [,,]\n\nThe determinant of Mc is det(Mc) = 0 - 2*(1-0) + 4*(1-0) = 2. Since the determinant is non-zero, the rank is 3, and the pair (A_d, b_d1) is controllable.\n\nNext, we find the characteristic polynomial of A (which is the same as for A_d):\ndet(sI - A) = det([[s-1, -1, 0], [-2, s-1, -1], [0, -2, s]])\n= (s-1)(s(s-1) - 2) + 1(-2s)\n= (s-1)(s^2 - s - 2) - 2s\n= s^3 - s^2 - 2s - s^2 + s + 2 - 2s\n= s^3 - 2s^2 - 3s + 2 = 0\n\nLet this be s^3 + a1*s^2 + a2*s + a3 = 0, so a1 = -2, a2 = -3, a3 = 2.\n\nThe transformation matrix, T_c, that transforms the dual system into controllable canonical form is given by T_c = (Mc * W)^-1, where W is a matrix formed from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.\nW = [[a2, a1, 1], [a1, 1, 0],] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0],]\nM = Mc * W = [,,] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0],]\nM = [, [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]\n\nT_c = M^-1. The inverse of M is:\nT_c = (1/-2) * [[-1, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]] = [[0.5, 0, -1], [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0]]\n\nThis transformation T_c converts (A_d, b_d1) to the controllable canonical form (A_c, b_c1).\n*   A_c = T_c * A_d * T_c^-1 = [,, [-a3, -a2, -a1]] = [,, [-2, 3, 2]]\n*   b_c1 = T_c * b_d1 = [[0.5, 0, -1], [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0]] *^T =^T\n\n### Step 3: Find the New C Matrix for the Original System\n\nNow we apply the transformation T_c to the full dual input matrix B_d to get the new input matrix for the controllable canonical form, B_c.\nB_c = T_c * B_d = [[0.5, 0, -1], [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0]] * [,,]\nB_c = [[0, 0.5], [0, 0.5], [1, 1.5]]\n\nAccording to the duality principle, the C matrix of the observer canonical form (C_o) is the transpose of the B matrix of the controllable canonical form (B_c).\nC_o = B_c^T\n\nTherefore, the new C matrix is:\nC_o = [, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]\n\n<<<[, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
