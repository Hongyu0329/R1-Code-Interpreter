    "An American in Paris (1951) was the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized recreation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the Luxor Obelisks is located.\n\nThis iconic scene, inspired by the work of French painter Raoul Dufy, was not filmed on location in Paris but on a meticulously crafted set at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios in Hollywood, California. A model of the Place de la Concorde fountain was created by designers Preston Ames and Irene Sharaff to plan the intricate choreography and camera movements for this sequence. While some establishing shots for the movie were filmed in Paris, the notable ballet sequence featuring the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk was a studio creation.\n\nPrior to 1951, no other Best Picture winner has been identified as featuring on-location footage or a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in Paris. Therefore, *An American in Paris* holds the distinction of being the first.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
