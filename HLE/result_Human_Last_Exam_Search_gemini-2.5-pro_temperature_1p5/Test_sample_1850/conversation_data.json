    "Seven historical saints are mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*. These figures, venerated as saints within various Christian traditions, play significant roles or are referenced within the epic poem's narrative and visions of the future.\n\nThe named saints include:\n\n*   **Four Archangels:** Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel are prominent angelic characters in the poem.\n    *   **Michael** leads God's army against Satan and reveals the future to Adam. In many Christian traditions, he is revered as Saint Michael the Archangel.\n    *   **Gabriel** is a chief angel who guards the Garden of Eden. He is also venerated as a saint.\n    *   **Raphael** is sent by God to warn Adam and Eve about Satan. He is recognized as a saint in several Christian denominations.\n    *   **Uriel**, the \"regent of the sun,\" is tricked by Satan but later reports the fiend's presence. The Anglican and Eastern Orthodox churches consider Uriel a saint.\n\n*   **Three Biblical Figures:**\n    *   **Adam and Eve**, the first man and woman and the central figures of the poem's narrative, are considered saints in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, with their feast day on December 24.\n    *   **Enoch**, the righteous man who \"was not, for God took him,\" is mentioned by name in the visions Michael shows to Adam. He is considered an example of a \"translated saint\" and is venerated in several Christian traditions.\n    *   **Abel** is also mentioned by name when Adam is shown the first murder in a vision. He is regarded as the first martyr and a saint.\n\nWhile other biblical figures are present, and the term \"saints\" is used to refer to the angels generally, these seven individuals are the specifically named characters in *Paradise Lost* who are also recognized as historical saints.\n\n<<<7>>>"
