    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This principle of additivity is a key feature of topological invariants like the Chern number.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the global properties of the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional material. When two such systems are brought into contact with minimal disruption (i.e., a negligible tunneling barrier), their topological characters combine. Therefore, for the described junction, the total Chern number is calculated as:\n\nC_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe negligible tunneling barrier ensures that the system behaves as a single topological entity. The additivity of the Chern number implies that the quantized Hall conductance of the combined system will be proportional to the sum of the individual Chern numbers. Furthermore, the interface between materials with different Chern numbers can host chiral edge states. While each Chern insulator individually has a single chiral edge state at its boundary with a vacuum (a trivial insulator with Chern number 0), the combined system with a total Chern number of 2 will exhibit two such states at its outer edges.\n\n<<<2>>>"
