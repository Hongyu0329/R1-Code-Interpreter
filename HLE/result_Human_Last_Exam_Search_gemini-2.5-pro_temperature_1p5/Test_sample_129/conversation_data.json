    "After a detailed analysis of the possible valid expression structures and cross-checking my logic, the search results do not directly answer the question for a specific expression length and symbol set. The search results discuss the total number of boolean functions for 'n' variables (which is 2^(2^n)) or the number of semantically different functions (related to Dedekind's numbers for monotonic functions), rather than the number of syntactically distinct true expressions of a fixed length. Problems like this, often referred to as #SAT, are known to be computationally hard, and a general formula is unlikely.\n\nMy approach of systematically enumerating all possible valid syntactic structures of length 5 and then counting how many of them evaluate to true appears to be the most viable method. My analysis identified 13 distinct structural patterns for a 5-symbol expression.\n\nHere is the final summary of the distinct structures and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n*   **No Parentheses:**\n    1.  `!!!!L` (e.g., `!!!!T`): 1 true expression.\n    2.  `L op L op L` (e.g., `T&T|F`): 18 true expressions.\n    3.  `!!L op L` (e.g., `!!T&T`): 4 true expressions.\n    4.  `L op !!L` (e.g., `T&!!T`): 4 true expressions.\n    5.  `!L op !L` (e.g., `!F&!F`): 4 true expressions.\n\n*   **With Parentheses:**\n    6.  `(L op L)` (e.g., `(T&T)`): 4 true expressions.\n    7.  `(!!L)` (e.g., `(!!T)`): 1 true expression.\n    8.  `((L))` (e.g., `((T))`): 1 true expression.\n    9.  `L op (L)` (e.g., `T&(T)`): 4 true expressions.\n    10. `(L) op L` (e.g., `(T)&T`): 4 true expressions.\n    11. `!!!(L)` (e.g., `!!!(F)`): 1 true expression.\n    12. `!((L))` (e.g., `!((F))`): 1 true expression.\n    13. `(L) op (L)` (e.g., `(T)|(F)`): 4 true expressions.\n\nAdding the counts from these 13 distinct structural categories gives the total number of unique true expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nTotal = 1 + 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 51.\n\n<<<51>>>"
