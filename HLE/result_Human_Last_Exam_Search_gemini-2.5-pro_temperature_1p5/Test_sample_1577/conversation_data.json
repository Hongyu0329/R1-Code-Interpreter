    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a simple, closed surface without holes, such as a sphere, the ground state is non-degenerate (GSD = 1). When the surface has non-trivial topology, such as handles or holes, the number of degenerate ground states increases.\n\nThe toric code on a torus, a surface with genus one, has a four-fold degenerate ground state. This can be understood as 2^(2g), where g is the genus of the surface. A torus has g=1.\n\nWhen considering a surface with boundaries, such as a plane or a cylinder, holes can be introduced. These holes act as defects in the lattice and are often referred to as \"punctures\". There are two primary types of boundaries (and thus holes) in the toric code, known as \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries.\n\nThe key principle for determining the ground state degeneracy is that each independent, non-trivial loop operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian introduces a twofold degeneracy. For the toric code, these are the logical operators, which are strings of Pauli-X or Pauli-Z operators.\n\nWhen a hole is created in the toric code lattice, it introduces a new type of non-contractible loop that can enclose the hole. This leads to the creation of a new logical qubit, which has two states, thereby doubling the ground state degeneracy. Several sources confirm this principle, stating that \"each puncture doubles the size of the ground-state degeneracy\" and \"The degeneracy of the ground state doubles for each hole\".\n\nWhether a hole is \"smooth\" or \"rough\" determines the type of logical operator associated with it (typically, Z-type for one and X-type for the other), but both types of holes contribute to the degeneracy. Therefore, if we have a surface with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, each of the *(n+m)* holes will independently contribute a factor of 2 to the total ground state degeneracy.\n\nStarting with a base degeneracy for the underlying surface (for a plane or sphere, the GSD is 1), the total degeneracy is calculated by multiplying this base by 2 for each hole.\n\nTherefore, the ground space degeneracy for a toric code with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes is 2 multiplied by itself *(n+m)* times, which is expressed as **2^(n+m)**.\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that each hole can be used to store one logical qubit, and a system with *k* qubits has 2^*k* states. Here, the number of logical qubits is *n+m*.\n\n<<<A>>>"
