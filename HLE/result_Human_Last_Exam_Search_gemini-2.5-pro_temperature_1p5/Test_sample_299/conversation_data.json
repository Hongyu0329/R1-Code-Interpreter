    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### **Analysis of Potential Solutions**\n\nA function $f$ that satisfies the given equation must be injective (one-to-one). This is because if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$, and therefore $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nA continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic, meaning it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n#### **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, then the composition $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing. While this is consistent with the behavior of $e^x$, we can show that no such decreasing solution exists.\n\nLet $f$ be a strictly decreasing continuous function defined on all real numbers.\n1.  As $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x)$ must approach a limit $L$, which can be a real number or $-\\infty$.\n2.  The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ implies that as $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) \\to \\infty$.\n3.  Let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y$ approaches $L$ from above. The limit of $f(f(x))$ becomes $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y)$.\n4.  For this limit to be $\\infty$, $f$ must have a vertical asymptote at $L$. However, a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot have a vertical asymptote. This means $L$ cannot be a real number, so we must have $L = -\\infty$.\n5.  If $L = -\\infty$, then as $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to -\\infty$. Consequently, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a limit $M = +\\infty$.\n6.  Now, consider the behavior as $x \\to -\\infty$. The right side of the equation, $e^x$, approaches 0.\n7.  The left side is $f(f(x))$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = L = -\\infty$.\n8.  This leads to the contradiction $-\\infty = 0$.\n\nTherefore, no continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can satisfy the equation.\n\n#### **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing**\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly increasing function, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $e^x$. The existence of such functions, known as functional square roots or half-exponentials, is a classic result in the theory of functional equations.\n\nConstructing these solutions is complex, but the general method involves defining the function on a specific interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the properties of the exponential function. The construction allows for a certain degree of freedom. For instance, one can choose an arbitrary, strictly increasing continuous function that meets certain boundary conditions on a segment of an orbit of the function $g(x)=e^x$, and this choice determines the solution over the entire orbit.\n\nThe set of all real numbers can be partitioned into a disjoint union of orbits under the action of the exponential function. The number of these orbits is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For each orbit, there is a continuum of ways to define a valid function segment.\n\nWhile it might seem that this would lead to a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\mathfrak{c}} = 2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$, the requirement of continuity across all of $\\mathbb{R}$ imposes constraints that tie the choices on different orbits together. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the set of rational numbers. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the number of solutions cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe freedom in the construction, such as choosing an initial function on a given interval, demonstrates the existence of infinitely many solutions. These choices can be made in a way that generates a set of solutions with the same cardinality as the real numbers.\n\nThus, the set of increasing continuous solutions has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSince there are no decreasing solutions and the set of increasing solutions has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, the total cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $|\\mathbb{R}|$).>>>"
