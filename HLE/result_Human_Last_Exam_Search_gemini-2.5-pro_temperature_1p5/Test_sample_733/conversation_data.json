    "There are four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA 2009 paper by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart titled \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" provides a complete classification of finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. In the context of group theory, these sets are also referred to as \"maximal sum-free sets\" where the group operation is considered addition.\n\nThe four groups are:\n*   **The cyclic group of order 6 (C₆)**\n*   **The dihedral group of order 8 (D₈)**\n*   **The quaternion group of order 8 (Q₈)**\n*   **The dihedral group of order 10 (D₁₀)**, which is isomorphic to the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 5 by the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nA product-free set is a non-empty subset of a group where the product of any two elements (including an element with itself) is not in the set. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group. The work by Giudici and Hart built upon earlier research into these structures, including investigations by Street and Whitehead. While the classification also identifies other groups with maximal product-free sets of different sizes, for the specific case of size 2, these four groups are the complete list.\n\n<<<4>>>"
