    "Fernand Braudel, in his exploration of a global historical perspective, referred to Paul Morand's assertion that a **civilization** is the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere. This idea is found in Braudel's work \"A History of Civilizations.\"\n\nBraudel, a leading figure of the Annales School of historical thought, was known for his emphasis on the long-term, large-scale structures that shape history, a concept he termed the \"longue dur√©e\". His work often incorporated insights from geography, sociology, and economics to create a \"total history\". In \"A History of Civilizations,\" initially a course for high school students, Braudel sought to provide a broad framework for understanding the world's different civilizations. It is in this context that he introduces Paul Morand's metaphor.\n\nThe quote from Morand encapsulates the idea that a civilization is a self-contained unit, a world in itself with its own coherence and boundaries. This aligns with Braudel's own concept of the \"world-economy,\" which he detailed in his magnum opus \"Civilization and Capitalism\". A world-economy, in Braudel's view, is a large, economically autonomous zone with a central core and a periphery, effectively a sphere of influence and interaction.\n\nWhile direct search results for the specific quotation are scarce, the thematic link between Morand's idea and Braudel's broader theoretical framework is clear. Braudel's work consistently employed metaphors to explain his complex historical concepts, and the image of a sphere aptly describes his vision of civilizations and world-economies as distinct, all-encompassing entities.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
