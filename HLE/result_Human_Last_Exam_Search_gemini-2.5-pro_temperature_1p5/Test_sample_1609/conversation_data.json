    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables is denoted by a(*n*). For a Boolean function with *n* variables, the maximum number of prime implicants is given by the formula 2^(n-1). This is because a prime implicant is a product term that cannot be simplified further, and the maximum number occurs in specific arrangements of minterms, such as in a checkerboard pattern on a Karnaugh map, where no further grouping is possible.\n\nFor a Boolean function of 4 variables (*n*=4), we can calculate a(4) using this formula:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
