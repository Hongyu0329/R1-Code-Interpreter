    "I am still in the process of analyzing the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. My initial search did not yield specific information about this exact polynomial. To determine the degrees of the normal field extensions, I first need to understand the structure of the Galois group of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This involves determining if the polynomial is reducible, and if so, how it factors. Once the Galois group is known, its normal subgroups will correspond to the normal field extensions. The degrees of these extensions are given by the indices of the corresponding normal subgroups. I need to perform further calculations to find the Galois group.\n\nI will attempt to factor the polynomial. By trying simple rational roots (divisors of the constant term -6), I can check for linear factors. If that fails, I'll look for factors of higher degrees.\n\nLet's test for rational roots $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$.\n$P(1) = 1 - 2 - 9 + 3 + 18 - 6 = 5 \\neq 0$\n$P(-1) = -1 + 2 + 9 + 3 - 18 - 6 = -11 \\neq 0$\n$P(2) = 128 - 64 - 72 + 12 + 36 - 6 = 34 \\neq 0$\n$P(-2) = -128 + 64 + 72 + 12 - 36 - 6 = -18 \\neq 0$\n$P(\\sqrt{3}) = (\\sqrt{3})^7 - 2(\\sqrt{3})^5 - 9(\\sqrt{3})^3 + 3(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 18(\\sqrt{3}) - 6 = 27\\sqrt{3} - 18\\sqrt{3} - 27\\sqrt{3} + 9 + 18\\sqrt{3} - 6 = 3 \\neq 0$.\nHowever, let's try to see if we can factor by grouping.\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\nSo, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The factors are $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe roots of $f_1(x)$ are $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $f_1(x)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a normal extension of degree 2.\nNow let's analyze $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. By Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$, this polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ be the splitting field of $f_1(x)$ and $K_2$ be the splitting field of $f_2(x)$. Then $K$ is the compositum of $K_1$ and $K_2$.\nThe Galois group of $f_1(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G_1 = \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nNow we need to find the Galois group of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, let's call it $G_2$. Since $f_2(x)$ is an irreducible quintic, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\nLet's check the discriminant of $f_2(x) = x^5+ax+b$. The discriminant is $D = 256a^5 + 3125b^4$. Here $a=-9$ and $b=3$.\n$D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nThis is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_5$.\n$f_2(x)$ has 3 real roots. Since the Galois group is not contained in $A_5$ and there are 3 real roots, the Galois group $G_2$ must be $S_5$.\nThe Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $K$ is the splitting field of the product of two polynomials, its Galois group is a subgroup of the direct product of the Galois groups of the factors.\n$G \\leq G_1 \\times G_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nSince the discriminant of $x^2-2$ is $8$ and the discriminant of $x^5-9x+3$ is negative, the fields are not linearly disjoint in a way that would make the Galois group simply the direct product. However, the intersection of the splitting fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$, as $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and the only quadratic subfield of the splitting field of an $S_5$ polynomial is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$. In our case, this is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $G = G_1 \\times G_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. The order of this group is $2 \\times 120 = 240$.\nWe are looking for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, these correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ are of the form $H_1 \\times H_2$, where $H_1$ is a normal subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_2$ is a normal subgroup of $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G$ are:\n1. $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (corresponds to $K$)\n2. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$\n3. $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n4. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$\n5. $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n6. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ (corresponds to $\\mathbb{Q}$)\n\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we exclude the subgroups that correspond to $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$. So we are interested in the subgroups 2, 3, 4, 5.\nThe degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding subgroup in $G$.\nThe indices of these subgroups are:\n- Index of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$ is $|G| / |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}| = 240 / 2 = 120$. This corresponds to the field $K_2$, the splitting field of $x^5-9x+3$.\n- Index of $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$ is $|G| / |\\{e\\} \\times A_5| = 240 / 60 = 4$. This corresponds to a field extension of degree 4.\n- Index of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$ is $|G| / |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5| = 240 / 120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_1}, \\sqrt{D_2})$. This is the compositum of the quadratic fields inside $K_1$ and $K_2$. In our case $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n- Index of $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$ is $|G| / |\\{e\\} \\times S_5| = 240 / 120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions are 2, 4, and 120.The polynomial is $P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$.\nFirst, we factor the polynomial. We can see that:\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\nLet $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field of $f_1(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This is a normal extension of degree 2.\n\nThe polynomial $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $D = 256a^5 + 3125b^4$. For $f_2(x)$, we have $a=-9$ and $b=3$, so the discriminant is $D_2 = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = -14,863,419$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group of $f_2(x)$ is not a subgroup of $A_5$. A theorem by Dummit states that an irreducible quintic with three real roots has Galois group $S_5$. The derivative $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$ has two real roots, so $f_2(x)$ has at most three real roots. As $f_2(-2)=-1, f_2(0)=3, f_2(1)=-5, f_2(2)=17$, there are indeed three real roots. Therefore, the Galois group of the splitting field $K_2$ of $f_2(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field of $P(x)$ is the compositum of $K_1$ and $K_2$, denoted $K=K_1K_2$. The intersection of these two fields is $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is because the only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is not equal to $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\nNormal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The normal subgroups of a direct product $H_1 \\times H_2$ are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1$ is a normal subgroup of $H_1$ and $N_2$ is a normal subgroup of $H_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ are:\n1. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$\n2. $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n3. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$\n4. $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n\nThe degree of the corresponding normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of the subgroup in $G$.\n1. $[G : \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}] = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$. This corresponds to the field $K_2$.\n2. $[G : \\{e\\} \\times A_5] = \\frac{240}{60} = 4$.\n3. $[G : \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5] = \\frac{240}{120} = 2$.\n4. $[G : \\{e\\} \\times S_5] = \\frac{240}{120} = 2$. This corresponds to the field $K_1$.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are the distinct values from the indices calculated above.\n\nThe degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
