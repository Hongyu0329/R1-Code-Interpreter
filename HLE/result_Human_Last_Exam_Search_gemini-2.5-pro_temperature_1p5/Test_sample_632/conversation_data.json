    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" was flanked by two small bell towers. These were removed between 1881 and 1883. The addition of the twin bell towers is often attributed to the famed architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini and was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII in 1628, though the design is also sometimes credited to Carlo Maderno.\n\nThe bell towers were a notable feature of the Pantheon's silhouette for over 250 years. However, they were met with significant criticism from the public, who derisively nicknamed them \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears). The removal of the bell towers was part of a series of efforts to restore the Pantheon to what was believed to be its original, classical appearance.\n\nThere is no record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda by the city administration in 1950. Historical accounts of the piazza's transformations focus on the 19th-century removal of the bell towers and other demolitions and alterations that occurred in different periods. It is possible there is a confusion with another location, as restorations in the 1950s that included the removal of frescoes took place at the Church of Santa Maria della Rotonda in Catania, Sicily.\n\n<<<The \"ass's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino), a pair of bell towers on the Pantheon.>>>"
