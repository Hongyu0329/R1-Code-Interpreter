    "After a gene duplication event, the two resulting gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is free from selective pressure and can accumulate mutations. Several outcomes are possible for these duplicate genes.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization (B):** This is the most common fate. One of the gene copies accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This outcome leads to the loss of a functional gene, not its retention and divergence.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization (C):** In this process, one copy of the gene retains the original function, while the other copy acquires a completely new function through mutation that proves beneficial to the organism. Natural selection then preserves this new gene, leading to the retention of both copies and their functional divergence. This is an adaptive process.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization (D):** This mechanism occurs when the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., it was active in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, complementary degenerative mutations can occur in each copy, causing one copy to lose one function and the other copy to lose a different function. As a result, both gene copies become essential to carry out the full set of the original gene's functions. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a strong mechanism for preserving both genes and allowing them to diverge in sequence and regulation. It's considered a neutral process, as it doesn't require the rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation to ensure retention.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion (A):** This is a process of non-reciprocal recombination where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. Gene conversion between duplicated genes tends to homogenize them, working against divergence, although it can occasionally create new chimeric gene variants. It is not the primary mechanism responsible for the retention *and* divergence of duplicates; in fact, it often prevents divergence.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation (E):** This is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into multiple new species that fill various ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism for the retention of duplicate genes within a genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization provides a highly plausible and common pathway for the initial preservation of both gene copies. It relies on the accumulation of relatively common degenerative mutations, which can \"lock in\" both copies by making them indispensable, without needing to wait for a rare advantageous mutation as required by neofunctionalization. For this reason, many consider it a very likely, if not the most likely, general mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
