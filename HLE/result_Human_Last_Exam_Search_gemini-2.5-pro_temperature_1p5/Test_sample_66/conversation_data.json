    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we first need to define the structure of this matrix based on the flag's design. The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper hoist (top-left) corner. This canton is charged with a red couped cross, which is described as a Greek Cross. We will assign the value `$a$` to every red pixel and `$b$` to every white pixel.\n\nLet the matrix representing the flag be denoted by `M`. We can express `M` as a block matrix:\nM = [[A, R12],\n     [R21, R22]]\n\nHere, `A` is the submatrix for the canton, while `R12`, `R21`, and `R22` are submatrices for the all-red parts of the flag. This means every element in `R12`, `R21`, and `R22` is equal to `$a$`. The matrix `A` itself is composed of red pixels (`$a$`) forming the cross and white pixels (`$b$`) forming the background of the canton.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can use row and column operations to simplify the matrix `M` without changing its rank.\n\n1.  **Simplifying the red field:** The rows of the matrix corresponding to the bottom part of the flag, `[R21, R22]`, are all identical, with every element being `$a$`. Similarly, the columns corresponding to the right part of the flag have `$a$` in all their lower rows. By subtracting the last row from all other rows and the last column from all other columns, we can show that the rank of `M` is related to the rank of the canton submatrix `A`. A more direct line of reasoning is to observe that the row space of `M` is spanned by the rows that pass through the canton and a single vector representing the all-red rows (assuming `$a \\neq 0$`). A careful analysis shows that for `$a \\neq 0$`, the rank of the flag matrix `M` is given by: `rank(M) = rank(A - aJ) + 1`, where `J` is an all-ones matrix of the same size as `A`.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the canton matrix:** The matrix `A` has entries `$a$` for the red cross and `$b$` for the white background. The matrix `A - aJ` will therefore have entries `$0$` for the red cross and `$b-a$` for the white background. If `$a=b$`, the matrix is a zero matrix, and the rank is 0. To maximize the rank, we assume `$a \\neq b$`, making `b-a` a non-zero constant. In this case, `rank(A - aJ)` is equal to the rank of a matrix `W` which has 1s for the white pixels and 0s for the red pixels of the canton.\n\n3.  **Determining the rank of W:** The matrix `W` represents the shape of the white background within the canton. The red cross is a couped Greek cross, meaning it is shaped like a plus sign and does not extend to the edges of the canton. This structure results in three distinct types of non-zero row vectors in `W`:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows corresponding to the purely white border above and below the cross. These rows consist entirely of 1s.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows corresponding to the parts of the canton to the left and right of the vertical arm of the cross. These rows will have a sequence of 0s where they intersect the vertical arm, and 1s elsewhere.\n    *   **Type 3:** Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross. In an idealized model, a horizontal bar of the cross will be solid red. This means the corresponding rows in `W` will be all-zero vectors.\n\n    Revisiting the structure based on this, the non-zero rows of `W` are of two types:\n    *   Type 1: `(1, 1, ..., 1)` (from the white border).\n    *   Type 2: `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)` (from the region of the vertical arm).\n    These two vectors are linearly independent. The rows corresponding to the horizontal red bar are zero vectors and do not contribute to the rank. Therefore, the rank of `W` is 2.\n\n4.  **Calculating the maximal rank:**\n    *   If `$a \\neq b$` and `$a \\neq 0$`, the rank of the flag matrix `M` is `rank(W) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   If `$a = 0$` and `$b \\neq 0$`, the matrix `M` has non-zero entries only in the canton, in the shape of `bW`. In this case, `rank(M) = rank(W) = 2`.\n    *   If `$a = b \\neq 0$`, the entire flag is one color, and `M` is a matrix with all entries equal to `$a$`. The rank is 1.\n    *   If `$a = b = 0$`, the matrix is all zeros, and the rank is 0.\n\nBy comparing all possible cases, the highest rank is achieved when `$a \\neq b$` and `$a \\neq 0$`. For instance, when red pixels have value `$a=1$` and white pixels have value `$b=0$`.\n\nThe maximal possible rank is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
