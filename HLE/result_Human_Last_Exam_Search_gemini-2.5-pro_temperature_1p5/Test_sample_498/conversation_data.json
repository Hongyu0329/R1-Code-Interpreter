The bottom row of letters on this type of keyboard is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M. While your provided sequence, ZXXCVYBN, has a couple of extra or out-of-place letters, it overwhelmingly follows the pattern of the bottom keyboard row. Assuming it follows this common pattern, the letter after N would be M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
