    "To find the volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, where one is shifted relative to the other by 1/2 along the main diagonal, we first need to define the cubes and the shift.\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). A shift \"along the main diagonal\" is interpreted as a shift in each coordinate. Therefore, a shift of 1/2 along the main diagonal corresponds to a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is C1 shifted by this vector. The coordinates of any point in C2 are found by adding the shift vector to the coordinates of a corresponding point in C1. This means C2 is the set of all points (x', y', z') where:\n0 + 1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both C1 and C2. For each coordinate, we find the overlapping interval by taking the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds.\n\nFor the x-coordinate: The interval is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)], which is [1/2, 1].\nFor the y-coordinate: The interval is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)], which is [1/2, 1].\nFor the z-coordinate: The interval is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)], which is [1/2, 1].\n\nThe resulting intersection is a cube with each side having a length of (1 - 1/2) = 1/2. The volume of this intersection cube is the side length cubed.\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
