    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **Ⅳ** is 4.\n*   **XXX** is 30.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII** is 3888.\n\nNow, we can write the equation with modern numbers:\n\n4 / 30 - 3888 = ?\n\nNext, we perform the calculation:\n\n4 divided by 30 is approximately 0.1333 (repeating).\n\nThen, subtract 3888 from this result:\n\n0.1333... - 3888 = -3887.8666...\n\nThe solution can also be expressed as a fraction. 4/30 simplifies to 2/15. So the equation is:\n\n2/15 - 3888 = -58318/15\n\n<<<-3887.8666...>>>"
