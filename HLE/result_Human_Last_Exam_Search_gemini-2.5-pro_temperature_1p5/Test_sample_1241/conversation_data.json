    "To find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, we first need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The given system of equations is a boundary-value problem for the Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which describes the evolution of probabilities in a continuous-time Markov process.\n\nThe given system is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392  + 0.008)P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\nwith the condition that the total probability is always one:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values $P_i$, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHowever, there is an inconsistency in the provided system of equations. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman formulation for a closed system, the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities must be zero, reflecting the conservation of total probability. If we sum the given derivatives, we get:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = -2 \\times 0.019 P_0(t) = -0.038 P_0(t)\n$$\nThis contradicts the condition that the sum of probabilities is constant. This suggests a typographical error in the problem statement, specifically in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ should likely be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ to represent the probability flow from state 0 to state 1.\n\nBy making this standard correction, the system becomes consistent, and the sum of the derivatives is zero. The corrected steady-state equations ($P_i' = 0$) are:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n3.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n4.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_0$:\n*   From (2), we get $P_1 = P_2$.\n*   From (3), we get $P_2 = P_3$.\n*   Therefore, $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n*   From (1), we have $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.65} P_0$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (4) to solve for the probabilities:\n$$\nP_0 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1 \\implies P_0 + 3P_1 = 1\n$$\nSubstitute $P_1$ in terms of $P_0$:\n$$\nP_0 + 3 \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.65} P_0 \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.057}{0.65} \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_0 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.65} \\right) = 1 \\implies P_0 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.65} \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}\n$$\nNow we find $P_1$:\n$$\nP_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.65} P_0 = \\frac{0.019}{0.65} \\times \\frac{0.65}{0.707} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n$$\nThe desired quantity is $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$$\nP_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768\n$$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the value is 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
