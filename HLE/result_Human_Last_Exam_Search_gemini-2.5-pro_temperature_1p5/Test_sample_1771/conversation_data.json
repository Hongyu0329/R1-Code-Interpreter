    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb **`*seh₂gieti`** (he/she is giving a sign, tracking), which is also the root of the Latin `sāgīre` (to perceive keenly), develops into the following forms in the Germanic languages through a series of regular sound changes.\n\nThe key transformations from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic are governed by Grimm's Law and changes in the vowel system.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** The PIE form `*séh₂gyeti` evolves into the reconstructed Proto-Germanic verb **`*sōkijaną`**, meaning \"to seek\".\n    *   The PIE root `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sōk-` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   Following Grimm's Law, the voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   The verbal suffix `*-yeti` corresponds to the Proto-Germanic class 1 weak verb infinitive ending `*-ijaną`.\n\nFrom Proto-Germanic `*sōkijaną`, the word further evolved into the early medieval Germanic languages:\n\n*   **Old Norse:** **`sœkja`**\n*   **Old English:** **`sēcan`** (also spelled `sœ̄ċan`)\n*   **Old High German:** **`suohhen`** (also spelled `suochen`)\n\nThe modern English word \"seek\" and the German \"suchen\" are direct descendants of these Old English and Old High German forms, respectively.\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
