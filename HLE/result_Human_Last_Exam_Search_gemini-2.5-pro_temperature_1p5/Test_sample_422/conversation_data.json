    "<<<In the context of the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, where \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are the only epistemic states, two significant problems arise that are not Gettier-related.\n\n**1. The Infinite Regress Problem of Justification**\n\nThe JTB model requires that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must be justified. However, this raises the question of what justifies the justification itself. If a belief 'P' is justified by another belief 'Q', then for 'P' to be considered knowledge, 'Q' must also be known. According to the JTB definition, to know 'Q', it must in turn be a justified, true belief. This justification for 'Q', let's call it 'R', must also be known, leading to an endless chain of required justifications (P requires Q, which requires R, and so on). This argument, known as an epistemic regress, suggests that no belief can ever be fully justified because the process of justification can be questioned endlessly. This creates a foundational crisis for knowledge, as it implies that a definitive starting point for justification is impossible.\n\n**2. The Demarcation Problem for Justification**\n\nThe JTB definition asserts that a belief must be \"justified\" to become knowledge, but it fails to specify a clear threshold for what level of justification is sufficient. This leads to what is known as a demarcation problem: a difficulty in drawing a distinct line between a well-supported true belief and a \"justified\" true belief that qualifies as knowledge. In a system with only two states—Belief and Knowledge—this problem becomes more pronounced. There is no intermediate ground, so a belief must abruptly transition from being a mere belief to becoming knowledge. Without a clear, non-arbitrary standard for what constitutes adequate justification, it is impossible to determine the exact point at which a true belief has been justified enough to be considered knowledge. This ambiguity makes the \"justification\" component of the JTB definition problematic for practical application.>>>"
