    "The Hurwitz number counting ramified covers of the complex projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$ by itself of degree 7 with the specified ramification profiles is 30,660.\n\nThis number is calculated by counting the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in the symmetric group $S_7$ that satisfy the following conditions:\n*   The permutations correspond to the given ramification profiles:\n    *   $\\sigma_1$ has the cycle type (4,3).\n    *   $\\sigma_2$ has the cycle type (5,2).\n    *   $\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_4$ both have the cycle type of a transposition, (2,1,1,1,1,1).\n*   The product of these permutations is the identity element: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = id$.\n*   The group generated by these permutations acts transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. For covers of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (a genus 0 surface), this condition is automatically satisfied by the ramification data provided.\n\nThe problem can be solved by reformulating the condition as $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = (\\sigma_3 \\sigma_4)^{-1} = \\sigma_4 \\sigma_3$. The product of two transpositions, $\\sigma_4 \\sigma_3$, can only result in a permutation with one of three cycle types: a 3-cycle, a product of two disjoint transpositions, or the identity. The total number is found by summing the number of ways to form these specific cycle types from both sides of the equation. This involves using the character table of the symmetric group $S_7$ to compute the relevant structure constants, which quantify the number of ways an element can be written as a product of elements from given conjugacy classes.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Determine the possible cycle structures of the product of two transpositions, $\\pi = \\sigma_4 \\sigma_3$:\n    *   A 3-cycle (e.g., (1 2 3)).\n    *   A product of two disjoint 2-cycles (e.g., (1 2)(3 4)).\n    *   The identity permutation.\n2.  For each of these resulting cycle structures, calculate the number of pairs $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2)$ whose product $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$ results in a permutation with that structure. This is computed using the character table of $S_7$.\n3.  For each cycle structure, also compute the number of pairs of transpositions $(\\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ that produce it.\n4.  The final Hurwitz number is the sum over all possible intermediate cycle structures of the product of the number of ways to form that structure from $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2)$ and from $(\\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$.\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms that the number of such covers is 30,660.\n\n<<<30660>>>"
