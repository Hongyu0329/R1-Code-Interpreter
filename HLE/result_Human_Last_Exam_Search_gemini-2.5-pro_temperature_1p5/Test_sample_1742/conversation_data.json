    "In the category of modules over the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module is the direct sum of the indecomposable projective module at vertex 1 ($P_1$), the indecomposable projective module at vertex 3 ($P_3$), and the indecomposable module with dimension vector (1,1,0) ($M_{1,2}$).\n\nLet's denote the indecomposable modules by $M_{i,j}$ for the module corresponding to the path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. The indecomposable modules for $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ are:\n*   $P_1 = M_{1,3}$ (the indecomposable projective at vertex 1, which is also injective)\n*   $P_2 = M_{2,3}$ (the indecomposable projective at vertex 2)\n*   $P_3 = M_{3,3}$ (the simple projective module at vertex 3)\n*   $M_{1,2}$ (which is also the injective module $I_2$)\n*   $M_{2,2}$ (the simple module $S_2$)\n*   $M_{1,1}$ (the simple injective module $I_1$)\n\nA module is a $\\tau$-tilting module for a hereditary algebra if it is a tilting module. A tilting module $T$ is a direct sum of $n$ (in this case, 3) non-isomorphic indecomposable modules such that $\\operatorname{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$.\n\nA tilting module is a slice module if its indecomposable summands form a slice in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. A key property of a slice is that it is an antichain in the AR-quiver, meaning there are no paths of irreducible maps between any two distinct modules in the slice.\n\nFor the path algebra of type $A_3$, there are four sincere tilting modules. Three of these are slice modules, while one is not. The module that is not a slice module is:\n$T = P_1 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus M_{1,2}$\n\nThis module is a tilting module because the Ext-group between any pair of its summands is zero. However, it is not a slice module because its summands do not form an antichain in the Auslander-Reiten quiver. Specifically, there is an irreducible map (and thus a path) from $P_1 = M_{1,3}$ to $M_{1,2}$ in the AR-quiver.\n\n<<<>>>$P_1 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus M_{1,2}$"
