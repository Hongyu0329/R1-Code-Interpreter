    "Based on a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems, the specific number of non-Grassman variables required can be determined.\n\nThe model in question is characterized by symmetry class D and involves two replicas (n=2). For this specific configuration, the target manifold of the sigma-model is a symmetric superspace represented by the coset G/K. According to recent literature, for class D with n replicas, this coset is identified as SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n).\n\nThe non-Grassman variables, which are the bosonic variables, are those that parametrize the bosonic part of this superspace. The bosonic part of the G/K manifold is given by the coset of the respective maximal bosonic subgroups, G_B/K_B.\n\nFor the specified case with two replicas (n=2), the superspace is G/K = SpO(4,R|4)/U(2|2).\n\n*   The maximal bosonic subgroup G_B of the orthosymplectic group G = SpO(4,R|4) is the real symplectic group Sp(4,R).\n*   The maximal bosonic subgroup K_B of the unitary supergroup K = U(2|2) is the product of two unitary groups, U(2) x U(2).\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables needed for the parametrization is therefore the dimension of the resulting bosonic manifold G_B/K_B = Sp(4,R) / (U(2) x U(2)). The dimension of this coset space is calculated as the difference between the dimensions of the respective Lie groups:\n\n*   The dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2m,R) is given by the formula m(2m+1). For Sp(4,R), where m=2, the dimension is 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(m) is m². For U(2), the dimension is 2² = 4.\n*   The dimension of the product group U(2) x U(2) is the sum of their individual dimensions, which is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSubtracting the dimension of the subgroup from the dimension of the group gives the dimension of the coset manifold:\n\nDimension(Sp(4,R) / (U(2) x U(2))) = dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2) x U(2)) = 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nThus, two non-Grassman variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of this model.\n\n<<<2>>>"
