    "The next number in the sequence is 2400.\n\nThe provided sequence consists of numbers that are multiples of 6. A detailed analysis of the differences between consecutive numbers does not reveal a simple arithmetic pattern. Similarly, properties like the sum of digits or prime factorization do not unveil a straightforward rule.\n\nHowever, a closer inspection suggests a more subtle property of the digits of the numbers in the sequence. The rule appears to be that the sequence includes multiples of 6 which do not contain any three consecutive digits in increasing order. For example, the number 123 is a multiple of 3 but it would be excluded. Similarly, a number like 4567 would be excluded because of the subsequence \"4, 5, 6\" and \"5, 6, 7\".\n\nLet's verify this rule with a number that is a multiple of 6 but is not in the sequence, for example, 1026. The digits are 1, 0, 2, 6. While the first three digits (1, 0, 2) are not strictly increasing, the number is still excluded. A more careful inspection of the provided numbers and the skipped multiples of 6 suggests the rule is related to the digits but is more complex than initially assumed.\n\nLet's test another hypothesis. Let's analyze skipped multiples of 6.\nThe sequence starts with 1014. The next multiple of 6 is 1020, which is in the sequence. The next is 1026. `1,0,2,6` contains an increasing subsequence of three digits: 1, 2, 6. Let's assume this is the exclusion rule: multiples of 6 that have an increasing subsequence of three digits are excluded.\n\n*   **1014**: Digits are 1,0,1,4. No increasing subsequence of length 3. It's in.\n*   **1020**: Digits are 1,0,2,0. No increasing subsequence of length 3. It's in.\n*   **1026** (multiple of 6, not in sequence): Digits 1,0,2,6. Subsequence 1,2,6 is increasing. It's out.\n*   **1032**: Digits 1,0,3,2. No increasing subsequence of length 3. It's in.\n*   **1038** (multiple of 6, not in sequence): Digits 1,0,3,8. Subsequence 1,3,8 is increasing. It's out.\n\nThis pattern seems to hold for the beginning of the sequence. Let's check the end of the sequence.\nThe last number is 2352. The next multiples of 6 are:\n*   **2358**: Digits are 2,3,5,8. The subsequence 2,3,5 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2364**: Digits are 2,3,6,4. The subsequence 2,3,6 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2370**: Digits are 2,3,7,0. The subsequence 2,3,7 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2376**: Digits are 2,3,7,6. The subsequence 2,3,7 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2382**: Digits are 2,3,8,2. The subsequence 2,3,8 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2388**: Digits are 2,3,8,8. The subsequence 2,3,8 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2394**: Digits are 2,3,9,4. The subsequence 2,3,9 is increasing. Excluded.\n*   **2400**: Digits are 2,4,0,0. There is no increasing subsequence of length three. It's a multiple of 6. Thus, it should be the next number in the sequence.\n\n<<<2400>>>"
