    "The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle, according to the best-known data, is C₁.\n\nThis determination is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings maintained on the Packomania website by Eckard Specht. In the data tables provided on this site, there is a designated column for the symmetry group of each packing, presented in Schoenflies notation. The key for the table explicitly states that if the symmetry group field is empty, the packing possesses C₁ symmetry. For the entry corresponding to N=1135 circles, the symmetry group field is empty, leading to the conclusion that its symmetry is C₁.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
