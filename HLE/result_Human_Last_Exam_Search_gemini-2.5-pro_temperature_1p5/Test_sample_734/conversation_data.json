    "Augustine of Hippo is the Christian theologian who first developed the specialized terminology of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*) to describe changes in the laws of nature, a concept applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws following the Fall.\n\nAugustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentialities within the fabric of the natural world. This framework allowed him to explain how creation could be considered complete while still accounting for the emergence of new things, including miraculous events.\n\nHis key ideas on this topic include:\n*   **Miracles as Potentialities:** According to Augustine, a miracle is not an event that runs contrary to nature itself, but one that is contrary to our limited *understanding* of nature (*non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura*). Miracles are the actualization of these hidden \"seminal reasons,\" which God alone can activate outside of the usual, observable causal chain. The turning of water into wine, for instance, is presented as an instantaneous development of a potentiality that nature usually unfolds over a longer period.\n\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is understood within this framework as a unique miracle and a significant sign. Augustine taught that Mary's ability to conceive without conforming to the normal \"law of the sinful flesh\" was part of God's predestined plan, implying a pre-ordained potentiality activated by divine power. He saw the event as fitting and miraculous, signifying that just as the Head of the Church (Christ) was born physically from a virgin, its members (Christians) would be born spiritually from a virgin Church.\n\n*   **Application to the Fall:** The doctrine of seminal reasons also provided a framework for understanding the consequences of the Fall of Man. It allowed Augustine to explain how humanity could be seminally present in Adam and thus inherit the penal conditions resulting from his sin. This concept addressed how the nature of humanity and the world could be altered from its original state, as the consequences were latent possibilities from the beginning, triggered by the misuse of free will.\n\nWhile Thomas Aquinas later developed his own related terminology, such as \"obediential potency\" (the capacity of a creature to obey God's will to produce effects beyond its natural power), he built upon the foundation laid centuries earlier by Augustine. Therefore, Augustine was the first to develop this specific and influential theological vocabulary.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
