    "There are 14 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be O₁ and O₂. Any category with two objects must have at least two morphisms, the identity morphisms `id₁` for O₁ and `id₂` for O₂. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\nWe can classify the categories by how the four morphisms are distributed among the four possible `Hom`-sets: `Hom(O₁, O₁)`, `Hom(O₁, O₂)`, `Hom(O₂, O₁)` and `Hom(O₂, O₂)`. Let `hᵢⱼ = |Hom(Oᵢ, Oⱼ)|`. We must have `h₁₁ ≥ 1`, `h₂₂ ≥ 1`, and the sum `h₁₁ + h₁₂ + h₂₁ + h₂₂ = 4`.\n\nThe non-isomorphic categories are found by considering the different partitions of the 4 morphisms and the valid composition rules for each partition:\n\n1.  **Disconnected objects with endomorphisms**: This corresponds to the case where there are no morphisms between O₁ and O₂ (`h₁₂ = 0`, `h₂₁ = 0`).\n    *   `h₁₁ = 2`, `h₂₂ = 2`: `Hom(O₁, O₁)` contains `id₁` and `f`. The composition `f ∘ f` can be `id₁` (forming the cyclic group C₂) or `f` (forming a 2-element monoid M₂). Similarly for `g` in `Hom(O₂, O₂)` . This gives three non-isomorphic combinations:\n        *   Both are groups (C₂ ⊕ C₂).\n        *   One is a group and one is a monoid (C₂ ⊕ M₂).\n        *   Both are monoids (M₂ ⊕ M₂).\n        **(3 categories)**\n    *   `h₁₁ = 3`, `h₂₂ = 1` (or vice-versa, which is isomorphic): `Hom(O₁, O₁)` consists of `id₁, f, g`. These must form a monoid of order 3. There are 5 such non-isomorphic monoids. The other object O₂ has only its identity morphism.\n        **(5 categories)**\n\n2.  **Connected objects**: This covers cases where there are morphisms between O₁ and O₂.\n    *   `h₁₁ = 2, h₂₂ = 1, h₁₂ = 1, h₂₁ = 0` (and the isomorphic case `h₁₁ = 1, h₂₂ = 2, h₁₂ = 0, h₂₁ = 1`): There is a single morphism `h: O₁ → O₂`. The object O₁ has an endomorphism `f`. Based on the composition rule for `f` (`f ∘ f = id₁` or `f ∘ f = f`), we have two distinct structures. The composition `h ∘ f` must be equal to `h`.\n        **(2 categories)**\n    *   `h₁₁ = 2, h₂₂ = 1, h₁₂ = 0, h₂₁ = 1` (and the isomorphic case `h₁₁ = 1, h₂₂ = 2, h₁₂ = 1, h₂₁ = 0`): This is similar to the previous case, but the morphism `k` goes from O₂ to O₁, so `k: O₂ → O₁`. The composition `f ∘ k` must equal `k`. These are not isomorphic to the previous two categories.\n        **(2 categories)**\n    *   `h₁₁ = 1, h₂₂ = 1, h₁₂ = 2, h₂₁ = 0` (or `h₂₁ = 2, h₁₂ = 0`, which is isomorphic): There are two parallel morphisms from O₁ to O₂, `f: O₁ → O₂` and `g: O₁ → O₂`. There are no non-identity compositions possible. This forms a \"directed graph\" category.\n        **(1 category)**\n    *   `h₁₁ = 1, h₂₂ = 1, h₁₂ = 1, h₂₁ = 1`: There is one morphism `f: O₁ → O₂` and one `g: O₂ → O₁`. For the composition to be well-defined, `g ∘ f` must be `id₁` and `f ∘ g` must be `id₂`. This means the two objects are isomorphic.\n        **(1 category)**\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of non-isomorphic categories: 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
