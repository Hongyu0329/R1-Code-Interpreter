    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats, typically measured in milliseconds. While HRV analysis originated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data, where this value is specifically called the R-R interval (the time between two successive R-waves of the QRS complex), the term \"interbeat interval\" is commonly used when deriving the data from photoplethysmography (PPG).\n\nOther synonymous terms include \"beat-to-beat interval\" and \"cycle length variability\". When HRV is calculated from PPG, the measurement is sometimes referred to as Pulse Rate Variability (PRV).\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
