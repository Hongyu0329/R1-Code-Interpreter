    "When applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations, starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is `1100001111111111111111`.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton that determines the state of a cell based on its own state and that of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is named for the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string encodes the output for each of the eight possible neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' surrounded by '0's (Generation 0), the automaton evolves through subsequent generations. Here are the first few patterns:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** `1110`\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** `11111`\n*   **Generation 5:** `110001`\n\nContinuing this process for 20 generations leads to the final pattern. The evolution of Rule 110 from a single cell is known to create complex, seemingly chaotic patterns from simple initial conditions.\n\n<<<1100001111111111111111>>>"
