    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large values of $x$, we first analyze the behavior of each term in the equation as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe ODE is given by:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, we can make the following approximations for the last two terms:\n1.  The term $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ will tend to zero, assuming that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. We will verify this assumption later.\n2.  The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is a periodic function with a period of $\\pi$. For a large-$x$ approximation of the smooth behavior of the solution, we can replace this rapidly oscillating term with its average value over one period. The average value is:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1} dx = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\nWith these approximations, the ODE for large $x$ simplifies to:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4} + 0.5$\n\nWe now use the method of dominant balance to find the leading-order behavior of the solution. Let's assume a solution of the form $y(x) = A x^n$.\nThen the derivatives are:\n$y'(x) = An x^{n-1}$\n$y''(x) = An(n-1) x^{n-2}$\n$y'''(x) = An(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3}$\n\nSubstituting this into the simplified ODE gives:\n$An(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (An x^{n-1})^4 + 0.5 = A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4} + 0.5$\n\nWe need to find a consistent balance between the dominant terms for large $x$. A systematic analysis shows that for any choice of $n$, there is no consistent balance. For instance, if $n>0$, the $A^4 x^{4n}$ term dominates the right-hand side, leading to a contradiction. If $n<0$, the constant term $0.5$ dominates the right-hand side, also leading to a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the approximation should be made by ignoring the smaller terms and balancing the most significant ones. A common, though not always rigorous, approach in such problems is to balance the term with the highest derivative ($y'''$) against the term with the highest power of the function ($y^4$). This choice assumes these two terms are dominant over all others. Let's proceed with this balance:\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\n\nSubstitute $y(x) = A x^n$ into this relation:\n$A n(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx A^4 x^{4n}$\n\nFor this balance to be possible, the powers of $x$ must be equal:\n$n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients:\n$A n(n-1)(n-2) = A^4$\nFor $n=-1$:\n$A (-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = A^4$\n$A (-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n$-6A = A^4$\n\nSince we seek a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we can divide by $A$:\n$A^3 = -6$\n$A = \\sqrt{-6} = -6^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of A and round it to two decimal places:\n$A \\approx -1.81712...$\n$A \\approx -1.82$\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\nWe must acknowledge that this approximation is not fully self-consistent when plugged back into the full approximated equation, as it leads to a situation where the constant term $0.5$ is dominant over the terms we balanced. However, this method of balancing the highest derivative with the highest non-linearity is a standard technique for finding the leading-order asymptotic behavior and is the most plausible approach given the complexity of the equation.\n\n<<<$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$>>>"
