  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to find the maximum possible length of a secret message hidden in the \"Ching\" book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Components:**\n    *   **The Message Alphabet:** The problem states the message is \"written using the letters in the Shu\". It also specifies that the Shu uses \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\". This means our alphabet for the secret message has 120 unique characters.\n    *   **The Encoding Medium:** The \"Ching\" book contains the encrypted message. It is composed of 9999 symbols.\n    *   **The Encoding Units:** The symbols in the Ching are \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbols. We need to determine how many unique types of these symbols exist.\n        *   Yinyang has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n        *   Wuxing (the five elements) has 5 possibilities (typically wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n        *   Therefore, the total number of unique yinyang-wuxing symbols is 2 × 5 = 10.\n\n3.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:** We need to figure out how to represent 120 different characters using only 10 unique symbols. This is a base-10 encoding problem. We need to find the minimum number of symbols from the Ching (let's call this number `N`) required to represent a single character from the Shu.\n\n    *   If we use 1 symbol from the Ching, we can represent 10¹ = 10 unique characters. This is less than the required 120.\n    *   If we use 2 symbols from the Ching, we can create 10² = 100 unique combinations. This is still not enough to represent all 120 characters.\n    *   If we use 3 symbols from the Ching, we can create 10³ = 1000 unique combinations. This is more than enough to represent the 120 characters.\n\n    Therefore, the most efficient encoding requires a sequence of **3 yinyang-wuxing symbols** to represent one character of the secret message.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:** Now that we know how the encoding works, we can calculate the length of the message.\n\n    *   Total symbols available in the Ching = 9999.\n    *   Symbols required per character of the message = 3.\n    *   Maximum length of the message = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols per character)\n    *   Maximum length = 9999 / 3\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\n6.  **Review Irrelevant Information:** The problem includes details like the total number of characters in the Shu (\"around 3000\"), the computer vision recognition time (12 ms), and computation times for operations (10 ns and 30 ns). These are red herrings designed to complicate the problem but are not needed for the final calculation, which is purely a matter of combinatorics and division.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
