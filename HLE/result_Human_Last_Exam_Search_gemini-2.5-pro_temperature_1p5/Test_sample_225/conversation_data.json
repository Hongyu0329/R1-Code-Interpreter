    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t), we are looking for distinct points (x, y) where the curve crosses itself. This is a characteristic of Lissajous curves.\n\nA self-intersection occurs when two different parameter values, t₁ and t₂, result in the same coordinates (x, y), within the primary period of the curve. The period for this curve is 2π, as 2π is the least common multiple of the periods of cos(9t) (which is 2π/9) and sin(5t) (which is 2π/5).\n\nThe conditions for a self-intersection at t₁ and t₂ (where t₁ ≠ t₂) in the interval [0, 2π) are:\n1.  cos(9t₁) = cos(9t₂)\n2.  sin(5t₁) = sin(5t₂)\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a known formula. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5. Since both are odd integers, the formula for the number of self-intersections is:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 distinct self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t), we are looking for distinct points (x, y) where the curve crosses itself.
