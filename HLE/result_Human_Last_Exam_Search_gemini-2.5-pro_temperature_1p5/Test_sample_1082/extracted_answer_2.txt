The Sustainable Value Added for the product cannot be calculated without benchmark data for water and energy eco-efficiency. The final answer is dependent on these external values. The formula to calculate the SVA once the benchmark efficiencies are known is:

**SVA = $25 - [(100 × Benchmark_Water_Efficiency_($/liter)) + (40 × Benchmark_Energy_Efficiency_($/kWh))]**
