    "The user is asking for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval.\nThis requires the following steps:\n1.  Find the wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box for a given quantum number 'n'.\n2.  Find the probability density function, which is the square of the wavefunction.\n3.  Integrate the probability density function over the given interval.\n\nFrom the search results, I know the following:\n- The wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' (or L) is ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a).\n- The probability of finding the particle in an interval [x1, x2] is given by the integral of the probability density |ψn(x)|² over that interval.\n- The probability density is |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n\nFor this specific problem:\n- The quantum number n = 2.\n- The interval is from x1 = 0.495a to x2 = 0.505a.\n\nSo, the wavefunction is ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a).\nAnd the probability density is P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a).\n\nThe probability is the integral of P(x) from 0.495a to 0.505a:\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, I can use the identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\nHere, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\nSo, sin²(2πx/a) = (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nProbability = (2/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2 dx\nProbability = (1/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nProbability = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nNow, I will evaluate this expression:\nUpper limit (x = 0.505a):\n(1/a) * [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)\n\nLower limit (x = 0.495a):\n(1/a) * [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)\n\nProbability = (0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)) - (0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π))\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\nI can use the approximation that for a small interval around x = a/2, the probability density is nearly constant.\nAt x = a/2, for n=2, the wavefunction is sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0. So the probability density is 0.\nThe interval is centered around x = a/2, which is a node for n=2.\nThis means the probability should be very small.\n\nLet's do the calculation without approximation first.\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\nSo, sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)) = 2sin(0.02π)\n\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (2sin(0.02π))\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\nFor small x, sin(x) ≈ x.\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.02π\nSo, Probability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * (0.02π) = 0.01 - 0.01 = 0.\n\nThis seems incorrect. Let's re-check the calculation.\n\nLet's use an approximation. The length of the interval is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a.\nThe probability can be approximated as P(x) * Δx if the interval is small.\nHere x is the center of the interval, x = 0.5a.\nFor n=2, the probability density is P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a).\nAt x = 0.5a, P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * 0 = 0.\nSo the approximation gives 0. This is because the center of the interval is exactly at a node.\n\nHowever, the probability density is not zero across the entire interval. It is only zero exactly at x=0.5a.\nLet's try to calculate the integral more carefully.\n\nLet u = 2πx/a. Then dx = (a/2π)du.\nWhen x = 0.495a, u = 2π(0.495a)/a = 0.99π.\nWhen x = 0.505a, u = 2π(0.505a)/a = 1.01π.\n\nProbability = ∫[from 0.99π to 1.01π] (2/a) * sin²(u) * (a/2π) du\nProbability = (1/π) ∫[from 0.99π to 1.01π] sin²(u) du\nProbability = (1/π) ∫[from 0.99π to 1.01π] (1 - cos(2u))/2 du\nProbability = (1/2π) * [u - (1/2)sin(2u)] evaluated from 0.99π to 1.01π.\n\nProbability = (1/2π) * [(1.01π - (1/2)sin(2.02π)) - (0.99π - (1/2)sin(1.98π))]\nProbability = (1/2π) * [0.02π - (1/2)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))]\nAs before, sin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π) and sin(1.98π) = -sin(0.02π).\nSo, sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = 2sin(0.02π).\n\nProbability = (1/2π) * [0.02π - (1/2)(2sin(0.02π))]\nProbability = (1/2π) * [0.02π - sin(0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nNow use the Taylor series expansion for sin(x) around x=0, which is x - x³/3! + ...\nHere, x = 0.02π.\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.02π - (0.02π)³/6\n\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [0.02π - (0.02π)³/6]\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (1/2π) * (0.02π)³/6\nProbability ≈ (1/2π) * (0.000008π³)/6\nProbability ≈ (0.000008π²)/12 ≈ 0.000006579\n\nLet's try another approximation.\nThe interval is small and symmetric around x=a/2. Let y = x - a/2. The interval becomes [-0.005a, 0.005a].\nThe probability density is (2/a)sin²(2π(y+a/2)/a) = (2/a)sin²(2πy/a + π) = (2/a)(-sin(2πy/a))² = (2/a)sin²(2πy/a).\nThe integral is ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a)sin²(2πy/a) dy.\nFor small y, sin(2πy/a) ≈ 2πy/a.\nSo the integral is approximately ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a)(2πy/a)² dy = ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²/a³)y² dy.\n= (8π²/a³) * [y³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\n= (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\n= (8π²/3a³) * 2 * (0.005a)³\n= (16π²/3a³) * (0.000000125a³)\n= (16π²/3) * 0.000000125\n≈ 5.26 * 0.000000125 ≈ 0.000000658\n\nThe result from my previous calculation: (0.000008π²)/12 = 0.000008 * 9.8696 / 12 ≈ 0.000006579. This seems correct.\n\nFinal calculation:\nProbability = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\nπ ≈ 3.14159\n0.02π ≈ 0.06283\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.062817\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - 0.062817 / (2 * 3.14159) = 0.01 - 0.062817 / 6.28318 = 0.01 - 0.0099976 ≈ 0.0000024\n\nLet me re-check the integral.\nProbability = (1/2π) * [0.02π - sin(0.02π)]\nLet's calculate the values again.\n0.02π ≈ 0.06283185\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.0627905\n0.02π - sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.00004135\nProbability = (1/2π) * 0.00004135 ≈ 0.00004135 / (2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThis seems to be the right order of magnitude.\n\nI'm confident in the steps and the formula. The calculation seems correct.\nLet me double check the initial setup.\nWavefunction: ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) sin(nπx/a). Correct.\nProbability density: P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(nπx/a). Correct.\nn = 2.\nP(x) = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a). Correct.\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx. Correct.\n\nIntegration using u-substitution seems correct.\nThe final expression Probability = (1/2π) * [0.02π - sin(0.02π)] is correct.\nUsing calculator:\n0.02 * π = 0.062831853\nsin(0.062831853) = 0.0627905195\n0.062831853 - 0.0627905195 = 0.0000413335\n0.0000413335 / (2 * π) = 0.000006579\n\nThe approximation gave a very similar result.\n(16 * π² / 3) * (0.005)³ = (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 0.000000125 = 52.6378 * 0.000000125 = 0.0000065797\n\nSo the probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶ or 0.000658%. This is a very small number, which is expected since the interval is centered on a node.\n\nSo the final answer should be approximately 0.00000658.\nThe question doesn't specify the number of significant figures, so I will provide a few.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. State the formula for probability density for n=2.\n2. Set up the integral for the probability.\n3. Solve the integral.\n4. Calculate the numerical value.\n\nAll steps have been done and checked. I am ready to give the final answer.The probability of finding the particle in a 1D box in an interval from x1 to x2 is given by the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor n = 2, the wavefunction is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density function for n = 2 is:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nWe need to find the probability of the particle being in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a. This is calculated by the integral:\nProbability = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. Here, θ = 2πx/a.\nProbability = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ (2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]/2 dx\nProbability = (1/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral:\nProbability = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\nProbability = (1/a) * {[0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)]}\nProbability = (1/a) * {0.01a - (a/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]}\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π)[2sin(0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nFor a small value of x, sin(x) can be approximated by the Taylor series expansion: sin(x) ≈ x - x³/6. Let x = 0.02π.\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π)[(0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6]\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (0.02π)³ / (12π)\nProbability ≈ (0.000008π³) / (12π)\nProbability ≈ (0.000008π²) / 12\nProbability ≈ (0.000008 * 9.8696) / 12\nProbability ≈ 0.000078957 / 12\nProbability ≈ 0.00000657975\n\nAn alternative approach is to notice that the interval is very small and centered around x = a/2, which is a node for n=2 where the probability is zero. We can approximate the probability density function in this small interval.\nLet y = x - a/2. The integration is from -0.005a to 0.005a.\nP(y) = (2/a)sin²(2π(y + a/2)/a) = (2/a)sin²(2πy/a + π) = (2/a)sin²(2πy/a)\nFor small y, sin(2πy/a) ≈ 2πy/a.\nProbability ≈ ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a)(2πy/a)² dy = (8π²/a³) ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy\nProbability ≈ (8π²/a³) [y³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nProbability ≈ (8π²/3a³) [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nProbability ≈ (8π²/3a³) * 2 * (0.005a)³\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nProbability ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 0.000000125\nProbability ≈ 52.6379 * 0.000000125 ≈ 0.00000658\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
