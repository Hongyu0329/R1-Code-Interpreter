    "The number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order $6$ is requested, where $d=53599$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$:\nThe prime factorization of $d=53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let the prime factors be $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. For a prime conductor $p_i$, a character is primitive if it is not the principal (trivial) character.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$. We require this order to be 6.\nLet $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\nThe order of a character modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k_i > 1$ modulo $p_i$ is given by $\\phi(k_i)$, provided that $k_i$ divides $p_i-1$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups and the possible orders for the component characters:\n*   For $p_1=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. The primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_2=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. The divisors of 6 are also divisors of 12, so the primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_3=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. The divisors of 6 are also divisors of 18, so the primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_4=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. The divisors of 6 are also divisors of 30, so the primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, the number of available primitive characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 are:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$ must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3. We can find the total number of such characters using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1.  **Total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6:**\n    For each prime $p_i$, we can choose a character of order 2, 3, or 6. The total number of choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. Since there are four prime factors, the total number of primitive characters with an order dividing 6 is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Number of characters with order dividing 3:**\n    If the order of $\\chi$ divides 3, then the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must divide 3. The only possible primitive order is 3. For each $p_i$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters. So there are $2^4 = 16$ characters whose order is 3.\n\n3.  **Number of characters with order dividing 2:**\n    If the order of $\\chi$ divides 2, then the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must divide 2. The only possible primitive order is 2. For each $p_i$, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character. So there is $1^4 = 1$ character whose order is 2.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with an order that strictly divides 6 (i.e., order 1, 2, or 3). Since all characters are primitive, the order must be greater than 1.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Characters with order dividing 6) - (Characters with order dividing 3) - (Characters with order dividing 2)\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n"
