    "The VC dimension of a hypothesis space is a measure of its complexity. In the context of logic, a hypothesis space is defined by a class of formulas. Specifically, we are considering formulas in the language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\nA hypothesis, or concept, is the set of elements in a model's universe that satisfy a given formula with one free variable, say $x$. Let's analyze the structure of such formulas in the given logic. They can contain existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunctions ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(x)$.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language is logically equivalent to a simpler form. A general formula can be written as $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are unary, we can separate the atoms involving the free variable $x$ from those involving only the bound variables $y_i$.\nThe formula is equivalent to $(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\rho(y_1, \\dots, y_m))$, for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The second part of this conjunction, $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\rho(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, is a sentence (it has no free variables), so for any given model, it evaluates to either true or false.\n*   If it is false, the entire formula is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false).\n*   If it is true, the formula is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n\nThe case $I = \\emptyset$ corresponds to an empty conjunction, which is equivalent to $\\top$ (true). Therefore, the set of concepts definable by this logic in a given model (a universe $U$ with predicate interpretations $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 \\subseteq U$) is the collection of sets:\n$\\mathcal{C} = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\nNote that this collection includes the entire universe $U$ when $I$ is the empty set.\n\nThe VC dimension is the maximum size of a set that can be \"shattered\" by this concept class $\\mathcal{C}$. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $C \\cap X = Y$. To determine the VC dimension of the logic, we must find the maximum size of a shatterable set over all possible models.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of distinct concepts we can form is limited by the number of ways we can choose the index set $I$. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Therefore, in any model, there are at most 16 definable sets of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$. Including the empty set, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ has at most $16+1=17$ members.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, we must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. If we try to shatter a set of size 5, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ subsets. Since our concept class can have at most 17 distinct concepts, it's impossible to generate 32 distinct subsets. Thus, no set of size 5 can be shattered, which implies that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to construct a model and a set of size 4 that is shattered.\nLet's choose a universe $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ of four elements. Let this also be the set we want to shatter. We define the interpretations of our four predicates, the sets $S_i$, as follows:\n*   $S_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nIn general, $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. Now, consider any subset $Y \\subseteq X$. Let $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be the set of indices such that $Y = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$. We need to find an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that the concept $C = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ satisfies $C \\cap X = Y$. Since our universe is $X$, this simplifies to finding an $I$ such that $C=Y$.\n\nLet's choose the index set for our concept to be $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$. The intersection is then:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\setminus J} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\setminus J} \\{x_i\\}$\nThis set contains all elements of $X$ except those whose indices are *not* in $J$. This is precisely the set of elements whose indices *are* in $J$, which is the set $Y$.\nThus, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept in $\\mathcal{C}$ that equals $Y$. This demonstrates that the set $X$ of size 4 can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
