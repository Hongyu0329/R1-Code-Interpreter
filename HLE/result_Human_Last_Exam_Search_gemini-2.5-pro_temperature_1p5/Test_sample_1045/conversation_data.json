    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to understand the composition of the 6-31G basis set for each type of atom present. Toluene is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes a split-valence double-zeta basis set. Here's a breakdown of what that means for each atom:\n\n**For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** The \"6\" indicates that the core 1s atomic orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The \"31\" indicates that the valence shell is split into two basis functions for each atomic orbital (double-zeta).\n    *   An inner, more contracted part is described by one set of functions (s and p) derived from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   An outer, more diffuse part is described by another set of functions (s and p) derived from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   This results in:\n    *   1 function for the 1s orbital.\n    *   2 functions for the 2s orbital.\n    *   2 functions for each of the 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals (a total of 2 * 3 = 6 functions for the 2p orbitals).\n*   Therefore, each carbon atom has a total of 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n**For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   A hydrogen atom only has a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons.\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** The \"31\" split-valence description means the 1s orbital is represented by two separate basis functions.\n    *   One contracted function is composed of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   One contracted function is composed of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   Thus, each hydrogen atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C7H8):\n\n*   **Total for Carbon atoms:** 7 Carbon atoms * 9 functions/Carbon atom = 63 functions\n*   **Total for Hydrogen atoms:** 8 Hydrogen atoms * 2 functions/Hydrogen atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total contracted Gaussian functions =** 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
