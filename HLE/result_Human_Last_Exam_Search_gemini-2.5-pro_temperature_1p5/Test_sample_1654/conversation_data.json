    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's interactions with his greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol of his vacillating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat or Otchumyelov's handling of it six times throughout the narrative.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat\" as he walks across the market square. This initial description establishes his official status and pompous demeanor. The subsequent descriptions of the coat directly reflect the shifts in his attitude as he tries to determine the ownership of a dog that has bitten a man.\n\nThe specific instances of him taking the coat off and putting it back on are as follows:\n\n*   **First Removal:** Upon hearing that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately feels hot and orders his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat.\n*   **Putting It Back On:** When it is suggested that the dog is not the general's, Otchumyelov feels a sudden chill and asks for his coat to be put back on.\n*   **Second Removal:** He once again takes off his coat when it is suggested the dog could still be a general's dog from a different town.\n*   **Putting It Back On Again:** When a policeman is confident it's not a general's dog, he has it put back on.\n*   **Final Mention:** After learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, he continues on his way, wrapped in his coat.\n\nThese repeated actions of removing and donning his coat symbolize his changing opinions and his fear of offending a person of high status. Each change of the coat aligns with a change in his \"verdict\" on the dog and the situation, perfectly illustrating the story's title and central theme.\n\n<<<6>>>"
