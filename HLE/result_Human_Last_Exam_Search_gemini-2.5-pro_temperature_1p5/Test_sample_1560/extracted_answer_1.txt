The final state of the system is probabilistic. After applying the gate \( Q \) to the first ququint of the entangled pair and subsequently measuring it, the system collapses into one of five possible states. Each of these potential final states for the two-ququint system has a specific probability of occurring.

Here is a breakdown of the steps and the resulting states:

### 1. Initial Entangled State
The system begins in a maximally entangled state of two ququints, A and B:
$|\Psi\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( |0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B + |2\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B + |3\rangle_A \otimes |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_A \otimes |4\rangle_B \right)$

### 2. Application of the Quantum Gate
The gate \( Q \) is applied to the first ququint (A). The transformation is represented by the operator \( Q \otimes I \), where \( I \) is the identity operator acting on ququint B. The state of the system after this operation becomes:
$|\Psi'\rangle_{AB} = (Q \otimes I) |\Psi\rangle_{AB}$

Substituting the definition of the gate \( Q \) for each basis state results in the new state:
$|\Psi'\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} [ |0\rangle_A(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B) + |1\rangle_A(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B) + |2\rangle_A(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B) + |3\rangle_A(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B) + |4\rangle_A(|2\rangle_B) ]$

Although the gate \( Q \) is not unitary by itself, the operation \( Q \otimes I \) on this specific entangled state preserves the overall normalization of the system, making the subsequent steps physically consistent within the problem's framework.

### 3. Measurement and Final States
A measurement is performed on the first ququint (A) in the computational basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, |4\rangle\}$. According to the principles of quantum measurement, the system will collapse into one of the possible eigenstates corresponding to the measurement outcome. The probability of each outcome is determined by the coefficients of the state vector.

The final state of the system depends on the measurement outcome, with the following possibilities:

*   **If the measurement outcome is 0:**
    *   Probability: **20%** (or 2/10)
    *   Final State: $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$

*   **If the measurement outcome is 1:**
    *   Probability: **20%** (or 2/10)
    *   Final State: $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$

*   **If the measurement outcome is 2:**
    *   Probability: **30%** (or 3/10)
    *   Final State: $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$

*   **If the measurement outcome is 3:**
    *   Probability: **20%** (or 2/10)
    *   Final State: $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$

*   **If the measurement outcome is 4:**
    *   Probability: **10%** (or 1/10)
    *   Final State: $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$

Therefore, the final state of the system is not a single state but a statistical ensemble of these five possible outcomes. When ququint A is measured, it collapses to a definite state, which in turn instantaneously projects ququint B into a specific, corresponding superposition or pure state.
