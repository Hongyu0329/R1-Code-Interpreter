    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is Valsartan. This determination is based on the matching molecular formula of C24H29N5O3 and molecular weight of approximately 435.53 g/mol, which are consistent with the data for Valsartan. Valsartan is a well-known medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease.\n\nValsartan functions by acting as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Its primary mechanism of action is to selectively bind to and inhibit the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). This protein-ligand interaction blocks the hormone angiotensin II from binding to the receptor, which in turn leads to vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels) and a reduction in blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, other small molecules that form a protein-ligand interaction with the same protein target as Valsartan are other angiotensin II receptor blockers. These drugs are often referred to as \"sartans\" due to their common nomenclature.\n\nHere is a list of small molecules that, like Valsartan, bind to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor:\n\n*   **Azilsartan** (Edarbi®)\n*   **Candesartan** (Atacand®)\n*   **Eprosartan** (Teveten®)\n*   **Irbesartan** (Avapro®)\n*   **Losartan** (Cozaar®)\n*   **Olmesartan** (Benicar®)\n*   **Telmisartan** (Micardis®)\n*   **Saprisartan**\n*   **Allisartan**\n\nThese molecules all share the same therapeutic target, the AT1 receptor, and are used for similar medical indications. While they all bind to the AT1 receptor, they can exhibit different potencies and may have slightly different chemical structures. For instance, many ARBs, including Valsartan, contain a characteristic biphenyl-tetrazole moiety which is crucial for their binding to the receptor.\n\nIn addition to these synthetic small molecules, there are also endogenous peptides, which are naturally occurring small molecules, that interact with the AT1 receptor. These include **angiotensin II** (the primary natural ligand), **angiotensin III**, and **angiotensin IV**.\n\n<<<Based on the provided information, the small molecules that form a protein-ligand interaction with the same target as CHEMBL4803817 (Valsartan) are other angiotensin II receptor blockers. A list of these molecules includes Azilsartan, Candesartan, Eprosartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Telmisartan, Saprisartan, and Allisartan. Additionally, the natural peptides Angiotensin II, Angiotensin III, and Angiotensin IV also bind to this receptor.>>>"
