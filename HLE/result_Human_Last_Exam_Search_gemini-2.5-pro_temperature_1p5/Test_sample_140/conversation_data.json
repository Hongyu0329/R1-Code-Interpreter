    "The problem of finding the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15 can be solved by systematically packing the blocks in stages. The optimal packing strategy does not place all blocks with the same orientation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step method to determine the number of blocks:\n\nFirst, calculate the volumes. The volume of the large cube is 15x15x15 = 3375 cubic units. The volume of a single block is 9x1x1 = 9 cubic units. Dividing the cube's volume by the block's volume gives 3375 / 9 = 375. This is the theoretical maximum, but it doesn't account for the physical constraints of packing the blocks.\n\nA common strategy for this type of packing problem is to place the blocks in layers with different orientations:\n\n1.  **First Layer (X-orientation):** The blocks are placed with their 9-unit length parallel to one of the cube's axes (let's call it the x-axis). This creates a slab of blocks with dimensions 9x15x15. The number of blocks that can fit in this slab is (9/9) × (15/1) × (15/1) = 225 blocks. After this, the remaining space is a 6x15x15 slab.\n\n2.  **Second Layer (Y-orientation):** In the remaining 6x15x15 space, the blocks can no longer be oriented along the x-axis. They are now placed with their 9-unit length parallel to a different axis (the y-axis). This uses a portion of the remaining space measuring 6x9x15. The number of blocks that fit here is (6/1) × (9/9) × (15/1) = 90 blocks. This leaves a 6x6x15 space.\n\n3.  **Third Layer (Z-orientation):** In the final 6x6x15 space, the blocks must be oriented along the last remaining axis (the z-axis). This occupies a 6x6x9 section. The number of blocks that can be placed here is (6/1) × (6/1) × (9/9) = 36 blocks.\n\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each step:\n225 + 90 + 36 = 351\n\nAfter these blocks are placed, the remaining empty space is a 6x6x6 cube, into which no more 9x1x1 blocks can fit.\n\n<<<351>>>"
