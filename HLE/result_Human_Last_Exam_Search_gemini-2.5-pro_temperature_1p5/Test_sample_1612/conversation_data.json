    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two types of Triple Crowns for players: one for hitting and one for pitching. The number of players who have accomplished this feat has grown with the recent inclusion of statistics from the Negro Leagues.\n\nFor hitters, winning a Triple Crown requires leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season. In total, 27 players have won the batting Triple Crown, with some achieving it multiple times. This exclusive list includes legendary players from the American League (AL), National League (NL), and former Negro Leagues.\n\nFor pitchers, the Triple Crown is awarded to the player who leads the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\nCombining both hitting and pitching achievements, the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history is 28, when including players from the AL, NL, and Negro Leagues.\n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the notable Triple Crown winners:\n\n*   **Most Recent Hitting Triple Crown:** Miguel Cabrera is the most recent player to win the batting Triple Crown, achieving this in 2012 with the Detroit Tigers. His historic season included a .330 batting average, 44 home runs, and 139 RBIs.\n*   **Multiple Triple Crown Winners:** Four players have won the Triple Crown on multiple occasions. Oscar Charleston holds the record with three, while Rogers Hornsby, Josh Gibson, and Ted Williams have each won it twice.\n*   **Post-Integration Era Winners:** Since the integration of baseball in 1947, there have been five batting Triple Crown winners: Ted Williams (1947), Mickey Mantle (1956), Frank Robinson (1966), Carl Yastrzemski (1967), and Miguel Cabrera (2012).\n\nThe inclusion of Negro League statistics in 2020 added eight players to the official list of Triple Crown winners.\n\n<<<28>>>"
