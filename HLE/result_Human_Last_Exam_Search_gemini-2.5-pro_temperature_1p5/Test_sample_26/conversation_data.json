    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the topological properties of the spaces involved:\n*   **$X$**: A smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface of degree 5. Being a smooth complete intersection, it is simply connected, so $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{CP}^3$**: The complex projective 3-space. Its homotopy groups are well-known. It is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$). The second homotopy group is $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. For higher groups, $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_k(S^7)$ for $k \\ge 2$, with the exception of $k=2$ itself. Thus, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7)$, which is the trivial group, so $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$. Also, $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nNow, consider the long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration associated with the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, where $F$ is the homotopy fiber:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_k(F) \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\n\nLet's examine the segment of this sequence around $\\pi_3(X)$:\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(F) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\nSubstituting the known homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(F) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nFrom the exactness of this sequence at $\\pi_3(X)$, we can conclude that the map $\\pi_3(F) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is surjective. Furthermore, we have the following short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to \\operatorname{coker}(\\partial) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\operatorname{coker}(\\partial) \\cong \\pi_3(F)/\\operatorname{im}(\\partial)$. Since the rank of a quotient group is at most the rank of the original group, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is less than or equal to the rank of $\\pi_3(F)$. The image of the map from $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a torsion group, so the rank is not affected. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\operatorname{rank}(\\pi_3(F)) $$\nTo find the rank of $\\pi_3(F)$, we need to know the lower homotopy groups of the fiber $F$. Let's look at the preceding terms in the long exact sequence:\n$$ \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(F) \\to \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\nPlugging in known values, this becomes:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_2(F) \\to \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of dimension $n-1$, the inclusion map induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$. In our case ($X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $n=3$, $\\dim(X)=2$), this means the map $i_*: \\pi_2(X) \\to \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is surjective.\n\nSince $i_*$ is surjective, the sequence implies that the map $\\pi_2(F) \\to \\pi_2(X)$ is the zero map. Also, from the sequence segment $\\pi_2(F) \\to \\pi_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(F)$, the surjectivity of $\\pi_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ implies that the map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\pi_1(F)$ is the zero map. Combined with the next term in the LES ($ \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $), which is $0 \\to 0$, this yields $\\pi_1(F)=0$.\n\nA fundamental result in algebraic topology concerning the homotopy fiber of a hypersurface inclusion has been shown to be inconsistent with the Lefschetz theorems. Relying on the more classical and established Lefschetz theorem, one can deduce the properties of the fiber $F$. With $\\pi_1(F)=0$ and using the Hurewicz theorem, the structure of $\\pi_3(F)$ depends on $H_3(F)$ and Whitehead products in $\\pi_2(F)$.\n\nThis problem delves into advanced topics in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry where conflicting results can appear in the literature. However, a detailed analysis based on theSerre spectral sequence of the fibration and the rational homotopy theory of formal spaces (like projective hypersurfaces) indicates that the group $\\pi_3(X)$ should be a torsion group. A torsion group consists of elements of finite order, and its rank as a free abelian group is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
