    "The search results confirm that the question is a piece of literary trivia. A search for the key phrases in Russian (\"В русском переводе одного эссе при описании широких венских бульваров фигурирует фамилия английского поэта\") directly leads to a quiz website where this exact question was posed.\n\nThe essay in question is part of Claudio Magris's renowned book \"Danube\" (\"Danubio\" in Italian). This work is a detailed literary and historical journey along the Danube river, passing through Vienna. Magris is an Italian scholar and writer known for his deep knowledge of Central European culture. His book has been translated into Russian (\"Дунай\").\n\nThe core of the trivia lies in a specific word choice within the Russian translation by Anna Yampolskaya. While describing the boulevards of Vienna, specifically the Ringstrasse, which was built where the old city walls and gates once stood, the translation includes a wordplay that evokes the surname of an English poet.\n\nAlthough the exact passage is not available in the search snippets, the logic points to the English poet and dramatist John Gay. His surname is transliterated into Russian as \"Гей\" (gey). The Viennese boulevards of the Ringstrasse are named after the former city gates (\"Tor\" in German, \"gate\" in English). The Russian translation likely uses a word like \"гейт\" (a transliteration of \"gate\") or a similar construct that sounds like the poet's name. This specific and clever detail connects the description of Vienna's boulevards to the English poet.\n\n<<<Gay>>>"
