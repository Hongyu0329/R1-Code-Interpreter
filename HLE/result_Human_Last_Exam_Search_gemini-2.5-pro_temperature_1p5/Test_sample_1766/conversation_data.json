    "In the quantum mechanical problem of a p-electron with spin-orbit coupling, the total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S**. Since the operators for the square of the total angular momentum, J², and the z-component of the total angular momentum, Jz, commute, they have a common set of eigenstates, and their corresponding eigenvalues can be determined simultaneously.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1, and the spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are obtained by the vector addition of the orbital and spin angular momenta, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps. For a p-electron, this gives:\n*   *j* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThe eigenvalues of the J² operator are given by the formula ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. This results in two possible sets of eigenvalues for J²:\n*   For *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue is ħ²(3/2)(3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   For *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue is ħ²(1/2)(1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Jz operator are given by *m*<sub>*j*</sub>ħ, where *m*<sub>*j*</sub> can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nFor the state with *j* = 3/2, the possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. This leads to the following eigenvalues for Jz:\n*   **-3/2 ħ**\n*   **-1/2 ħ**\n*   **1/2 ħ**\n*   **3/2 ħ**\n\nFor the state with *j* = 1/2, the possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues for Jz are:\n*   **-1/2 ħ**\n*   **1/2 ħ**\n\nTherefore, the common eigenstates of J² and Jz are characterized by a specific eigenvalue for J² and one of the possible eigenvalues for Jz corresponding to that *j* value.\n\n<<<The eigenvalues for J² are (15/4)ħ² and (3/4)ħ². For Jz, the eigenvalues are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ for the j=3/2 state, and (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ for the j=1/2 state.>>>"
