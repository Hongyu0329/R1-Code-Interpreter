    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The poetic lines refer to Rezanov's story, which Voznesensky immortalized in his poem \"Avos!\" and the subsequent, highly popular rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n\nNikolai Rezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and undertook a diplomatic and exploratory mission to California in 1806. During this journey, he became engaged to Concepci처n Arg체ello, the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco.\n\nOn his return journey across Siberia to seek the Tsar's permission to marry the Catholic Concepci처n, Rezanov fell ill. He died of fever and exhaustion in the city of Krasnoyarsk in March 1807 and was buried there. A monument was erected on his grave in 1831.\n\nThe original grave and its monument at the Resurrection Cathedral were destroyed during the Soviet era. In the fall of 2000, a new memorial cross was dedicated at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk, believed to be the site of his reburial. This event symbolically reconnected the two lovers, as earth and a rose from Concepci처n's grave in Benicia, California, were placed on Rezanov's tomb.\n\nVoznesensky's work, particularly \"Juno and Avos,\" revived the tragic love story in Russian popular culture, focusing on the themes of love, loss, and the vast distances that separated the couple.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
