    "The number of stable equilibria for the given differential equation is denoted by $m$. The differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set $x'(t) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nFactoring the expression, we get:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x(x-1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we analyze the sign of the derivative of the function $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable if solutions starting near $x_0$ approach $x_0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. A common method to assess this is to evaluate the derivative of $f(x)$ at the equilibrium point.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1\n$$\n-   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable.\n-   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is unstable.\n-   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nLet's test the equilibrium points:\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, we must analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ around $x=1$. We look at the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n    -   For a value slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 < 0$. This means that for $x > 1$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so $x(t)$ decreases towards 1.\n    -   For a value slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 < 0$. This means that for $x < 1$, $x'(t)$ is also negative, so $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n    Since solutions on one side of $x=1$ approach it, while on the other side they move away, this equilibrium point is classified as semi-stable. A stable equilibrium requires that solutions from all nearby points converge to it. Therefore, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. So, the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
