    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n**1. Reaction Type:** The presence of a strong, sterically hindered base like potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) with an alkyl halide favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In cyclohexane rings, this means that both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Starting Material:** The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The \"trans\" relationship between the bromo and methyl groups means they are on opposite sides of the ring. For an E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. In the case of this trans isomer, forcing the bromine into an axial position also forces the adjacent methyl group into an axial position, which is a less stable conformation.\n\n**4. Identifying Possible Elimination Products:**\n*   **Zaitsev Product (more substituted alkene):** Elimination of the hydrogen from the carbon bearing the methyl group (C2) would lead to the more substituted alkene, **1-methylcyclohexene**. However, for this to happen, the hydrogen on C2 must be axial and anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. In the necessary chair conformation, the methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. Therefore, elimination to form the Zaitsev product is not possible.\n*   **Hofmann Product (less substituted alkene):** Elimination of a hydrogen from the other adjacent carbon (C6) would lead to the less substituted alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene**. In the chair conformation with an axial bromine, there is an axial hydrogen on C6 that is perfectly positioned (anti-periplanar) for elimination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBecause of the rigid stereochemical demands of the E2 mechanism, the reaction is forced to proceed by removing the only available anti-periplanar hydrogen. This leads exclusively to the formation of the less substituted alkene. Even though potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base that typically favors the formation of the Hofmann product due to sterics, in this specific case, the stereoelectronic requirements are the determining factor. The only possible product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
