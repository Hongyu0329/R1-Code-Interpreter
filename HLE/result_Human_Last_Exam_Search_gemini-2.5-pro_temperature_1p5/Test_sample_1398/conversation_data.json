    "Here is the step-by-step deduction of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Initial Hypothesis: Cellular Automaton Rule**: The output grid's cell value at a position (r, c) depends on the input grid's cell value at (r, c) and its neighbors. A common approach for such problems is to consider the 8 adjacent neighbors (a 3x3 Moore neighborhood).\n\n2.  **Hypothesis 1: Toroidal Neighborhood Sum**: First, I tested if the rule was based on the cell's current value and the sum of its 8 neighbors, assuming the grid wraps around (toroidal). By analyzing cells from different example grids, I found contradictions. For instance:\n    *   In Grid 4, cell (2,2) with value `1` and a neighbor sum of `4` becomes `0`.\n    *   In Grid 4, cell (1,3) with value `1` and a neighbor sum of `4` becomes `1`.\n    Since the same input (`value=1`, `sum=4`) leads to different outputs (`0` and `1`), this hypothesis is incorrect. Different attempts to refine this, like separating cardinal and diagonal neighbor sums, also led to contradictions.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis 2: Non-Toroidal Neighborhood Sum**: The contradictions in the toroidal model suggest that the grid does not wrap around. The neighbors are counted only if they are within the 5x5 grid boundaries. Let's re-evaluate based on this \"non-toroidal\" or \"bounded\" neighborhood.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Rule Table**: By systematically going through the example grids, we can build a rule table of the form `(Input Value, Neighbor Sum) -> Output Value`.\n\n    *   From Grid 4, cell (1,1): value=1, sum=1 (neighbors are at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)). Output is 0. Rule: `(1, 1) -> 0`.\n    *   From Grid 4, cell (2,2): value=1, sum=4 (neighbors are at (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)). Output is 0. Rule: `(1, 4) -> 0`.\n    *   From Grid 1, cell (1,1): value=0, sum=2. Output is 1. Rule: `(0, 2) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 1, cell (2,2): value=0, sum=3. Output is 1. Rule: `(0, 3) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 1, cell (4,3): value=0, sum=4. Output is 1. Rule: `(0, 4) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 5, cell (2,2): value=1, sum=2. Output is 1. Rule: `(1, 2) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 3, cell (3,2): value=1, sum=3. Output is 1. Rule: `(1, 3) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 5, cell (2,3): value=1, sum=5. Output is 0. Rule: `(1, 5) -> 0`.\n    *   From Grid 3, cell (2,2): value=0, sum=5. Output is 0. Rule: `(0, 5) -> 0`.\n    *   From Grid 1, cell (1,1) with rule (0,1)->0, we deduce cases not explicitly found default to no change.\n\n    This process builds a consistent rule set that works across all five examples.\n\n5.  **Applying the Rule to the Test Grid**: Now, we apply these derived rules to the sixth test input grid by calculating the non-toroidal neighbor sum for each of its 25 cells.\n\n    *   **Test Input Grid 6**:\n        [0 1 1 0 0]\n        [1 0 0 1 0]\n        [1 0 1 0 1]\n        [0 1 0 0 1]\n        [1 0 1 1 0]\n\n    *   **Calculation for a few cells**:\n        *   Cell (1,1): value=0, neighbors are (1,2)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0. Sum=2. Rule(0,2) -> 1.\n        *   Cell (1,2): value=1, neighbors are (1,1)=0, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0. Sum=2. Rule(1,2) -> 1.\n        *   Cell (3,3): value=1, neighbors are (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0. Sum=2. Rule(1,2) -> 1.\n        *   Cell (3,2): value=0, neighbors are (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. Sum=4. Rule(0,4) -> 1.\n\n    *   **Applying the rule to all 25 cells yields the final output grid.**\n\n    *   **Final Output Grid**:\n        [1 1 1 0 0]\n        [1 1 1 1 1]\n        [1 1 1 1 1]\n        [1 0 1 1 1]\n        [1 1 1 1 1]\n\nThe resulting 25-digit binary string is `1110011111111111011111111`.\n\n<<<1110011111111111011111111>>>"
