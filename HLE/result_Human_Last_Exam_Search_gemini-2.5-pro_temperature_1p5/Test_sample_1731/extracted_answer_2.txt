The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³)V T³ and U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³)V T⁴, respectively. These are derived from the Planck distribution, the establishment of which as the equilibrium state can be rigorously justified through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems.
