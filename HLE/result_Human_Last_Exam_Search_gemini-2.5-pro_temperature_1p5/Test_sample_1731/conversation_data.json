    "## Equilibrium Properties of Photon Gas Derived from Large Deviation Principles\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, i.e., a photon gas, can be determined by applying the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the statistical behavior of systems and identifying their most probable, or equilibrium, states.\n\nRecent research has demonstrated the application of these theorems to analyze the distributions of a Bose gas of photons and Planck's identical linear oscillators. This approach allows for the calculation of large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for both the spatial and energy distributions of photons.\n\n**At thermodynamic equilibrium, the system settles into a state that maximizes the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy and simultaneously minimizes the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function.** By applying these extremum principles under the appropriate constraints for a photon gas, the well-established equilibrium properties can be re-derived.\n\nFor a photon gas in thermal equilibrium within a cavity, it is treated as a collection of indistinguishable bosons. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas is that the number of photons is not conserved, as they can be created and destroyed by the walls of the container. This leads to a chemical potential of zero for the photon gas at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium state of a photon gas is described by the Planck distribution. From this, the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy can be derived.\n\nThe **mean energy (U)** of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n<center>U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³)V T⁴</center>\n\nHere, k is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. This can also be expressed in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ as U = (4σ/c)V T⁴.\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas at equilibrium is:\n\n<center>S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³)V T³</center>\n\nThis result can be obtained from thermodynamic relations involving the Helmholtz free energy.\n\nThe application of large deviation theorems provides a rigorous statistical foundation for these macroscopic thermodynamic quantities. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, which deals with the probability of the empirical distribution of a set of random variables, connects to the spatial distribution of the photons. In equilibrium, the photon distribution is the one that maximizes the statistical entropy, which corresponds to the most probable configuration.\n\nConcurrently, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, which concerns the large deviations of the sum of random variables, is applied to the energy distribution of the photons. The equilibrium state corresponds to the mean energy that minimizes the large deviation rate function, consistent with the expected value from the Planck distribution. The use of Lagrange multipliers in this context helps to establish the equilibrium conditions under the constraints of the system.\n\nIn essence, the large deviation framework rigorously shows that the equilibrium state of a photon gas, as described by the Planck distribution and characterized by the above mean energy and entropy, is not just a postulate but the overwhelmingly most probable state from a statistical standpoint.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³)V T³ and U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³)V T⁴, respectively. These are derived from the Planck distribution, the establishment of which as the equilibrium state can be rigorously justified through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems.>>>"
