    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of the figure eight knot is known as a quandle, and for this specific knot, the smallest such structure has 5 elements.\n\nThe coloring of knots is a mathematical technique used to distinguish them from one another. For a knot to be \"colorable\" with a certain number of colors, say 'n', there's a specific rule that must be followed at each crossing. This rule is an algebraic one: if an over-crossing arc is labeled with color 'a', and the two under-crossing arcs are labeled 'b' and 'c', then the equation `2a - b - c` must be equivalent to 0 modulo n.\n\nThe figure eight knot is the simplest knot that cannot be colored with three colors. However, it is 5-colorable. This is related to the determinant of the knot, which is a value calculated from a matrix representing the knot's crossings. For the figure-eight knot, the determinant is 5, which indicates that it can be colored with 5 colors.\n\nThe algebraic structure that formalizes this coloring is called a quandle. For an n-coloring, the quandle used is the set of integers modulo n, with the operation `x * y = 2y - x (mod n)`. Since the smallest number of colors (greater than 1) for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is 5, the corresponding quandle has 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
