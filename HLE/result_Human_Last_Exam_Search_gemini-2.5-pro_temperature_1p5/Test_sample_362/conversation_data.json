    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). This reaction is significant in organic synthesis because it forms a carbon-carbon double bond at a precise location.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  **Identification of Reactants**: The two reactants are an aldehyde, pivalaldehyde, and a phosphorus ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane.\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde** (2,2-dimethylpropanal) is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   **The Wittig reagent** is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. Its structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and (C₆H₄Cl) is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**: The nucleophilic carbon of the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This leads to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane. This intermediate then decomposes to yield the final products: an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O). The essence of the reaction is the replacement of the carbonyl C=O double bond with the C=C double bond from the ylide.\n\n3.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` portion of pivalaldehyde combines with the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` portion from the ylide.\n    *   This combination results in the alkene: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n\n4.  **Product Name**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond is identified and numbered to give the double bond the lowest possible position. The substituents are then named and located. The correct IUPAC name for the resulting structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the ylide is non-stabilized, which typically favors the formation of the Z-isomer (cis). However, the presence of the bulky tert-butyl group on the pivalaldehyde can introduce significant steric hindrance, which may favor the formation of the more stable E-isomer (trans). Often, a mixture of both E and Z isomers is produced.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
