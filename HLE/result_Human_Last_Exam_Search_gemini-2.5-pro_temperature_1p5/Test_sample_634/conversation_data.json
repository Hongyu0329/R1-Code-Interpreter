    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the method of row-reducing the stacked matrix M(s) formed by P1 and P2. Any common right divisor of P1 and P2 is a right divisor of any right linear combination of P1 and P2. The GCRD can be found by applying elementary row operations to the matrix M(s) to reduce it to a simpler form. The resulting non-zero matrix block will be a GCRD.\n\nLet's construct the matrix M(s):\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[[s^2 + s, -s],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n [s, 0],\n [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe apply elementary row operations, which include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n1.  Let the rows be R1, R2, R3, R4. Swap R1 with R3 to have a simpler pivot in the first row.\n    [[s, 0],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  Use the new R1' = [s, 0] to eliminate other entries in the first column.\n    *   R2' = R2 + s * R1' = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n    *   R3' = R3 - (s+1) * R1' = [s^2 + s - s(s+1), -s] = [0, -s]\n    *   R4' = R4 + 1 * R1' = [-s - 1 + s, 1] = [-1, 1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[s, 0],\n     [-1, s^2],\n     [0, -s],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n3.  Use the new R2' = [-1, s^2] as a pivot, as it has a constant in the first column.\n    *   R1'' = R1' + s * R2' = [s - s, s*s^2] = [0, s^3]\n    *   R4'' = R4' - R2' = [-1 - (-1), 1 - s^2] = [0, 1-s^2]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, s^3],\n     [-1, s^2],\n     [0, -s],\n     [0, 1-s^2]]\n\n4.  The first column is now simplified. Let's focus on the second column for the rows with a zero in the first column (R1'', R3, R4''). These rows are [0, s^3], [0, -s], and [0, 1-s^2]. We can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials on the second elements. The greatest common divisor of s^3, -s, and 1-s^2 is 1. We can obtain a row through elementary operations.\n\n    Consider the polynomials p3 = -s and p4 = 1-s^2. By polynomial division, we have 1 - s^2 = s(-s) + 1. Rearranging gives the remainder: 1 = (1 - s^2) - s(-s).\n    This corresponds to the row operation: R_new = R4'' - s * R3.\n    *   R_new = [0, 1-s^2] - s*[0, -s] = [0, 1-s^2 + s^2] =\n\n5.  Now we have a row. Let's replace R4'' with this new row. The matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n    [[0, s^3],\n     [-1, s^2],\n     [0, -s],\n    ]\n\n6.  Use the row R_new = to eliminate all other entries in the second column.\n    *   R1''' = R1'' - s^3 * R_new = [0, s^3 - s^3] =\n    *   R2'' = R2' - s^2 * R_new = [-1, s^2 - s^2] = [-1, 0]\n    *   R3'' = R3 + s * R_new = [0, -s + s] =\n\n7.  The set of non-zero rows we are left with is {[-1, 0],}. We can multiply the first row by -1 to make it.\n\nThe simplified matrix, after reordering the rows, is:\n[,\n,\n,\n]\n\nThe non-zero part of the reduced matrix is the identity matrix I. Therefore, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
