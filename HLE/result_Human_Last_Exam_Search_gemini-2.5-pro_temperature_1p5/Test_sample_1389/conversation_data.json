    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while offering no protection to the remainder. The question is whether the standard vaccine efficacy formula, calculated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR), accurately reflects the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for this type of vaccine.\n\n### Definitions\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate of infection in the vaccinated group (IRv) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IRu). `IRR = IRv / IRu`.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE) based on Incidence Rates:** This is the percent reduction in disease occurrence in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group, calculated as `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n*   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection per single exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Model:** In this model, if a vaccine has an efficacy of, for example, 80%, it means that 80% of vaccinated people are perfectly protected from infection, while the other 20% have no protection at all and are as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\n### Analysis\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1.  Let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are perfectly protected by the all-or-nothing vaccine. The remaining proportion, `1-p`, is not protected.\n2.  The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IRu`) depends on the force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed to the pathogen).\n3.  The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IRv`) is an average of the rates in the protected and unprotected subgroups.\n    *   The protected subgroup (proportion `p`) has an incidence rate of 0.\n    *   The unprotected subgroup (proportion `1-p`) has an incidence rate equal to the unvaccinated group (`IRu`).\n4.  Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is: `IRv = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * IRu) = (1-p) * IRu`.\n5.  Now, we calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n    `IRR = IRv / IRu = ((1-p) * IRu) / IRu = 1-p`.\n6.  The vaccine efficacy calculated from this is:\n    `VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nThis shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard `1 - IRR` calculation yields `p`, which is the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nThe \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for this type of vaccine can be interpreted as the average reduction in susceptibility for the entire vaccinated group. In this case, the average susceptibility is reduced by a factor of `p`. Because the standard efficacy calculation (`1 - IRR`) also results in `p`, it correctly estimates this average effect. The time-invariant vaccine efficacy estimator under an all-or-nothing model estimates the proportion of individuals who are completely protected.\n\nTherefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, where this efficacy is understood as the proportion of the vaccinated population that receives complete protection.\n\n<<<C>>>"
