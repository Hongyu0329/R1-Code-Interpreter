    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35.\n\nThis is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. Let a family of bipartite graphs \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\) cover the edges of the complete graph \\(K_n\\). The quantity to be minimized is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph, i.e., \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|\\).\n\nA well-established theorem by G. Hansel provides the exact minimum value for this problem. The theorem states that the minimum sum of the orders (number of vertices) of a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of \\(K_n\\) is equal to \\(n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). A similar result was independently discovered by Katona and Szemer√©di.\n\nTo solve the problem for n = 35, we need to calculate this value:\n\nFirst, we determine the value of \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil\\).\n*   We know that \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n*   Since \\(32 < 35 \\le 64\\), the logarithm of 35 to the base 2 is between 5 and 6.\n*   Therefore, the ceiling of \\(\\log_2 35\\), denoted as \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil\\), is 6.\n\nNext, we multiply this value by n:\n*   Minimum number of vertices = \\(35 \\times 6\\)\n\nThe final calculation is:\n*   \\(35 \\times 6 = 210\\)\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of \\(K_{35}\\) is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
