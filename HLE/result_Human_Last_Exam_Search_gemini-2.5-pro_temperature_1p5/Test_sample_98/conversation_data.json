    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned on one of its triangular faces and filled with water to half of its total height, the surface of the water will form a regular decagon.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it rests on one of its faces, that triangular face forms the base of the tank. The face directly opposite this base is parallel to it.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at the halfway point of its height. Due to the symmetrical properties of the icosahedron, a horizontal slice at this midpoint creates a regular decagon. This is because a plane perpendicular to an axis connecting the centers of two opposite faces at its midpoint intersects the icosahedron to form a ten-sided polygon with equal sides and equal interior angles.\n\nTherefore, the water surface will have the distinct shape of a regular decagon.\n\n<<<A regular decagon>>>"
