    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of Pummerer rearrangement. In this reaction, the sulfoxide is activated by the electrophilic triflic anhydride, followed by the introduction of a cyanide group.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This step forms a triflyloxysulfonium salt, [Ph-S(OTf)-CH₃]⁺.\n2.  **Formation of a thionium ion:** The intermediate loses triflic acid (TfOH) through the removal of an acidic proton from the methyl group. This results in the formation of an electrophilic thionium ion, [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺.\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion, delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN), attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion. This forms the final product.\n\nThe resulting product has the chemical structure Ph-S-CH₂-CN. To determine its IUPAC name, the nitrile group (-CN) is considered the principal functional group.\n\n*   The parent chain containing the nitrile is two carbons long, hence \"ethanenitrile\".\n*   The phenylthio group (C₆H₅S-) is attached to the second carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrile group).\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name for the product Ph-S-CH₂-CN is **2-(phenylthio)ethanenitrile**. This compound is also commonly known as (phenylthio)acetonitrile, with phenylacetonitrile being a preferred IUPAC name for benzyl cyanide (C₆H₅CH₂CN).\n\n<<<2-(phenylthio)ethanenitrile>>>"
