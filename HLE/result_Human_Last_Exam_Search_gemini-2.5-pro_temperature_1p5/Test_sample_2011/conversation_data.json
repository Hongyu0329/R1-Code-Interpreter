    "The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with `n = 128` vertices is 128.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**: The question asks for the number of different sizes of cliques that appear as *induced subgraphs*. A subset of vertices forms an induced clique of size `k` if the subgraph formed by these `k` vertices and all the edges between them in the original graph is a complete graph (`K_k`). A complete graph is one where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This means we are looking for the number of distinct integers `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists in the graph.\n\n2.  **Establishing an Upper Bound**: Let `G` be any graph with 128 vertices. If `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`, this clique is formed by a subset of `k` vertices from `G`. By definition, the number of vertices in this subset, `k`, cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, any possible clique size `k` must be an integer satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`. The set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`. Consequently, the maximum number of different clique sizes cannot be more than 128.\n\n3.  **Constructing a Graph that Achieves the Maximum**: To show that 128 is achievable, we need to find a specific graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. The complete graph, `K_128`, serves this purpose. In a `K_128`, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   To find an induced clique of size `k` (for any `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`), simply select any `k` vertices.\n    *   The subgraph induced by these `k` vertices will include all the edges between them. Since all these vertices are connected to each other in `K_128`, the induced subgraph is a complete graph `K_k`.\n    *   Since this is true for any `k` from 1 to 128, the complete graph `K_128` has induced cliques of all 128 possible sizes.\n\nSince we have established an upper bound of 128 and found a graph that achieves this bound, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
