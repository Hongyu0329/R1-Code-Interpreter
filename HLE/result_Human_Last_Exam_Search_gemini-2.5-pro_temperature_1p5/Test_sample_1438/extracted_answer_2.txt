The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the rules: the integral of a constant is zero, and the integral of the Grassmann variable itself is one (∫ dθ θ = 1). This definition ensures that the integral picks out the component of a function that is linear in the Grassmann variable, which is a direct mathematical reflection of the Pauli exclusion principle.
