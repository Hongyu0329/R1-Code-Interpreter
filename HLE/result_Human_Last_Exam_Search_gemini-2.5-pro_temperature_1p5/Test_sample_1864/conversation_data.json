    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples. The accuracy of a multicolor sorting experiment relies heavily on proper controls to ensure correct compensation, accurate gating, and the purity of the sorted populations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and why they are necessary:\n\n### 1. Basic Controls (2 tubes)\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 tube):** This sample consists of cells alone with no added fluorochromes. It is the most fundamental control, used to assess the natural autofluorescence of your cells and to set the baseline voltage for the detectors (PMTs).\n*   **Streptavidin Specificity Control (1 tube):** When using a streptavidin-biotin detection system (e.g., for the PE channel), it's crucial to have a control where cells are incubated only with the streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate (e.g., Streptavidin-PE) without the biotinylated primary antibody. This checks for any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate to your cells.\n\n### 2. Controls for Compensation (6 tubes)\nCompensation is a mathematical correction for the spectral overlap of fluorochromes into detectors other than their primary one. For accurate compensation, you need single-stained samples that are at least as bright as the signal in your fully stained sample.\n*   **AF350 single-positive control (1 tube)**\n*   **GFP single-positive control (1 tube):** This would typically be cells that are known to express GFP.\n*   **PE (Streptavidin) single-positive control (1 tube)**\n*   **AF647 single-positive control (1 tube)**\n*   **AF750 single-positive control (1 tube)**\n*   **Viability Dye single-positive control (1 tube):** It is critical to include a viability dye in a sorting experiment to exclude dead cells, which can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence. A separate single-stained control for the viability dye is needed for compensation.\n\n### 3. Controls for Gating (5 tubes)\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are essential in multicolor experiments for setting accurate gates. An FMO control includes all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except for one*. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the \"empty\" channel, allowing you to precisely define the boundary between your negative and positive populations. For a sorting experiment where purity is paramount, an FMO for each parameter being gated on is highly recommended.\n    *   FMO control for the AF350 channel (all stains except AF350)\n    *   FMO control for the GFP channel (all stains except GFP)\n    *   FMO control for the PE channel (all stains except PE)\n    *   FMO control for the AF647 channel (all stains except AF647)\n    *   FMO control for the AF750 channel (all stains except AF750)\n\nIn summary, preparing these 13 control tubes, in addition to your fully stained experimental sample, will provide the necessary foundation for a robust and reliable five-color cell sorting experiment.\n\n<<<13>>>"
