    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a playful concept in chemistry, blending the structure of a benzene ring with the iconic three-pointed star of the Mercedes-Benz logo. The structure consists of a central benzene ring, which is made up of 6 carbon atoms. Attached to this ring are three ethyl groups, arranged symmetrically to mimic the star logo. Each ethyl group contains 2 carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of carbon atoms in \"mercedesbenzene\" can be calculated as follows:\n*   6 carbons from the benzene ring\n*   6 carbons from the three ethyl groups (2 carbons per group x 3 groups)\n\nThis results in a total of 12 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<12>>>"
