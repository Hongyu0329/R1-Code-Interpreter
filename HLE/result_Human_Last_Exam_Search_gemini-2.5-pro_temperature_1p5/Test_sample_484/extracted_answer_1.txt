The derived expression for the change in synaptic efficacy, in terms of the local variables $u_i$ (postsynaptic accumulator) and $v_i$ (presynaptic accumulator), and a new constant $\rho = (\alpha-\beta)(1-\eta)$, is:
$$
\tau_w\frac{\mathrm{d}w_i}{\mathrm{d}t} = u_i \left( \beta + \frac{\rho}{1+v_i} \right)
$$
