    "To solve this competitive programming problem with maximum memory efficiency, we need to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case, while using the minimum amount of memory for variables.\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe key to memory efficiency for this problem is to avoid storing the second string in memory. We must read and store the first string to have it available for comparison. However, the second string can be read character by character and compared on the fly with the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n\nThis approach requires a buffer for the first string, a loop index, and a variable to hold the character being read from the second string.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program solves the \"Petya and Strings\" problem (Codeforces 112A)\n * with a focus on being highly memory-efficient.\n */\nint main() {\n    /*\n     * Variable 1: A character array (buffer) to store the first string.\n     * The maximum string length is 100, so a size of 101 is required\n     * to include the null terminator ('\\0').\n     * Memory used: 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 bytes.\n    */\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    /*\n     * After scanf reads the string, a newline character ('\\n') remains in the\n     * input buffer. We must consume it before reading the second string\n     * character by character.\n    */\n    getchar();\n\n    /*\n     * Variable 2: A loop index 'i'. Since the string length is at most 100,\n     * an 'unsigned char' (range 0-255) is the smallest integer type that\n     * can serve as the index, minimizing its memory footprint.\n     * Memory used: sizeof(unsigned char) = 1 byte.\n    */\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    /*\n     * Variable 3: An integer 'c2' to store characters from the second string.\n     * It must be of type 'int' because getchar() returns an 'int' to be\n     * able to represent the special value EOF (End-of-File).\n     * Memory used: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes (on typical systems).\n    */\n    int c2;\n\n    // Loop through the first string until its end.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read one character from the second string.\n        c2 = getchar();\n\n        // Convert both characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        int lower_s1 = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n        int lower_c2 = tolower((unsigned char)c2);\n\n        // If characters are not equal, determine the result and exit.\n        if (lower_s1 != lower_c2) {\n            if (lower_s1 < lower_c2) {\n                printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            } else {\n                printf(\"1\\n\");\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all variables declared within the `main` function. A variable in C is a named piece of memory, and its size depends on its data type. Stack memory is used to store variables with short lifespans within functions.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This is an array to store the first input string. Its size is 101 bytes (100 for characters and 1 for the null terminator).\n2.  **`unsigned char i;`**: This variable is used as a loop counter. `unsigned char` is the smallest data type for a non-negative integer, occupying just **1 byte**.\n3.  **`int c2;`**: This variable holds the character read by `getchar()`. It must be an `int` to accommodate the `EOF` value. An `int` typically occupies **4 bytes**.\n\nThe temporary variables `lower_s1` and `lower_c2` inside the loop will also use stack space (or be optimized into registers by the compiler), each taking space equivalent to an `int` (4 bytes). However, to be absolutely minimal, one could perform the comparisons without declaring them, but their impact is the same. Let's calculate based on the declared variables which represent the program's defined state.\n\nTotal memory `m` for variables is:\n`m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c2)`\n`m = 101 + 1 + 4`\n`m = 106` bytes\n\n<<<106>>>"
