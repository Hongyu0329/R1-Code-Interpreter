    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set, we first need to find the total number of electrons (N) and the total number of basis functions (orbitals, K).\n\n### 1. Determining the Total Number of Electrons (N)\n\nThe number of electrons for each atom is equal to its atomic number. The atoms in the molecule are one Carbon (C), three Hydrogens (H), one Silicon (Si), and one Fluorine (F).\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 1 electron per atom (x3) = 3 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons (N) is the sum:\nN = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n\n### 2. Determining the Total Number of Basis Functions (K)\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set is also known as 6-31G(d,p). This means it's a split-valence double-zeta basis set with d-type polarization functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions on hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 2 basis functions for the 1s orbital.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which are 3 functions.\n    *   Total per H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (Second-row atoms):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 9 basis functions (describing the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals in a split-valence scheme).\n    *   The `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions. Using Cartesian d-functions, this adds 6 functions.\n    *   Total per C or F atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Silicon (Si) (Third-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part for a third-row atom provides 13 basis functions (describing the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals).\n    *   The `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions, which is 6 functions.\n    *   Total per Si atom = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of basis functions (K) for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1x C, 3x H, 1x Si, 1x F):\nK = (1 * 15) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 19) + (1 * 15)\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64 basis functions**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Number of Singlet CSFs\n\nFor a full CI calculation, we need to consider all possible ways to distribute the N electrons among the K orbitals. Since the molecule has an even number of electrons (32), its ground state is a singlet state (total spin S=0).\n\nThe number of singlet CSFs is given by the Weyl-Pauncz formula:\nNumber of Singlet CSFs = (2S + 1)/(K + 1) * (<sup>K+1</sup>C<sub>N/2 - S</sub>) * (<sup>K+1</sup>C<sub>N/2 + S + 1</sub>)\n\nFor our case, N = 32, K = 64, and S = 0.\nTherefore, N/2 = 16.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\nNumber of Singlet CSFs = 1/(64 + 1) * (<sup>65</sup>C<sub>16</sub>) * (<sup>65</sup>C<sub>17</sub>)\n\nLet's calculate the binomial coefficients:\n*   <sup>65</sup>C<sub>16</sub> = 65! / (16! * (65-16)!) = 1,313,463,090,384,175\n*   <sup>65</sup>C<sub>17</sub> = 65! / (17! * (65-17)!) = 3,784,400,501,104,900\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of singlet CSFs:\nNumber of Singlet CSFs = (1 / 65) * 1,313,463,090,384,175 * 3,784,400,501,104,900\nNumber of Singlet CSFs â‰ˆ 7.647 x 10<sup>28</sup>\n\nThe number of CSFs in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with a 6-31G** basis set is approximately 7.647 x 10<sup>28</sup>.\n\n<<<7.647e+28>>>"
