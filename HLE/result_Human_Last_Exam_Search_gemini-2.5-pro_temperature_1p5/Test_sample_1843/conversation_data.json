    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to understand the structure of these characters.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is called primitive if its conductor is exactly $N$. If the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then a character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$:\n$36036 = 4 \\times 9009 = 2^2 \\times 9 \\times 1001 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nSo, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo 36036 is a product of primitive characters:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, with conductors 4, 9, 7, 11, and 13, respectively. We need to find the number of such combinations where the lcm of their orders is 6.\n\nLet's determine the possible orders for primitive characters for each conductor:\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(4) = 2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The characters that are not primitive are those induced from modulus 3, which have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, the primitive characters are those with orders 3 and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) = 2$ (for order 3) and $\\phi(6) = 2$ (for order 6). All these orders (3 and 6) are divisors of 6.\n*   **Conductor 7**: The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All characters are primitive except for the principal character (order 1). The possible orders that are divisors of 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of primitive characters for these orders are $\\phi(2)=1$ (order 2), $\\phi(3)=2$ (order 3), and $\\phi(6)=2$ (order 6).\n*   **Conductor 11**: The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. For the total character order to be 6, the order of this component character must divide 6. The divisors of 10 that also divide 6 are 1 and 2. As it must be a non-principal primitive character, its order must be 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character.\n*   **Conductor 13**: The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters must divide 12. For the total order to be 6, the order of this component must divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters are $\\phi(2)=1$ (order 2), $\\phi(3)=2$ (order 3), and $\\phi(6)=2$ (order 6).\n\nLet $o_i$ be the order of the character $\\chi_i$. We need to find the number of tuples of characters such that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5) = 6$. The possible orders for each component are:\n*   $o_1 \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_4 \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of the orders must be 6. Let's analyze this condition.\n1.  All possible orders are divisors of 6, so their lcm will also be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The order of $\\chi_1$ is 2, so the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n3.  The order of $\\chi_2$ is either 3 or 6, so it is always a multiple of 3. This guarantees the lcm will be a multiple of 3.\n\nA number that is a multiple of both 2 and 3, and is also a divisor of 6, must be exactly 6. Therefore, any combination of the allowed primitive characters will result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of available choices for each component:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_1$ (conductor 4, order 2): 1\n*   Choices for $\\chi_2$ (conductor 9, orders 3 or 6): $2 + 2 = 4$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_3$ (conductor 7, orders 2, 3, or 6): $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$ (conductor 11, order 2): 1\n*   Choices for $\\chi_5$ (conductor 13, orders 2, 3, or 6): $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the product of these counts:\n$1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
