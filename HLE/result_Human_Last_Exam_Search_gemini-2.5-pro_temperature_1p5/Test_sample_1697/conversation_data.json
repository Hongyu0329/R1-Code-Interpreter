    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide**.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The starting molecule has two functional groups that can direct the metalation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position C1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position C3. Both are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) because their heteroatoms can coordinate to the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent.\n    *   The amide group at C1 directs deprotonation to the adjacent *ortho* positions, C2 and C6.\n    *   The amino group at C3 directs deprotonation to its *ortho* positions, C2 and C4.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** The C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. This synergistic activation makes the proton at C2 the most acidic on the aromatic ring and the preferential site for deprotonation by the strong base. The combination of sec-BuLi, a powerful and sterically hindered base, with TMEDA, a chelating agent that increases the reactivity of the organolithium compound, efficiently removes the proton at C2. This step forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The aryllithium intermediate, with its nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position, then reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I). The carbanion attacks the electrophilic methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product is the starting benzamide with a methyl group introduced at the C2 position, between the two original directing groups.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide>>>"
