    "In a barbell graph with 10 nodes, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25 or 4%.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n1.  **Structure of a 10-Node Barbell Graph**\n    A standard barbell graph is formed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge. A 10-node barbell graph, therefore, consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5), linked by one \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\" edge. This single edge is what makes the graph a \"barbell\" and represents a bottleneck for information flow between the two highly connected clusters.\n\n2.  **Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n    Randomized uniform gossiping is a decentralized communication protocol used in networks. The process for sampling an edge involves two steps:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all the nodes in the graph. With 10 nodes, the probability of picking any specific node is 1/10.\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with. The edge connecting the node and its chosen neighbor is the one considered \"sampled.\"\n\n3.  **Calculating the Probability**\n    To find the probability of sampling the specific bottleneck edge, we need to consider the two nodes it connects. Let's call these nodes `A` and `B`. The bottleneck edge `(A, B)` can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   Node `A` is chosen, and it then chooses node `B`.\n    *   Node `B` is chosen, and it then chooses node `A`.\n\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    `P(edge AB) = P(choose A) * P(A chooses B) + P(choose B) * P(B chooses A)`\n\n4.  **Determining Node Degrees**\n    The probability of a node choosing a specific neighbor depends on its total number of neighbors (its degree).\n    *   In a 5-node complete graph (K5), each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (`A` and `B`) are each connected to 4 nodes within their own K5 clique and to 1 node in the other clique (via the bottleneck edge).\n    *   Therefore, the degree of both node `A` and node `B` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    Using the degrees, we can find the probabilities for the final calculation:\n    *   The probability of node `A` being initially selected is 1/10. The probability of it then choosing node `B` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5.\n    *   The probability of node `B` being initially selected is 1/10. The probability of it then choosing node `A` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5.\n\n    Plugging these into the formula:\n    `P(edge AB) = (1/10 * 1/5) + (1/10 * 1/5)`\n    `P(edge AB) = 1/50 + 1/50`\n    `P(edge AB) = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\nThis corresponds to a probability of 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
