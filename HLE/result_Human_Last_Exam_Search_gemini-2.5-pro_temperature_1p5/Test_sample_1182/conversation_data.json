    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$), we need to find a stable model of the curve and analyze its special fiber.\n\nFirst, we perform a change of variables to find a better model of the curve. The given equation is:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n\nWe can complete the square to simplify the equation. Let the polynomial on the right be $f(x)$. Notice that $x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 = x^2(1+4x+4x^2) = x^2(1+2x)^2$. This suggests a transformation involving this term. Let $y' = y - x(1+2x) = y-x-2x^2$. This is a valid transformation over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The equation for the curve can be rewritten in terms of $y'$ as:\n$(y')^2 + 2(x+2x^2)y' - (8x+8x^5) = 0$\n\nThis new model is isomorphic to the original curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's call it $C'$. Let's examine its reduction modulo 2. The coefficients $2(x+2x^2)$ and $-(8x+8x^5)$ are divisible by 2. Thus, the reduction modulo 2 of the equation for $C'$ is $(y')^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This gives a non-reduced special fiber (a \"fat line\"), which is not stable.\n\nTo find a better model, we can try scaling the variables. Let's introduce a new variable $y_1 = y'/2$. Substituting $y' = 2y_1$ into the equation for $C'$ gives:\n$(2y_1)^2 + 2(x+2x^2)(2y_1) - (8x+8x^5) = 0$\n$4y_1^2 + 4(x+2x^2)y_1 - 8(x+x^5) = 0$\n\nDividing the entire equation by 4, we obtain a new model, which we'll call $C''$:\n$y_1^2 + (x+2x^2)y_1 - 2(x+x^5) = 0$\n\nThis model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Now, let's consider its reduction modulo 2:\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$y_1(y_1+x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n\nThe special fiber of this model is the union of two distinct lines in the affine plane over the field with two elements $\\mathbb{F}_2$: the line $y_1=0$ and the line $y_1=x$. These two lines intersect at a single point, $(x, y_1) = (0,0)$.\n\nHowever, for a curve of genus 2, the special fiber of a stable model must have arithmetic genus 2. A configuration of two rational curves (lines) intersecting at a single point has an arithmetic genus of 0. This indicates that the model $C''$ is not yet the stable model because it must be singular at the point corresponding to the intersection.\n\nLet's find a more suitable model. Consider the transformation $x=X/2$ and $y=Y/2$ on the original equation. This is equivalent to clearing denominators after the substitution.\n$y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nSubstitute $x=X/2$:\n$y^2 = 8(X/2) + (X/2)^2 + 4(X/2)^3 + 4(X/2)^4 + 8(X/2)^5$\n$y^2 = 4X + \\frac{X^2}{4} + \\frac{4X^3}{8} + \\frac{4X^4}{16} + \\frac{8X^5}{32}$\n$y^2 = 4X + \\frac{X^2}{4} + \\frac{X^3}{2} + \\frac{X^4}{4} + \\frac{X^5}{4}$\n\nTo obtain an integral model, we can multiply by 4. This suggests the transformation $Y=2y$:\n$(2y)^2 = 16X + X^2 + 2X^3 + X^4 + X^5$\n$Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\n\nLet's analyze the reduction of this model modulo 2:\n$Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2 \\pmod 2$\n$Y^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1) \\pmod 2$\n\nThe polynomial $p(X) = X^3+X^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The reduced curve is singular at the point $(X,Y)=(0,0)$. This type of singularity, where the equation locally resembles $Y^2=kX^4$ or more generally $Y^2 = X^2(\\text{...})$, is a tacnode.\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve is obtained by resolving the singularities of its special fiber. A tacnode singularity resolves into a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) that intersects the strict transform of the original curve at two distinct points. The strict transform of $Y^2 = X^2(X^3+X^2+1)$ is the smooth curve $Z^2 = X^3+X^2+1$, which is an elliptic curve (genus 1).\n\nThus, the stable special fiber consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve that intersect at two points. This configuration is a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2, and it has two ordinary double points (nodes) at the two intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
