    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that characterizes the mapping from three-dimensional space (R³) to the two-sphere (S²). For a normalized vector field **n**(x,y,z), such as the one provided, which is uniform at infinity, the Hopf charge is an integer. It describes the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere S².\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge H is given by the integral:\nH = - (1 / (16π²)) ∫ **F** ⋅ **A** d³r\nwhere **F** is the emergent magnetic field defined by Fᵢ = ½ εᵢⱼₖ **n** ⋅ (∂ⱼ**n** × ∂ₖ**n**), and **A** is the vector potential such that **F** = ∇ × **A**.\n\nCalculating this integral directly is complex. However, the Hopf charge for hopfions with an axial symmetry can often be determined by decomposing the structure into winding numbers. For a toroidal hopfion, the Hopf charge is typically the product of the azimuthal winding number, `n`, and the poloidal winding number, `m`, so that H = n × m.\n\nLet's analyze the given vector field **n** = (nx, ny, nz) in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z), where x = ρ cos(φ) and y = ρ sin(φ).\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (n):**\n    The phase of the in-plane components (nx, ny) determines the azimuthal winding number.\n    nx + i ny = sin(G)cos(f) + i sin(G)sin(f) = sin(G)e^(if)\n    The angle `f` is defined as `atan2(y,x)`, which is the cylindrical azimuthal angle φ. As one goes around the z-axis once (φ from 0 to 2π), the phase `f` also goes from 0 to 2π. This corresponds to an azimuthal winding number **n = 1**.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (m):**\n    The poloidal winding number describes the winding of the vector field in any plane with a constant azimuthal angle φ. Let's consider the half-plane where φ = 0 (the xz-plane with x > 0). In this plane, we examine how the vector **n** rotates as we trace a path around the core of the hopfion.\n\n    The core of the structure is where the vector field points in the opposite direction to the far field.\n    *   At infinity (|**r**| → ∞), `r2` → ∞, which makes `G` = π * exp(-10*r2) → 0. So, **n** → (0, 0, cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1).\n    *   The field is maximally opposite when `r2` = 0, which occurs on the circle defined by x² + y² = 0.5 and z = 0. Here, G = π, and **n** = (0, 0, cos(π)) = (0, 0, -1).\n\n    Now, let's trace a path in a constant-φ plane that encloses the core point. For instance, in the φ=0 plane, we can travel along the line ρ = sqrt(0.5) from z = -∞ to z = +∞.\n    *   At z = -∞, `r2` = |z| → ∞, so G → 0 and **n** → (0, 0, 1).\n    *   At z = 0, `r2` = 0, so G = π and **n** → (0, 0, -1).\n    *   At z = +∞, `r2` = |z| → ∞, so G → 0 and **n** → (0, 0, 1).\n\n    Along this path, the vector **n** starts pointing up, sweeps down to point in the opposite direction, and then returns to pointing up. This constitutes one full 360-degree rotation in the poloidal direction. This corresponds to a poloidal winding number **m = 1**.\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\nH = n × m = 1 × 1 = 1.\n\nThis field configuration represents a fundamental hopfion, which has a Hopf charge of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
