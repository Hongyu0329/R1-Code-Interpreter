    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, playing significant roles in the narrative as settings for divine intervention and as geographical landmarks. To determine the tallest among them, excluding the abode of the gods, Mount Olympus, it is necessary to examine their respective elevations.\n\nThe mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and their heights are as follows:\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** Located in central Greece, it rises to an elevation of 8,061 feet (2,457 meters). In mythology, it was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest mountain on the island of Crete, with an elevation of 8,058 feet (2,456 meters). In mythology, this is the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Situated in northwestern Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy, this mountain has a height of 5,820 feet (1,774 meters). It is from this mountain that the gods are said to have watched the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** A mountain range in central Greece, its highest peak reaches 5,663 feet (1,726 meters). In mythology, it was the stronghold of the Titans.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in the southeastern part of Thessaly, its highest summit is 5,328 feet (1,624 meters).
