    "To date, a total of 10 mature members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the number of mature microRNAs (miRNAs) and the number of genes that produce them. While there are 10 distinct mature let-7 miRNAs, these are encoded by 12 or 13 different precursor genes located on various chromosomes. This is because some mature miRNAs, such as let-7a and let-7f, are produced from multiple precursor genes. For example, the same mature let-7a sequence is generated from three different precursor genes: let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3.\n\nThe let-7 family is a group of closely related miRNAs that play crucial roles in cellular processes like differentiation and tumor suppression. Slight variations in their sequences distinguish the different family members. While most sources converge on the number 10 for mature members, some studies might report slightly different numbers, such as 9 or 11, depending on the specific members included in their analysis.\n\n<<<10>>>"
