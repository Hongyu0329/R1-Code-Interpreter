The effective electron-electron interaction, for a specific momentum transfer **q**, is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = - \sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m} \frac{1}{\omega_n^2+w_q^2}$
Here, $\omega_n=2\pi n/\beta$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency, $w_q$ is the phonon frequency, $g$ is the coupling constant, $m$ is the mass, and $q_j$ is the j-th component of the momentum transfer vector **q**. The negative sign indicates that this interaction is attractive. This attraction is strongest for low frequencies ($\omega_n \approx 0$) and is the basis for the conventional theory of superconductivity.
