    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares consist of all the squares on the first and eighth ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files. This amounts to a total of 28 squares.\n\nIn the game of chess, bishops move along diagonals. A key rule is that a bishop always stays on the squares of the same color. To place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares without any of them being able to attack each other, one can place them all on squares of the same color.\n\nThe 28 edge squares of a chessboard are evenly divided into 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares. By placing a bishop on each of the 14 squares of the same color, no two bishops can attack each other. Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14.\n\nWith 14 out of the 28 edge squares occupied by bishops, the number of edge squares lacking bishops is the difference between the total number of edge squares and the number of bishops placed.\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 (total edge squares) - 14 (bishops placed) = 14.\n\nTherefore, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would remain empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
