    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is **Ontario**.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region. Geographically, its location places it in close proximity to the Ontario border, which lies to the west and south of the community. The traditional territory of the Cree people, known as \"Eeyou Istchee,\" encompasses land in both what is now northern Quebec and Ontario, highlighting the close relationship between the two areas.\n\nWhile road distances to major Ontario cities such as Toronto and Ottawa are substantial, the actual provincial border is much nearer. A map of the region clearly shows Waskaganish's position near the provincial boundary along the coast of James Bay. The other provinces and territories bordering Quebec are Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick to the east, and the territory of Nunavut to the north across the Hudson Strait, all of which are considerably farther from Waskaganish than Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
