    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of 22 June 1940 was the motor passenger ship **Brazza**.\n\nThe a 10,387-ton vessel, was sunk on May 28, 1940, by the German submarine U-37. The attack occurred approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, while the *Brazza* was en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca. The ship was struck by two torpedoes and sank rapidly, resulting in the loss of 379 lives out of the 576 people on board.\n\nAnother significant loss for the French merchant marine before the armistice was the steam merchant **Bretagne**, a vessel of 10,108 tons. It was sunk on October 14, 1939, by the U-boat U-45. This should not be confused with the French battleship *Bretagne*, which was of a much larger displacement and was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-KÃ©bir on July 3, 1940, after the armistice.\n\nOther French vessels sunk by U-boats during this initial period of the war include:\n*   **Louisiane**: A 6,903-ton steam merchant sunk on October 13, 1939, by U-48.\n*   **Loire**: A 4,285-ton steam merchant sunk on November 13, 1939, by U-26.\n*   **Doris**: A 552-ton submarine sunk on May 9, 1940, by U-9.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, and came into effect on June 25, 1940, marking the end of the Battle of France and the period of hostilities for the purposes of this question.\n\n<<<Brazza>>>"
