    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we will follow the definition of the Fredholm index for a linear operator, which is given by:\n\n`index(L) = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L))`\n\nwhere `L` is the operator associated with the boundary-value problem, `ker(L)` is its kernel (null space), and `coker(L)` is its cokernel.\n\n### 1. Defining the Operator and Problem Parameters\n\nThe given boundary-value problem is defined by the system of differential equations:\n`x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)`\nwith a set of boundary conditions.\n\nThis can be associated with a linear operator `L`. The dimension of the system, determined by the size of the matrix `A` (`202000 x 202000`), is `n = 202000`. The problem statement has a typo in specifying the dimension of vector `x(t)`; for the equation to be consistent, `x(t)` must be a 202000-dimensional vector.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n*   `x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0`\n*   `x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0`\n*   `5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0` (This is linearly dependent on the previous condition)\n*   `100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0` (Linearly dependent)\n*   `1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0` (Linearly dependent)\n*   `100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0`, which simplifies to `x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0`\n\nAfter removing redundancies, we have `m = 3` linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Dimension of the Kernel (dim(ker(L)))\n\nThe kernel of `L` is the space of solutions to the homogeneous problem:\n`x'(t) = Ax(t)` with homogeneous boundary conditions.\n\nSince `A` is a diagonal matrix, the system is uncoupled. The general solution for each component is:\n`x_i(t) = c_i * exp(-t/R_i)`\nwhere `c_i` are arbitrary constants.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for `k \\in \\{1, 2, 2024\\}`:\n`x_k(T) - x_k(0) = 0`\n`c_k * exp(-T/R_k) - c_k * exp(0) = 0`\n`c_k * (exp(-T/R_k) - 1) = 0`\n\nAssuming `T > 0` and `R_k` are finite and non-zero, the term `exp(-T/R_k) - 1` is non-zero. This implies that `c_k = 0` for `k = 1, 2, 2024`.\n\nFor all other components `i` (where `i` is not 1, 2, or 2024), the constants `c_i` are not constrained by any boundary condition and can be chosen freely. The number of such unconstrained components is `n - 3`.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel is the number of free parameters, which is:\n`dim(ker(L)) = n - 3 = 202000 - 3 = 201997`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Dimension of the Cokernel (dim(coker(L)))\n\nThe dimension of the cokernel is equal to the dimension of the kernel of the adjoint operator, `L*`.\n`dim(coker(L)) = dim(ker(L*))`\n\nThe adjoint problem consists of the adjoint differential equation `y'(t) = -A^T y(t)` with adjoint boundary conditions. Since `A` is diagonal, `A^T = A`.\nThe general solution for the adjoint equation is `y_i(t) = d_i * exp(t/R_i)`.\n\nThe adjoint boundary conditions are derived to make the boundary form `[x(t) \\cdot y(t)]_0^T` equal to zero for all `x(t)` satisfying the original boundary conditions. This yields the following conditions on `y(t)`:\n*   For `k \\in \\{1, 2, 2024\\}`: `y_k(T) - y_k(0) = 0`\n*   For `i \\notin \\{1, 2, 2024\\}`: `y_i(T) = 0` and `y_i(0) = 0`\n\nApplying these conditions to the general solution of the adjoint equation:\n*   For `i \\notin \\{1, 2, 2024\\}`:\n    `y_i(T) = d_i * exp(T/R_i) = 0 \\implies d_i = 0`.\n    `y_i(0) = d_i * exp(0) = 0 \\implies d_i = 0`.\n    So, `d_i = 0` for these components.\n\n*   For `k \\in \\{1, 2, 2024\\}`:\n    `d_k * exp(T/R_k) - d_k * exp(0) = 0`\n    `d_k * (exp(T/R_k) - 1) = 0`\n    This implies `d_k = 0`.\n\nSince all constants `d_i` must be zero, the only solution to the adjoint problem is the trivial solution `y(t) = 0`.\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel of the adjoint operator is zero:\n`dim(ker(L*)) = 0`.\n\n### 4. Finding the Index\n\nThe index of the problem is the difference between the dimensions of the kernel and the cokernel:\n`index(L) = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L))`\n`index(L) = 201997 - 0 = 201997`\n\n<<<201997>>>"
