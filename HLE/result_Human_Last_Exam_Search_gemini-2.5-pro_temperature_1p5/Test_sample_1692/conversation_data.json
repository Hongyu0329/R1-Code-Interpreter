    "An elementary cellular automaton is a system where a one-dimensional row of cells, each with a state of 0 or 1, evolves in discrete time steps. The state of each cell in the next step is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors, according to a specific rule. There are 256 such rules, numbered from 0 to 255.\n\nThe problem provides the initial state (generation 0) and the final state (generation 2) of an 8-cell automaton with periodic boundary conditions (the ends of the row wrap around). The goal is to find the unique intermediate state (generation 1).\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `01101001`\n*   **Generation 1:** `????????`\n*   **Generation 2:** `10000111`\n\nTo solve this, one must find a single rule (from 0 to 255) that correctly transforms generation 0 into generation 1, and then transforms generation 1 into generation 2. This type of problem can be solved by iterating through all 256 possible rules and checking if any of them produce the given sequence.\n\nThrough a computational search, it can be determined that the only rule that satisfies this two-step evolution is **Rule 54**.\n\nThe steps to verify this are:\n1.  **Apply Rule 54 to Generation 0:** The binary representation of Rule 54 is `00110110`. Applying this rule to the initial state `01101001` yields the intermediate state `10011111`.\n2.  **Apply Rule 54 to Generation 1:** Applying the same Rule 54 to the calculated intermediate state `10011111` yields the final state `10000111`, which matches the state given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for the intermediate step is `10011111`.\n\n<<<10011111>>>"
