    "Two languages from different Asian cultures with no direct contact where the words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are nearly identical are **Korean** (a Koreanic language) and **Tamil** (a Dravidian language).\n\nThe comparison of the words is as follows:\n\n*   **Mom:** In Korean, the informal word for \"mom\" is **Eomma** (엄마). In Tamil, a Dravidian language spoken in Southern India and Sri Lanka, the common word for \"mom\" is **Amma** (அம்மா). These two words are phonetically very similar.\n\n*   **Dad:** In Korean, the informal word for \"dad\" is **Appa** (아빠). This is strikingly similar to the Tamil word for \"dad,\" which is **Appa** (அப்பா).\n\n*   **Broom:** The words for \"broom\" in these two languages are not similar. In Korean, a common word for broom is **Bitjaru** (빗자루). In a dialect of Tamil, the word for broom is **Variyal**.\n\nThe Koreanic and Dravidian language families are spoken in geographically distant parts of Asia—the Korean Peninsula and Southern India/Sri Lanka, respectively. There is no evidence of significant direct contact between these two cultures that would explain borrowing these fundamental vocabulary items. The similarity in the words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" is considered by linguists to be a notable coincidence, possibly related to the ease of producing these sounds by infants (a phenomenon known as \"babble words\").\n\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
