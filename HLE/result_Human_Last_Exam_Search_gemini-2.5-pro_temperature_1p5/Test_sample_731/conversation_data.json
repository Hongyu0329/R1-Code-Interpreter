    "The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD₅₁₂, is 9.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD₅₁₂ can be described by the presentation G = <r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷>. A power subgroup Gᵏ is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. The number of distinct such subgroups is determined by the following analysis:\n\n1.  **For any odd integer k:** The power subgroup Gᵏ is the group G itself. This is because for any element g in G, its order is a power of 2. Since k is odd, k is coprime to the order of g. This implies that g is a power of gᵏ, and therefore G is a subset of Gᵏ. Since Gᵏ is a subgroup of G, it follows that Gᵏ = G. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **For any even integer k:** Let k = 2m. The power subgroup Gᵏ is G²ᵐ = (G²)ᵐ. We first determine G²:\n    *   The elements of G are of the form rⁱ or rⁱs.\n    *   (rⁱ)² = r²ⁱ. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup <r²>.\n    *   (rⁱs)² = rⁱs rⁱs = rⁱ(srs)ⁱ = rⁱ(r¹²⁷)ⁱ = r¹²⁸ⁱ. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup <r¹²⁸>.\n    *   G² is the subgroup generated by <r²> and <r¹²⁸>. Since <r¹²⁸> is a subgroup of <r²>, G² is simply <r²>.\n\n    Now, Gᵏ = G²ᵐ = (<r²>)ᵐ = <(r²)ᵐ> = <r²ᵐ>. A subgroup of this form is determined by the greatest common divisor of 2m and 256. The possible values for gcd(2m, 256) are the even divisors of 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The even divisors are:\n    *   2, giving the subgroup <r²>\n    *   4, giving the subgroup <r⁴>\n    *   8, giving the subgroup <r⁸>\n    *   16, giving the subgroup <r¹⁶>\n    *   32, giving the subgroup <r³²>\n    *   64, giving the subgroup <r⁶⁴>\n    *   128, giving the subgroup <r¹²⁸>\n    *   256, giving the subgroup <r²⁵⁶> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\n    This accounts for 8 distinct power subgroups.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups of SD₅₁₂ is {G, <r²>, <r⁴>, <r⁸>, <r¹⁶>, <r³²>, <r⁶⁴>, <r¹²⁸>, {e}}. Therefore, there are a total of 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
