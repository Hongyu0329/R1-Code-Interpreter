    "The question of which achiral and non-polar crystal classes exhibit optical activity involves a nuanced understanding of symmetry properties. While optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes, it can also occur in specific non-centrosymmetric achiral classes under certain conditions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the requirements:\n*   **Optical Activity**: This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, requires a crystal structure that is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral**: Chiral structures lack any improper rotation axes (which include mirror planes and inversion centers) and are not superimposable on their mirror images. All 11 chiral classes are non-centrosymmetric and thus optically active. Achiral structures possess at least one improper rotation axis, meaning they have mirror-image symmetry.\n*   **Optical Activity in Achiral Classes**: Ten of the non-centrosymmetric classes are achiral. In these classes, optical activity can still be observed, but not in all directions of light propagation. The presence of symmetry elements like mirror planes means there are directions in the crystal where the effect is canceled out. For instance, in a crystal of class mm2, light traveling along either of the two optical axes can be rotated, often in opposite directions.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-Polar**: Polar crystal classes possess a unique direction (a polar axis) along which a permanent electric dipole moment can exist. There are 10 such polar classes. Non-polar classes lack a unique polar axis.\n\nTo answer the user's question, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: Possesses mirror planes or other rotoinversion axes.\n2.  **Non-Polar**: Lacks a unique polar axis.\n3.  **Optically Active**: Must be non-centrosymmetric.\n\nCombining these criteria leads to a specific set of five crystal classes. The non-centrosymmetric achiral classes that are also non-polar are **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (also written as -62m), and -43m**.\n\nReviewing the answer choices provided:\n*   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are achiral but polar.\n*   B. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`: All of these classes are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   C. `3m`, `4m`, and `6mm`: These are achiral but polar.\n*   D. `-4` and `-42m`: These classes are also achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   E. `1, 2, 3, 4, and 6`: These are chiral classes.\n\nBoth choices B and D are subsets of the correct group of five crystal classes that meet all the specified conditions. Without further constraints, both are technically correct but incomplete answers. However, since a single choice must be made, and both B and D contain valid examples, the question may be flawed or relying on a specific convention not universally applied.\n\nAssuming the question and choices are valid and seek a representative group, both B and D fit the description perfectly. Given the provided options, both sets of crystal classes are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric structure to allow for optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
