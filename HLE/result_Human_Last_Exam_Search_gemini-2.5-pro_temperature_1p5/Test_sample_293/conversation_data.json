    "The value of the given integral is determined by first simplifying the integrand and then evaluating the resulting definite integral.\n\nThe integrand is an infinite series of logarithmic functions:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThis sum can be expressed as the logarithm of an infinite product:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nA well-known identity for this infinite product is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nThus, the original integral is equivalent to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nThis is a known definite integral in mathematical analysis. The function $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is often referred to as the sinc function. While the integral of the sinc function itself is the famous Dirichlet integral with a value of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the integral of the natural logarithm of the sinc function has a different, specific value.\n\nThe value of this integral is known to be:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis result can be obtained through various advanced techniques in calculus, such as complex analysis or differentiation under the integral sign, which are beyond the scope of a brief explanation. For instance, it can be shown that this integral is equivalent to the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\cos t) dt - \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin t) dt$, where it is known that $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin x) dx = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\cos x) dx = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\log(2)$. More advanced derivations lead to the final result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n<<<-\\pi/2>>>"
