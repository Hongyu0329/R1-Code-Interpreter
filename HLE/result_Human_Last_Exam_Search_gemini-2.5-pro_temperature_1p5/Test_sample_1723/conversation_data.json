    "Based on available mycological information, there is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit blue coloration in their caps or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the strikingly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* produces a pink spore print. The *Lactarius indigo*, known for its blue milk and overall blue appearance, has a cream-colored spore print. Similarly, the *Stropharia caerulea*, or blue roundhead, has a purple-black spore print. Other blue-hued mushrooms like *Cortinarius rotundisporus* and *Panaeolus cyanescens* have reddish-brown and black spore prints, respectively.\n\nSpore print colors are a crucial characteristic for mushroom identification and typically range from white and cream to shades of brown, pink, purple, and black. Green is a known, albeit uncommon, spore print color, but blue is not documented as a naturally occurring spore color in any mushroom genus.\n\nTherefore, the premise that a single genus of mushroom is known to produce a distinctly blue spore print appears to be incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
