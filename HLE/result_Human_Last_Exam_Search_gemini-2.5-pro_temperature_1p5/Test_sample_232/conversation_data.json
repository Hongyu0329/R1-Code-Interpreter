    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square piece of paper into a complex pattern of geometric shapes. A careful count of these individual, enclosed regions reveals that there are a total of 64 distinct areas.\n\nThe crease pattern of a traditional crane can be broken down for easier counting:\n\n*   The central part of the paper forms what is known as the \"bird base\" or \"preliminary base\" which is then shaped with \"petal folds\". When flattened, this central diamond shape is composed of 16 small triangular regions.\n*   The four corners of the original square paper each contain an identical pattern of creases. Each of these four corner sections is divided into 12 smaller regions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of regions is the sum of the regions in the central base and the regions in the four corners: 16 (from the central base) + 4 * 12 (from the corners) = 16 + 48 = 64 regions.\n\n<<<64>>>"
