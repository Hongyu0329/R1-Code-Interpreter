The premise of the question contains a mathematical inconsistency. The provided polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous with respect to the given weights, which is a necessary condition for it to define a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in the specified weighted projective space. Therefore, the Crawley-Nordstr√∂m invariant cannot be determined.
