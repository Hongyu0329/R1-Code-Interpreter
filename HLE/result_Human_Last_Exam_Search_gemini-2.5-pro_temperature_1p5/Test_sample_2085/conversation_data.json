    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is not a direct translation but can be understood through the etymology of its components and its historical context. The name is composed of two parts: \"Odo-\" and \"-beccus.\"\n\nThe element \"-beccus\" is of Gaulish origin, meaning \"beak.\" This word was adopted into Late Latin as *beccus* and subsequently evolved into the modern French word \"bec,\" which also means \"beak.\"\n\nThe prefix \"Odo-\" is generally considered to be of Germanic origin, deriving from a root meaning \"wealth\" or \"property.\" This prefix was common in many Germanic names and was assimilated into the languages of the regions where Germanic tribes settled, including Gaul. In French, \"Odo\" evolved into the name \"Eudes.\" For instance, the historical figure Odo of Aquitaine is known as Eudes in French.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" itself belonged to a historical figure, a general of the early 5th-century usurper Constantine III in Gaul. His name is recorded in historical sources with various spellings, including \"Edobicus,\" \"Edovicus,\" and \"Odobeccus.\"\n\nWhile a definitive, standardized French equivalent for \"Odobeccus\" from the historical period does not exist, we can construct a plausible equivalent based on the linguistic evolution of its parts. Combining the French evolution of \"Odo\" (\"Eudes\") and \"beccus\" (\"bec\"), a constructed French equivalent could be *\"Eudes-Bec\"* or a similar formation.\n\nA claim found in one online source suggests the equivalent is \"Sent-du-Bec,\" with the meaning \"bad breath.\" However, this assertion is not supported by scholarly linguistic or historical sources and appears to be an isolated and likely inaccurate interpretation. The etymology of \"Odo-\" as \"wealth\" and \"-beccus\" as \"beak\" is well-documented in linguistic studies of Gaulish and Germanic names.\n\nTherefore, while there is no single established French translation of \"Odobeccus,\" the most linguistically and historically sound interpretation points to a name combining the Germanic element \"Odo\" (which becomes \"Eudes\" in French) and the Gaulish element \"beccus\" (which becomes \"bec\").\n\n<<<Eudes-Bec>>>"
