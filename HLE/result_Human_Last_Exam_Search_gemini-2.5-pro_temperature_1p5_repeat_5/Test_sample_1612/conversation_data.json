    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a hitter earns the Triple Crown by leading their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nHistorically, there have been 23 players who have won the batting Triple Crown. These 23 players have accomplished this feat a total of 28 times, as some players have won it on multiple occasions. The most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nIt is important to note that in 2020, MLB officially incorporated statistics from seven Negro Leagues that operated between 1920 and 1948. This resulted in the addition of eight players to the list of Major League Triple Crown winners.\n\nFour players have the distinction of winning the Triple Crown more than once. Oscar Charleston won it a record three times, while Rogers Hornsby, Josh Gibson, and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n\n<<<23>>>"
