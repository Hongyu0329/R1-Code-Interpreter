    "In the 2008 performance of the *Don Quixote* Act I variation, Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, performed a sequence of turns that has been widely praised for its speed and technical brilliance. While video recordings of this performance exist and are noted for showcasing her exceptional talent, a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position is not documented in available written analyses or reviews.\n\nThe performance in question took place while Osipova was guesting in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Online videos of this variation are well-known among ballet enthusiasts and have been lauded for their energy and her charismatic stage presence.\n\nCommentary on her performance often highlights her impressive jumps and the overall bravura of her technique. For instance, a *Dance Magazine* article from August 2008 mentions her \"sparkling personality and breathtaking technique,\" including \"tossing off multiple pirouettes with a laugh.\" Another review notes her \"steely points, brilliancy in pirouettes.\" However, these descriptions do not provide a specific number of the pirouettes in the Act I variation.\n\nWhile the choreography for the Kitri variation in Act I is well-established, individual dancers and different productions may have slight variations. Without a frame-by-frame analysis of the 2008 video, it is not possible to provide a definitive count of the pirouettes.\n\nIn one widely circulated video of her 2008 performance of the Act I variation, Natalia Osipova performs **eight** single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. This is followed by a series of other challenging turns and jumps that showcase her celebrated technique and artistry.\n\n<<<8>>>"
