    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers will recognize as referring to Romulus and Remus is **a thrall (a slave or serf) of the House of the Gael**.\n\nThis unnamed thrall, who had been captured and enslaved by the Romans, recounts his experiences in Chapter VI, \"They Talk on the Way to the Folk-thing\". During a conversation with other warriors on their way to the Folk-mote, he describes the customs of the Romans. When asked about their gods, he says:\n\n> \"For I have heard it said that they have a God whom they call the Wolf-fostered, and him they worship and praise and make songs about; and his image, and the image of the she-wolf his foster-mother, is the holiest of their banners, the very heart of their battle-array.\"\n\nThis passage is a clear allusion to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus, the twin brothers who were said to have been abandoned and then suckled by a she-wolf. The terms \"Wolf-fostered\" and \"she-wolf his foster-mother\" directly point to this well-known legend.\n\n<<<A thrall of the House of the Gael.>>>"
