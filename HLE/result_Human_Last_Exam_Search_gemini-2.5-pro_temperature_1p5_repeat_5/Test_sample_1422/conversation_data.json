    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the interaction is typically represented by vertices where multiple field lines meet. For the common $\\phi^4$ theory, the fundamental interaction vertex connects four field lines. A loop in a Feynman diagram is a closed path of internal lines (propagators). The number of independent loops (L) in a connected diagram is given by the formula L = I - V + 1, where I is the number of internal lines and V is the number of vertices.\n\nTo find the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram, we can consider the simplest possible configurations:\n\n*   **One Vertex:** In a $\\phi^4$ theory, a single vertex has four lines. To form loops, these lines must be connected to each other as internal lines. We can connect two of the lines to form one loop, and the other two lines to form a second loop. This creates a \"figure-eight\" or \"double-tadpole\" diagram. This is a vacuum diagram (it has no external lines). In this case, we have V = 1 (one vertex) and I = 2 (two internal lines). According to the formula, L = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, a two-loop diagram with just one vertex is possible.\n\n*   **Two Vertices:** It is also possible to construct a two-loop diagram with two vertices. A well-known example is the \"sunset\" diagram, which is a contribution to the two-point function (propagator correction). This diagram consists of two vertices connected by three internal propagators. Here, V = 2 and I = 3. The loop number is L = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. Each of the $\\phi^4$ vertices uses three of its lines for the internal connections, leaving one external line at each end of the diagram.\n\nSince a valid two-loop diagram can be constructed with a single vertex, this represents the minimum number required.\n\n<<<1>>>"
