    "The Gauss class number problem, in essence, seeks to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number. The class number indicates the size of the ideal class group of a quadratic field, and determining the number of fields for a specific class number is a significant question in number theory. For any given class number, it has been proven that there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with that class number.\n\nIn the context of this problem, a fundamental discriminant is a key concept. These are the basic building blocks for all other discriminants. The question asks for the number of these fundamental discriminants that are negative and correspond to an imaginary quadratic field with a class number of 48.\n\nAccording to a table compiled by Mark Watkins of the University of Sydney's computational algebra group, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 2419.\n\n<<<2419>>>"
