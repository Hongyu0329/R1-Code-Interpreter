Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still undergo the physical process of tunneling, but the observable consequences, specifically the splitting of energy levels, would be absent. This is because the exotic spin-0 hydrogen nuclei are bosons, which require the total molecular wavefunction to be symmetric with respect to their exchange. The tunneling motion produces both a spatially symmetric and a spatially antisymmetric state. Since the nuclear spin part of the wavefunction for spin-0 nuclei is symmetric, only the spatially symmetric state is allowed to exist to maintain the overall symmetric nature of the total wavefunction. The spatially antisymmetric state would be forbidden. Without both states of the tunneling doublet being present, there is no observable energy splitting, which is the hallmark of ammonia tunneling in spectroscopy. Therefore, while the physical potential for tunneling exists, its characteristic spectral manifestation would not be observed.
