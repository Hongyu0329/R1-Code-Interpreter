    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ has two double points. This is determined by analyzing the 2-adic properties of the curve's branch points.\n\nThe given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The stable reduction of such a curve over the 2-adic numbers can be understood by examining the 2-adic valuations of the differences between the roots (the branch points) of the polynomial on the right-hand side. The structure of the stable reduction, including the number of components and the number of nodes (double points), is determined by the way these branch points cluster together at different 2-adic distances.\n\nThe branch points of the curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This polynomial has one root at $x=0$. The other four roots have 2-adic valuations that can be calculated using Newton polygons. The analysis shows that there is one root, let's call it $\\alpha_1$, with a 2-adic valuation of 3, and three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each with a 2-adic valuation of -1. The point at infinity is also a branch point.\n\nThe set of six branch points can be partitioned into two sets based on their 2-adic distances:\n*   A set $S_1 = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$.\n*   A set $S_2 = \\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction for hyperelliptic curves, the stable model in this situation consists of two components connected to each other. The genus of each component is determined by the number of branch points it is associated with.\n*   The component associated with $S_1$ (which has 2 points) has genus $g_1 = (|S_1| - 2)/2 = (2-2)/2 = 0$.\n*   The component associated with $S_2$ (which has 4 points) has genus $g_2 = (|S_2| - 2)/2 = (4-2)/2 = 1$.\n\nFor a genus 2 curve, the number of nodes ($N$) in the stable reduction is related to the genera of its components by the formula $N = 3 - (g_1 + g_2)$. In this case, we have:\n$N = 3 - (0 + 1) = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has two double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
