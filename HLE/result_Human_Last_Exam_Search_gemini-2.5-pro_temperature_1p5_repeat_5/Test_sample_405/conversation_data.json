    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and blue. However, variations and other described shades expand this palette.\n\nThe primary allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, it is a translucent, waxy solid that is white or colorless. Upon exposure to light or due to impurities, it typically appears yellowish, which has led to it also being called yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is known for its characteristic red color. However, its appearance can range from orange-red to a deep red or even a dark red-purple.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the most thermodynamically stable form, black phosphorus has an appearance similar to graphite. It is described as being black and flaky, and can also appear grey with a metallic luster.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is typically described as violet or red-purple. It has also been observed as brown transparent plates and can have a steely blue lustre. When ground into a very fine powder, it can appear red.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized allotrope that exists as a single layer. As its name suggests, it is blue in color.\n\nIn addition to these solid allotropes, phosphorus can exist as a gas called diphosphorus (Pâ‚‚) under extreme temperatures.\n\nTherefore, while there are five primary and distinct colors associated with phosphorus allotropes (white, red, black, violet, and blue), observing their variations like yellow, colorless, grey, brown, and steely blue is also possible.\n\n<<<5>>>"
