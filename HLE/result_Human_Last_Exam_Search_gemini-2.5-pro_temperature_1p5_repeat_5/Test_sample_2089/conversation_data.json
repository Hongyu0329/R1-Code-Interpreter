    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a very specific query that does not correspond to a well-known scene in a major film. It is possible that the user is misremembering certain details of the movie in question.\n\nThere are, however, Oscar-nominated films with pivotal scenes taking place on buses or other forms of public transport that significantly impact a character's destiny. For instance, in the film *Incendies* (2010), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, a harrowing and transformative scene occurs on a bus. Similarly, *Fruitvale Station* (2013), though not Oscar-nominated, received critical acclaim for its portrayal of the final day in the life of Oscar Grant, culminating in a fateful event at a transit station.\n\nWithout a more precise recollection of the film's plot, director, or actors, it is difficult to definitively identify the movie the user has in mind. The detail of the character saying \"Thank you\" is not a widely recognized cinematic moment tied to an Oscar-nominated film.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question.>>>"
