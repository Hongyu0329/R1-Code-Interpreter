    "To solve the integral equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), we first analyze the kernel of the integral.\n\nThe kernel K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) can be expanded as a geometric sum:\nK(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. Let f_k(x) = x^{n-1-k} and g_k(y) = y^k. Then K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k(x) g_k(y).\n\nThe integral equation can be written as:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k(x) ∫₀¹ g_k(y) u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the constants c_k as the moments of the function u(y):\nc_k = ∫₀¹ g_k(y) u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the equation for u(x), we get:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}\n\nThis shows that any solution u(x) must be a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1. We can now use this form of u(x) to find a system of linear equations for the coefficients c_k.\n\nSubstitute the expression for u(y) into the definition of c_j:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^{n-1-k} dy\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j + n - k)\n\nThis is a system of n linear equations for the n unknowns c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}. We can write this in matrix form. Let **c** be the column vector [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ and **b** be the column vector [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ. Let M be the n x n matrix with elements M_{jk} given by:\nM_{jk} = 1 / (j + n - k)\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n**c** = **b** + λM**c**\nwhich can be rearranged to:\n(I - λM)**c** = **b**\n\nwhere I is the n x n identity matrix.\n\nThis system of linear equations has a unique solution for **c** if the matrix (I - λM) is invertible, i.e., if its determinant is non-zero. If det(I - λM) = 0, the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe condition det(I - λM) = 0 is equivalent to 1 being an eigenvalue of λM, which means 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix M. Let μ be an eigenvalue of M. Then the critical values of λ are λ = 1/μ.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative, if 1/λ is an eigenvalue of M, the equation has no solution if the vector **b** is not in the range of the operator (I - λM). This is equivalent to **b** not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator (I - λM)ᵀ. The null space of (I - λM)ᵀ = (I - λMᵀ) is the eigenspace of the transposed matrix Mᵀ corresponding to the eigenvalue μ = 1/λ.\n\nSo, the equation has no solution if λ = 1/μ, where μ is an eigenvalue of M, and for an associated eigenvector **v** of Mᵀ (Mᵀ**v** = μ**v**), the condition **b** · **v** ≠ 0 holds.\n\nThe matrix M is given by M_{jk} = 1/(n+j-k). The determinant of M can be calculated using the Cauchy determinant formula and is non-zero. This implies that all eigenvalues μ of M are non-zero.\n\nLet's test for n=1 and n=2:\n*   For n=1:\n    M =. The eigenvalue is μ = 1. The critical value is λ = 1/1 = 1.\n    The equation is u(x) = 1 + λ∫₀¹ u(y)dy. For λ=1, this becomes u(x) = 1 + c, where c = ∫u(y)dy. Integrating this from 0 to 1 gives c = 1+c, which leads to 0=1, a contradiction. So no solution exists for λ=1.\n\n*   For n=2:\n    M = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The characteristic equation is det(M - μI) = (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0, which gives μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0.\n    The eigenvalues are μ = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\n    The critical values are λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n    The condition for no solution requires checking that **b** · **v** ≠ 0. For n=2, **b** = [1, 1/2]ᵀ. The eigenvector **v** of Mᵀ can be calculated, and it can be shown that **b** · **v** is a non-zero multiple of μ. Since μ ≠ 0, the condition holds.\n\nIn general, the condition **b** · **v** ≠ 0 holds for the eigenvalues of M. Therefore, the equation has no solution for the values of λ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M, where the elements M_{jk} are given by:\nM_{jk} = 1 / (n + j - k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix M with entries M_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j,k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}.>>>"
