    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is associated with a deep sense of loss and longing for the natural world of Earth, including the sound of rustling leaves.\n\nThe film opens with an extended sequence at Kris's father's country house, where Kris is shown deeply immersed in the terrestrial environment, observing the water, plants, and rain. This establishes his profound connection to Earth before his journey to the space station orbiting the planet Solaris. While the exact line of dialogue expressing \"shame\" for missing the rustling of leaves is not explicitly stated in available transcripts, the thematic core of the film supports that Kris is the character who would feel this sentiment most acutely. His nostalgia for Earth is a central element of his character arc. The other scientists, Snaut and Sartorius, are depicted as being more cynical and detached, having been on the station for a longer period. Hari is a \"visitor,\" a manifestation of Kris's memories, and Gibarian is deceased upon Kris's arrival. Therefore, Kris Kelvin is the character who embodies this poignant yearning for the simple, natural beauties of his home planet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
