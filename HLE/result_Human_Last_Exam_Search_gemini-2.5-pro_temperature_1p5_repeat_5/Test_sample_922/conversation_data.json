    "The integer that completes the sequence is 431306.\n\nThis sequence consists of the known values of *k* for which the number of the form (80 * 10^*k* - 53) / 9 is prime. These are the indices *k* such that 80*R*<sub>*k*</sub> + 3 is prime, where R*<sub>*k*</sub> is a repunit with *k* digits. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A056694.\n\nThe known terms of this sequence, in order, are: 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 50, 70, 76, 223, 295, 314, 2089, 2905, 3394, 3881, 5113, 6055, 7253, 7994, 18172, 18970, 24663, 35005, 69673, and as of developments prior to August 2022, the list of known terms included the numbers provided in the question.\n\nThe single integer that was known to complete this sequence as of August 2022, following the provided numbers, was a new discovery. The sequence in the prompt is a subset of the known terms of A056694. A search of resources related to this sequence indicates the discovery of new terms.\n\nWhile the prompt implies a single value completes the sequence from the provided list, the full known sequence A056694 contains more terms. The numbers in the prompt are indeed a subsequence of A056694. Based on the likely intended puzzle, the next term in the full sequence after the ones provided is the answer.\n\n<<<431306>>>"
