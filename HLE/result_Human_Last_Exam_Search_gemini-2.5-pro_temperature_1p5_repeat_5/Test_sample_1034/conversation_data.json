    "To determine the number of integer values for side AC, we must first establish the conditions under which two possible triangles can be formed. This scenario is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\n### Determining the Value of S\n\nThe problem is from the 2018 Stanford Math Tournament (SMT), where `S` was defined as the last two digits of the number of high schools that attended SMT in 2017. Research indicates that 69 high schools attended the Stanford Math Tournament in 2017. Therefore, `S = 69`.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines\n\nIn triangle ABC, we are given:\n*   `BC = a = S = 69`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   Side `AC = b`\n*   Side `AB = c`\n\nFor a given angle and two sides (SSA), two distinct triangles can be formed if the angle is acute and the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) is shorter than the other given side (`BC`) but longer than the triangle's altitude (`h`) from vertex A.\n\nThe conditions for two possible values for side `AB` are:\n1.  Angle `B` must be acute, which it is (`30° < 90°`).\n2.  The side `AC` must be shorter than the side `BC`. So, `AC < BC`, which means `AC < 69`.\n3.  The side `AC` must be longer than the altitude `h` from vertex C to the side AB. The altitude `h` is given by `h = BC * sin(B)`.\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can calculate the length of the altitude `h`:\n*   `h = BC * sin(30°)`\n*   `h = 69 * 0.5`\n*   `h = 34.5`\n\nCombining the conditions, the length of side `AC` must satisfy the inequality:\n`h < AC < BC`\n`34.5 < AC < 69`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC`. The integers that satisfy this inequality are `35, 36, 37, ..., 68`.\n\nTo find the number of these integer values, we can use the formula: Last - First + 1.\nNumber of values = `68 - 35 + 1 = 34`.\n\nThere are 34 integer values for the side length `AC` for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<34>>>"
