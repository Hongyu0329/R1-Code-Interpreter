    "After gene duplication, the two resulting gene copies are initially redundant. For both copies to be retained in the genome over evolutionary time, they must both offer a selective advantage. Without this, one copy is likely to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, which is the most common fate. Several mechanisms can lead to the retention and divergence of these duplicate genes.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences. Instead of promoting divergence, gene conversion tends to homogenize the sequences of duplicated genes, making them more alike. This can work against the retention of two distinct genes with different functions.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a gene becomes non-functional. It is the most frequent outcome for a duplicated gene but represents a loss of one copy, not the retention of both functional duplicates.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one of the gene copies mutates to acquire a completely new function that is beneficial to the organism, while the other copy continues to perform the original ancestral function. Because both the old and new functions are useful, both genes are preserved by natural selection. This is a recognized mechanism for duplicate gene retention but relies on the relatively rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation creating a new function.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism involves the partitioning of the ancestral gene's original functions between the two duplicate copies. If the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages), each duplicate copy can accumulate mutations that disable different sub-functions. Consequently, both genes become necessary to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This \"division of labor\" ensures that both copies are maintained. Subfunctionalization is considered a highly plausible and common mechanism because it can occur through neutral or slightly deleterious mutations, which are more frequent than the beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary process where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. This concept applies to the evolution of species, not the retention of duplicate genes within a genome.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid and important mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the subfunctionalization model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) provides a pathway for the preservation of duplicates through more common, neutral mutational events. This makes it a very likely and frequently cited explanation for the widespread retention of duplicated genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
