    "Answering this competitive programming problem requires comparing two strings lexicographically while ignoring case. To achieve the highest memory efficiency in C, we should avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible.\n\nThe core idea of the memory-efficient approach is:\n1.  Read the first string into a buffer. This is unavoidable as we need to access its characters to compare against the second string, and the second string can only be read from standard input after the first one.\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time, immediately comparing it with the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n3.  This avoids allocating a second buffer for the second string, significantly saving memory.\n\nTo further optimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible data types for our variables.\n*   The buffer for the first string must be `char str1[101];` to accommodate a string of up to 100 characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`). This consumes **101 bytes**.\n*   To iterate through the first string, we need an index variable. Since the length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is sufficient. This consumes **1 byte**.\n*   To store the character being read from the second string, a simple `char` is sufficient. This consumes **1 byte**.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nHere is the C program implementing this logic. It's designed to be correct, conforming to the problem statement, while using the minimum amount of memory for its variables.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program solves the lexicographical string comparison problem\n * with a focus on memory efficiency.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer to store the first string. 100 chars + 1 null terminator.\n    // Memory: 101 bytes.\n    char str1[101];\n\n    // An index for iterating over str1. Since length is <= 100, an\n    // unsigned char (0-255) is sufficient and memory-efficient.\n    // Memory: 1 byte.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to hold the character being read from the second string.\n    // Memory: 1 byte.\n    char char2;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", str1);\n\n    // Iterate through the first string (which is now in the buffer).\n    while (str1[i]) {\n        // Read one character from the second string. The \" %c\" format specifier\n        // cleverly skips any whitespace (including the newline after the\n        // first string) before reading the character.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &char2);\n\n        // Perform the case-insensitive comparison.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)str1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)char2)) {\n            puts(\"-1\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)str1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)char2)) {\n            puts(\"1\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n    puts(\"0\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe problem asks for `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this program. We calculate this by summing the sizes of the variables declared in the `main` function:\n\n1.  `char str1[101];`: 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n2.  `unsigned char i;`: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  `char char2;`: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
