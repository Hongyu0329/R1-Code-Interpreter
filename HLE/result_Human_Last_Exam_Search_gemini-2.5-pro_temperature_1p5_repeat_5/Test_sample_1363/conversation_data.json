    "In the European Tango, it is technically impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally disregarding the established technique.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Tango's Core Technique:** The European Tango is characterized by its sharp, staccato movements, and a strong, stable frame. Turns are executed with a distinct rotational action in the body, but without the continuous, flowing sway seen in the waltz dances. There is no rise and fall, and the knees remain flexed.\n\n*   **The Reverse Turn in Tango:** The Reverse Turn in Tango involves a specific sequence of steps and body rotations to execute a left turn. The lead for the turn comes from the leader's body rotation, and the follower's ability to follow this lead is paramount. The technique guides have specific instructions for foot placement and alignment throughout the figure.\n\n*   **The Consequence of Overturning:** Attempting to overturn a standard Tango Reverse Turn would disrupt the core principles of the dance. One source explicitly states that overturning the second step of a reverse turn would lead to a completely different figure known as a \"Fallaway,\" which is considered an error if not intended. This highlights that the defined technique of the Reverse Turn does not accommodate overturning; doing so creates a different, and likely unintended, outcome. The precision of movement and connection in Tango means that any deviation from the prescribed amount of turn would break the connection and the technical integrity of the figure.\n\nIn the other dances listed:\n\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** While extremely difficult and generally avoided in corners, the concept of overturning a reverse turn exists, even if it's considered poor practice. Dancers are taught that a natural turn is the correct technical choice for corners because the reverse turn is so challenging to overturn.\n*   **English Waltz and Slow Foxtrot:** These dances utilize sway and continuous movement, which allows for more flexibility in the amount of turn. Underturning is a common technique, and while overturning isn't standard, the nature of the dances doesn't make it a technical impossibility in the same way as Tango.\n*   **Quickstep:** Overturning is sometimes used as a specific variation in figures like the Progressive Chass√© to link to other steps, indicating that overturning is a recognized, albeit specific, technical possibility within the dance.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango stands out as the dance where the technique of the reverse turn is so precisely defined that overturning it is not a variation or a matter of difficulty, but a direct contradiction of the dance's technical principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
