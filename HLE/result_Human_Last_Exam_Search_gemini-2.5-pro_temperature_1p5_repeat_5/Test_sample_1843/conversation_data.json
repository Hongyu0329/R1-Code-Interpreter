    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factor the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime power factor of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We require this order to be 6:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Count primitive characters for each prime power factor\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor of $N$ whose orders divide 6. Let $n(p^a, d)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Conductor $4 = 2^2$**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is of order $\\phi(4) = 2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a possible component.\n    *   $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $9 = 3^2$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The primitive characters modulo 9 are those that are not induced by characters modulo 3. The group of characters mod 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$. So, there are $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$ primitive characters. Their orders must be divisors of 6 that do not divide 2, i.e., orders 3 and 6.\n    *   $n(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Conductor $7$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6 other than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. All these divide 6.\n    *   $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $11$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The orders of primitive characters must divide 10. For the lcm to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6. Thus, the order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. Since it's a primitive character, its order must be greater than 1, so the only possible order is 2.\n    *   $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $13$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the counts\nLet's assemble the number of choices for each primitive component whose order divides 6:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (of order 2)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (of orders 3 or 6)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (of orders 2, 3, or 6)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (of order 2)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (of orders 2, 3, or 6)\n\nThe total number of combinations of these characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n$C = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThis is the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides 6. Now, we must ensure the lcm of the orders is exactly 6. For this, the set of prime factors of the orders must contain both 2 and 3.\n\nLet $L = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n1.  **Divisibility by 2**: The character $\\chi_4$ must be chosen, and its order is 2. Therefore, $L$ is always divisible by 2 for any valid combination.\n2.  **Divisibility by 3**: For $L$ to be divisible by 3, at least one of the component orders must be divisible by 3. Let's count the number of combinations where this is *not* the case, i.e., where all component orders are not divisible by 3. The only possible order that divides 6 and is not divisible by 3 is 2.\n    *   $\\chi_4$: must have order 2. Number of choices = 1.\n    *   $\\chi_9$: primitive orders are 3 and 6. Both are divisible by 3. Number of choices with order not divisible by 3 = 0.\n    *   $\\chi_7$: primitive orders are 2, 3, 6. The number of choices with order 2 is 1.\n    *   $\\chi_{11}$: must have order 2. Number of choices = 1.\n    *   $\\chi_{13}$: primitive orders are 2, 3, 6. The number of choices with order 2 is 1.\n\nThe number of combinations where no component order is divisible by 3 is:\n$1 \\times 0 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0$.\n\nThis means that in all 100 combinations of characters we found, the lcm of the orders is divisible by 3. Since the lcm is also always divisible by 2, the lcm is always divisible by 6. As we have already restricted the orders to be divisors of 6, the lcm must be exactly 6 for all 100 combinations.\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
