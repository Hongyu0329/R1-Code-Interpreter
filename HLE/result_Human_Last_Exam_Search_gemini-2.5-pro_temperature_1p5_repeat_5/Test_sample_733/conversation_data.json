    "A finite group can possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any elements `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (also known as a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not properly contained within any larger product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe classification of finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 was accomplished by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their findings reveal that there is a finite and specific list of such groups.\n\nBased on their classification, there are 17 such finite groups:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C₃ (Cyclic group of order 3)\n    *   C₄ (Cyclic group of order 4)\n    *   C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₈ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₁₀ (Cyclic group of order 10)\n\n*   **Dihedral Groups:**\n    *   D₆ (Dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n    *   D₈ (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 10)\n    *   D₁₂ (Dihedral group of order 12)\n\n*   **Quaternion Groups:**\n    *   Q₈ (Quaternion group of order 8)\n    *   Q₁₂ (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n\n*   **Direct Products of Cyclic Groups (Elementary Abelian Groups and others):**\n    *   C₂ × C₂ (Klein-four group)\n    *   C₂ × C₂ × C₂ (Elementary abelian group of order 8)\n    *   C₄ × C₂ (Direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\n    *   C₆ × C₂ (Direct product of cyclic groups of order 6 and 2)\n    *   D₆ × C₂ (Direct product of the dihedral group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 2)\n\nThis comprehensive list of 17 distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups is derived from the work of Giudici and Hart, who categorized these groups based on the structure of the subgroup generated by the product-free set.\n\n<<<17>>>"
