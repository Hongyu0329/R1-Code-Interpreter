    "The value of the infinite product is given by the expression:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nwhere $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a complex cube root of unity and $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\n\nThis result is derived from the infinite product representation of the Gamma function. A known identity is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nThis formula provides the product starting from n=1. To find the product from n=3, we must divide by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n\nThe term for n=1 is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right) = 1-z^3$.\nThe term for n=2 is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) = 1-\\frac{z^3}{8}$.\n\nDividing the infinite product from n=1 by these two terms gives the desired result. The Gamma function, denoted by $\\Gamma(z)$, is a generalization of the factorial function to complex numbers.\n\n<<<$$ \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$>>>"
