    "An upper bound for the norm of an ideal in a number field is given by Minkowski's bound. While the notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is not standard, it likely refers to this bound or a related concept in the context of the geometry of numbers.\n\nIn algebraic number theory, for a number field $K$ of degree $n$ with discriminant $d_K$, every ideal class contains an integral ideal $I$ whose norm $N(I)$ is bounded above. The covolume $(V)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ viewed as a lattice in the Minkowski space is given by $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$.\n\nWhen considering squarefree natural numbers $N$, a common context is the study of quadratic number fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree integer.\n\nThe upper bound for the norm of an ideal is given by the Minkowski constant $M_K$:\n$N(I) \\leq M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$\n\nHere:\n*   $n$ is the degree of the number field.\n*   $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings.\n*   $d_K$ is the discriminant of the number field $K$.\n*   $N(I)$ is the norm of the ideal $I$.\n\nRelating this to the terms in the query for a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ (where $n=2$):\n*   **For a real quadratic field ($N > 0$):** We have $r_2=0$. The covolume is $V = \\sqrt{d_K}$. The bound is:\n    $N(I) \\leq \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{d_K} = \\frac{1}{2}V$\n\n*   **For an imaginary quadratic field ($N < 0$):** We have $r_2=1$. The covolume is $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$. The bound is:\n    $N(I) \\leq \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^1 \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}V$\n\nThus, the upper bound for the norm of an ideal, which may be what is represented by $(k_{k,\\infty})$, in relation to the covolume $(V)$ depends on whether the field is real or imaginary.\n\n<<<The upper bound is $(\\frac{4}{\\pi})^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} V$, where $n$ is the degree of the number field, $r_2$ is the number of complex places, and $V$ is the covolume.>>>"
