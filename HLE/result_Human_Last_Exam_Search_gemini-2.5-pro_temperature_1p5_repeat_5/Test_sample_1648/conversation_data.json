    "To determine the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`th K-group of `Z/27` is nonzero, we must analyze the structure of the algebraic K-groups `K_{2n}(Z/27Z)`.\n\nThe key results from algebraic K-theory needed to solve this problem are:\n1.  **Gabber's Rigidity Theorem**: For a henselian pair of rings `(A, I)`, where `I` is an ideal, the relative K-theory groups `K_m(A, I)` with `l`-adic coefficients are trivial for any prime `l` invertible in `A`. A consequence is that for `A = Z/p^k` and `I = (p)`, the relative K-groups `K_m(Z/p^k, (p))` are `p`-groups (i.e., every element has an order that is a power of `p`).\n2.  **Quillen's computation for finite fields**: For a finite field `F_q`, the even K-groups are `K_{2n}(F_q) = 0` for all `n >= 1`.\n3.  **Geisser-Hesselholt Theorem**: The `p`-adic K-theory of a finite algebra `A` over the Witt vectors of a perfect field of characteristic `p` is isomorphic to its topological cyclic homology (`TC`). For `A = Z/p^k`, this implies that the `p`-primary part of `K_m(Z/p^k)` is isomorphic to `TC_m(Z/p^k; p)`.\n4.  **Hesselholt-Madsen computation of TC**: For an odd prime `p`, the even-degree topological cyclic homology groups `TC_{2n}(Z/p^k; p)` are zero for all `n >= 1`.\n\nHere, the ring is `R = Z/27Z`, so we have `p=3` (an odd prime) and `k=3`. We want to find the largest natural number `n` for which `K_{2n}(Z/27) != 0`.\n\nLet's construct the argument step-by-step for any odd prime `p` and `n >= 1`:\n*   Consider the long exact sequence in K-theory associated with the ideal `I = (p)` in `A = Z/p^k`:\n    `... -> K_{2n}(A, I) -> K_{2n}(A) -> K_{2n}(A/I) -> ...`\n*   The quotient ring is `A/I = (Z/p^k)/(p) = Z/pZ = F_p`. From Quillen's computation, `K_{2n}(F_p) = 0` for `n >= 1`.\n*   The long exact sequence thus implies that for `n >= 1`, the map from the relative group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k, (p))` to `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is surjective.\n*   By Gabber's theorem, `K_{2n}(Z/p^k, (p))` is a `p`-group. Since `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is a quotient of a `p`-group, it must also be a `p`-group.\n*   Now, we examine the `p`-primary part of `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)`. The Geisser-Hesselholt theorem states that the `p`-adic K-theory is isomorphic to topological cyclic homology. For finite groups, this means the `p`-primary component of `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is isomorphic to `TC_{2n}(Z/p^k; p)`.\n*   The Hesselholt-Madsen computation shows that for an odd prime `p` (in our case `p=3`), `TC_{2n}(Z/p^k; p) = 0` for all `n >= 1`.\n*   Therefore, the `p`-primary part of `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is zero.\n\nCombining these facts, we have shown that for `n >= 1`, `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is a 3-group, and also that its 3-primary part is zero. The only group with this property is the trivial group, `{0}`.\n\nThus, `K_{2n}(Z/27) = 0` for all `n >= 1`.\n\nThe only remaining even K-group to check is `K_0(Z/27)`. The group `K_0(R)` for a local ring `R` is isomorphic to the group of integers, `Z`. Since `Z/27` is a local ring, `K_0(Z/27) = Z`, which is non-zero.\n\nThis corresponds to the case `n=0`. If \"natural number\" is taken to include 0, then the set of natural numbers `n` for which the `(2n)`th K-group is nonzero is `{0}`. The largest (and only) element of this set is 0. If \"natural number\" means a positive integer, then no such `n` exists. In standard mathematical contexts where such a question would be posed, 0 is typically included as a natural number.\n\n"
