    "The Hollywood feature film that most closely matches the description is **Napoleon Dynamite**, produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and MTV Films. However, there is a discrepancy in the color of the bicycle.\n\nIn the 2004 cult classic, the titular teenager, Napoleon Dynamite, is frequently seen riding a bicycle. There are notable scenes where he performs a bike jump and another where his uncle throws a steak at him while he is riding. While the film prominently features a bicycle, a definitive pink color is not accurate.\n\nThe bicycle that Napoleon often rides belongs to his friend, Pedro. Descriptions of this bike's color vary. One source identifies it as a \"bright red XJD model.\" A movie script describes it as a \"black mountain bike with orange handlebars.\" A trivia quiz about the film asks for the color of Pedro's bike, with the correct answer being \"Orange/black\" and \"Pink\" listed as an incorrect choice.\n\nThe confusion about the color pink might stem from the character of Deb, who wears a homemade pink shirt with fake rubies glued to it and also dons a pink dress with large, puffy sleeves to the school dance. It is possible that the memory of Deb's pink attire has been conflated with the bicycle.\n\nWhile there are other films that feature characters on bicycles, and even a Reddit thread mentioning a movie with a man on a pink bike, there is no major Hollywood feature film that precisely depicts a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, it is highly likely that the user is thinking of *Napoleon Dynamite* but is misremembering the color of the bicycle.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
