    "The ground state degeneracy of a topological code is determined by the number of logical qubits it can encode. The relationship is `Degeneracy = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits is in turn determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\nThe key aspects of the topology are the genus (`g`), the number of \"smooth\" boundaries (or holes), and the number of \"rough\" boundaries (or holes).\n\n1.  **Genus:** For a closed surface (without any boundaries or holes) of genus `g` (which corresponds to a surface with `g` handles, like a `g`-holed torus), the toric code encodes `2g` logical qubits, leading to a degeneracy of `2^(2g)`. For a simple torus, `g=1`, which gives `2^2 = 4` degenerate ground states. For a sphere, `g=0`, leading to a single, non-degenerate ground state (`2^0 = 1`).\n\n2.  **Holes and Boundaries:** Introducing holes, also called punctures or defects, into the surface increases the ground state degeneracy. There are two primary types of boundaries for these holes:\n    *   **Smooth (or soft/open) boundaries:** At these boundaries, the plaquette operators (`B_p`) are not enforced. This allows electric charge (`e`) anyons to condense or terminate at the boundary.\n    *   **Rough (or closed) boundaries:** At these boundaries, the star operators (`A_s`) are not enforced. This allows magnetic flux (`m`) anyons to condense or terminate at the boundary.\n\n3.  **Logical Qubits from Holes:**\n    *   When starting on a simple surface like a plane or a sphere (genus `g=0`), each hole introduced adds to the number of logical qubits.\n    *   A key result is that for a planar lattice (topologically equivalent to a sphere with one boundary), creating `b` additional holes of the same type results in a code that can store `k=b` logical qubits.\n    *   Smooth and rough holes provide independent ways to encode information. A logical operator can be a string connecting two holes of the same type. The logical operators associated with smooth holes commute with those associated with rough holes.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits contributed by each type of hole. With `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes on a surface that is otherwise topologically trivial (like a sphere), the total number of logical qubits is `k = n + m`.\n\nBased on this, the ground space degeneracy is `2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n*   `n` smooth holes contribute `n` logical qubits.\n*   `m` rough holes contribute `m` logical qubits.\n*   Total logical qubits `k = n + m`.\n*   Ground Space Degeneracy = `2^k` = `2^(n+m)`.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
