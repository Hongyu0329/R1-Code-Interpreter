    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. The phase plane is the $(u, d)$ plane, for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nThe system is given by:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nLet's denote the right-hand sides as $g(u,d)$ and $f(u,d)$ respectively:\n$f(u, d) = u' = u^3 - u^2$\n$g(u, d) = d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $u' = 0$ and $d' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d + 0 = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$.\n    So, an equilibrium point is $(u,d) = (0,0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + (1)^4 - (1)^3 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$, which gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two other equilibrium points are $(u,d) = (1,0)$ and $(u,d) = (1,-1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the $(u,d)$ plane for $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial f/\\partial u & \\partial f/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial g/\\partial u & \\partial g/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1)-3)(-1) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 & 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 + 1 & -4 + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the equilibrium point $(1, -1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We look for an invariant curve (a trajectory) that passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\nLet's test if there is a simple relationship between $d$ and $u$ that defines an invariant curve. Let's try the form $d = -u^k$. We look for a particular solution of the form $d(t) = h(u(t))$. The slope of the trajectory in the phase plane is given by $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\nLet's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$.\n\nTo verify if $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ is a solution, we substitute it into the original system of differential equations.\nThe derivative of the proposed solution with respect to $t$ is:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot (u^3(t) - u^2(t)) = -2u^4(t) + 2u^3(t)$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3 = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both sides are equal, $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve of the system.\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points:\n*   For $(0,0)$: $0 = -0^2$, which is true. The curve passes through $(0,0)$.\n*   For $(1,-1)$: $-1 = -(1)^2$, which is true. The curve passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nAn invariant curve that passes through a saddle point is a separatrix. In this case, it corresponds to one of the manifolds (stable or unstable) of the saddle point. To determine which one, we can check the tangent of the curve at the saddle point.\nThe slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$.\n\nNow we find the slope of the unstable manifold from the eigenvector of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$. The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The eigenvector $(v_u, v_d)^T$ is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis gives the equation $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, which simplifies to $v_d = -2v_u$.\nThe eigenvector can be chosen as $(1, -2)^T$. The slope of the direction defined by this vector in the $(u,d)$ plane is $\\frac{v_d}{v_u} = -2$.\n\nSince the slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ at the saddle point $(1,-1)$ matches the slope of the unstable manifold, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point. This curve separates different regions of flow, and is therefore the separatrix. Specifically, it is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n\n<<<The equation of the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.>>>"
