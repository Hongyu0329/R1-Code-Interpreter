    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using the detection channels AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, along with Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 12 essential controls to ensure accurate data acquisition, compensation, and gating.\n\nThese controls can be categorized as follows:\n\n### 1.  Instrument and Staining Quality Controls (2 Tubes)\nThese are foundational controls to assess the background fluorescence of your sample and ensure dead cells are excluded.\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains only your cells and the streptavidin beads (if they are separate from the cells) without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells and beads and for setting the initial voltage parameters on the flow cytometer.\n*   **Viability Control (1 tube):** Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit increased autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. Therefore, a viability dye (e.g., DAPI, Propidium Iodide, or a fixable viability dye) should be included. A single-color control with just the viability dye is necessary for compensation.\n\n### 2.  Compensation Controls (5 tubes)\nIn any multicolor experiment, the emission spectrum of one fluorochrome can spill into the detector for another. Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spectral overlap. You will need one single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n*   **AF350 single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **GFP single stain (1 tube):** This will be a sample of your GFP-expressing cells, ideally mixed with a negative cell population to identify the positive and negative signals.\n*   **PE single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **AF647 single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **AF750 single stain (1 tube)**\n\nThese controls can be prepared using either cells or antibody-capture beads, but it is essential that the fluorochrome used in the control is identical to the one in your experiment and that the signal is as bright or brighter than your experimental sample. If Streptavidin-PE is used, for example, the PE compensation control should be generated using that specific conjugate.\n\n### 3.  Gating Controls (5 tubes)\nFluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls are critical for accurately setting gates, especially for a cell sorting experiment where purity is paramount. An FMO control includes all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except* for one. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the \"minus\" channel, allowing for a precise distinction between positive and negative populations. You will need one FMO control for each channel.\n*   **AF350 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **GFP FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **PE FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **AF647 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750.\n*   **AF750 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential control tubes is:\n*   Unstained Control: 1\n*   Viability Control: 1\n*   Compensation Controls: 5\n*   FMO Controls: 5\n*   **Total: 12 tubes**\n\nIt is also good practice to include a \"streptavidin-fluorochrome only\" control if you are using a biotin-streptavidin system to assess any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate. Additionally, biological controls (e.g., negative and positive cell populations for your markers of interest) are essential for interpreting the biological significance of your results.\n\n<<<12>>>"
