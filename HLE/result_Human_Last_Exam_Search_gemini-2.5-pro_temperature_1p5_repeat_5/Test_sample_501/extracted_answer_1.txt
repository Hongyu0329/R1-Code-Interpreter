The force law between the polymer ends for a thermally isolated system is given by:
$F(x) = \frac{3 x E(0)}{n^2 \ell^2} \exp\left(\frac{3 x^2}{2n^2 \ell^2}\right)$
where $x$ is the separation of the ends, $\ell$ is the length of a single strut, $n$ is the number of mass points (assumed to be large), and $E(0)$ is the kinetic energy of the polymer at zero extension.
