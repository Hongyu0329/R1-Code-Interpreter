    "In a standard surface code configuration, the number of logical qubits is often directly related to the number of topological features like holes. For a simple planar surface, introducing `b` holes typically allows for the encoding of `k=b` logical qubits. By this logic, a single patch with two holes would encode two logical qubits, and two such patches would encode four.\n\nHowever, more advanced configurations can store information more densely. By engineering the boundaries of the holes to have a mixture of \"open\" and \"closed\" properties, it's possible to increase the number of encoded qubits. Research has demonstrated a \"mixed diamond-hole surface code\" where a surface with just two holes can encode five logical qubits.\n\nSince the question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits, this denser encoding scheme provides the current upper bound. Assuming each of the two patches can be configured in this advanced way, the total number of logical qubits would be the sum from both patches.\n\nTherefore, with each of the two patches encoding a maximum of 5 logical qubits, the total is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
