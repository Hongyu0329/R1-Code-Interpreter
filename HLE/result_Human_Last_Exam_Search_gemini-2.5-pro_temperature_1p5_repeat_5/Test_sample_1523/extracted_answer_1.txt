In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field `φ`, the inner product `(φ, Dφ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of `φ` multiplied by the action of the kinetic operator `D` on `φ` over Euclidean spacetime. The operator `D` is `D = -∂_μ² + m²`, where `∂_μ²` is the four-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian and `m` is the mass of the scalar field. The inner product is explicitly:

`(φ, Dφ) = ∫ d⁴x_E φ(x) (-∂_μ² + m²) φ(x)`

where the integration is over the four-dimensional Euclidean volume, with the time dimension compactified to the interval `[0, β]`, where `β` is the inverse temperature. This expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action `S_E[φ]`.
