    "### Augustine of Hippo: Pioneering Language for Altered States of Nature\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD). He introduced a nuanced understanding of miracles that did not see them as violations of the natural order, but as events occurring within a framework of God's overarching will, which itself constitutes the true nature of things.\n\nAugustine's most significant contribution to this theological discussion is the concept encapsulated in his Latin phrase: ***Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura***. This translates to, \"A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature.\" This terminology posits that what humans perceive as a violation of natural law is simply an event that falls outside of our limited understanding of the full scope of nature as ordained by God.\n\n#### **Application to the Virgin Birth**\n\nAugustine directly applied this thinking to the virgin birth of Jesus. In his sermons and writings, he marveled at the event, stating, \"A virgin conceives, yet remains a virgin; a virgin is heavy with child; a virgin brings forth her child, yet she is always a virgin. Why are you amazed at this, O man? It was fitting for God to be born thus when He deigned to become man.\" When confronting critics who viewed the virgin birth as unnatural, Augustine argued that it was not in accordance with the *known* laws of nature, but it was in accordance with God's higher, all-encompassing natural law. For him, God, the author of nature, is not bound by the regularities He established and can introduce new, \"unusual\" events into the natural order.\n\n#### **Applicability to the Fall**\n\nAugustine's framework also provides a lens through which to understand the changes in the natural world following the Fall of Man. While he may not have used the precise phrase *\"contra quam est nota natura\"* in direct reference to the Fall's consequences, his theology lays the groundwork for its application.\n\nAugustine taught that the state of nature before the Fall was different from our current reality. The introduction of pain in childbirth, the necessity of toiling for food, and the general corruption of human nature are direct consequences of humanity's sin, representing a shift in the natural order. In his view, Adam and Eve's disobedience resulted in a \"corruption of nature,\" creating what some scholars analyzing his work term a \"second nature.\" This post-Fall state, with its inherent suffering and decay, is \"contrary to\" the original, unfallen nature that was \"known\" in the Garden of Eden.\n\nThus, Augustine's specialized terminology, which distinguishes between the observable \"course of nature\" and the ultimate divine ordering of reality, is applicable to both the singular, positive miracle of the virgin birth and the negative, ongoing alterations to the natural world resulting from the Fall. He was the first to build a theological system capable of describing such divinely-wrought changes in the laws of nature.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
