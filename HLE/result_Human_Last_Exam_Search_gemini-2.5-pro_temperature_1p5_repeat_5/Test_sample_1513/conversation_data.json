    "Based on the detailed investigation, the island town that fits the unique description is **Adamstown** on **Pitcairn Island**.\n\nThis remote island territory is situated in the south-central Pacific Ocean and meets all the specified criteria:\n\n*   **More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island:** Pitcairn Island is located approximately 688 kilometers from Mangareva, its nearest inhabited neighbor in French Polynesia.\n*   **Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera:** Pitcairn Island is the remnant of a shield volcano with a collapsed caldera. The island is described as a rugged half-crater, and its only settlement, Adamstown, lies within this volcanic basin. The landing point for the island is Bounty Bay, which is an embayment within this volcanic structure.\n*   **Shares the town's name:** While the bay is officially known as Bounty Bay, the town itself, Adamstown, sits on the bay within the caldera, thus being the \"island town...on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name\". No other location matches this specific combination of features.\n\nOther remote islands considered did not meet all the conditions. For instance, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas on Tristan da Cunha is not located on a caldera bay. Hanga Roa on Easter Island is near the Rano Kau caldera but not situated on a bay formed by it.\n\n<<<Adamstown>>>"
