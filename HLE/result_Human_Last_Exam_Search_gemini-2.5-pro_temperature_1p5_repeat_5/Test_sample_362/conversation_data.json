    "The Wittig reaction is a process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). In this specific case, the reactants are:\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and the chloro-substituent is at position 2 of the phenyl ring.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) of the pivalaldehyde with the functional carbon group of the ylide, forming a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The other product of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe structure of the resulting alkene product is formed by connecting the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde to the ylide carbon via a double bond. This leads to the formation of **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the nature of the ylide is important. The ylide in this reaction, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), is considered an \"unstabilized\" ylide because the carbon of the ylide is not attached to an electron-withdrawing group that would stabilize it through resonance. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically lead to the (Z)-alkene as the major product under standard, salt-free conditions. This is due to the reaction being under kinetic control, favoring the formation of the cis-oriented intermediate. Therefore, the primary product expected is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
