    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ is 0.\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n\nAn isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a normed vector space $(B, ||\\cdot||)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $||f(x) - f(y)|| = d_X(x, y)$. For such an embedding to exist, the geometry of the Banach space $B$ must be able to accommodate the distances defined in $X$.\n\nThere are cases where no such embedding is possible, meaning the number of isometric embeddings is zero. This can happen for two main reasons:\n\n1.  **Cardinality Mismatch:** If the cardinality of the finite ultrametric space $X$, denoted as $|X|$, is greater than the cardinality of the Banach space $B$, denoted as $K$, then no injective map from $X$ to $B$ can exist. Since an isometric embedding must be injective (as $d(x,y) > 0$ for $x \\neq y$), it is impossible to construct such an embedding. In this scenario, the number of embeddings is 0.\n\n2.  **Geometric Obstruction:** Even if the cardinality of $B$ is large enough, the geometric structure of $B$ might not be compatible with the distances in $X$. It has been established that for a finite ultrametric space to be isometrically embeddable into a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^N$ (which is a Banach space), its size is limited. Specifically, an ultrametric space that can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ can have at most $N+1$ points.\n\n    This leads to concrete examples where the number of embeddings is zero. For instance:\n    *   Consider a finite ultrametric space $X$ with 4 points. According to the result mentioned, it is not possible to isometrically embed $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, for this pair $(X, \\mathbb{R}^2)$, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n    *   As a simpler example, let $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ be an equilateral triangle with $d(a,b) = d(b,c) = d(c,a) = 1$. This is a valid ultrametric space since for any three points, the two largest distances are equal, satisfying the ultrametric inequality $d(x,z) \\le \\max\\{d(x,y), d(y,z)\\}$. Let the Banach space be the real line, $B = \\mathbb{R}$. It is impossible to place three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that the distance between any two is 1. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings of this $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}$, and the number of embeddings is 0.\n\nWhile it is true that for any finite ultrametric space $X$, one can always construct *some* Banach space into which $X$ can be embedded (for instance, the space of bounded functions on $X$), and that an embedding is always possible into any *infinite-dimensional* Banach space, the question asks for the smallest possible number of embeddings into a *given* Banach space $B$. As demonstrated, this number can be zero.\n\nSince the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, and we have shown that it can be 0, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
