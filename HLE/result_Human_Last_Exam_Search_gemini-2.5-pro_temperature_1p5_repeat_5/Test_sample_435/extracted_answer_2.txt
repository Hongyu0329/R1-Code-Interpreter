Based on the body of evidence, I predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased and more sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen encounter compared to T cells manufactured without it. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting T cell activation, proliferation, survival, and differentiation into a polyfunctional, memory-like phenotype, which would likely correlate with a higher potential for cytokine release syndrome.
