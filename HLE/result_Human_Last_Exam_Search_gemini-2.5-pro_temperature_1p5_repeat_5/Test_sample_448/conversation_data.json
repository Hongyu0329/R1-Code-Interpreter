    "### Radon Identified as Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was radon (Rn). This extreme rarity is primarily due to its radioactive nature and short-lived isotopes.\n\nThe noble gases, a group of elements known for their chemical inertness, include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). While argon is the most abundant noble gas, making up approximately 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere, the others are found in much smaller quantities.\n\nThe abundance of noble gases extends beyond the atmosphere to the Earth's crust. For instance, argon constitutes about 0.00015% of the crust. Krypton is even scarcer in the crust, with an abundance of about 0.15 micrograms per kilogram. Xenon is found in trace amounts in certain minerals and has an atmospheric concentration of about 0.087 parts per million.\n\nHowever, radon's presence is fleeting and its concentration minuscule. It is a product of the radioactive decay of radium, which itself is a decay product of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust. One of its most stable isotopes, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This rapid decay ensures that its concentration in the environment remains exceedingly low. The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be around 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram. This makes it significantly rarer than other noble gases.\n\nAnother noble gas, oganesson (Og), was first synthesized in a laboratory in 2002. However, with only a few atoms ever created, it is not considered a naturally occurring component of terrestrial matter and thus is not a candidate for the rarest naturally occurring noble gas on Earth.\n\nGiven the available data on the atmospheric and crustal abundances of all-natural noble gases, radon's exceptionally low and transient existence made it the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
