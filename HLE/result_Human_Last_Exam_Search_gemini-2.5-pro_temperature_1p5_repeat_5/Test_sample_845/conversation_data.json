    "The value computed between heartbeats for the purpose of calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen specifically measured using photoplethysmography (PPG), this can also be referred to as the **Pulse-to-Pulse interval (PPi)**. In the context of an electrocardiogram (ECG), the equivalent measurement is known as the **R-R interval**, which is the time between successive R-waves of the QRS complex.\n\nHRV is then calculated by analyzing the variations in these beat-to-beat intervals. Different HRV metrics, such as RMSSD (the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) and SDNN (the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals), are derived from these IBI or R-R interval values.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
