    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\nMount Olympus stands as the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters and is famously known in Greek mythology as the home of the gods. While also a significant location in the *Iliad*, serving as a vantage point for the gods to observe the Trojan War, Mount Ida in Turkey (also known as Kaz Dağı) is not the next tallest. Its highest peak reaches an elevation of approximately 1,774 meters.\n\nHomer's epic also references Mount Athos. Located in northeastern Greece, Mount Athos has a summit that rises to 2,033 meters, making it taller than Mount Ida. Therefore, among the historical mountains identified in the *Iliad*, Mount Athos is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\nAnother mountain, Mount Pelion, with its highest point at 1,624 meters, is associated with a myth mentioned in the context of the *Iliad* where giants attempted to stack it on Mount Ossa to reach Olympus, but it is not a prominent geographical feature in the poem's main narrative.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
