    "Based on the interpretation provided by Veronika Campan, the full name of the individual referred to as \"HE\" is Sigmund Freud.\n\nCampan's analysis, particularly in her work on Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski's film series *The Decalogue*, delves into the representation of the Ten Commandments. Her interpretation discusses the omission of the second commandment, which prohibits the making of graven images (the \"prohibition against representation\"), and the division of the final commandment concerning the coveting of another's possessions. This analysis is linked to the work of Sigmund Freud, who famously explored the psychological significance of the Ten Commandments, especially the prohibition of representation, in his book *Moses and Monotheism*. In this work, Freud argues that the prohibition against making an image of God was a pivotal moment in the development of civilization, marking a transition from sensory experience to abstract thought.\n\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
