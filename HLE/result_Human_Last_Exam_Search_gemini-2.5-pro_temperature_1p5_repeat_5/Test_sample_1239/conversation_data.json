    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is technically infinite-dimensional. The Lie algebra of this group contains arbitrary functions of time, which is what makes it infinite-dimensional.\n\nHowever, within this infinite-dimensional group, there is a physically significant finite-dimensional subgroup known as the extended Galilei group. This subgroup is often the focus of symmetry analyses in fluid dynamics. The dimension of this extended Galilei group is 11.\n\nThe Lie algebra of this 11-dimensional subgroup is generated by the following types of transformations:\n*   **Time translations:** 1 generator\n*   **Space translations:** 3 generators\n*   **Spatial rotations:** 3 generators\n*   **Galilean boosts:** 3 generators\n*   **Scale transformations:** 1 generator\n\nTherefore, while the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional, the dimension of its most important finite-dimensional subgroup is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
