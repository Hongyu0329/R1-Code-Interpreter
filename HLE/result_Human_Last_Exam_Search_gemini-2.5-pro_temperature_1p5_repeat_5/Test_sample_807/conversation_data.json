    "While the chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B, there is no definitive public information from Crayola that officially links this chemical to a specific crayon color.\n\nRhodamine B is a fluorescent dye that is bright-pink to red in color. There have been special edition Crayola crayons that featured chemical names on their labels. However, it has been noted that these labels were intended to be educational examples of chemicals that produce a similar color, not the actual ingredients used in the crayons.\n\nOnline discussions and a Reddit thread mention a \"chemistry crayon\" set where \"Red\" was labeled with Rhodamine B. Despite this, there is no official confirmation from Crayola or clear photographic evidence of a specific crayon named after this chemical. Therefore, a definitive answer to which Crayola crayon color contains or is named after 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride cannot be provided.\n\n<<<The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride cannot be definitively identified from the available information.>>>"
