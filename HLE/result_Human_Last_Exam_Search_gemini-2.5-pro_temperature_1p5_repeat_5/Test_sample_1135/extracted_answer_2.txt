In the CCSD method, matrix elements of the form $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, which limits the connectivity of the terms in the linked-cluster expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H} = (H e^{T_1+T_2})_C$. This limitation means that $\bar{H}$ can create a maximum of four particle-hole excitations from the reference determinant, $|\Phi\rangle$. As a result, its projection onto any determinant with more than four excitations is zero.
