    "There are four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These correspond to the Dynkin diagrams of types A₄, B₄, D₄, and F₄.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their associated irreducible root systems, which are in turn classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the Weyl group is equal to the number of nodes in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. The irreducible finite Weyl groups consist of four infinite families—Aₙ, Bₙ, Cₙ, and Dₙ—and five exceptional groups: G₂, F₄, E₆, E₇, and E₈.\n\nFor a rank of 4, the possible non-isomorphic groups are:\n*   **A₄**: The Weyl group corresponding to the type A root system with 4 nodes.\n*   **B₄ and C₄**: Although the root systems of type B₄ and C₄ are distinct, their corresponding Weyl groups, W(B₄) and W(C₄), are isomorphic.\n*   **D₄**: The Weyl group associated with the type D root system with 4 nodes.\n*   **F₄**: An exceptional Weyl group that is of rank 4.\n\nThe other exceptional Weyl groups have ranks other than 4: G₂ has a rank of 2, while E₆, E₇, and E₈ have ranks of 6, 7, and 8, respectively. Additionally, there are non-crystallographic finite reflection groups, such as H₄, but these are not classified as Weyl groups because they do not preserve a crystal lattice.\n\nTherefore, by counting the distinct isomorphism classes, we find there are four such groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
