    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, we first need to define these concepts.\n\n### 1. Pauli Channel\nA qudit is a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a density matrix $\\rho$ of a qudit is a quantum channel of the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a set of $d^2$ unitary operators known as the generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These operators form an orthonormal basis for the space of all linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$, denoted $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe action of the channel can also be described using Kraus operators. For a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators can be written as $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. The channel action is then given by the operator-sum representation:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k} A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger $$\n\n### 2. Complementary Channel\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ from the system's Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to a combined system-environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe **complementary channel**, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks into the environment. It is obtained by tracing over the system instead:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe output of the complementary channel is a state in the environment's Hilbert space.\n\n### 3. Rank of the Complementary Channel\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the dimension of its output space. A key result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}_{k=1}^r$ is given by the dimension of the vector space spanned by the operators $\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}_{i,j=1}^r$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}_{i,j=1}^r) $$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Maximal Rank for a Pauli Channel\nFor a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. To find the *maximal* rank, we can choose the probabilities $p_k$ freely, as long as they form a valid probability distribution. To maximize the dimension of the span, we should ensure that we have as many non-zero Kraus operators as possible. This is achieved by choosing $p_k > 0$ for all $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. A simple choice is the uniform distribution, $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$, which corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel.\n\nWith $p_k > 0$ for all $k$, we have $d^2$ Kraus operators. The rank of the complementary channel is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the Kraus operators:\n$$ A_i^\\dagger A_j = (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} U_i^\\dagger U_j $$\nSince we chose all $p_k > 0$, the coefficients $\\sqrt{p_i p_j}$ are all non-zero. Therefore, the dimension of the span is determined by the linear independence of the operators $U_i^\\dagger U_j$:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1}) $$\nThe set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ forms a basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. The key properties of this set are:\n1.  Each $U_k$ is unitary.\n2.  The product of any two Pauli operators, $U_i U_j$, is proportional to another Pauli operator, $U_m$.\n3.  The set is closed under taking the adjoint (inverse), i.e., $U_i^\\dagger$ is proportional to some $U_l$.\n\nThis means the set of operators $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}_{i,j}$ consists of Pauli operators (possibly with a phase factor, which does not affect the span). To find the dimension of the space spanned by this set, we need to see how many linearly independent operators it contains.\n\nConsider the case where $U_i$ is the identity operator, $I$ (which is one of the Pauli operators, usually denoted $U_0$). Then for this choice of $i$, the set contains $\\{I^\\dagger U_j\\}_{j=0}^{d^2-1} = \\{U_j\\}_{j=0}^{d^2-1}$.\nThis shows that the set of operators $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}$ contains the entire basis $\\{U_k\\}$ of the space $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. Therefore, the span of $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}$ is the entire space $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n\nThe dimension of $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ is $d^2$. Thus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nThe maximal rank is achieved when the Pauli channel has contributions from all $d^2$ Pauli error operators, ensuring that the information leaked to the environment is as rich as possible, spanning a space of dimension $d^2$.\n\n<<<$d^2$>>>"
