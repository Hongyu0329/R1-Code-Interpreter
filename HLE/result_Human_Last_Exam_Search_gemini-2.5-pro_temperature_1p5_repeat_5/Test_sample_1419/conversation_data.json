    "Near four dimensions, the ϕ⁴ theory exhibits a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The position of this fixed point for the coupling constant, denoted as u*, can be calculated perturbatively as an expansion in the small parameter ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nTo leading order in ϵ, the fixed point coupling is given by:\n\n***u* = (8π² / 3) ϵ**\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena and quantum field theory. It allows for the calculation of critical exponents as an expansion in ϵ, providing a powerful tool to study the behavior of systems near a second-order phase transition. The existence of this fixed point is what makes the ϕ⁴ theory renormalizable and predictive near four dimensions. At the fixed point, the beta function for the coupling u vanishes, β(u*) = 0, indicating that the effective coupling does not change with the energy scale. This scale invariance is a key feature of systems at a critical point.\n\n<<<(*8π² / 3) ϵ*>>>"
