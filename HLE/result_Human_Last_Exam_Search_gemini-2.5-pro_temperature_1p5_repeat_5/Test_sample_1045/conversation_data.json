    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by calculating the number of functions for each atom and summing them.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   The '6-' signifies that each core atomic orbital (the 1s orbital for carbon) is described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussian functions. This gives **1 core function**.\n    *   The '-31' indicates that the valence shell (the 2s and 2p orbitals) is split into two parts. Each valence atomic orbital is represented by two basis functions.\n    *   Carbon has four valence orbitals: one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   Each of these four valence orbitals is represented by two contracted functions (an inner one made of 3 primitives and an outer one of 1 primitive). This results in 4 × 2 = **8 valence functions**.\n    *   Therefore, each carbon atom uses a total of 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   The '-31' split means this 1s orbital is described by **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For the Toluene Molecule (C7H8):**\n    *   The molecule consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total functions from carbon: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = **63 functions**.\n    *   Total functions from hydrogen: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = **16 functions**.\n    *   The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum for all atoms: 63 + 16 = **79 functions**.\n\n<<<79>>>"
