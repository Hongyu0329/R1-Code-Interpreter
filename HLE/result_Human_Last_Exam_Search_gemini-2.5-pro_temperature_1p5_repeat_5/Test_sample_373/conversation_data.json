    "In a barbell graph with 10 nodes, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25, or 4%.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n1.  **Understanding the Graph Structure**: A standard 10-node barbell graph consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\" as it is the sole bridge between the two halves of the graph.\n    *   **Nodes**: There are a total of 10 nodes (n=10) in the graph.\n    *   **Edges**: Each complete 5-node graph (K5) has `5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10` edges. With two such cliques and one connecting bridge, the total number of edges is `10 + 10 + 1 = 21`.\n\n2.  **Defining Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: This process involves two steps for sampling a single edge:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/10`.\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to contact. The edge connecting them is considered \"sampled\". The probability of choosing a specific neighbor depends on the node's degree (the number of connections it has).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Probability**: Let the bottleneck edge connect node `A` (in the first clique) and node `B` (in the second clique).\n\n    *   **Degree of the Bottleneck Nodes**:\n        *   Node `A` is connected to 4 other nodes within its own clique and to node `B` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, the degree of node `A` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n        *   Similarly, the degree of node `B` is also 5.\n\n    *   **Two Ways to Sample the Bottleneck Edge**: The bottleneck edge `(A, B)` can be sampled in one of two mutually exclusive ways in a single gossiping step:\n        1.  Node `A` is chosen first, and it then chooses node `B`.\n        2.  Node `B` is chosen first, and it then chooses node `A`.\n\n    *   **Calculating the Probabilities**:\n        *   The probability of selecting node `A` first is `1/10`. The probability of node `A` then selecting node `B` from its 5 neighbors is `1/5`. So, the total probability for this scenario is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n        *   The probability of selecting node `B` first is `1/10`. The probability of node `B` then selecting node `A` from its 5 neighbors is `1/5`. The probability for this scenario is also `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n    *   **Final Probability**: To get the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we sum the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n        `P(sampling bottleneck) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives a 4% chance. This low probability illustrates why information spreads slowly across the bottleneck in uniform gossiping models.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
