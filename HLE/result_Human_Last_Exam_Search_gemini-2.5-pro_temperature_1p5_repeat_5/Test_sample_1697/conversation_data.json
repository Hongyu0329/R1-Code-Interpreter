    "The reaction described involves a directed ortho-lithiation followed by quenching with an electrophile.\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs): the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt2) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2). In directed ortho-metalation reactions, the strength of the directing group determines the site of lithiation. The tertiary amide group is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine group.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two steps:\n1.  **Directed ortho-lithiation**: The substrate is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong base, in the presence of TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine) and THF (tetrahydrofuran) as the solvent. The stronger directing group, the N,N-diethylamide, will direct the lithium to the ortho position. The positions ortho to the amide are C2 and C6. The C2 position is also ortho to the dimethylamino group, making it electronically activated by both groups. The C6 position is only ortho to the amide. The lithiation will preferentially occur at the more activated C2 position, which is ortho to both the amide and the amino groups. The sec-BuLi deprotonates the C2 position of the benzene ring to form a stabilized aryllithium intermediate. TMEDA chelates the lithium ion, increasing the reactivity of the base and stabilizing the lithiated species.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic quench**: The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It is then treated with methyl iodide (CH3I). The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nTherefore, the final product obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
