    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of triangular-shaped graphene nanoflake with ethynyl groups attached at its corners. A systematic name for this molecule is 2,7,12-triethynyl-trinaphtho[2,3-a:2',3'-c:2'',3''-e]cyclooctatetraene, although it is more commonly referred to in the literature as a triethynyl-substituted triangulene or a derivative of triphenylene. Due to its highly regular and symmetric structure, this molecule belongs to the **D3h point group**.\n\nThe determination of the D3h point group is based on the presence of the following symmetry elements in the molecule's planar structure:\n*   **A principal C3 rotational axis:** This threefold axis of rotation passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A rotation of 120 degrees around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n*   **Three C2 rotational axes:** There are three twofold axes of rotation that are perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Each of these axes lies in the plane of the molecule and bisects one of the sides of the triangular structure.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This mirror plane is coincident with the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these mirror planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the ethynyl groups, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **An S3 improper rotational axis:** Coincident with the principal C3 axis, a 120-degree rotation followed by a reflection through the horizontal mirror plane is a symmetry operation.\n\nMolecules that possess a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane are classified under the D3h point group. This high degree of symmetry is characteristic of many triangular and trigonal planar molecules.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
