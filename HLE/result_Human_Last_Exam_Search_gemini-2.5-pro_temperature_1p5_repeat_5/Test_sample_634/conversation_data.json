    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1],\n\nwe can use a method based on row-reducing a concatenated matrix.\n\n1.  **Define the GCRD**: A matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a common right divisor (i.e., P1 = Q1*G and P2 = Q2*G for some polynomial matrices Q1 and Q2) and any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s). A common method to find the GCRD is to perform elementary row operations on the combined matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to a simpler form.\n\n2.  **Form the concatenated matrix M(s)**:\n    M(s) =\n    [s^2 + s,  -s]   (R1)\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2]   (R2)\n    [s,         0]   (R3)\n    [-s - 1,    1]   (R4)\n\n3.  **Perform elementary row operations**: The goal is to simplify this matrix using operations that are equivalent to left-multiplying by a unimodular matrix. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n    Let's perform the reduction:\n    *   Observe the relationship between R1 and R4: R1 = [s^2 + s, -s] and R4 = [-s - 1, 1]. If we multiply R4 by -s, we get -s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s, -s], which is exactly R1. Therefore, R1 is a polynomial multiple of R4. We can eliminate R1 by the operation R1_new ← R1 + s*R4:\n        R1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] =.\n        The matrix becomes:\n        [0,         0]\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n        [s,         0]\n        [-s - 1,    1]\n\n    *   Now, let's work on the remaining non-zero rows. Let's use R4 to eliminate the s^2 term in the second column of R2. We perform the operation R2_new ← R2 - s^2*R4:\n        R2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0].\n        The matrix is now:\n        [0,         0]\n        [s^3 - 1,   0]   (R2_new)\n        [s,         0]   (R3)\n        [-s - 1,    1]   (R4)\n\n    *   Now consider R2_new and R3. We can simplify them using a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. We have the rows [s^3 - 1, 0] and [s, 0]. We can perform the operation R2_new ← R2_new - s^2*R3:\n        R2_new' = [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0].\n        The matrix of non-zero rows becomes:\n        [-1,       0]\n        [s,        0]\n        [-s - 1,   1]\n\n    *   Now, use the new top row [-1, 0] to eliminate the other rows:\n        *   R3_new ← R3 + s*[-1, 0] = [s, 0] + [-s, 0] =.\n        *   R4_new ← R4 + (-s - 1)*[-1, 0] = [-s - 1, 1] + [s + 1, 0] =.\n\n    *   The final set of non-zero rows is:\n        [-1, 0]\n       \n\n4.  **Identify the GCRD**: The GCRD is the matrix formed by the non-zero rows of the reduced matrix.\n    G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nThis resulting matrix is unimodular because its determinant is -1, which is a non-zero constant. When the GCRD is unimodular, the original matrices are said to be right coprime. Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case, including the identity matrix I, which can be obtained by multiplying G(s) by [-1, 0; 0, 1] (which is also unimodular).\n\n<<<[[-1, 0],]>>>"
