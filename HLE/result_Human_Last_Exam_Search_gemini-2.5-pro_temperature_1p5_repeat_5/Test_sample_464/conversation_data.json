    "Yes, if a Schwartz class function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has the property that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, then it follows that $f(x)$ must be the zero function.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives:**\n    Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of the Schwartz function $f(x)$. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n    $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n    A key property of the Fourier transform is that it converts multiplication by a polynomial into differentiation. The $k$-th derivative of the Fourier transform can be found by differentiating under the integral sign:\n    $\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\n2.  **Connecting to the Moments of the Function:**\n    If we evaluate these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$, we get a direct relationship with the moments of the function $f(x)$:\n    $\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$\n    This shows that the moments of a function are directly related to the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Condition:**\n    The problem states that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero. That is, for all non-negative integers $k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$:\n    $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$\n    From the relationship above, this implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at $\\xi = 0$ are also zero:\n    $\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$\n\n4.  **Properties of the Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function:**\n    A fundamental result in Fourier analysis is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is itself a Schwartz function. Schwartz functions are infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$). Furthermore, the Fourier transform of a function with compact support (a subset of Schwartz functions) is a real-analytic function. While not all Schwartz functions have compact support, their rapid decay ensures that their Fourier transforms are analytic functions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Analytic Function Theory:**\n    Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is an analytic function, it can be represented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of any point. The Taylor series for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$ is given by:\n    $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) \\xi^k$\n    As we've established that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at zero are null, every coefficient in this Taylor series is zero. An analytic function that is zero in a neighborhood (because its Taylor series is identically zero) must be zero everywhere. Thus, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Uniqueness of the Fourier Transform:**\n    The Fourier transform is an invertible map on the space of Schwartz functions. This means that if the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero almost everywhere. Since Schwartz functions are continuous, if $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, then $f(x)$ must be identically zero for all $x$.\n\nTherefore, the condition that all moments of a Schwartz function are zero forces the function to be identically zero.\n\nIt is worth noting that there exist non-zero functions that are not in the Schwartz class for which all moments are zero. A classic example is $f(x) = e^{-x^{1/4}} \\sin(x^{1/4})$, which is not a Schwartz function because it does not decay rapidly enough.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
