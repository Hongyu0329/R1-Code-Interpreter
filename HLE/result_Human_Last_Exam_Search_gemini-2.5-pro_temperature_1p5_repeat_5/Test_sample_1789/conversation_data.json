    "The prime factorization of the number N = 823564528378596 is 2² × 3¹ × 7¹ × 11¹ × 13¹ × 17¹ × 19¹ × 23¹ × 29¹ × 31¹ × 37¹ × 41¹ × 43¹ × 47¹ × 53¹.\n\nThe set of divisors of N, ordered by divisibility, forms a partially ordered set (poset). In this poset, an antichain is a set of divisors where no divisor in the set divides another. The divisors of N can be partitioned into antichains based on their rank. The rank of a divisor is the sum of the exponents of its prime factors.\n\nLet Ω(d) be the sum of the exponents in the prime factorization of a divisor d. For N, the sum of the exponents is Ω(N) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16. The possible ranks for the divisors of N range from 0 (for the divisor 1) to 16 (for the divisor N itself). This gives a total of 17 possible ranks.\n\nEach set of divisors with the same rank forms an antichain. Therefore, the set of all divisors of N can be partitioned into 17 disjoint antichains. The question asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains. Since we have only 17 possible antichains (one for each rank), the union of 20 antichains will encompass all the divisors of N. Therefore, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the total number of divisors of N.\n\nThe number of divisors of N, denoted by τ(N), is calculated from its prime factorization N = p₁ᵃ¹ × p₂ᵃ² × ... × pₖᵃᵏ as τ(N) = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(aₖ + 1).\n\nFor N = 2² × 3¹ × 7¹ × ... × 53¹, the number of divisors is:\nτ(N) = (2 + 1) × (1 + 1)¹⁴ = 3 × 2¹⁴ = 3 × 16384 = 49152.\n\nThus, the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of [1, 823564528378596] is the set of all its divisors, which is 49152.\n\n<<<49152>>>"
