The number of non-Clifford gates is not a fixed parameter of a quantum computer but is determined by the specific algorithm being executed. For a simulation on a distance-3 surface code, this number can range from fewer than ten for simple proof-of-concept circuits to billions for complex problems like factoring. For the implementation of a universal quantum computer with a distance-5 surface code and a high physical error rate of 1%, the crucial factor is the immense overhead required to produce a single fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate through magic state distillation. This process requires a complex circuit of many physical Clifford gates and does not have a straightforward "gate count" in terms of logical non-Clifford gates. Therefore, a single numerical answer for the number of non-Clifford gates is not meaningful without specifying a particular quantum algorithm and target logical fidelity.
