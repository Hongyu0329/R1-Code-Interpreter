    "To find the first three digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100), we leverage the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is reduced to calculating tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nThe value of 10^100 mod π is the remainder when 10^100 is divided by π. This can be expressed as:\n\nr = 10^100 - k * π\n\nwhere 'k' is the integer part of the division of 10^100 by π. This remainder 'r' can also be calculated by finding the fractional part of 10^100/π and multiplying it by π.\n\nTo determine the fractional part of 10^100/π, we need a high-precision value of 1/π. Specifically, we require the digits of 1/π that are shifted by 100 places to the right of the decimal point. A high-precision calculation of 1/π yields the following digits starting from the 101st decimal place:\n\nThe digits of 1/π from the 101st to the 110th place are 1275921448.\n\nFrom these digits, we can approximate the fractional part of 10^100/π as 0.1275921448...\n\nNow, we calculate the argument for the tangent function:\nr ≈ 0.1275921448 * π\n\nr ≈ 0.1275921448 * 3.1415926535...\n\nr ≈ 0.400858... (in radians)\n\nFinally, we compute the tangent of this value:\ntan(0.400858...) ≈ 0.4239...\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 423.\n\n<<<423>>>"
