    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This outcome is determined by the specific stereochemical requirements of the E2 elimination reaction.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants and Conditions**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), is a strong, sterically hindered base, and the reaction is carried out in tert-butyl alcohol. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **E2 Reaction and Stereochemistry**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane ring, this translates to both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen being in axial positions on opposite sides of the ring (a trans-diaxial arrangement).\n*   **Chair Conformations**: The *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations: one where both the bromo and methyl groups are equatorial, and another where they are both axial. The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable. However, for the E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must adopt the less stable diaxial conformation, as this is the only one where the bromine leaving group is in the required axial position.\n*   **Product Determination**: In the reactive diaxial conformation, the bromine is axial. We must now look at the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) for axial hydrogens.\n    *   At C2, the methyl group is in an axial position, meaning the hydrogen at C2 is in an equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated.\n    *   At C6, there is an axial hydrogen that is perfectly positioned anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n*   **Conclusion**: The bulky tert-butoxide base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The resulting product is 3-methylcyclohexene. The more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed because of the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction mechanism in this specific isomer.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
