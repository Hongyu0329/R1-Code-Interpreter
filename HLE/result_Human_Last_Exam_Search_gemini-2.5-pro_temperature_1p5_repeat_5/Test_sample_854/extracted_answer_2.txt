The primary mistake made by the laboratory was in its media preparation and quality control procedures. Person B's decision to autoclave the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) after the addition of chloramphenicol led to the thermal degradation of the antibiotic, rendering it ineffective. Chloramphenicol is heat-sensitive, and standard practice is to add it to the media after it has been autoclaved and cooled.

This initial error was compounded by a flawed quality control (QC) check. The laboratory used a stock culture of *Bacillus subtilis* to test the agar, and the expected result of no growth was observed. This falsely confirmed that the antibiotic was active. However, the QC strain was likely not robust enough, or the residual, partially-degraded antibiotic was just sufficient to inhibit this specific strain but not hardier, environmental contaminants.

When the PDA bottles were subsequently left open to the air, they were exposed to various microbes, including resilient airborne bacterial spores. In Batch 3, these spores, which included gram-positive, spore-forming rods consistent with a *Bacillus* species, were able to germinate and grow because the chloramphenicol had been destroyed. In Batches 1 and 2, the properly prepared antibiotic remained active and prevented this contamination. Therefore, the laboratory's misplaced confidence in Batch 3 stemmed from relying on QC evidence that was compromised by an incorrect media preparation protocol.
