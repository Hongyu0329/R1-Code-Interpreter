    "## Conditions for FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Unveiled\n\nIn the realm of fixed point theory, a branch of mathematics that studies points that remain unchanged by a function, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions **F: X × Y × Z → X**, **G: Y × X × Y → Y**, and **H: Z × Y × X → Z** is contingent upon a set of specific conditions related to the underlying spaces and the nature of the functions themselves. These conditions are primarily established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet **(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z** such that:\n*   **F(x, y, z) = x**\n*   **G(y, x, y) = y**\n*   **H(z, y, x) = z**\n\nThe core requirements for the existence and, in some cases, uniqueness of such a point are detailed below.\n\n### Foundational Setting: Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces\n\nThe groundwork for establishing an FGH-tripled fixed point theorem is laid upon the topological and algebraic structure of the sets X, Y, and Z.\n\n*   **(Complete Metric Spaces)**: The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. This means that every Cauchy sequence of points in these spaces converges to a point within the space itself. Let their respective metrics be d_X, d_Y, and d_Z.\n*   **(Partial Order)**: The spaces must be endowed with a partial order relation (≤). This allows for the comparison of elements, which is crucial for the mixed monotone property.\n\n### The FGH-Mixed Monotone Property\n\nA central condition is the generalization of the mixed monotone property to the three functions F, G, and H. This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial order. The mappings **F**, **G**, and **H** must have the **mixed monotone property**. This means that for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n**For the function F: X × Y × Z → X:**\n*   F is non-decreasing in its first argument: if x₁ ≤ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z).\n*   F is non-increasing in its second argument: if y₁ ≤ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z).\n*   F is non-decreasing in its third argument: if z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n**For the function G: Y × X × Y → Y:**\n*   G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments: if y₁ ≤ y₂, then G(y₁, x, y) ≤ G(y₂, x, y) and G(y, x, y₁) ≤ G(y, x, y₂).\n*   G is non-increasing in its second argument: if x₁ ≤ x₂, then G(y, x₁, y) ≥ G(y, x₂, y).\n\n**For the function H: Z × Y × X → Z:**\n*   H is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments: if z₁ ≤ z₂, then H(z₁, y, x) ≤ H(z₂, y, x) and if x₁ ≤ x₂, then H(z, y, x₁) ≤ H(z, y, x₂).\n*   H is non-increasing in its second argument: if y₁ ≤ y₂, then H(z, y₁, x) ≥ H(z, y₂, x).\n\n### Contractive Conditions\n\nThe functions must satisfy certain contractive conditions, which ensure that successive applications of the functions bring points closer together, ultimately leading to a fixed point. There exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequalities hold:\n\n*   **d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)**\n*   **d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ k * d_Y(y, v) + l * d_X(x, u) + m * d_Y(y, v)**\n*   **d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_Z(z, w) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_X(x, u)**\n\nThese inequalities ensure that the mappings are contractions with respect to a weighted combination of the distances in the respective spaces.\n\n### Continuity or a Regularity Condition\n\nTo guarantee the existence of a fixed point, an additional condition regarding the continuity of the functions or the structure of the partially ordered metric spaces is required.\n\n*   **Continuity**: The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n\n*   **OR**\n\n*   **Regularity**: The partially ordered spaces have the property that for any non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converging to x, we have x_n ≤ x for all n, and for any non-increasing sequence {y_n} converging to y, we have y ≤ y_n for all n.\n\n### Existence of an Initial Point\n\nFinally, there must exist initial points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfy:\n\n*   **x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)**\n*   **y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)**\n*   **z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)**\n\nThis condition provides a starting point for the iterative process that converges to the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is assured when the functions operate on partially ordered complete metric spaces, exhibit a specific mixed monotone behavior, satisfy a set of contractive conditions, are continuous (or the space has a regularity property), and when there is a suitable starting point. These conditions are a generalization of those for coupled and tripled fixed points and are primarily discussed in the work of Karichery and Shaini.## Conditions for FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Unveiled\n\nIn the realm of fixed point theory, a branch of mathematics that studies points that remain unchanged by a function, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions **F: X × Y × Z → X**, **G: Y × X × Y → Y**, and **H: Z × Y × X → Z** is contingent upon a set of specific conditions related to the underlying spaces and the nature of the functions themselves.
