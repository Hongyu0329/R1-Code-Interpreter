    "Answering the question of the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion requires specifying a basis for the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y. The number of such coefficients is dependent on the chosen basis. A common and computationally significant choice is the Lyndon basis.\n\nFor the Lyndon basis, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion is 55.\n\nThis number is derived from the total number of basis elements of order 10 and the number of vanishing coefficients in this specific basis. The total number of independent commutators of order `n` in a free Lie algebra with two generators is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`l_2(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * 2^(n/d)`\n\nwhere `μ` is the Möbius function. For order 10, the total number of basis elements is:\n\n`l_2(10) = (1/10) * (μ(1)*2^10 + μ(2)*2^5 + μ(5)*2^2 + μ(10)*2^1)`\n`l_2(10) = (1/10) * (1*1024 - 1*32 - 1*4 + 1*2) = 99`\n\nSo, there are 99 independent commutators of order 10.\n\nIn the Lyndon basis, for an even order `m=2p`, there is a specific pattern of vanishing coefficients. The number of these zero coefficients for order `m=10` (`p=5`) is given by the formula:\n\n`nc(10) = l_2(10) - l_2(9) + 1`\n\nThe dimension of the free Lie algebra for order 9 is:\n\n`l_2(9) = (1/9) * (μ(1)*2^9 + μ(3)*2^3 + μ(9)*2^1)`\n`l_2(9) = (1/9) * (1*512 - 1*8 + 0*2) = 56`\n\nTherefore, the number of vanishing coefficients of order 10 is:\n\n`nc(10) = 99 - 56 + 1 = 44`\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients is the total number of basis elements minus the number of vanishing coefficients:\n\nNumber of nonzero coefficients = `99 - 44 = 55`.\n\nThis result is consistent with computational analyses of the BCH formula. For other bases, such as the Hall basis, the number of nonzero coefficients can be different.\n\n<<<55>>>"
