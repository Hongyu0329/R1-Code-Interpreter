    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, corresponds to an adjunction between posets. The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, and the morphisms are order-preserving maps.\n\nAn adjunction from $$ to $$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: \\to$ (the left adjoint) and $R: \\to$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the condition $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in$ and $j \\in$.\n\nA crucial property of such adjunctions between posets is that left adjoints preserve all suprema (joins), and right adjoints preserve all infima (meets). Since the posets $[n]$ are complete lattices, all joins and meets exist.\n*   For an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all joins. In a finite total order like $[m]$, this condition is equivalent to requiring that the map preserves the least element, i.e., $L(0) = 0$.\n*   Similarly, for an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve all meets. This is equivalent to preserving the greatest element, i.e., $R(n) = m$.\n\nFor any left adjoint $L$, the right adjoint $R$ is uniquely determined, and vice-versa. Therefore, the number of internal adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints $L: \\to$.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $L(0) = 0$. Such a map is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the 23 values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements. This is a \"stars and bars\" combination-with-repetition problem. We are choosing 23 numbers from 38 possibilities with replacement, and the order is determined by the non-decreasing condition.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $n=38$ (the number of available options).\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating the value of this binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 459,286,812,653,415,360$.\n\nThus, there are 459,286,812,653,415,360 internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $$ to $$.\n\n<<<459286812653415360>>>"
