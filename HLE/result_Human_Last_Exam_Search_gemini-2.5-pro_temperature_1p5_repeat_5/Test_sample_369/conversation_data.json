    "The scansion of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is as follows:\n\n*   **Foot 1: vēr-um** - This is a spondee (S), as \"vē\" is a long vowel and \"-rum\" is a closed syllable, making it long by position.\n*   **Foot 2: u-b' e-qui** - This is a dactyl (D). It involves an elision where the \"-i\" in \"ubi\" is dropped before the initial vowel of \"equi\". The \"u\" is short, \"be\" is short, and \"qui\" is long.\n*   **Foot 3: at-qu(e) ho-mi** - This is a dactyl (D). An elision occurs where the \"-e\" in \"atque\" is dropped before the vowel sound of \"hominis\" (the 'h' is not typically treated as a consonant in scansion). \"-at\" is long by position, and \"-qu(e) ho-\" and \"-mi-\" are short.\n*   **Foot 4: nis cā-sū** - This is a spondee (S). The syllable \"-nis\" is long by position (followed by two consonants, 'c' and 's'), and both vowels in \"cāsū\" are long by nature.\n*   **Foot 5: con-ve-nit** - This is a dactyl (D). The syllable \"con-\" is long by position, while \"-ve-\" and \"-nit\" are both short.\n*   **Foot 6: i-mā-gō** - This is a spondee (S). The \"-mā-\" and \"-gō\" syllables are both long by nature. The final syllable of a hexameter line is always considered long.\n\nTherefore, the complete scansion of the line is:\n\n<<<S D D S D S>>>"
