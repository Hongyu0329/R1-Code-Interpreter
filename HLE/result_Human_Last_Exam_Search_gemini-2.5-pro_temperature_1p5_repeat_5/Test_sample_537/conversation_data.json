    "The pattern used to encode the words is the Atbash cipher. This simple substitution cipher works by reversing the alphabet; A becomes Z, B becomes Y, C becomes X, and so on.\n\nHere is the decoding of the provided words:\n*   **utpshtheas** decodes to **forgiveus**\n*   **fkuhu** decodes to **sushi**\n*   **numhkatnatu** decodes to **manhattan**\n\nFollowing this pattern, the final word is decoded as follows:\n*   **anhaeketn** decodes to **zmszvpvgm**\n\n<<<zmszvpvgm>>>"
