    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, we first need to understand the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### The Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup> (for n ≥ 3) can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_2<sup>n</sup> = { a, b | a<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = 1, b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup></sup>, bab<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup> }.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have 2<sup>n</sup> = 128, which means n = 7. Thus, Q_128 is defined by:\nQ_128 = { a, b | a<sup>64</sup> = 1, b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, bab<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup> }\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are { a<sup>i</sup>, a<sup>i</sup>b | 0 ≤ i < 64 }. This group contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 64, which is `<a>`. A key property is that every abelian subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is cyclic.\n\n### Power Subgroups\n\nA power subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of the elements of G. That is, G<sup>k</sup> = < {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} >. We need to find how many distinct subgroups of Q_128 can be formed this way for all positive integers *k*.\n\nWe analyze the k-th powers of all elements in Q_128, which are of two forms: a<sup>i</sup> and a<sup>i</sup>b.\n\n**Case 1: k is an odd integer**\n\n*   The k-th power of an element a<sup>i</sup> is (a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>ik</sup>. Since k is odd, the greatest common divisor gcd(k, 64) is 1. Therefore, the subgroup generated by a<sup>k</sup>, `<a<sup>k</sup>>`, is the same as `<a>`.\n*   The k-th power of an element a<sup>i</sup>b can be calculated. Note that (a<sup>i</sup>b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>i</sup>b a<sup>i</sup>b = a<sup>i</sup>(ba<sup>i</sup>b<sup>-1</sup>)b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>i</sup>(a<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>i</sup>b<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>.\n*   Since k is odd, we can write k = 2m + 1. Then (a<sup>i</sup>b)<sup>k</sup> = ((a<sup>i</sup>b)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>m</sup> * (a<sup>i</sup>b) = (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>m</sup> * a<sup>i</sup>b.\n*   The set of k-th powers includes `<a>` (from elements like a<sup>k</sup>) and elements of the form a<sup>32m+i</sup>b. Because this set contains elements from the coset `<a>b` in addition to the entirety of the subgroup `<a>`, the subgroup generated by all these k-th powers is Q_128 itself.\n*   Therefore, for any odd integer k, Q_128<sup>k</sup> = Q_128. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: k is an even integer**\n\n*   Let k = 2m. The k-th power of a<sup>i</sup> is (a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>ik</sup> = a<sup>2im</sup>. The subgroup generated by these elements is `<a<sup>k</sup>> = <a<sup>2m</sup>>`.\n*   The k-th power of an element a<sup>i</sup>b is ((a<sup>i</sup>b)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>32m</sup> = a<sup>16k</sup>. This element a<sup>16k</sup> is already contained within the subgroup `<a<sup>k</sup>>` because 16k is a multiple of k.\n*   Thus, for any even integer k, the power subgroup Q_128<sup>k</sup> is `<a<sup>k</sup>>`.\n\nWe now need to count how many distinct subgroups of the form `<a<sup>k</sup>>` exist for even integers k. The subgroup `<a<sup>k</sup>>` is determined by the greatest common divisor gcd(k, 64). Since k must be even, gcd(k, 64) must be an even divisor of 64.\n\nThe divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. The even divisors are:\n*   2 (e.g., k=2): `<a²>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   4 (e.g., k=4): `<a⁴>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   8 (e.g., k=8): `<a⁸>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   16 (e.g., k=16): `<a¹⁶>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   32 (e.g., k=32): `<a³²>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   64 (e.g., k=64): `<a⁶⁴>`, the trivial subgroup {1} of order 1.\n\nThese are 6 distinct subgroups for even values of k.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are:\n1.  Q_128 (for all odd k)\n2.  `<a²>`\n3.  `<a⁴>`\n4.  `<a⁸>`\n5.  `<a¹⁶>`\n6.  `<a³²>`\n7.  The trivial subgroup {1}\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 6 = 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
