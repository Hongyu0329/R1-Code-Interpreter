    "An analysis of the position reveals that White has a decisive, game-winning move. The optimal move for White is to trade queens, which leads to a winning king and pawn endgame.\n\nThe correct move for White is:\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>\n\nAfter White plays Qxc5+, Black is forced to recapture with their king, as the queen on c5 is undefended. The subsequent position is a king and pawn endgame where White's passed d-pawn, supported by the king, becomes an unstoppable threat. Black's king is drawn away from the defense of the kingside, allowing White's king to advance and support the pawn's promotion. Simultaneously, White's king is well-positioned to halt the advance of Black's own passed d-pawn. This sequence of moves transitions the game from a complex queen endgame to a clearly won simplified position for White."
