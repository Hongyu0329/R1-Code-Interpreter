    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Polynomials and their Derivatives\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\n*   $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x) = mx^3 + nx^2 + px + q$, with $m \\neq 0$.\n\nThe derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n*   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n*   $g'(x) = 3mx^2 + 2nx + p$.\n\nThe condition that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real $x$ imposes constraints on their coefficients. For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, we must have $A > 0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\n*   For $f'(x)>0$: We need $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$, and $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n*   For $g'(x)>0$: We need $3m > 0 \\implies m > 0$, and $(2n)^2 - 4(3m)(p) < 0 \\implies 4n^2 - 12mp < 0 \\implies n^2 < 3mp$.\n\nThese conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions, as their derivatives are always positive.\n\n### 2. The Composite Function and its Fixed Points\n\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the number of solutions to $h(x)=x$.\nThe degree of the composite polynomial $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is at most 9.\n\n### 3. Possibility of Attaining 9 Fixed Points\n\nNow, we need to determine if it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\nLet $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. For $P(x)=0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, say $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_9$, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots, with one root lying between each pair of consecutive roots of $P(x)$.\n\nLet's examine the derivative $P'(x)$:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n\nLet's determine the degree of $P'(x)$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   Therefore, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n\nThe product $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\nSo, $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n\nThis means that it is theoretically possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, which is a necessary condition for $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\nFor $P(x)=0$ to have 9 real roots, we need to be able to choose the parameters of $f$ and $g$ such that:\n1.  $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n2.  The polynomial equation $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n3.  The values of $P(x)$ at the 8 critical points (the roots of $P'(x)$) alternate in sign.\n\nThe leading coefficient of the 8th-degree polynomial $P'(x)$ is $(3am^2)(3m) = 9am^3$. Since $a>0$ and $m>0$, this coefficient is positive. Thus, $P'(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. For $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots, it must have 4 local minima that are negative and 3 local maxima that are positive. The derivative of $P'(x)$, which is $P''(x)$, is a polynomial of degree 7 and thus can have up to 7 real roots, allowing for the required number of local extrema for $P'(x)$.\n\nThe constraints on the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ ($b^2 < 3ac$ and $n^2 < 3mp$) define open sets in the space of coefficients, providing enough flexibility. It has been shown that such polynomials can be constructed. For instance, one can construct a suitable polynomial $h(x)$ of degree 9 which is a composition of two cubic polynomials and then slightly perturb it to have 9 fixed points while keeping its derivative positive. A common technique involves perturbing compositions of Chebyshev polynomials, like $T_9(x)=T_3(T_3(x))$, and adjusting them to ensure the derivatives are strictly positive.\n\nSince a 9th-degree polynomial can have at most 9 roots, and it has been established that it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ meeting the criteria such that $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 solutions, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n"
