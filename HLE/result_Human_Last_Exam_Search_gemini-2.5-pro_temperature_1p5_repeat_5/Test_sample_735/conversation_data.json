    "A significant amount of research has been conducted on the topic of maximal by inclusion product-free sets. The question of how many finite groups contain such sets of a specific size has been a subject of classification efforts.\n\nA key result in this area comes from a 2015 paper by Anabanti and Hart, which proved a conjecture by Giudici and Hart. They demonstrated that if a group *G* contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3, then the order of the group, denoted as |*G*|, must be less than or equal to 24. This finding significantly narrows down the search for such groups to a finite number of cases.\n\nBy analyzing all groups with an order of 24 or less, a complete classification of those containing maximal product-free sets of size 3 was achieved. The research identified exactly 11 such non-isomorphic finite groups.\n\nThese 11 groups are:\n*   The cyclic groups of orders 7, 9, 12, 14, 20, and 24.\n*   The dihedral groups of orders 8, 10, 18, and 22.\n*   The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 with itself, C₃ x C₃.\n\nTherefore, there are 11 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<11>>>"
