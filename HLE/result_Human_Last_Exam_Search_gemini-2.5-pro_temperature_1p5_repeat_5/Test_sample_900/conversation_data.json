    "I am unable to provide a specific count of the \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Svetlana Gileva performed this role with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, and video descriptions indicate a recording of her performance was made on November 9, 2015, the video content itself is no longer available online. My search for alternative recordings of this specific performance has not been successful.\n\nTo accurately count the number of \"pas de Balanchines,\" a visual analysis of the performance is essential. Without access to the video footage of Svetlana Gileva's solo, it is impossible to provide a precise number. Reviews and promotional materials confirm her role and praise her technique, but do not contain the detailed choreographic information required to answer your question.\n\n<<<I am sorry, but I cannot answer your question as the video of the performance is not available for analysis.>>>"
