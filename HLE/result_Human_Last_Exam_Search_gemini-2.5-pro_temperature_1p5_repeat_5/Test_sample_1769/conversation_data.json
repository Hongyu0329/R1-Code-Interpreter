    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved into **\"swester\"** or **\"swuster\"**.\n\nThe original Old English word for a female sibling was `sweostor`, with dialectal variations such as `swuster`. The modern word \"sister\" is a result of the influence of the Old Norse word `systir`. This is particularly evident in the change of the vowel sound from `eo`/`u` to `i`.\n\nWithout the linguistic interchange with the Norse, `sweostor` would have followed a more typical path of English phonological development. The diphthong `eo` would likely have smoothed to `e`, and the unstressed final syllable `-or` would have probably reduced to `-er`, a common evolution for such endings. This would result in \"swester.\"\n\nAlternatively, the `swuster` variant, which was also present in Old English, particularly in the Mercian and West Saxon dialects, could have prevailed, leading to the modern form \"swuster.\" We see parallels in other Germanic languages that did not have the same Norse influence on this word; for example, the German word is *Schwester* and the Dutch is *zuster*, both of which are closer to the hypothetical \"swester\" or \"swuster\" than to \"sister\".\n\nTherefore, without the Norse contact that introduced the `i` vowel sound, English speakers today would most likely use a word derived directly from the native Old English form.\n\n<<<swester or swuster>>>"
