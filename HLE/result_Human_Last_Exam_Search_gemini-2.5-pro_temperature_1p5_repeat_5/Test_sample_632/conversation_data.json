    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" sported a unique architectural feature that was later removed: a pair of small bell towers. These towers, added in the 17th century and often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were colloquially known by the unflattering nickname \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears).\n\nThe bell towers were commissioned by Pope Urban VIII and were added to the front of the ancient temple in 1628. For over two and a half centuries, they were a distinctive, albeit much-criticized, element of the Pantheon's facade. However, a push to restore the Pantheon to its original appearance led to their demolition between 1881 and 1883.\n\nWhile the city administration did remove this feature, the removal occurred in the late 19th century, not in 1950 as the question states. Historical records and numerous sources consistently point to the 1881-1883 timeframe for the demolition of the towers. There is no evidence of a significant architectural feature being removed from the piazza in 1950. The removal of the bell towers remains the most significant alteration of this kind to the Pantheon, which is the centerpiece of the piazza.\n\n<<<The bell towers, known as \"the ass's ears\".>>>"
