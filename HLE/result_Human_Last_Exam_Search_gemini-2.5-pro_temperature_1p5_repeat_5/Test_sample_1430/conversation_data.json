    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus 3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, X = Sym¹⁵(C). We want to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted by ρ(X).\n\nThe 15th symmetric power of C, Sym¹⁵(C), is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. For a degree `d` greater than or equal to the genus `g`, the symmetric power Symᵈ(C) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety J(C) of C. In this case, d=15 and g=3, so the condition is satisfied. The map that realizes this fibration is the Abel-Jacobi map A₁₅: Sym¹⁵(C) → J(C).\n\nThe structure of the Néron-Severi group of Symᵈ(C) for d ≥ g is well-understood. It is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian and the group of integers, Z.\nNS(Sym¹⁵(C)) ≅ NS(J(C)) ⊕ Z.\n\nThis implies that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is given by:\nρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(J(C)).\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nFor a \"very general\" curve C of genus g, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian J(C) is simply the integers Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is of rank 1, generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, the minimum possible value for ρ(J(C)) is 1.\n\nThe smallest possible rank for ρ(X) is therefore:\nρ(X)ₘᵢₙ = ρ(J(C))ₘᵢₙ + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a complex variety is bounded by the Hodge number h¹¹ of that variety. For an abelian variety of dimension g, such as J(C), the Hodge number h¹¹ is equal to g². In our case, g=3, so the maximum possible rank for ρ(J(C)) is 3² = 9.\n\nAn abelian variety for which ρ = h¹¹ is called ρ-maximal. An abelian variety of dimension g is ρ-maximal if and only if it is isogenous to a product of g mutually isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM).\n\nFor genus 3, it is known that there exist curves whose Jacobians are isogenous to the product of three such CM elliptic curves. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, given by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. Its Jacobian is isogenous to E³, where E is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. Consequently, its Jacobian has the maximal Picard number, ρ(J(C)) = 9.\n\nIt has been shown that for abelian threefolds, the set of all possible Picard numbers is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}. This confirms that 9 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nThe largest possible rank for ρ(X) is therefore:\nρ(X)ₘₐₓ = ρ(J(C))ₘₐₓ + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2.\n*   The largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
