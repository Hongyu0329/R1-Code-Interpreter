**1) The exact residues from the human beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located within the hydrophobic Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) binding pocket on the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. While a definitive list with residue numbers is not consistently provided across all literature, these residues create a hydrophobic groove that accommodates the AID of the alpha-1 subunit. Key to this interaction are hydrophobic residues, likely including several leucine residues, that form the core of this pocket. 2) The exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for the fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties are largely the same residues within the GK domain that bind the AID. By binding to the AID, the beta-1 subunit influences the conformation of the alpha-1 subunit, including electrostatic interactions critical for open-state inactivation. Therefore, the residues in the AID-binding pocket are the primary sites for allosteric gating modulation.**
