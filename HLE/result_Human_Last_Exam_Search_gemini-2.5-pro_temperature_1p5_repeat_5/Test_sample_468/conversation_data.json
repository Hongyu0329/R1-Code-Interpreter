    "The common name for the genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)* in their native range of North America is \"fairy bee\". This name is widely used in both scientific and public contexts to refer to the bees in this large genus, which are known for their small size and often iridescent colors. The native range of these bees is concentrated in the desert regions of the United States and Mexico.\n\nWhile the genus was scientifically described by Frederick Smith in 1853, the exact year the common name \"fairy bee\" was coined is not well-documented in available resources. The Entomological Society of America began formally compiling a list of common names for insects in the early 20th century to standardize communication, and this list has grown and been revised over the decades. However, the specific origin of \"fairy bee\" as a common name for *Perdita* is not explicitly dated. The term is currently in wide use, as evidenced by its appearance in recent publications.\n\n<<<fairy bee, unknown>>>"
