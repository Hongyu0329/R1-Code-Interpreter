    "The provided FEN string, `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, describes a chess position where the white king is currently in check by the black rook on e1. As it is white's turn to move, the only legal move is to capture the checking piece.\n\nThe forced sequence of moves leading to a win for White is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rxe1**: This is White's only legal move, capturing the black rook on e1 that is checking the king. This move also clears the f1 square, which becomes crucial later. Black's optimal response is to move the king to h7 to evade the immediate checkmate threat on f7.\n    *   1... Kh7\n\n2.  **Qxf7+**: White proceeds with the attack. Black's only move is to retreat the king.\n    *   2... Kh8\n\n3.  **Ng6+**: This is a discovered check from the bishop on h5. Black is forced to capture the knight with the pawn.\n    *   3... hxg6\n\n4.  **Rf8+**: This powerful move forces the black king into the corner.\n    *   4... Kh7\n\n5.  **Qg8#**: White delivers checkmate.\n\nTherefore, White can win in 5 moves.\n\n<<<5>>>"
