    "The problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. On a toroidal board, the rows, columns, and diagonals wrap around the edges.\n\nThis problem can be solved by leveraging a known mathematical theorem concerning the n-queens problem on a toroidal board. Specifically, we can relate the number of ways to place 4 queens to the number of ways to place 5 queens.\n\n1.  **The n-Queens Completion Problem:** The problem of whether a partial arrangement of non-attacking queens can be completed to a full board of `n` non-attacking queens is a known area of study. For toroidal boards of size `n x n` where `n` is a prime number, a key theorem states that any configuration of `n-1` non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a full `n`-queen solution. For this problem, `n=5`, which is a prime number, so this theorem applies.\n\n2.  **Relating 4-Queen and 5-Queen Solutions:** The unique completability means that every valid arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board is a subset of exactly one valid 5-queen solution. Consequently, the total number of 4-queen solutions can be found by multiplying the number of 5-queen solutions by the number of ways to remove one queen from each solution.\n\n3.  **Number of 5-Queen Solutions on a 5x5 Toroidal Board:** The number of ways to place `n` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board is a well-documented figure. For a 5x5 board, the number of 5-queen solutions is 30.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Number of 5-queen solutions on a 5x5 toroidal board: 30\n    *   Each 5-queen solution can generate 5 distinct 4-queen solutions by removing one queen at a time.\n    *   Total number of 4-queen solutions = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5\n    *   Total number of ways = 30 × 5 = 150.\n\nTherefore, there are 150 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<150>>>"
