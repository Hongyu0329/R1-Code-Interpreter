    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), it acts as a bridging ligand connecting two ruthenium centers. The starting ruthenium complex, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, is chiral and can exist in either a Δ or Λ configuration at the metal center.\n\nThe reaction involves two equivalents of the ruthenium complex for each equivalent of the bridging ligand, forming a dinuclear complex. The resulting product has two chiral ruthenium centers. This leads to the formation of different stereoisomers.\n\nThe possible combinations of the chirality at the two ruthenium centers are:\n*   (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ), which are a pair of enantiomers and together constitute the racemic (*rac*) form.\n*   (Δ,Λ), which is an achiral *meso* form because it possesses a center of inversion.\n\nThese two forms, the *meso* and the *rac*, are diastereoisomers of each other. Experimental studies have confirmed that the reaction produces these two diastereoisomers, which can be separated by methods such as cation exchange chromatography. Therefore, two isomers (diastereomers) are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
