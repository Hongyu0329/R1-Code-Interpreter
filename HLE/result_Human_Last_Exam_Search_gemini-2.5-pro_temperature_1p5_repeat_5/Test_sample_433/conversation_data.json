    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules in a Sterile Environment\n\n**Once a single-dose glass ampule is broken open in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period.** This guideline is in place because an ampule is an open system that cannot be resealed, making it highly susceptible to microbial contamination after being opened.\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, which sets the standards for sterile compounding, opened single-dose ampules must not be stored. Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded immediately after the initial dose is withdrawn.\n\nWhile the guidelines for single-dose *vials*—which have a rubber stopper that can be resealed—allow for a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of up to 12 hours after the initial puncture in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, this does not apply to ampules. The critical distinction is that ampules, once opened, cannot maintain their sterility.\n\nRegulatory bodies and compounding standards from organizations such as the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) also align with this \"no storage\" policy for opened ampules. This immediate-use requirement ensures patient safety by minimizing the risk of contamination.\n\n<<<No storage is permitted; the contents must be used immediately.>>>"
