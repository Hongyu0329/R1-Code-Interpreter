    "The first step of searching for general information on circle packing and databases of optimal packings was successful. I found a relevant website by E. Specht that seems to contain the specific information needed. The search results also provided a good overview of Schoenflies notation. My initial plan to now search specifically for 1135 circles is still valid, and the Specht website will be the primary source. After that, I will determine the symmetry and provide the answer.The search results from E. Specht's website provide a page specifically for the packing of 1135 circles in a circle. While the page itself doesn't explicitly state the symmetry group, the main page for circle packings in a circle by the same author explains the notation. It states that if the symmetry group field is empty for a particular number, the symmetry is C1. I need to check the specific page for 1135 circles to see if the field is empty. I have also gathered general information about Schoenflies notation, which will be useful for the final answer.\n\n\nThe \"1135 circles in a circle\" page from E. Specht's website does not explicitly state the symmetry group. However, the main page of the same website, \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle,\" provides a legend for the data table. This legend specifies that if the \"symmetry group\" field is empty for a given number of circles, the packing has the symmetry element C1. Visiting the specific page for 1135 circles confirms that the symmetry group field is indeed empty. Therefore, based on the author's convention, the symmetry group is C1.I have successfully found the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by E. Specht, which appears to be the most comprehensive resource for this question. I've also found the specific page for 1135 circles. Critically, the main page of the website provides a legend indicating that if the symmetry group is not listed for a specific number, it should be considered C1. A final check of the 1135-circle page confirms the absence of a specified symmetry group. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1. According to the comprehensive database of \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by E. Specht, for cases where the symmetry group is not explicitly listed, it is by default C_1. The entry for 1135 circles on this database does not specify a symmetry group, thus implying it has C_1 symmetry.\n\nIn Schoenflies notation, the C_1 point group represents the lowest possible symmetry, containing only the identity element (no rotations, reflections, or inversions). This means the arrangement of the 1135 circles lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
