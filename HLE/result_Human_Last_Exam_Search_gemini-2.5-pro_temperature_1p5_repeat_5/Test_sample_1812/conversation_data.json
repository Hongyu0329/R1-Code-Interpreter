    "The determinant of the given matrix is calculated as follows:\n\nLet A be the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the formula:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the elements in each row is zero. This implies that the vector \\[1, 1, 1\\] is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. If a matrix has an eigenvalue of 0, its determinant must be 0.\n\nThe term \"Markov quiver\" relates to a specific area of mathematics concerning cluster algebras and representation theory. The provided matrix is associated with the Markov equation and can be considered a fundamental example in this context. However, the information about \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) does not alter the matrix itself for the purpose of this calculation. The question specifies the matrix to be used.\n\n<<<0>>>"
