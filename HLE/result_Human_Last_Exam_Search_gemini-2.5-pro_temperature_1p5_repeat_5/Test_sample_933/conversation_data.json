    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is most commonly synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases in a nickel vessel. According to multiple sources, this reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of 400°C to achieve an efficient yield. The reaction is exothermic and is represented by the chemical equation:\n\nXe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\nWhile a range of temperatures from 350°C to 450°C can be used, 400°C is the preferred and most frequently cited temperature for this synthesis. Some flow methods have utilized temperatures between 300-500°C, but these can lead to contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂). Temperatures significantly lower than this are noted to favor the formation of XeF₂ over XeF₄, and for a thermal reaction to occur at all, temperatures generally need to exceed 120°C. One source mentions a synthesis at 873 K (600°C) and 7 bar pressure to obtain good amounts of the compound.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the most well-documented and coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through the standard synthesis method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
