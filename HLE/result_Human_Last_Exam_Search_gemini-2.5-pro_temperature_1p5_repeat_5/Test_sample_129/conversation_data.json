    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we can systematically classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 by their top-level structure. Any well-formed boolean expression can be parsed into a tree structure. We will count the number of true expressions for each possible root structure of the parse tree for an expression of length 5.\n\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`. All operators are left-associative.\n\nAn expression `E` of length 5 must belong to one of the following categories, based on its outermost structure:\n1.  `(A)`: An expression enclosed in parentheses.\n2.  `!A`: The negation of an expression.\n3.  `A | B`: A disjunction of two expressions.\n4.  `A & B`: A conjunction of two expressions.\n\nWe will count the number of true expressions of length 5 in each category. This method ensures that we count each unique expression exactly once.\n\n### 1. Expressions of the form `(A)`\nFor `(A)` to have a length of 5 symbols, the inner expression `A` must have a length of 3. The expression `(A)` is true if and only if `A` is true. We need to find the number of true expressions of length 3.\n\nExpressions of length 3 can be of the form `!!L`, `(L)`, or `L1 op L2` (where `L`, `L1`, `L2` are `T` or `F`). Let's list all true expressions of length 3:\n*   `!!T` (evaluates to T)\n*   `(T)` (evaluates to T)\n*   `T&T` (evaluates to T)\n*   `T|T` (evaluates to T)\n*   `T|F` (evaluates to T)\n*   `F|T` (evaluates to T)\n\nThere are 6 true expressions of length 3. Therefore, there are 6 true expressions of length 5 of the form `(A)`: `(!!T)`, `((T))`, `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, and `(F|T)`.\n\n### 2. Expressions of the form `!A`\nFor `!A` to have a length of 5, the expression `A` must have a length of 4. The expression `!A` is true if and only if `A` is false. Thus, we need to count the number of false expressions of length 4.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of valid expressions of length 4 (`|S_4|`) and the number of true expressions of length 4 (`|T_4|`). The number of false expressions will then be `|F_4| = |S_4| - |T_4|`.\n\nAn expression of length 4 can have the structure `!A₃`, `(A₂)`, `A₁ op A₂`, or `A₂ op A₁`.\n*   `!A₃`: 12 expressions (since there are 12 expressions of length 3).\n*   `(A₂)`: 2 expressions (`(!T)`, `(!F)`).\n*   `A₁ op A₂`: 8 expressions (e.g., `T&!F`, `T|!T`).\n*   `A₂ op A₁`: 8 expressions (e.g., `!T&F`, `!T|T`).\n\nSo, `|S_4| = 12 + 2 + 8 + 8 = 30`.\n\nNow, we count the true expressions of length 4 (`|T_4|`):\n*   `!A₃`: True if `A₃` is false. There are 6 false expressions of length 3. (6)\n*   `(A₂)`: True if `A₂` is true. `!F` is the only true expression of length 2. (1)\n*   `A₁ op A₂`: `T&!F`, `T|!T`, `T|!F`, `F|!T`, `F|!F`. (5)\n*   `A₂ op A₁`: `!F&T`, `!T|T`, `!F|T`, `!F|F`. (4)\n\nSo, `|T_4| = 6 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 16`.\nThe number of false expressions of length 4 is `|F_4| = 30 - 16 = 14`.\nTherefore, there are 14 true expressions of length 5 of the form `!A`.\n\n### 3. Expressions of the form `A | B`\nFor `A | B` to be a length-5 expression, `len(A) + len(B) + 1 = 5`, or `len(A) + len(B) = 4`. Due to operator precedence, `A` and `B` cannot be disjunctions themselves.\n*   **len(A)=1, len(B)=3**: `L | A₃`. `A₃` cannot be of the form `X|Y`. There are 8 such expressions for `A₃`.\n    *   If `L=T`, the expression is always true. (8 expressions)\n    *   If `L=F`, `A₃` must be true. There are 3 such true expressions (`!!T`, `(T)`, `T&T`). (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 8 + 3 = 11.\n*   **len(A)=3, len(B)=1**: Symmetric to the previous case. Total: 11.\n*   **len(A)=2, len(B)=2**: `A₂ | B₂`. `A₂` and `B₂` are `!T` or `!F`.\n    *   True expressions: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3 expressions)\n\nTotal for `A|B`: 11 + 11 + 3 = 25.\n\n### 4. Expressions of the form `A & B`\nFor `A & B` to be a length-5 expression, `len(A) + len(B) = 4`. Due to operator precedence, `A` and `B` cannot be disjunctions or conjunctions themselves.\n*   **len(A)=1, len(B)=3**: `L & A₃`. `A₃` cannot be `X|Y` or `X&Y`. There are 4 such `A₃` (`!!T`, `!!F`, `(T)`, `(F)`). For the expression to be true, `L=T` and `A₃` must be true.\n    *   True `A₃` in this set: `!!T`, `(T)`. (2 expressions: `T&!!T`, `T&(T)`)\n*   **len(A)=3, len(B)=1**: Symmetric to the previous case. (2 expressions: `!!T&T`, `(T)&T`)\n*   **len(A)=2, len(B)=2**: `A₂ & B₂`. For the expression to be true, both `A₂` and `B₂` must be `!F`.\n    *   True expression: `!F&!F`. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for `A&B`: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n### Total Count\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   From `(A)`: 6\n*   From `!A`: 14\n*   From `A | B`: 25\n*   From `A & B`: 5\n\nTotal number of true expressions of length 5 is 6 + 14 + 25 + 5 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
