The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynmanâ€™s path integral formalism is $Z = \int_{\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)}^{\bar{\psi}(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}(0)} \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi}\mathcal{D}\psi \ e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$. The fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time interval $\tau \in [0, \beta]$, and $S_E$ is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system.
