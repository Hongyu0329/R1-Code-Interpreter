To relieve the second patch of its native amino acid and the negatively charged environment, the best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47-50 (Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate) is to mutate all four residues to Alanine. This would result in the sequence Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (AAAA) and would be achieved through the following site-directed mutations: S47A, E48A, E49A, and D50A.
