    "Based on a logical deduction process assuming fixed boundary conditions (where cells beyond the edge of the sequence are considered 0), the only potential solution for the intermediate step emerges from a unique set of constraints.\n\nThe evolution of an elementary cellular automaton is determined by a specific rule (out of 256 possible rules) that is applied at each step. By setting up a system of logical constraints, we can deduce the characteristics of the required rule and the resulting intermediate state. This analysis reveals a single candidate solution that fits the complex dependencies between the two known states.\n\nThe step-by-step logical deduction, though complex, points to a unique sequence for the intermediate step.\n\nThe only valid solution for the intermediate step is `00111101`.\n<<<00111101>>>"
