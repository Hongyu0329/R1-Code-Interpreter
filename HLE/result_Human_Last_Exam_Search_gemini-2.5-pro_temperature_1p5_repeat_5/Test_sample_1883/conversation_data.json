    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)`-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene yields two isomeric products, a `cis`-isomer (A) and a `trans`-isomer (B). Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory can be used to predict the stereochemical outcome and thus the ratio of these products.\n\n### Analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory:\n\n1.  **Reaction Type and Electron Count**: The reaction is an electrocyclization of a conjugated polyene, deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This molecule possesses four π-bonds, which means it is an 8π-electron system.\n\n2.  **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules**: According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal electrocyclic reactions, systems with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 for this 8π system) undergo a **conrotatory** ring closure. This means the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond.\n\n3.  **HOMO Symmetry**: In FMO theory, the stereochemistry of a thermal pericyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the π-system. For an 8π system like octatetraene, the HOMO is ψ₄. The key feature of the ψ₄ orbital is that the p-orbitals at the two termini of the conjugated system are out of phase with each other (one lobe points \"up\" while the corresponding lobe on the other end points \"down\"). To achieve constructive overlap and form a bonding sigma orbital, a conrotatory motion is required.\n\n4.  **Torquoselectivity (Steric Effects)**: While the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict the *mode* of rotation (conrotatory), they do not distinguish between the two possible conrotatory pathways (both clockwise vs. both counter-clockwise). This preference for one rotational direction over the other is known as **torquoselectivity**, and it is primarily governed by steric hindrance in the transition state. The bulky substituents at the termini will preferentially rotate outwards to minimize steric clash.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**:\n    *   The reactant is `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)`-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n    *   The reacting termini are C2 and C9.\n    *   At the C2 end, the double bond has a *Z* configuration, placing the terminal methyl group in an \"inward\" (or *endo*) position in the helical conformation required for cyclization.\n    *   At the C9 end, the double bond has an *E* configuration, placing the terminal methyl group in an \"outward\" (or *exo*) position.\n\n6.  **Predicting the Major Product**:\n    *   **Pathway 1 (Favored)**: The two terminal groups can undergo a conrotatory rotation where the bulky methyl groups both rotate *outward*. The \"inward\" methyl group at the Z-terminus rotates to become one face of the new ring, and the \"outward\" methyl group at the E-terminus also rotates to lie on the same face. This transition state is sterically favored as it minimizes repulsion. This specific rotation leads to the formation of the **cis-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene** (isomer A).\n    *   **Pathway 2 (Disfavored)**: The alternative conrotatory motion would require both bulky methyl groups to rotate *inward*. This would lead to significant steric repulsion in the transition state, making this pathway much higher in energy. This disfavored rotation would result in the formation of the *trans*-isomer (B).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on FMO theory and the principle of torquoselectivity, the conrotatory ring closure will proceed overwhelmingly via the pathway that minimizes steric hindrance. This favored pathway, involving the outward rotation of the terminal methyl groups, exclusively forms the *cis*-isomer (A). Experimental evidence confirms that this reaction is highly stereospecific, yielding *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene as the only observable product.\n\nTherefore, the product A (*cis*-isomer) is the major product, and the product B (*trans*-isomer) is formed in negligible amounts, if at all. The ratio of A to B is very high, approaching exclusivity for A.\n\n<<<A:B > 1 (A is the major product)"
