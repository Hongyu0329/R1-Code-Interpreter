    "**The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.**\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, was a featured speaker in one of the commercials. In the advertisement, he spoke about the importance of questioning assumptions to make progress.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on new trade theory, also had a connection to Enron. In 1999, he was paid $50,000 to serve on an advisory board for the company. He resigned from this position in the same year upon joining *The New York Times* due to their conflict-of-interest rules. While his association was in an advisory capacity and concluded before the \"Ask Why\" commercials aired in 2000, his connection to Enron is often cited in discussions of the company's efforts to build a prestigious image.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign is now remembered with bitter irony, as the company's massive fraud and subsequent collapse in 2001 revealed a stark contrast to the commercials' themes of innovation and inquiry.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman"
