    "The next number in the sequence is determined by applying the rule from the Collatz conjecture to the final number. The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, dictates that for any given number, the next term is generated by one of two rules: if the number is even, it is divided by 2, and if the number is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nThe final number in this sequence is 124. As 124 is an even number, the rule to apply is to divide it by 2.\n\n124 / 2 = 62\n\nMany of the numbers in the provided sequence are also found within the Collatz sequence starting with the number 27, which includes terms such as 41, 124, and 62. The repeated and seemingly out-of-order nature of the numbers in the given list appears to be a distraction from the underlying mathematical rule. By identifying the connection to the Collatz conjecture and applying its rules to the last term, the next number can be determined.\n\n<<<62>>>"
