    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q\\u00b3 - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\nMarket equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q*) and the price is the same for both. We find the equilibrium quantity (Q*) by setting the two price equations equal to each other:\nln(Q*\\u00b3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q*))\n\nThis equation is solved numerically to find the equilibrium quantity.\n\n**2. Consumer and Producer Surplus**\nOnce the equilibrium price (P*) and quantity (Q*) are found, the surpluses are calculated as follows:\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the economic benefit to consumers. It is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price level, integrated from Q=0 to Q*. The formula is:\n    CS = \\u222b[0 to Q*] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - P*) dQ\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the economic benefit to producers. It is the area between the equilibrium price level and the supply curve. The integration is performed over the domain of the supply function, which requires Q\\u00b3 - 2 > 0, or Q > \\u221b2. The formula is:\n    PS = \\u222b[\\u221b2 to Q*] (P* - ln(Q\\u00b3 - 2)) dQ\n\n**3. Calculation**\nUsing numerical methods to solve for the equilibrium and to perform the integrations, we find:\n*   Equilibrium Quantity (Q*) \\u2248 4.407\n*   Equilibrium Price (P*) \\u2248 4.869\n*   Consumer Surplus (CS) \\u2248 10.638\n*   Producer Surplus (PS) \\u2248 6.313\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses.\n\nTotal Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus \\u2248 10.638 + 6.313 \\u2248 16.951\n\n<<<16.951>>>"
