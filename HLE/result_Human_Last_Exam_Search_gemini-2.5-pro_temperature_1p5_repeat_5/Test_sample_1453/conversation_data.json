    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein coiled-coil sequence, we must first identify the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that defines its structure. Coiled coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `abcdefg`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, interacting through a \"knobs-into-holes\" packing mechanism. The specific amino acids at these 'a' and 'd' positions are primary determinants of the coiled-coil's oligomeric state (the number of helices in the bundle).\n\nThe sequence provided is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nTo decipher the oligomeric state, we must first establish the register of the heptad repeat by identifying the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:** The 'a' and 'd' positions are separated by two amino acids (`a-b-c-d`) and are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), or Alanine (A). By examining the sequence, we can find a recurring pattern of hydrophobic residues. Let's analyze the core of the sequence, which appears to have repeating segments.\n\n    The sequence contains three core repeating units:\n    *   `LKEIAKS` (starting at L7)\n    *   `LKEIAWS` (a variation starting at L14)\n    *   `LKEIAQS` (a variation starting at L21)\n\n2.  **Assigning 'a' and 'd' Positions:** Let's assign the `abcdefg` positions to this repeating `LKEIAKS` motif:\n    *   **L** K E **I** A K S\n    *   **a** b c **d** e f g\n\n    This assignment places Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position. Let's verify if this holds for the entire core sequence:\n    *   **Heptad starting at L7:** `L(a) K E I(d) A K S` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n    *   **Heptad starting at L14:** `L(a) K E I(d) A W S` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n    *   **Heptad starting at L21:** `L(a) K E I(d) A Q S` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n\n    The pattern of having Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position is consistent throughout the central, repeating part of the sequence.\n\n3.  **Determining Oligomeric State from 'a' and 'd' Residues:** Landmark studies on coiled-coil design have established rules that correlate the identity of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions with the resulting oligomeric state. These rules are based on the efficiency of the knobs-into-holes packing.\n    *   **Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' (`a=I, d=L`):** This arrangement favors the formation of a **dimer** (2 helices), as seen in the GCN4 protein.\n    *   **Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' (`a=I, d=I`):** This combination typically results in a **trimer** (3 helices).\n    *   **Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' (`a=L, d=I`):** This specific arrangement favors the formation of a **tetramer** (4 helices).\n\nSince the provided sequence consistently shows Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions, it fits the pattern for a tetrameric coiled-coil. The different branching structures of the Leucine and Isoleucine side chains create a specific packing geometry that is most stable in a four-helix bundle.\n\nBased on this analysis, the protein would have an oligomeric state of 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
