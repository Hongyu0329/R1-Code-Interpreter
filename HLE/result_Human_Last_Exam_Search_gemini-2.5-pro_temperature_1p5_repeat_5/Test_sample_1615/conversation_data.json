    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph is 12344.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n### 1. Chromatic Number and Its Bounds\n\nThe minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph G is called its chromatic number, denoted as χ(G). For any graph with *n* vertices, the chromatic number is between 1 and *n*. A simple greedy coloring algorithm shows that for any graph G, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1, where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of any vertex in G.\n\n### 2. Brooks' Theorem\n\nBrooks' Theorem provides a tighter upper bound for the chromatic number. It states that for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ, its chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the cases where G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is Δ + 1.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Constraints\n\nThe problem considers a graph *G* with *n* = 12345 vertices, with the condition that *G* is not the complete graph K₁₂₃₄₅.\n\n### 4. The Upper Bound\n\nSince the graph *G* is not a complete graph (K₁₂₃₄₅), there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them *u* and *v*, that are not connected by an edge. We can create a proper coloring of *G* using at most *n* - 1 colors. This can be done by assigning the same color to vertices *u* and *v*, and then assigning a unique color to each of the remaining *n* - 2 vertices. This results in a valid coloring using 1 + (*n* - 2) = *n* - 1 colors.\n\nTherefore, for any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices, the chromatic number is at most 12344.\n\n### 5. Achieving the Maximum\n\nTo show that 12344 is the maximum possible chromatic number, we need to demonstrate that there exists a graph *G* that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344. Consider the following two examples:\n\n*   **A graph with a large clique:** Let *G* be a graph composed of a complete graph on 12344 vertices (K₁₂₃₄₄) and one isolated vertex. This graph has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex. The chromatic number of this graph is determined by its largest component, the K₁₂₃₄₄, which requires 12344 colors. Thus, χ(G) = 12344.\n\n*   **A nearly complete graph:** Let *G* be the graph K₁₂₃₄₅ with a single edge removed. This graph is not complete. The two vertices from the removed edge are not adjacent and can be colored with the same color. The other 12343 vertices are all adjacent to each other and to the first two, requiring 12343 additional distinct colors. This gives a total of 1 + 12343 = 12344 colors. It is not possible to color this graph with fewer than 12344 colors because it contains a K₁₂₃₄₄ subgraph.\n\nBoth examples are non-complete graphs on 12345 vertices and both require 12344 colors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices can be colored with at most 12344 colors, and there exist such graphs that require exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
