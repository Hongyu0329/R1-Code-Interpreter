    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nVoznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (1970), which formed the libretto for the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" is based on the tragic love story of Rezanov and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of San Francisco. The opera is named after the two ships, *Juno* and *Avos*, which were part of the expedition led by Rezanov.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on March 8, 1807. The question of his final resting place, which Voznesensky's poem alludes to, has a complex history. His original grave was destroyed during the Soviet era. Although his remains were reburied, the definitive rediscovery and new memorialization of his grave took place later. On October 28, 2000, a service was held and a new memorial was dedicated at his grave in the Trinity churchyard in Krasnoyarsk, featuring a white cross with lines from Voznesensky's work.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
