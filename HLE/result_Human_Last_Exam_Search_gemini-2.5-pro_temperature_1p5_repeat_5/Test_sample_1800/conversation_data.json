    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). Research indicates that the optimal ratio is significantly different for each of these applications.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, a lower nickel content relative to ceria appears to enhance catalytic activity and stability. Studies have shown that high dispersion of nickel on the ceria support is a key factor.\n\nSeveral studies point towards a relatively low Ni/Ce ratio for optimal performance:\n*   A catalyst with the composition Ni_0.2_W_0.1_Ce_0.7_O_2_, which has a Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 1:3.5, exhibited high catalytic activity for the WGS reaction.\n*   Another study demonstrated that atomically dispersing 2.5 atomic % Ni in CeO_2_ creates a highly active and selective catalyst for the WGS reaction, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of about 1:39. This composition was effective in converting CO near equilibrium levels at 350°C without detectable methane formation.\n*   In the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been reported.\n*   Other research on Ni/CeO_2_ catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt % found no significant difference in the initiation temperature of the WGS reaction, though CO conversion rates at 400°C were nearly identical for 10 and 12.5 wt % Ni.\n\nOverall, for the WGS reaction, a lower Ni/Ce ratio is generally favored to ensure high dispersion of Ni particles and prevent side reactions like methanation.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn contrast to the WGS reaction, a higher nickel content is generally beneficial for the catalytic performance in water splitting, particularly for the more challenging Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\nKey findings for the optimal Ni/Ce ratio in water splitting include:\n*   Electrocatalysts with Ni/Ce atomic ratios of **3:1 (Ni_75_Ce_25_O_x_) and 1:1 (Ni_50_Ce_50_O_x_)** were found to have the highest OER activities. These catalysts exhibited lower Tafel slopes and greater stability, with the Ni_75_Ce_25_O_x_ catalyst showing stable performance for over 100 hours. The enhanced performance is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n*   Computational studies have suggested that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** show more favorable adsorption energy for the water-splitting reaction.\n*   For the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), one study found an optimal **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2**, which translates to a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2. However, the OER is typically the rate-limiting step in overall water splitting.\n*   Another study focusing on water oxidation found that a **95:5 Ni:Ce molar ratio** in the deposition solution provided the best performance.\n\nIn summary, for water splitting, particularly for the OER, a higher Ni/Ce ratio, such as **3:1 or 1:1**, is considered ideal for maximizing catalytic activity.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a lower Ni/Ce ratio (e.g., 1:3.5 or even as low as 1:39) is generally preferred to maximize performance and selectivity. Conversely, for water splitting, a higher Ni/Ce ratio, specifically around 3:1 or 1:1, is ideal for enhancing the catalytic activity for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).>>>"
