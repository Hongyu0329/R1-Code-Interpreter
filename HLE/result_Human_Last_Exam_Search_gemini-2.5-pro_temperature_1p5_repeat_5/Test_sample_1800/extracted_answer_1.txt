The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a lower Ni/Ce ratio (e.g., 1:3.5 or even as low as 1:39) is generally preferred to maximize performance and selectivity. Conversely, for water splitting, a higher Ni/Ce ratio, specifically around 3:1 or 1:1, is ideal for enhancing the catalytic activity for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).
