    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the structure of this group and its power subgroups.\n\n### The Semidihedral Group SD_512\n\nThe semidihedral group of order `2^n`, denoted `SD_2^n`, is given by the presentation:\n`SD_2^n = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>`\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have `512 = 2^9`, so `n=9`. The group, which we will call `G`, has the presentation:\n`G = SD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^7 - 1) = r^127>`\n\nThe elements of `G` are of the form `r^i` for `0 ≤ i < 256` or `sr^i` for `0 ≤ i < 256`.\n\n### Power Subgroups\n\nA subgroup `H` of `G` is a power subgroup if there exists an integer `k` such that `H` is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in `G`. This is denoted as `G^k = <{g^k | g ∈ G}>`.\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set `{ G^k | k ∈ Z }`.\n\n#### Case 1: `k` is an odd integer\n\nLet `k` be an odd integer. We examine the generators of `G^k`.\n1.  For elements of the form `r^i`, their `k`-th powers are `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`. Since `k` is odd, `gcd(k, 256) = 1`. Therefore, the subgroup generated by `{r^(ik) | 0 ≤ i < 256}` is `<r>`, the cyclic subgroup of order 256.\n2.  For the element `s`, its `k`-th power is `s^k = s` since `s^2 = 1` and `k` is odd.\n\nThe subgroup `G^k` contains `<r>` and `s`. Since `r` and `s` are the generators of `G`, the subgroup generated by them is `G` itself. Thus, for any odd `k`, `G^k = G`. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n#### Case 2: `k` is an even integer\n\nLet `k = 2^a * m`, where `a ≥ 1` and `m` is an odd integer.\nFor any element `g ∈ G`, its order `|g|` is a power of 2. Since `m` is odd, `gcd(m, |g|) = 1`. This implies that the map `x ↦ x^m` is a bijection on `G`. Consequently, the set of `m`-th powers `{g^m | g ∈ G}` is equal to the set `G`.\nTherefore, `G^k = G^(2^a * m) = <{g^(2^a * m) | g ∈ G}> = <{(g^m)^(2^a) | g ∈ G}>`. Since `{g^m | g ∈ G} = G`, this simplifies to `G^k = <{h^(2^a) | h ∈ G}> = G^(2^a)`.\n\nThis shows that the power subgroup `G^k` is determined solely by the power of 2 that divides `k`. We only need to compute the distinct subgroups `G^(2^a)` for `a ≥ 1`.\n\nLet's compute the generators for `G^(2^a)` where `a ≥ 1`.\n1.  For elements `r^i`: `(r^i)^(2^a) = r^(i * 2^a)`. These generate the subgroup `<r^(2^a)>`.\n2.  For elements `sr^i`: We first compute `(sr^i)^2`. From the relation `srs = r^127`, we derive `sr = r^127 * s`. So, `sr^i s^(-1) = (srs^(-1))^i = (r^127)^i = r^(127i)`.\n    Then `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i * sr^i = (sr^i s) * r^i = (r^(127i)) * r^i = r^(128i)`.\n    Now, for `a ≥ 1`:\n    `(sr^i)^(2^a) = ((sr^i)^2)^(2^(a-1)) = (r^(128i))^(2^(a-1)) = r^(128 * i * 2^(a-1)) = r^(i * 2^7 * 2^(a-1)) = r^(i * 2^(a+6))`.\n    The subgroup generated by these elements is `<r^(2^(a+6))>`.\n\nCombining these, `G^(2^a) = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(2^(a+6))> >`. Since `a ≥ 1`, `a+6 > a`, which means `<r^(2^(a+6))>` is a subgroup of `<r^(2^a)>`. Therefore, the subgroup they generate is simply `<r^(2^a)>`.\n\nSo, for `a ≥ 1`, the power subgroup `G^(2^a)` is the cyclic subgroup `<r^(2^a)>`.\n\n### Counting the Distinct Power Subgroups\n\nWe can now list all the distinct power subgroups:\n*   For `k` odd (`a=0`): `G^1 = G`.\n*   For `a = 1`: `G^2 = <r^2>` (order 128).\n*   For `a = 2`: `G^4 = <r^4>` (order 64).\n*   For `a = 3`: `G^8 = <r^8>` (order 32).\n*   For `a = 4`: `G^16 = <r^{16}>` (order 16).\n*   For `a = 5`: `G^32 = <r^{32}>` (order 8).\n*   For `a = 6`: `G^64 = <r^{64}>` (order 4).\n*   For `a = 7`: `G^128 = <r^{128}>` (order 2).\n*   For `a = 8`: `G^256 = <r^{256}> = {1}` (the trivial subgroup).\n\nThese are `1 + 8 = 9` distinct subgroups, as they all have different orders.\n\nThere are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
