The second coefficient, `a₂`, in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is given by a combination of terms involving the curvature tensors of the manifold and the square of the gauge field strength. A general expression found in the literature for a Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field is `a_2(D) = Tr[ (1/12) Y_{μν} Y^{μν} + (1/6) (R/2 + ∇^μ Ω_μ + Ω^μ Ω_μ ) * (R/6 * mathbb{1}) + (1/2) * (R/6 * \mathbb{1})^2 ]`, where `Y_{μν}` is the curvature of the gauge connection and `Ω_μ` is the spin connection term. For a minimally coupled U(1) gauge field, a more specific form often cited is `a_2 = (1/360) * (5R^2 - 2R_{μν}R^{μν} + 2R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) * \mathbb{1} + (1/2) * C_{μνρσ} C^{μνρσ} * \mathbb{1} + (1/12) F_{μν} F^{μν} * \mathbb{1}` where `C_{μνρσ}` is the Weyl tensor and `F_{μν}` is the gauge field strength.
