    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, g(r₁, r₂, t₁, t₂), describes the probability of detecting a neutron at position r₁ at time t₁, given that a neutron was detected at position r₂ at time t₂. In the context of nuclear reactor analysis, this correlation is experimentally measured by analyzing the fluctuating signals from two neutron detectors.\n\nThe process to arrive at the CPSD involves two Fourier transforms:\n\n1.  **Temporal Fourier Transform:** The correlation between the detector signals as a function of the time difference (t₁ - t₂) is calculated. A Fourier transform with respect to this time difference converts the time-domain correlation function into a frequency-domain function. This relationship is fundamental in signal processing, where the Fourier transform of a cross-correlation function yields the cross-power spectral density.\n\n2.  **Spatial Fourier Transform:** The dependence of the correlation on the spatial separation of the detectors (r₁ - r₂) is also considered. A Fourier transform with respect to this spatial variable results in a function in the spatial frequency (wavevector) domain. Reactor noise analysis literature discusses space-dependent cross-spectral density functions, which are derived from such theoretical considerations.\n\nWhen the two points in the pair correlation function are identical (r₁ = r₂), the function is an autocorrelation function, and its Fourier transform is known as the **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)**. However, since the query refers to the *generalized* pair correlation function, which allows for two distinct points, the Cross-Power Spectral Density is the more general and fitting term. The CPSD provides crucial information about the dynamics and stability of the neutron population within a nuclear reactor.\n\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density>>>"
