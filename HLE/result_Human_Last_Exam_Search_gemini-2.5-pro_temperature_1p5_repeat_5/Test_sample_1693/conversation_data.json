    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **Athos**.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, and took effect on June 25, 1940. In the period leading up to the armistice, several French vessels were lost to U-boat attacks.\n\nThe largest of these was the oil tanker *Athos*, with a displacement of 13,444 tons. It was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat U-70 on December 9, 1939, while on a voyage from Port-de-Bouc to Donges.\n\nAnother significant loss was the steam tanker *Brumaire*, with a tonnage of 7,638 tons. On June 19, 1940, it was damaged by a torpedo from U-boat U-25 and was subsequently sunk by German aircraft the following day off Belle-ÃŽle. While its sinking was completed by aircraft, the initial and decisive blow was struck by a U-boat.\n\nThe French Navy also lost the submarine *Doris* on May 9, 1940, sunk by the German U-boat U-9. The *Doris* had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons.\n\n<<<Athos>>>"
