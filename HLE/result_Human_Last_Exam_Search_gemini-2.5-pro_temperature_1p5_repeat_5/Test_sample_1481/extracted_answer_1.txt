The leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s') in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation |s′−s| approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion: H(s,s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ + O((s' - s)⁴). In this expression, the leading term, -|s' - s|, represents the behavior on a flat boundary (zero curvature). The first and most significant correction term, (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³, directly incorporates the influence of the boundary's local geometry through its curvature, κ(s). This term illustrates the nuanced interplay where the geometric curvature introduces a third-order perturbation to the generating function, thereby fundamentally altering the symplectic structure of the billiard map from the trivial case and governing the stability and nature of trajectories near the boundary.
