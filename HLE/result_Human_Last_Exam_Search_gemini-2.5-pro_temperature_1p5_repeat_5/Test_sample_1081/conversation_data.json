    "The problem asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are the maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, where $\\sigma$ is the Frobenius endomorphism acting on $W$.\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. We can assume that $G$ is a split group, which means that there is a maximal torus $T$ in $G$ that is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and splits over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n\nAccording to the mathematical literature, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112. This number has been determined by R. Carter in 1972.\n\nThus, for a split reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is 112.\n\nIf the group $G$ is not split, it is a twisted form of the split group. The Frobenius endomorphism $\\sigma$ acts on the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$. Since the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, any twisted form of $E_8$ is an inner form. This means that the Frobenius action on the Weyl group is induced by an inner automorphism, which is conjugation by an element of the Weyl group.  The number of twisted conjugacy classes for an inner twist is the same as the number of ordinary conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, for any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
