    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from the 16th to the 19th bayt (verse).\n\nThe enumeration of the twenty-five prophets begins in the 16th verse and concludes in the 19th. The verses are as follows:\n\n**Starting Bayt (16):**\nهُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسٌ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ ¤ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih, and Ibrahim, each one followed)\n\n**Ending Bayt (19):**\nإِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ¤ عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the final one, leave falsehood.)\n\nThese four couplets list the prophets whose names are considered obligatory for a Muslim to know in this particular theological text. The preceding verse serves as an introduction to this list, and the subsequent verse is a prayer for all of them.\n\n<<<From the 16th bayt to the 19th bayt.>>>"
