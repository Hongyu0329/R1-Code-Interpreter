    "The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval is calculated by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function, ψn(x), for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a' is given by:\n`ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wave function:\n`P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n\nFor this problem, the quantum state is n = 2, and the interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a. The probability (P) is the integral of the probability density over this interval:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\nThe center of this interval is at x = 0.5a. For the n=2 state, this point is a node, meaning the wave function and the probability density are zero. Since the interval is very small and centered around a node, we expect the probability to be very small.\n\nTo solve the integral, a common trigonometric identity, `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`, is used. Applying this, the integral becomes:\n`P = (1/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n\nEvaluating this integral gives:\n`P = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)]` evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nDue to the small interval, we can use an approximation by expanding the sine function. The calculation leads to:\n`P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n\nThis results in a probability of approximately:\n`P ≈ 0.00000658` or `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\nThis very low probability confirms the expectation that there is a minimal chance of finding the particle in a small interval around a node.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
