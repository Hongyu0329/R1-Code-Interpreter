    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk. The film includes a notable ballet sequence set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the two Luxor Obelisks is located.\n\nThe film, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, was primarily filmed on Hollywood soundstages. However, it incorporates elaborate set designs and backdrops inspired by famous Parisian locations and the works of French painters. One of these sequences is a passionate dance between the lead characters around a fountain in a set designed to evoke the Place de la Concorde. A model of the fountain at the Place de la Concorde was used in the film's production to plan the complex choreography and camera movements for this scene. The final ballet also begins with a backdrop inspired by Raoul Dufy's painting of the iconic square.\n\nWhile the earlier Best Picture winner, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), is set in Paris, there is no evidence that it contains any scenes depicting the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Obelisk. Later Best Picture winner *Gigi* (1958) was also filmed in Paris, but its notable locations did not include the Place de la Concorde.\n\nTherefore, *An American in Paris* stands as the first Best Picture Oscar winner to showcase the famous ancient Egyptian monument on-screen.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
