In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. The specific functional form is G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure proper time-ordering.
