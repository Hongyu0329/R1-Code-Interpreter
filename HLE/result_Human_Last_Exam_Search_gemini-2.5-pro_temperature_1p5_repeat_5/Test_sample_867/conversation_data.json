    "I am unable to provide a specific number of sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake* choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Svetlana Zakharova danced the lead role in this specific production, a video of the complete Act II Odette variation is not publicly available for analysis. Reviews and articles from the time praise her technical abilities but do not offer a detailed choreographic breakdown of the number of specific steps, such as sissone fermes.\n\nTherefore, without a visual record of the performance, a precise count of the requested ballet step cannot be determined.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
