    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. This is based on a specific, complex nanocar molecule with the chemical formula C430H274O12.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" in chemistry indicates that all of the hydrogen atoms in a molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, in a perfluorinated version of this particular nanocar, the 274 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is important to note that \"nanocar\" is a general term for a class of molecules, and different nanocars have different chemical structures and formulas. For instance, a simpler nanocar has the formula C310H34, and its perfluorinated version would hypothetically contain 34 fluorine atoms. However, using the more complex and explicitly cited formula provides a more specific hypothetical answer.\n\n<<<274>>>"
