    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, along with an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe key to minimizing memory usage is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Since we only need to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4', we can read the input character by character and update our counts immediately. This stream-based processing eliminates the need for a large input buffer.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the Xenia and the Sum problem in a memory-efficient way.\n * It reads the input sum character by character, counting the occurrences of each\n * number (1, 2, 3, 4) without storing the entire string. It then prints the\n * numbers in non-decreasing order to form a new sum that Xenia can calculate.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // An array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    int counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variables for processing and looping.\n    int c;              // Holds the character read by getchar(), as an int to handle EOF.\n    int i, j;           // Loop counters.\n    int is_first = 1;   // Flag to manage printing the '+' separator.\n\n    // Read input character by character until a newline or end-of-file is found.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // If the character is a digit, increment the corresponding counter.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Construct and print the new sum.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // For the very first number, don't print a '+' before it.\n            if (is_first) {\n                printf(\"%d\", i + 1);\n                is_first = 0; // Unset the flag after the first number is printed.\n            } else {\n                // For all subsequent numbers, print a '+' first.\n                printf(\"+%d\", i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Analysis\n\nThe total memory (`m`) used by the variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes:\n\n1.  `int counts[4]`: This array stores the frequencies of the four numbers.\n    *   `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes`\n2.  `int c`: This variable stores the character being read from the input stream. It is an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` (End-of-File) value.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int) = 4 bytes`\n3.  `int i`, `int j`: These are used as loop counters.\n    *   `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8 bytes`\n4.  `int is_first`: This flag is used to control the printing of the `+` symbol.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int) = 4 bytes`\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables:\n\nm = 16 + 4 + 8 + 4 = **32 bytes**\n\n<<<32>>>"
