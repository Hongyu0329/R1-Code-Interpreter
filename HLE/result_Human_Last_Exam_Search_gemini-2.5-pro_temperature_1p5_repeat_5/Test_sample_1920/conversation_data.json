    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**\n    First, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\n    $53599 = 7 \\times 7657 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 589 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    Let $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$. The conductor $d$ is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n2.  **Conditions for a primitive character of conductor `d`**\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$.\n    For $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character $\\chi_i$ is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial. This means that for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, $\\chi_i$ must not be the principal character.\n\n3.  **Condition on the order of the character**\n    The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_i = \\operatorname{order}(\\chi_i)$. We require $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n    Since the lcm is 6, the order $k_i$ of each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6. As $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, $k_i > 1$. Therefore, the possible orders for each $k_i$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n4.  **Counting available characters for each prime factor**\n    The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$, and 0 otherwise.\n    We check the values of $p_i-1$ for each prime factor of $d$:\n    *   $p_1-1 = 7-1=6$\n    *   $p_2-1 = 13-1=12$\n    *   $p_3-1 = 19-1=18$\n    *   $p_4-1 = 31-1=30$\n\n    For an order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, we check if it divides each $p_i-1$:\n    *   $k=2$: divides 6, 12, 18, 30. So, characters of order 2 exist for all $p_i$. The number is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   $k=3$: divides 6, 12, 18, 30. So, characters of order 3 exist for all $p_i$. The number is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   $k=6$: divides 6, 12, 18, 30. So, characters of order 6 exist for all $p_i$. The number is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n    For each prime factor $p_i$, the number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is the sum of the counts for orders 2, 3, and 6:\n    Number of choices for each $\\chi_i = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n5.  **Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n    We need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ has order $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, and $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)=6$.\n\n    The total number of ways to choose one character for each prime factor $p_i$ with an order dividing 6 (and greater than 1) is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n    Now, we subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6. The lcm of the orders is not 6 if the orders are all divisors of 2 or all divisors of 3.\n    *   Case 1: The lcm is a divisor of 3. This means that for each $i$, the order $k_i$ must be 3 (since it must be odd and greater than 1). The number of characters of order 3 for each prime is $\\phi(3)=2$. So there are $2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n    *   Case 2: The lcm is a divisor of 2. This means that for each $i$, the order $k_i$ must be 2 (since it must not be a multiple of 3). The number of characters of order 2 for each prime is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there are $1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n\n    The set of combinations where the lcm divides 2 and the set where it divides 3 are disjoint (since one requires orders to be only 2, and the other requires orders to be only 3). So, the number of combinations where the lcm is not 6 is the sum of these two cases: $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\n    The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the lcm is not 6:\n    Number = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
