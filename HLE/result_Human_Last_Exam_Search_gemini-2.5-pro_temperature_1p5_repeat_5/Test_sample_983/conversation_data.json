    "The next number in the sequence is 4032.\n\nThe provided sequence is a bit of a trick. While all the initial numbers are multiples of 6, the underlying pattern is revealed by the final number. The number 2352 is part of the sequence defined by the formula a(n) = n⁴ - n².\n\nLet's test this formula:\n*   For n=2, a(2) = 2⁴ - 2² = 16 - 4 = 12\n*   For n=3, a(3) = 3⁴ - 3² = 81 - 9 = 72\n*   For n=4, a(4) = 4⁴ - 4² = 256 - 16 = 240\n*   For n=5, a(5) = 5⁴ - 5² = 625 - 25 = 600\n*   For n=6, a(6) = 6⁴ - 6² = 1296 - 36 = 1260\n*   For n=7, a(7) = 7⁴ - 7² = 2401 - 49 = 2352.\n\nThe last number in your sequence, 2352, corresponds to n=7 in this formula. The long list of preceding numbers appears to be a distraction.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we calculate the value for n=8:\n*   For n=8, a(8) = 8⁴ - 8² = 4096 - 64 = 4032.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 4032.\n\n<<<4032>>>"
