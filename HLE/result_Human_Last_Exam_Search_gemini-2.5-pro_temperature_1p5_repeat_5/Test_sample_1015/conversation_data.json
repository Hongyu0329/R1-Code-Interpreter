    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. This difference is rooted in the foundational principles of each ballet technique.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. The training focuses on developing strength in the back and precision in every movement, with a clear and codified use of épaulement (the turning of the shoulders and head). When executing a cambré derrière, a Vaganova-trained dancer strives to keep the hips square to the direction they are facing, creating a pure backward bend from the spine. The movement is initiated from the upper back, and attention is given to the correct placement of the head to create a continuous and elegant line.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long lines. A characteristic of the Balanchine style is a more open placement of the hips, particularly noticeable in arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is allowed to open towards the audience. This principle often extends to the cambré derrière, where the hip can be less squared to achieve a greater sense of amplitude and a more dynamic line. This less restricted hip placement can also contribute to the appearance of a deeper or more extreme backbend.\n\nWhile there are also differences in the speed of movement and the styling of the arms (port de bras), the fundamental approach to hip placement is a significant and defining technical variation between the two methods in this particular step. The Balanchine style often encourages a \"more is more\" approach, with deeper pliés and more expansive movements, which contrasts with the Vaganova method's emphasis on precise alignment and control.\n\n<<<B>>>"
