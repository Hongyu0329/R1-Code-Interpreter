    "Following the rules of the elementary cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule for 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is `1111101110001`.\n\nRule 110 determines the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule set is as follows, where '1' represents an active cell and '0' a quiescent one:\n\n| Current Pattern (Left, Center, Right) | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nThis rule is also represented by the binary sequence `01101110`, which corresponds to the decimal number 110.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern from a single '1' for 20 steps is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 0:** 1\n*   **Step 1:** 11\n*   **Step 2:** 111\n*   **Step 3:** 1101\n*   **Step 4:** 11111\n*   **Step 5:** 110001\n*   **Step 6:** 1110011\n*   **Step 7:** 11010111\n*   **Step 8:** 111110101\n*   **Step 9:** 1100011111\n*   **Step 10:** 1110010001\n*   **Step 11:** 11010110011\n*   **Step 12:** 11111011011\n*   **Step 13:** 11000110101\n*   **Step 14:** 11100111111\n*   **Step 15:** 11010100001\n*   **Step 16:** 111111100011\n*   **Step 17:** 1100001100111\n*   **Step 18:** 1110001110101\n*   **Step 19:** 1101001011111\n*   **Step 20:** 1111101110001\n\n<<<1111101110001>>>"
