    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat can be calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion. This method involves performing calculations in `d = d_c - ε` dimensions, where `d_c` is the upper critical dimension, and then treating ε as a small expansion parameter.\n\nFor a system described by the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ theory (which includes the Ising model as a special case), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The spatial dimension given is `d = 3`, therefore `ε = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n\nThe epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α, to the first order in ε, is given by the formula:\n\n`α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ε`\n\nHere, `n` is the number of components of the order parameter. For the Ising universality class, the order parameter is a scalar, so `n=1`.\n\nSubstituting the values `n=1` and `ε=1` into the formula, we get:\n\n`α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1`\n`α = 3 / (2 * 9)`\n`α = 3 / 18`\n`α = 1/6`\n\nThus, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent α for a system in the Ising universality class at d=3 is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
