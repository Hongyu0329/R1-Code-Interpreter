    "In the framework of large deviation theory, the principles of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff provide a rigorous foundation for understanding the emergence of equilibrium thermodynamic properties from statistical mechanics. These theorems establish that the probability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from equilibrium is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is, therefore, the most probable macroscopic state, corresponding to the minimum of a \"rate function\".\n\n**1. Connection to Statistical Mechanics and Equilibrium**\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem** deals with the large deviations of an empirical measure. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the distribution of particles over energy states. The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular empirical distribution ν, when the true underlying distribution is ρ, is approximately `exp[-n * D(ν||ρ)]`, where `D(ν||ρ)` is the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). Minimizing this rate function is equivalent to finding the distribution ν that is \"closest\" to ρ.\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle**, which predates Sanov's theorem, connects the entropy (S) of a macrostate to the number of microstates (W) that compose it, via the formula `S = k * log(W)`, where k is the Boltzmann constant. Sanov's theorem provides a formal justification for this, as the configuration with the highest W is the most probable one. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes this entropy under the system's physical constraints.\n\n*   **Cramér's Theorem** concerns the large deviations of an empirical average of independent, identically distributed random variables. In this context, it can be applied to understand fluctuations of extensive quantities like the total energy. The equilibrium value of such a quantity is the one corresponding to the most probable state, which minimizes the large deviation rate function.\n\n**2. The System: Bose Case of Light Quanta (Photon Gas)**\n\nFor a gas of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium within a cavity (black-body radiation), we have two key properties:\n1.  Photons are bosons and thus obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n2.  The number of photons is not conserved, as they are continuously absorbed and emitted by the cavity walls. This leads to the crucial condition that their chemical potential (µ) is zero in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n**3. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we use the principle of maximum entropy, as justified by the large deviation framework. We seek the distribution of photons over energy levels `ε` that maximizes the statistical entropy `S = k * log(W)` subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy `E`.\n\nThe number of ways `W` to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable bosons among `g_i` states at energy level `ε_i` is given by:\n`W = Π_i (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)`\n\nMaximizing `log(W)` subject to the constraint `Σ_i n_i * ε_i = E` (and with µ=0) leads to the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number of a state with energy ε:\n\n`<n_ε> = 1 / (exp(ε / kT) - 1)`\n\nThis is the **Planck distribution**, which describes the equilibrium distribution of photons in black-body radiation. This distribution represents the most probable macroscopic state, whose overwhelmingly high probability is quantified by the large deviation theorems.\n\n**4. Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy `E` of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each mode multiplied by its average occupation number over the density of states `g(ε)`. For photons in a volume `V`, the density of states is `g(ε) = (8πV / (hc)³) * ε²`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n`E = ∫<n_ε> * ε * g(ε) dε = (8πV / (hc)³) ∫ ε³ / (exp(ε / kT) - 1) dε`\n\nSolving this integral yields:\n\n`E = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\nThis is the celebrated **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**. The mean energy of the photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature `T`. This value `E` is the equilibrium mean energy because it is the average energy corresponding to the most probable (Planck) distribution.\n\n**5. Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nSimilarly, the equilibrium entropy `S` can be calculated from the Planck distribution using the standard formula for the entropy of a Bose gas.\n\n`S = (E + PV) / T = (E + E/3) / T = 4E / 3T`\n\n(Here we have used the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, `P = E / 3V`).\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium value for `E` from the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the equilibrium entropy:\n\n`S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`\n\nThe entropy is proportional to the volume and the cube of the absolute temperature. These values for `E` and `S` represent the equilibrium state of the photon gas as determined through the application of the maximum probability principle, which is formally described by the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff.\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium mean energy is `E = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`, and the equilibrium entropy is `S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`.\n>>>"
