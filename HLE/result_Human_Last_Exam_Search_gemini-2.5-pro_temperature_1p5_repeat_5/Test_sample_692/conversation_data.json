    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the Zapotec glyph for \"1 Earthquake\". This significant artifact is found on Monument 3 at the archaeological site of San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico.\n\nThe monument, a carved stone depicting a sacrificed captive, features two glyphs between the figure's legs that are interpreted as his name, based on the 260-day ritual calendar. While there had been debate regarding the precise age of the monument, with some earlier estimates placing it around 500-600 BCE and others suggesting a much later date, more recent archaeological work has provided a more secure timeframe.\n\nRadiocarbon dating has established a firm chronological context for Monument 3. The stone was discovered in a corridor, positioned stratigraphically above a charcoal layer dated to around 720 BCE and beneath a layer containing hearths dated to 630 BCE and 560 BCE. This evidence places the carving of the monument, and thus the recording of the \"1 Earthquake\" date, no later than about 600 BCE, making it the oldest known writing with a specific date in the Americas.\n\nThis Zapotec record predates other early examples of dated writing in Mesoamerica. For instance, Olmec artifacts from around 650 BCE bear glyphs, but their interpretation as specific dates is not as clear as the Zapotec example. The earliest known dates using the Long Count calendar system, such as the 36 BCE date on a stela from Chiapa de Corzo, are several centuries younger than the date on Monument 3.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\", from Monument 3 at San José Mogote, dating to approximately 600 BCE.>>>"
