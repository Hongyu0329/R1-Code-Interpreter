    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2. These groups are categorized based on their symmetry properties, and their point groups describe their rotational and reflectional symmetries, while ignoring translational movements.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups are:\n*   **p2**: This group's point group is **C2**, which has an order of 2. It contains a 180-degree rotation (a half-turn) and the identity operation.\n*   **pm**: The point group for pm is **D1**, which is also of order 2. This group includes a reflection and the identity.\n*   **pg**: Similar to pm, the point group for pg is **D1**. Its symmetry is defined by a glide reflection, but its point group only considers the reflection component.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group **D1**. It features reflections along parallel axes.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For instance, p1 has a point group of order 1, while groups like pmm, pmg, and pgg have point groups of order 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
