    "I am unable to definitively identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 based on the available search results.\n\nWhile the records confirm the existence of a town council, lay judges, and a head of the town known variously as a \"richtár\" (reeve or judge), \"šoltýs\" (scultetus), or \"villicus\" (mayor) in Bártfa during this period, the name of the specific individual holding the primary judicial office in 1461 is not mentioned in the searched documents.\n\nHistorical records from 1461 do show that the town council of Bardejov was active, as it was involved in a dispute with the town of Nowy Sącz. Furthermore, an invitation was sent to the \"lay judges in Bártfa\" in the same year, indicating a functioning judicial body.\n\nThe most promising source for this information appears to be the publication \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára, 1319–1526\" (The Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bardejov, 1319–1526), edited by B. Iványi. This collection of archival documents would likely contain the names of municipal officials for the year 1461. However, the content of this publication is not available in the search results.\n\nWithout access to these specific archives or a secondary source that directly cites them for the year 1461, it is not possible to provide the name of the judge.<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461.>>>"
