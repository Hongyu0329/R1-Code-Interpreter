    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger group of structures known as the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located in the posterior subesophageal mass of the cuttlefish brain. This complex plays a crucial role in controlling locomotion, including escape responses and inking.\n\nDetailed brain atlases and neuroanatomical studies of *Sepia* species have provided a clear understanding of the spatial arrangement of these lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is situated centrally within the posterior subesophageal mass. Positioned behind it are the posterior chromatophore lobes, which are involved in controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, fins, and the back of the head, and the fin lobes, which innervate the muscles of the fins. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the dwarf cuttlefish brain confirm this posterior positioning of the posterior chromatophore and fin lobes relative to the palliovisceral lobe. Additionally, vasomotor lobes are also located in this posterior region.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
