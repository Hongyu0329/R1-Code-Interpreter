    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, denoted as a(n) for an n-step walk, is a subject of significant interest in combinatorics and physics. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" in this context refers to a square lattice or grid.\n\nFor a self-avoiding walk on a square lattice, the number of possible walks for the first few steps are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n\nWhile there is no known simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, these numbers have been computed through various algorithms. For a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value of a(10) has been determined to be 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
