    "While Virgil's epic, the Aeneid, traverses both the mortal and mythological realms, a number of real-world rivers are mentioned alongside their mythical counterparts. The three longest of these terrestrial rivers are the Tiber, the Haliacmon, and the Acheloüs.\n\nThe most prominent river in the epic is the **Tiber**, the third-longest river in Italy. It flows for approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles) through the heart of Italy before emptying into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Tiber is central to the latter half of the Aeneid, as it is on its banks that Aeneas and the Trojans finally arrive to establish their new home.\n\nThe **Haliacmon** (or Aliakmonas) is the longest river that flows entirely within Greece. It has a total length of about 297 kilometers (185 miles). Though not as central to the Aeneid's narrative as the Tiber, its significance in the Greek world of the time makes it a noteworthy geographical marker.\n\nThe third longest is the **Acheloüs** (or Acheloos) River, also in western Greece, with a length of around 220 kilometers (137 miles). Like the Haliacmon, its presence in the epic is more peripheral, but it was a significant river in ancient Greece and is associated with a powerful river god in Greek mythology.\n\nIn addition to these real-world rivers, the Aeneid famously features several mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, which Aeneas encounters in his journey to the afterlife in Book VI. However, as these are mythical, their lengths are not quantifiable.\n\n<<<The three longest real-world rivers mentioned in the context of the Aeneid and its related mythology are the Tiber, Haliacmon, and Acheloüs.>>>"
