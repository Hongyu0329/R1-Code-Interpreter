Yes, the theory will not hold. The birefringent medium is described by a Jones matrix that couples the initial horizontal polarization state into the vertical polarization state. The original system and its inverse `T^-1` are scalar operators that act only on the spatial profile and preserve polarization. By adding birefringence, the system becomes a vector problem. The scalar inverse `T^-1` cannot undo the polarization mixing, causing the entire theoretical relationship to fail.
