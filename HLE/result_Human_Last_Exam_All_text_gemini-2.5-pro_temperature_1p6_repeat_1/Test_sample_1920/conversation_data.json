    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n- We test for small prime divisors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n- $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n- $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n- $589 \\div 19 = 31$\nSince 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all prime numbers, the prime factorization of $d$ is:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\nThe conductor $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nFor such a character $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive modulo its respective prime $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the character which is 1 for all inputs coprime to $p_i$). The principal character is the unique character of order 1.\n\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, the order of each component character $\\chi_i$, let's call it $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$\n\nThis condition implies that each order $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Combining this with the primitivity condition ($k_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Available Component Characters\nThe order of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. Let's check this for our primes:\n- $p_1 = 7$, $p_1-1 = 6$ (divisible by 6)\n- $p_2 = 13$, $p_2-1 = 12$ (divisible by 6)\n- $p_3 = 19$, $p_3-1 = 18$ (divisible by 6)\n- $p_4 = 31$, $p_4-1 = 30$ (divisible by 6)\n\nSince $p_i-1$ is divisible by 6 for all $i$, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist for each prime modulus.\nThe number of characters modulo a prime $p$ having order $k$ (for $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we count the number of available characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$:\n- Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n- Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n- Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n\nFor each component $\\chi_i$, the total number of choices with order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Counts Using Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to form 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ has order $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nLet's first count all possible combinations of such primitive characters whose orders are divisors of 6. Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 component characters, the total number of combinations is:\nTotal combinations = $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis count includes combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3), which we must exclude.\n\n**Case 1: Exclude combinations where lcm divides 2.**\nThis occurs if and only if all component orders $k_i$ are divisors of 2. Since $k_i > 1$, this means $k_i = 2$ for all $i$.\n- For each component, there is $\\phi(2) = 1$ character of order 2.\n- Number of such combinations = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n**Case 2: Exclude combinations where lcm divides 3.**\nThis occurs if and only if all component orders $k_i$ are divisors of 3. Since $k_i > 1$, this means $k_i = 3$ for all $i$.\n- For each component, there are $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters of order 3.\n- Number of such combinations = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe two cases above are mutually exclusive (the lcm cannot divide both 2 and 3 without also being 1, which is ruled out).\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the order is not 6:\nNumber = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm dividing 2) - (Combinations with lcm dividing 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$."
