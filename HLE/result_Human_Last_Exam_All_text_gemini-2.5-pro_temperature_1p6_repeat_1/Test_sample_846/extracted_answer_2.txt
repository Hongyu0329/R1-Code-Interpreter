At sunrise, the picnic table must bend or change its shape from a straighter, elongated form (the *trans*-isomer) into a bent, V-shape (the *cis*-isomer) due to the UV light from the sun. At sunset, as the light disappears, it must slowly relax and straighten back out into the elongated *trans*-form.
