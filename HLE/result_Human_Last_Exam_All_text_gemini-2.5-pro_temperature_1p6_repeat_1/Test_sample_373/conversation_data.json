    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nThe question specifies a **barbell graph with 10 nodes**. A barbell graph is typically constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, called the bridge or bottleneck.\n\n1.  **Nodes distribution:** With 10 total nodes, the most symmetric and standard configuration is to have two cliques of 5 nodes each. Let's call these cliques $C_L$ (left) and $C_R$ (right).\n2.  **Cliques:** Each clique, $C_L$ and $C_R$, is a complete graph on 5 nodes ($K_5$). In a $K_5$, every node is connected to every other node within that clique.\n3.  **Bottleneck Edge:** The two cliques are connected by a single edge. Let's say this edge connects node $L_1$ from $C_L$ to node $R_1$ from $C_R$. This edge, $(L_1, R_1)$, is the unique bottleneck edge.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Node Properties (Degrees)\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. This is crucial for calculating the probabilities in the gossiping process.\n\n1.  **Bridgehead Nodes:** These are the nodes connected to the bottleneck edge ($L_1$ and $R_1$).\n    *   Node $L_1$ is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique $C_L$.\n    *   Node $L_1$ is also connected to $R_1$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of $L_1$ is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of $R_1$ is $5$.\n    *   There are **2** such nodes with degree 5.\n\n2.  **Internal Clique Nodes:** These are the other nodes in the cliques (4 in $C_L$ and 4 in $C_R$).\n    *   Any such node is connected only to the other 4 nodes within its own clique.\n    *   Therefore, their degree is 4.\n    *   There are **8** such nodes with degree 4.\n\n*   **Verification:** The sum of degrees should be twice the number of edges. Sum of degrees = $(2 \\text{ nodes} \\times 5) + (8 \\text{ nodes} \\times 4) = 10 + 32 = 42$. The number of edges in a $K_5$ is $\\binom{5}{2}=10$. Total edges = $10 (C_L) + 10 (C_R) + 1 (\\text{bottleneck}) = 21$. So, $2 \\times |E| = 2 \\times 21 = 42$. The degree calculations are correct.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Sampling Process\nThe process is **randomized uniform gossiping**. The standard model for this (a \"push\" gossip) works as follows for a single round:\n\n1.  **Select an Initial Node:** A single node `u` is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all $N$ nodes. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of picking any specific node is $P(u) = 1/10$.\n2.  **Select a Neighbor:** The chosen node `u` then selects one of its neighbors, `v`, uniformly at random to send a message to. The probability of `u` picking a specific neighbor `v` is $1 / \\text{deg}(u)$, where $\\text{deg}(u)$ is the degree of node `u`.\n\nThe \"sampling of an edge\" refers to the edge $(u,v)$ used in this single communication step.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\nWe want to find the probability that the edge $(u,v)$ chosen by the process is the bottleneck edge, $e_b = (L_1, R_1)$. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n\n*   **Case A:** Node $L_1$ is chosen to start, and it chooses to gossip with $R_1$.\n*   **Case B:** Node $R_1$ is chosen to start, and it chooses to gossip with $L_1$.\n\nWe calculate the probability of each case and add them together.\n\n1.  **Probability of Case A:**\n    *   The probability of choosing $L_1$ as the starting node is $P(u=L_1) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $L_1$ is chosen, its degree is 5. The probability that it chooses $R_1$ from its 5 neighbors is $P(v=R_1 | u=L_1) = 1/\\text{deg}(L_1) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability for Case A is: $P(A) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n2.  **Probability of Case B:**\n    *   The probability of choosing $R_1$ as the starting node is $P(u=R_1) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $R_1$ is chosen, its degree is 5. The probability that it chooses $L_1$ from its 5 neighbors is $P(v=L_1 | u=R_1) = 1/\\text{deg}(R_1) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability for Case B is: $P(B) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n3.  **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n    *   $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is **1/25**.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
