    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Who:** Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟).\n*   **What:** His first major defeat.\n*   **Where:** The location of this defeat, identified by its current Vietnamese province name.\n\n**Step 2: Provide historical context.**\nThe question refers to the period of the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the future Vietnamese emperor Lê Lợi against the rule of the Chinese Ming Dynasty. Mu Sheng was one of the primary Ming commanders tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n**Step 3: Research Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam to identify his defeats.**\nMu Sheng was involved in multiple campaigns. While he experienced numerous battles, we need to find his *first personal, major defeat*.\n\n*   **Initial Campaigns (pre-1426):** In the early years of the war, Lê Lợi's forces were often on the defensive and suffered many setbacks. Mu Sheng's command was largely successful, or at least not marked by a \"major defeat.\"\n*   **The Turning Point (1426):** In 1426, the strategic situation changed. The Ming Dynasty sent a new commander, Wang Tong (王通), to take over. Mu Sheng was preparing to hand over command and return to his base in Yunnan.\n*   **The Ambush at Ải Lưu Pass (1426):** As Mu Sheng was withdrawing his forces from the region of Nghệ An, Lê Lợi ordered his commanders Lý Triện and Đỗ Bí to pursue him. They successfully ambushed Mu Sheng's army at **Ải Lưu Pass** (隘留關). In this battle, Mu Sheng's forces were soundly beaten, suffering over 1,000 casualties and losing significant amounts of supplies and equipment. Mu Sheng himself barely escaped. This was a significant military and psychological blow and can be clearly identified as his *first major defeat* during this conflict.\n*   **The Final Campaign (1427):** Mu Sheng led another major relief army from Yunnan in 1427 to save the besieged Ming forces. After learning of the utter destruction of the other Ming army under Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng, Mu Sheng's army lost its morale and was subsequently routed by Vietnamese forces. While this was a catastrophic defeat, it was not his *first* one.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the location of the first major defeat.**\nThe Battle of Ải Lưu Pass in 1426 is the event that fits the description. Historical and geographical sources, including the Vietnamese chronicle *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, place the Ải Lưu Pass in the territory of modern-day **Nghệ An Province**, located in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam. It was on the strategic route that connected the central provinces with the Red River Delta.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nBased on the historical record, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Ải Lưu Pass in 1426. This location is situated within the modern-day borders of Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
