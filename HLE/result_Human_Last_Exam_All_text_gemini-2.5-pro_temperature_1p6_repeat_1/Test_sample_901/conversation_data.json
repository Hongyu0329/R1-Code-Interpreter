    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base, a polar protic solvent that favors elimination reactions.\n*   **Conclusion:** The conditions (secondary alkyl halide + strong, bulky base) are ideal for an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stereochemistry of the substrate.**\n*   The IUPAC name is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. Let's determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups.\n*   If we assign C1 as having the bromo group and C2 as having the methyl group, the (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring. They are **cis** to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conformation required for E2 elimination.**\n*   The E2 mechanism requires a specific stereochemical arrangement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** orientation (one pointing straight up, the other straight down on adjacent carbons).\n*   For the leaving group (Br) to be in a position to be eliminated, it must be in an **axial** position.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the chair conformations of cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and identify the reactive conformer.**\n*   A cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformers where the substituents are (axial, equatorial) and (equatorial, axial).\n    *   **Conformer A:** Bromine is **axial** and the methyl group is **equatorial**.\n    *   **Conformer B:** Bromine is **equatorial** and the methyl group is **axial**. (This is the result of a ring-flip of Conformer A).\n*   E2 elimination can only proceed from **Conformer A**, where the bromine leaving group is in the required axial position. Although Conformer B (with the bulky methyl group axial) is less stable and thus Conformer A is more populated, the reaction proceeds through the less stable Conformer A according to the Curtin-Hammett principle. Even if Conformer B is more stable, the reaction must proceed through Conformer A, where the Br is axial. *Correction*: The conformer with the bulky methyl group equatorial (Conformer A) is actually the more stable one. Either way, this is the reactive conformer because Br is axial.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the available anti-periplanar β-hydrogens.**\n*   In Conformer A (Br is axial), we look for β-hydrogens that are also axial.\n    *   **At Carbon-2:** This carbon has the equatorial methyl group, so its other substituent, a hydrogen, must be **axial**. Removing this hydrogen is a possible pathway.\n    *   **At Carbon-6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one equatorial and one **axial**. Removing this axial hydrogen is another possible pathway.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the potential products and predict the major product.**\n*   **Path 1 (Removing H from C2):** Elimination between C1 and C2 forms a double bond, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, which is the more thermodynamically stable product (the **Zaitsev product**).\n*   **Path 2 (Removing H from C6):** Elimination between C1 and C6 forms a double bond, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, which is the less thermodynamically stable product (the **Hofmann product**).\n\n**Step 7: Apply Zaitsev's vs. Hofmann's Rule.**\n*   **Zaitsev's Rule:** Predicts the more substituted alkene will be the major product. This is favored by small, strong bases (like ethoxide or hydroxide).\n*   **Hofmann's Rule:** Predicts the less substituted alkene will be the major product. This is favored when using a **sterically bulky base**, like the potassium tert-butoxide used in this reaction. The large base has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered β-hydrogen (on C2, adjacent to the methyl group). It preferentially attacks the more accessible, less hindered β-hydrogen (on C6).\n*   **Conclusion:** Because potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, the reaction will follow Hofmann's rule, and the major product will be the less substituted alkene.\n\n**Final Answer Identification**\nThe major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product, which is formed by removing a proton from carbon-6. The name of this product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
