    "This question requires a careful reading of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* and a clear definition of what constitutes a \"historical saint.\"\n\n**Step 1: Define \"Historical Saint\"**\nFirst, we must establish the scope of the term \"historical saint.\" In this context, it refers to individuals who lived after the biblical era (i.e., after the time of Jesus and the Apostles) and were later canonized or widely revered as saints by Christian traditions. This definition excludes biblical figures like the Apostles (Peter, John, Paul) or Old Testament prophets (Moses, Elijah), even though they are considered saints in Christianity. The key is the \"historical\" aspect, implying post-biblical figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Locations in *Paradise Lost***\nMilton's epic is primarily focused on the biblical story of the Fall. Mentions of later, post-biblical figures would likely occur in specific contexts, such as:\n1.  **Prophecies or Visions:** The Archangel Michael reveals future history to Adam in Books XI and XII.\n2.  **Satirical Passages:** Milton, a Protestant, often critiqued what he saw as the errors and superstitions of the Roman Catholic Church.\n3.  **Similes and Allusions:** Comparisons to historical events or figures.\n\n**Step 3: Search and Analyze the Text**\nA careful search of the text reveals one key passage where historical saints are mentioned. This occurs in **Book III**, in the description of the \"Limbo of Vanity,\" also called the \"Paradise of Fools.\" This is a satirical section where Milton dispatches all things vain and useless.\n\nHere, Milton describes a category of people who hoped to get into Heaven through superstitious means:\n\n> \"And they who to be sure of Paradise\n> Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n> Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised\"\n> (Book III, lines 478-480)\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Saints by Name**\nFrom this passage, we can identify two distinct historical saints:\n\n1.  **Dominic:** This is a direct reference to **Saint Dominic** (c. 1170–1221), the founder of the Dominican Order (the \"Order of Preachers\"). Milton is satirizing the belief that being buried in the habit of a Dominican friar could ensure salvation.\n2.  **Francis(can):** The word \"Franciscan\" is the adjectival form for the order founded by **Saint Francis of Assisi** (c. 1181–1226). This is a clear and direct reference to St. Francis, mentioning him through the name of his widely known followers. It is an undeniable mention of the saint himself.\n\n**Step 5: Rule Out Other Possibilities**\n*   **Michael's Prophecy (Books XI-XII):** While Michael describes the future of the Church, including its corruption, he only names biblical figures (Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, etc.). He critiques the institutions of the Papacy (referring to it as holding \"Peter's chair\") but does not name any specific post-biblical Popes or saints.\n*   **Other Biblical Saints:** Figures like Peter, Paul, and Mary are mentioned, but they are biblical figures, not \"historical saints\" in the post-biblical sense required by the question.\n*   **Other Historical Figures:** Milton mentions the astronomer Galileo (\"the Tuscan Artist\"), but he is not a saint.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the text shows that Milton explicitly names exactly two historical, post-biblical saints. Both mentions occur in a single satirical passage in Book III.\n\nThe two historical saints mentioned by name are:\n1.  **Saint Dominic**\n2.  **Saint Francis**\n\nTherefore, the total number is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
