    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nThe question provides three key pieces of information to identify the man:\n1.  He was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n2.  Voznesensky wrote a famous line about him: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n3.  The answer to the question of his grave's location was found in the late 1980s.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Voznesensky Connection**\n\n*   **The Quotes:** Both quotes originate from Andrei Voznesensky's highly famous poem which served as the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work premiered in 1981 and became a cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union.\n*   **The Protagonist:** The main character of \"Juno and Avos\" is a Russian nobleman and explorer. This character is the \"sailor\" referred to in the poem.\n*   **Careful Point:** The rock opera is based on a true story. Identifying the historical figure behind the main character is the key to solving the puzzle. The protagonist of the story is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Lost Grave\" Clue**\n\n*   **Historical Context:** The historical Nikolai Rezanov was a Russian diplomat and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. On his return from an expedition to Russian America and Spanish California (the basis for the \"Juno and Avos\" story), he fell ill while crossing Siberia.\n*   **Death and Burial:** He died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807 and was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n*   **Why it was Lost:** In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral and its cemetery were demolished. The exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost in the process, and its headstone disappeared. This historical fact is precisely what Voznesensky's poetic line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", alludes to.\n*   **Careful Point:** The final clue states the grave's location was found in the late 1980s. We need to verify this part of Rezanov's story.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the \"Discovery\" Clue**\n\n*   **The Search:** Starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, local historians and archaeologists in Krasnoyarsk began a dedicated search for Rezanov's lost burial site.\n*   **The Finding:** These efforts led to the discovery of what is believed to be his grave. While absolute proof was elusive due to the destruction, a presumptive site was identified. A monument was later erected on this spot. This rediscovery fits the timeline provided in the question (\"late 1980s\").\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n\nAll three clues point directly to one person:\n1.  **\"Joy-discovering sailor\"**: Voznesensky's poetic term for Count Nikolai Rezanov in \"Juno and Avos\".\n2.  **\"Where is your grave?\"**: A reference to Rezanov's real grave, which was lost after a cemetery's destruction.\n3.  **Grave found in the late 1980s**: Matches the historical timeline of the rediscovery of Rezanov's burial site in Krasnoyarsk.\n\nThe man's full name is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
